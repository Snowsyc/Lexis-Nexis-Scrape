<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant chiropractors challenged a decision from the State of Florida, Department of Professional Regulation, Board of Chiropractic, which found appellants guilty of violating department regulations, imposed a fine, and placed appellants on probation for one year.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant chiropractors were found guilty of violating Fla. Stat. ch. 460.413(1)(d) (e) (w), and certain regulations of appellee, the Department of Chiropractic, and were fined, and placed on one-year probation. Appellants were found guilty of those violations because of a &quot;tasteless ad&quot; they ran and because of their failure to have the initials D.C. after their names properly identifying themselves as chiropractors. Appellants challenged the decision. The court held that appellee had no regulation regarding how a doctor of chiropractic medicine should identify himself. However, it was clear from the ad that ordinary people would not be misled by the advertisement, but would know that the appellants and their clinic practiced chiropractic. Therefore, the court found no basis for the alleged violation in failing to have the words &quot;D.C.&quot; following their names. The court further found that the regulation relating to advertising was overly broad and restricted, unlawfully, free speech, no matter how &quot;tasteless&quot; the ad, and the regulation, therefore, was found to be unconstitutional. The fines and probation were reversed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The reviewing court reversed the order of the appellee department of chiropractic which found that appellants violated certain regulations, fined them and placed them on probation of one year. It held that appellee had no regulation relative to how a doctor of chiropractic medicine identified himself. Further the regulation relating to advertising was overly board and restricted, unlawfully, fee speech, which was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants challenged a decision from the Circuit Court for Orange County (Florida) that dismissed with prejudice their amended complaint against appellees for appellees' alleged negligent actions in not advising appellant wife that her exposure to rubella during her pregnancy posed a potential threat to her unborn child.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants brought a negligence action against appellee physicians and appellee professional organizations. After appellants' initial complaint was dismissed, they filed an amended complaint. Appellants alleged that appellant mother consulted with appellees regarding her exposure to rubella and the potential threat it posed to her unborn child. Appellants also contended that appellees negligently performed a blood test and advised appellant mother not to worry about the disease. Appellant mother gave birth to a severely deformed and retarded infant. Appellant mother submitted her individual claim to a mediation panel as was then required under Fla. Stat. ch. 768.44 (1979). The panel found that appellee physicians were not negligent, and appellees filed a motion to dismiss the complaint. The trial court dismissed all the actions as they pertained to appellee professional associations and as to appellee physicians, except for those claims filed by appellant mother individually. The court reversed the trial court's decision as it pertained to appellee professional associations. The court held that appellee associations were vicariously liable for the actions of their employees.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant podiatrist, whose privileges at a hospital were revoked, contested an adverse summary judgment given by the Circuit Court for Dade County (Florida) in favor of appellee doctors. He alleged that appellees had defamed him in the course of proceedings of the hospital's review committee, and that he was not statutorily barred from seeking damages from them.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant podiatrist had his privileges to perform certain procedures at a hospital revoked. He brought a defamation action against appellee doctors, claiming that they had defamed him in the course of proceedings conducted concerning his case by the appropriate hospital medical review committees. The trial court entered summary judgment for appellees on the ground that no such action may be maintained under Fla. Stat. ch. 768.40(4) (1983). The court affirmed the decision. It held that the language of the statute created an absolute privilege, and meant that any existing defamation action had been totally abolished. Because of the importance and novelty of the precise issues presented, the court certified to the state supreme court the issue of whether the statute totally abolished defamation claims arising in medical review committee proceedings, and if it did, whether the statute was invalid as in conflict with Fla. Const. art. I, &sect; 21.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that appellant podiatrist's defamation action against appellee doctors was properly dismissed by summary judgment because such actions were prohibited when the action arose out of proceedings before medical review committees. The issue was certified by the court to the state supreme court for review as a question of great public importance.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant filed a complaint against appellee on the basis that appellee unlawfully duplicated one of appellant's unpatented boat hulls using a direct molding process in violation of Fla. Stat. ch. 559.94. Appellee filed a motion to dismiss appellant's complaint, which was granted by the trial court on the basis that federal patent laws permitted unrestricted copying of unpatented articles and preempted Fla. Stat. ch. 559.94. Appellant sought review of the adverse order. The court affirmed judgment dismissing with prejudice appellant's complaint against appellee because federal patent laws preempted Florida's power to regulate the copying of unpatented articles. The court went on to hold that Fla. Stat. ch. 559.94 was unconstitutional under the supremacy clause, U.S. Const. art. VI. The court held that a state could not, consistent with U.S. Const. art. VI, prohibit the copying of an unpatented article or award damages for such copying. The court found that unpatented articles were in the public domain and could be copied and sold by whoever chose to do so.</SPAN></P>

Petitioner filed a motion seeking an order authorizing access to and limited use of respondents' property to perform a contamination assessment, pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 376.307. The trial court authorized petitioner's motion to conduct a pollution assessment, but did not allow use of a Water Quality Assurance Trust Fund (trust fund). Petitioner sought review of the order. The court granted a writ of certiorari in favor of petitioner and quashed that portion of the trial court's order which denied petitioner the use of money from the trust fund because the legislature authorized petitioner to use trust funds for making a pollution assessment, pursuant to Fla.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied a request for a writ of prohibition or, alternatively, writ of mandamus and motion for stay of petitioner's jury trial, which asserted that Fla. Stat. ch. 40.015(1985), and Circuit Court for Palm Beach County, Fla. Admin. Order No. 1.006-1/80 were unconstitutional. The statute authorized counties over a certain population to create separate jury districts for each courthouse location, provided that they did not exclude any cognizable group. The administrative order divided the county into two separate jury districts. The court held that a writ of prohibition was not appropriate when petitioner failed to demonstrate that there was a lack of jurisdiction in the lower court. The court also held that a writ of mandamus was not appropriate when petitioner was not seeking to coerce respondent to perform an official, ministerial duty which he was required by law to perform. Treating the petition as a petition for writ of certiorari, the court denied the petition for failure to demonstrate the absence of an adequate remedy by plenary appeal.</SPAN></P>

The state had sought injunctive relief in the trial court to halt appellants' alleged practice of medicine claiming their practice caused irreparable harm to the public. The appellants sought further review. The court reversed the enjoinment order of the trial court and remanded for further proceedings, including a hearing and explicit ruling granting or denying the motion to intervene. The court found that a due process violation had occurred when the hearing on the injunction was stopped and injunctive relief granted without allowing all parties being allowed to present and complete their case.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought a declaratory judgment allowing him to have a nasogastric feeding tube removed from his terminally ill wife. The trial court held that there was no federal or state constitutional right of privacy allowing the requested relief. The trial court noted that Fla. Stat. ch. 765 (Supp. 1984), governing a competent person's right to decline life-prolonging procedures, specifically excluded the provision of sustenance from its definition of life-prolonging procedures. On appeal the court reversed, holding that ch. 765 did not affect the otherwise existing constitutional right of persons in a permanent vegetative state with no reasonable prospect of regaining cognitive brain function to forego the use of artificial life sustaining measures. The court explained that it was unable to distinguish on a legal, scientific, or moral basis between those artificial measures that sustained life, whether by means of forced sustenance or forced continuance of vital functions. Thus, the court concluded, appellant's wife had a right under both the federal constitution and Fla. Const. art. I, &sect; 23 to have the feeding tube removed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In consolidated appeals, plaintiff insurer challenged judgments from the Circuit Court for Sarasota County (Florida) that granted defendants, an architect, contractor, and manufacturer, summary judgment in plaintiff's suit to recover, as subrogee, for damages to the insured premises.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff insurer appealed judgments that granted defendants, an architect, contractor, and manufacturer, summary judgment in plaintiff's suit to recover for damages to a church on grounds that plaintiff did not file suit within the applicable statutes of repose. Fla. Stat. ch. 95.11, .031. Plaintiff alleged that a fire was caused by negligent construction and design of the church and by a defective lighting fixture. In consolidated appeals, the court affirmed the judgments. The court first rejected plaintiff's claim that the statute applicable to defendants architect and contractor was unconstitutional. The court ruled that, unlike a similar statute that had been struck down because the legislature had not expressed any perceived public necessity for abolishing such suits, the legislature, in enacting ch. 95.11, made express findings of fact as to why suits against architects and contractors were to be limited. Regarding plaintiff's product liability claim against defendant manufacturer, the court ruled that ch. 95.031 was a valid limitation on product liability suits such as plaintiff's.</SPAN></P>

The statute of repose applicable to defendant manufacturer was valid even without a legislative expression of compelling need.</SPAN></P>

The method of voting to elect supervisors in the district was a weighted, vote-by-acreage method. Appellant homeowners argued that this method was unconstitutional and requested injunctive relief. The reviewing court found that appellants' petition for relief was properly denied. The Florida Supreme Court had previously upheld the constitutionality of Fla. Stat. ch. 190 (1984) insofar as it provided for similar election of a board of supervisors on a &quot;one-vote-per-acre&quot; basis, rather than a &quot;one man-one vote&quot; basis. All of appellee's functions related directly to its water control and road maintenance authority.

Appellant argued the state's no-fault statute,&nbsp;Fla. Stat. ch. 627.730 et seq., did not exempt appellees from tort liability because they voluntarily obtained personal injury protection coverage. Therefore, according to appellant, she was able to maintain a negligence action against appellees without alleging threshold injuries. The trial court ruled that the tort exemption provided by ch. 627.737(1) was applicable to appellees and dismissed appellant's action. Consequently, appellant sought review. The court affirmed the trial court because the court sitting en banc reached a tie vote. However, the court also certified the question of the applicability of the exemption provided by ch. 627.737(1) to the state supreme court.</SPAN></P>

Human Rights Ordinance, &sect; 16 1/2-67 invalid and unconstitutional. The ordinance created an administrative agency to adjudicate complaints of illegal discrimination. The ordinance authorized the agency to conduct hearings and take appropriate affirmative actions, including awarding compensation for humiliation and embarrassment suffered as a direct result of discriminatory practices. Appellee was ordered to pay damages and attorney's fees for housing discrimination violations. The court rejected appellant county's argument that the payment of damages was not a penalty. The court stated that although awards of restitution have been upheld as constitutional, damages for humiliation and embarrassment were penalties. Therefore, the court held that the portions of the ordinance that provided for the imposition of a penalty by an administrative agency violated Fla.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed an order that dissolved appellant's prejudgment writ of garnishment. Appellant sought equitable contribution from appellee business partner for appellee's share of a joint obligation. Appellant obtained a prejudgment writ of garnishment directed to funds held by appellee business partner's attorney. At the hearing on appellee's motion to dissolve, appellee business partner testified that he did not owe appellant any money under partnership agreement and appellee attorney testified that funds he held were jointly owned by appellee business partner and his wife. The court rejected appellant's argument that the trial court held too extensive a hearing and should have denied motion to dissolve writ when appellant made a prima facie case for garnishment. The court held that under revised version of Fla. Stat. ch. 77.07(1)(1983), such a limited hearing would not withstand constitutional scrutiny. The court explained that the creditor must prove the grounds upon which the writ was issued, and that the trial court had broad latitude in setting limits of the hearing and did not abuse its discretion in allowing testimony of affirmative defenses.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment that dissolved appellant's prejudgment writ of garnishment. The court held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in allowing testimony of affirmative defenses. The court held that when statute required creditor to prove grounds for writ, lack of credibility on the part of the creditor or the appearance of a valid affirmative defense were relevant.</SPAN></P>

Stat. ch. 440.20(10). Appellants, appellee's employer and its insurance carrier, challenged the award. They claimed that lump sum awards were unconstitutional, that the deputy commissioner should not have retroactively applied a statutory amendment that altered the discount rate and permissible amount of the award, and that the deputy commissioner improperly found that a lump sum award was in appellee's best interest. The appellate court affirmed the deputy commissioner's findings as to the constitutionality of the lump sum award and retroactive application of the amendment. In many prior cases, both issues had been resolved adversely to appellants' positions. However, the appellate court reversed the award of the lump sum payment because the deputy commissioner improperly found that it would be in appellee's best interest. Appellee received a monthly state supplemental benefit. However, the lump sum payment of PTD benefits discharged appellee's right to the supplemental benefit. As a result, the appellate court remanded the case for redetermination.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant banks and insurers sued appellees, state and agency, challenging the constitutionality of Fla. Stat. Ch. 626.988, (1983), which banned banks from selling insurance. After the trial court dismissed the suit, appellants sought review. On appeal, the court said that if a complaint's well-pleaded allegations entitled appellants to a declaration of rights, the motion to dismiss was to be denied and appellants would be allowed to adduce evidence in behalf of the pleading. The court reversed dismissal of appellants' suit and remanded because the record was inadequate to determine that there was no possibility that appellants would be able to demonstrate that the hazards of financial institutions' selling insurance did not justify its proscription or, if it did, that the methods by which such proscription was sought did not meet constitutional muster.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was subjected to custodial interrogation without the benefit of Miranda warnings. He subsequently moved to suppress all of his statements. The court granted the motion to suppress, and the state appealed. The court noted that, having found that defendant was subjected to custodial interrogation without the benefit of Miranda warnings, the trial court was required to suppress statements made during that period. The court utilized a presumption of compulsion and a &quot;taint analysis&quot; and found that defendant's initial statements were presumed to be compelled. Consequently, his subsequent statements could be admissible only if they were sufficiently attenuated to remove the taint of initial misconduct. Defendant's warned statements began immediately after the unwarned ones. The interrogation was conducted in the same building, by the same officer. The court affirmed the lower court's decision, because Miranda warnings, by themselves, were not sufficient to remove the taint of improper tactics utilized to secure the initial statement.</SPAN></P>

Appellant purchased from the condominium developer the laundry machines that were already in place. The lease allowed for payments to appellee half the revenues from the operation of the machines, but had not specified the cost to operate them. Appellant increased the costs to operate the machines, which appellee objected to. Appellee sought declaratory judgment against the enforcement of the lease and complained that the lease agreement violated Fla. Stat. ch. 718.3025. The trial court held that the lease was unenforceable pursuant to the statute. The court affirmed and held that the lease fell under the purview of Fla. Stat. ch. 718.3025, and appellant failed to comply with the statute. Appellee had not effected a waiver of any objection to the lease by accepting its benefits because appellee had no knowledge that the lease had not complied with the statute.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of the decision by the Circuit Court for Dade County (Florida) sustaining the ad valorem real property assessment on its property. Appellant contended that the appellee property appraiser's assessment of value, based on comparable sales, was purely speculative as to future value, and therefore was contrary to the provisions of Fla.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant brought action contesting the appellee property appraiser's ad valorem real property assessment on its undeveloped wetlands property. The appellee determined the fair market value of the subject property by performing a standard appraisal using the comparable sales approach to valuation. The court found that Fla. Const. art. VII, &sect; 4(a) required the property to be assessed at fair market value and precluded it from being assessed solely on the basis of character or use. By considering and giving adequate weight to all eight criteria, specified in Fla. Stat. ch. 193.011(2) (1981), the appellee complied with the constitutional and statutory mandates of his office in assessing the subject property. The court affirmed the trial court's affirmation of the ad valorem real property assessment made on appellant's property, finding that there was ample evidence on the record that willing buyers had purchased from willing sellers, comparable land for a price in excess of the assessed value, and that appellant itself has placed the present value on the land at a price in excess of the assessed value.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's affirmation of the ad valorem real property assessment made on appellant's property.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent filed a complaint alleging that Fla. Stat. ch. 490 was unconstitutional. Respondent submitted interrogatories to petitioner requesting the names, addresses, educational background, and professional experience of every person licensed under Fla. Stat. ch. 490. Petitioner submitted information which could be readily compiled from computer databases and made its records available for inspection. Respondent filed a motion to compel. The trial court granted the motion on the ground that the burden of ascertaining this information was greater for respondent. Petitioner sought a writ of certiorari. The court granted the petition and quashed the order. Under Fla. R. Civ. P. 1.340(c), if the answer to an interrogatory could be ascertained from the records of the party to whom the interrogatory was directed and the burden of ascertaining that answer was substantially the same for the party serving the interrogatory, then offering the records for inspection was a sufficient answer.

At the time of the arrest, he was standing in the parking lot of his apartment complex, approximately 25 to 30 feet from the building in which he resided. The court affirmed the circuit court's denial of appellant's motion to dismiss, holding that appellant's conduct did not fall within the Fla.

The court determined that the at home exception in the concealed weapon statute did not apply to the parking lot of a multiple unit apartment dwelling. The court also held that Fla. Stat. ch. 790.25(3)(n) (1984) was not unconstitutionally vague because it sufficiently apprised the ordinary person that this exception did not permit an individual to carry a concealed weapon in the parking lot of a multi-unit apartment building.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner inmate sought a writ of certiorari to the Circuit Court for Lee County (Florida), directing the court to allow him to proceed with an action that alleged respondent county sheriff was liable for injuries he sustained in an assault by another prisoner while he was a pretrial detainee. The action was abated on the grounds that petitioner was subsequently divested of his civil rights by virtue of Fla. Stat. ch. 944.292 (1983).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner inmate sought a writ of certiorari to review an order of a trial court abating appellant's civil suit against respondent county sheriff in which petitioner alleged that his assault by another prisoner could have been prevented if jail officials had exercised due care. Petitioner was a pretrial detainee at the time of the assault. Shortly before trial was to commence, respondent successfully moved to abate the action because petitioner, in the interim, had been convicted of a felony and sentenced to state prison. Thus, respondent successfully argued petitioner had been divested of his civil rights by virtue of Fla. Stat. ch. 944.292 (1983). Holding that even prisoners enjoyed a constitutional right of &quot;access to the courts,&quot; the appellate court disagreed, granted the writ of certiorari, and directed the lower court to allow petitioner to proceed with his lawsuit because the state statute respondent relied upon was unconstitutional in that it violated both the state and federal constitutions. The court held that to delay the action until petitioner was released from prison could conceivably deny him from securing evidence necessary to prove his claim.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Holding that &quot;civil death&quot; statutes were an archaic remnant of an era that viewed inmates as being stripped of their constitutional rights at the prison gate, the court granted the writ of certiorari and directed the lower court to permit petitioner to proceed with his lawsuit because the law abhorred the denial of access to the courts for any other reason than a wilful abuse of the processes of the court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant victim sought review of a ruling from the Circuit Court for Alachua County (Florida), which dismissed appellant's complaint against appellee dealer, asserting personal jurisdiction over appellee under Fla. Stat. ch. 48.193(1)(f)2 in an action arising as the result of a criminal incident in which appellant was allegedly kidnapped, threatened, robbed, assaulted, and injured.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant victim was apparently locked in her car at the time of a criminal incident, but the attacker had gained access to it by means of a key which was provided to him by defendant first dealer after he had obtained the key number for the car from appellee dealer. Appellant sued both defendant and appellee asserting personal jurisdiction over appellee under Fla. Stat. ch. 48.193(1)(f)2. Appellee moved to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction and insufficient service of process, which was granted. Appellant amended her complaint, which the trial court dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. Appellant sought review. The court found that appellant could not allege jurisdiction under ch. 48.193(1)(f)2 as it was intended to provide jurisdiction over one who placed into the stream of commerce defective products which caused injury within the state. Appellant's cause of injury was not for an injury caused by a defective product, but for injuries which proximately resulted from appellee's negligence. In addition, the court found no merit in appellant's assertion that the trial court possessed in rem jurisdiction over the contractual obligation of appellee's insurer.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's determination that appellant's theory of in rem jurisdiction had no legal basis in the state and that appellant had not sufficiently alleged jurisdiction under statutory law because appellant's automobile was merely the situs of the incident and was not the sort of situation contemplated by the long-arm statute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was arrested for violation of the Florida loitering and prowling statute,&nbsp;Fla. Stat. ch. 856.021 (1983), and he was found guilty of burglary and petit theft of a tape recorder found in his possession at the time of his arrest. The court reversed this conviction, holding that his arrest for prowling was made without probable cause, and that evidence of the tape recorder should have been suppressed. Since prowling was a misdemeanor, only the arresting officer's own observations could be considered in determining whether probable cause existed, and the officer only saw appellant staggering down the street carrying a tape recorder. The court found that appellant's intoxication, without more, could not justify an arrest for prowling, nor could his failure to explain his presence in the area be considered. The court determined that appellant's possession of the recorder did not indicate that future criminal activity was imminent as was required for a prowling arrest. The court held that the loitering and prowling statute was unconstitutionally applied as a mere catchall provision to detain appellant until sufficient evidence could be obtained to charge him with burglary.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A ratified collective bargaining agreement existed between appellant county aviation authority and various employee associations.

The court reversed the decision that appellant county aviation authority had committed unfair labor practices by refusing to implement the agreement, holding that appellant county aviation authority, by taking steps to request that appellant civil service board amend its rules so as to eliminate the conflict, followed the law and thereby did not commit unfair labor practices. In accordance with Fla. Stat. ch. 447.309(3) (1983), the collective bargaining agreement provisions were not effective when in conflict with civil service rules unless those rules were amended to eliminate the conflict.

On appeal, the court said that provisions limiting subdivision allowed reasonable leeway for units being used as residences for hotel management. The court affirmed because when read with the county code, of which the ordinance was an integral part, the ordinance was not void for failure to prescribe standards or for vagueness. The court added that the only other zoning district where hotels and motels were permitted as a matter of right were zoned industrial, and because hotels in industrial zones were not located in resort areas and served primarily business travelers, there was no subdivision or need for a similar ordinance.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the circuit court's order and declared Fla. Stat. ch. 39.41(1)(f)(1)(d) (1983) unconstitutional. Appellant mother argued that the statute was unconstitutional, and on review the court held that the statute was fundamentally defective and unjust insofar as it permitted the severance of appellant's rights solely because of appellant's failure to substantially comply with a performance agreement drafted by a worker from appellee department of health and rehabilitative services. The court found that the statute set forth no standards or guidelines for performance agreements, and left the substance of such agreements entirely to the whims and caprices of the individual social worker. The court noted that only by clear and convincing evidence of neglect, abuse, or abandonment by the natural parent could the parental relationship have been validly severed by the statute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of violating Fla. Stat. ch. 796.05 (1983) based on her operation of several escort services providing prostitutes for clients. Defendant then appealed, arguing that reversal was required because the relevant statute, which criminalized living off the earnings of a prostitute, was unconstitutionally void for vagueness. The court held that the statute was not void for vagueness because persons of common intelligence would know that prostitution, and the use of funds knowingly derived from prostitution, were illegal acts. Thus, the court found that defendant had not sufficiently rebutted the presumption that the statute was constitutional, and affirmed defendant's conviction in all respects.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The cable company entered upon the association's land dedicated for public utilities to install underground cable television equipment. The association brought a trespass action against appellees. The court reversed the summary judgment that was for appellees. The court was not concerned with the association's contention that Dade County, Fla., Code &sect; SA-127, pursuant to which the cable company was licensed to use easements, was unconstitutional. The court held that the cable company was not entitled to use easements dedicated for the use of public utilities because it was not a public utility. The legislature did not subject cable television to the jurisdiction of the public service commission. Cable television was not given the right of eminent domain in the statutes that granted public utilities the right of eminent domain. Cable television was also not considered a public utility as that term had been defined by the courts. While cable television should be available to the public generally and was impressed with a public interest, the value and necessity of cable television was not so self-evident that the court would declare it to be the equivalent of electricity and water.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following a jury trial, the Circuit Court for Osceola County (Florida) entered a judgment convicting and sentencing appellant to 12 years' imprisonment for manslaughter by driving while intoxicated. The trial court denied appellant's motion to dismiss because causation was not required to sustain the conviction. Appellant sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">While he had a blood alcohol level of .21, appellant collided with another vehicle. A passenger in the other vehicle later died from injuries sustained in the accident. Appellant was charged with manslaughter by driving while intoxicated (DWI). An eyewitness testified that the other vehicle made a left-hand turn directly into appellant's vehicle. Likewise, an accident reconstruction expert stated his opinion that appellant did not have time to avoid the accident. Nevertheless, the jury found appellant guilty. Appellant sought review. The court affirmed, holding that the trial court's denial of appellant's motion to dismiss and giving of the somewhat conflicting standard jury instruction was not error because the state supreme court had held that DWI manslaughter was a strict liability crime. However, because the standard jury instruction used causation language, the court certified the question for further appellate review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed appellant's conviction and sentence for manslaughter by driving while intoxicated (DWI), holding that the trial court properly denied appellant's motion to dismiss because DWI manslaughter did not require proof of negligence or causation. The trial court also properly gave the standard DWI manslaughter jury instruction that included causation language. Because of an apparent conflict, the court certified the question.</SPAN></P>

Under Fla. Stat. ch. 631.291(4)(b), the receiver had the right to cancel the contract, and the receiver was required to receive court approval to enter any contract.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, condominium owners and managers, challenged the dismissal of their complaint against appellees, the county appraiser, tax collector, and Executive Director of the Florida Department of Revenue, by the Pinellas County Circuit Court (Florida) in an action for a declaratory judgment which would prevent enforcement an assessment for ad valorem taxes made pursuant to Fla.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellees, the county appraiser, tax collector, and Executive Director of the Florida Department of Revenue, assessed a condominium of appellants for ad valorem taxes pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 192.037 (1983). Appellants brought a complaint seeking a declaration that the assessment was unauthorized, unconstitutional, and to enjoin its enforcement. Appellees responded with a motion to dismiss the complaint for a lack of subject matter jurisdiction under Fla. Stat. ch. 194.171(2), (6). The circuit court dismissed the matter on that basis. The court affirmed the dismissal. The court ruled that ch. 194.171(2) was a statute of non-claim, establishing the circuit court's jurisdiction over appellants' complaint under ch. 194.171(6). Appellants' challenge to the assessment failed to meet the 60-day deadline, resulting in a lack of circuit court jurisdiction. The court refused to decide the constitutional issue because appellant did not raise it at the circuit court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order dismissing the complaint for declaratory relief was affirmed because the circuit court lacked jurisdiction to hear appellants' challenge that was not filed within 60 days after the assessment was certified for collection.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant lender challenged the partial summary judgment of the Circuit Court for Volusia County (Florida), which granted injunctive relief to appellee borrower. The issue was whether, under a particular real estate mortgage clause, appellant had the right to accelerate the amount due.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee borrower sold real estate which was subject to a mortgage held by appellant lender. A mortgage clause provided that, if the property subject to the mortgage was sold &quot;without the written consent of&quot; appellant &quot;and without the assumption&quot; of the mortgage &quot;by whatever agreement for additional advances there may be,&quot; the amount due could be accelerated. Appellant sent a notice of breach to appellee, who then filed this action seeking a declaratory judgment, an injunction, and damages. The circuit court enjoined appellant from accelerating the amount due. On appeal, the court considered two different, but very similar, mortgage clauses which had been ruled upon in prior decisions. The court held that the mortgage at issue contained two conditions, both of which had to be met before acceleration was permitted. The court held that a federal statute, Garn-St. Germain Act &sect; 1701j-3 (b)(2), and a federal regulation, 12 C.F.R. &sect; 545.8-3(f) (1982), both recognized that a federal savings and loan could not accelerate a mortgage unless the agreement gave the lender that right. The court affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed, holding that, under the particular clause, two conditions must have been breached by appellee borrower before appellant lender could accelerate the amount due. The court further held that this interpretation did not conflict either with a federal law or a federal regulation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state challenged a trial court decision that dismissed an indictment filed against defendant sheriff after a determination that Fla. Stat. ch. 839.25(1)(b) was unconstitutional. Defendant asserted that the statute failed to define public servant, official record, and official document, thereby failing to apprise him of proscribed conduct and denying him his due process rights under the United States and Florida Constitutions. Defendant was charged with official misconduct under the statute. The court held that Fla. Stat. ch. 839.25(1)(b), was not vague, because the term public servant was defined in Fla. Stat. ch. 838, which is related to Fla. Stat. ch. 839. In addition, the court held that the common duties of sheriff lead to the conclusion that the office holder is a public servant. The court held that Fla. Stat. ch. 839.25(1)(b), was not vague as to the other terms, since it specifically defined the prohibited conduct. The court found that defendant's overbreadth argument was without merit, because Fla. Stat. ch. 839.25(1)(b), did not impinge on the exercise of his due process rights or other U.S. Const. amend. I, liberties. The court reversed and remanded.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed and remanded, holding that the only remaining section of the official misconduct statute was not unconstitutional. The court found that the statute was not vague because terms were defined in other statutes or prohibited conduct was specifically defined.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant pharmacist sought review of a final order of appellee board of pharmacy (Florida), which revoked appellant's license to practice pharmacy, contrary to the recommendation of the hearing officer that the charges against appellant be dismissed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant pharmacist filled prescriptions for methaqualone. At the time, it was legal to dispense the drug, and appellant complied with the requirements for dispensing the drug in Fla. Stat. 893.04 (1981), although he recognized that some of the individuals whose prescriptions he filled might have purchased the drug for improper purposes. Appellee board of pharmacy charged appellant with lack of good faith and a departure from the course of professional practice in violation of Fla. Stat. chs. 465.016(1)(i) and 893.04(1) (1981). The hearing officer recommended dismissal of the charge because no statute specifically precluded appellant's conduct. On review, appellee concluded that compliance with Fla. Stat. ch. 893.04 (1981) did not insulate appellant from discipline, found that appellant lacked good faith, and did not act in the course of professional practice, and revoked his license. On appeal, the court vacated appellee's order and remanded, holding that appellee had authority to discipline appellant if evidence proved his bad faith and departure from professional practice, but only after a hearing officer first determined the disputed facts and recommended a disposition.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee board's order of revocation of appellant pharmacist's license was vacated, and the case was remanded for a further administrative hearing to be conducted in accordance with the court's opinion because appellee board improperly relied upon its own expertise to reverse a hearing officer's finding that appellant had not committed any violation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, an inmate at a state prison, petitioned for a writ of mandamus, seeking an order compelling the department of corrections to remove a correctional officer from having direct contact with inmates due to his sadistic and racist attitude. After the circuit court determined that appellant failed to state grounds upon which relief could be granted, it dismissed appellant's petition. Appellant sought further review. While affirming the dismissal of the petition, the appellate court concluded that the petition was unjustifiably dismissed because of its vague and conclusory allegations; as such, the appellate court directed that leave be granted to allow appellant to amend his petition. Although the writ of mandamus could not be used to compel a public agency to exercise its discretion in a certain manner, Fla. Stat. ch. 944.34 clearly required a prison superintendent not to permit certain types of punishment, and Fla. Stat. ch. 20.315 imposed a clear legal duty upon the state department of corrections to provide inmates with an environment free from victimization.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order of dismissal was affirmed, as appellant's petition for a writ of mandamus failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, while incarcerated, attempted to sue appellee, his former criminal defense counsel, for legal malpractice. Appellee successfully interposed Fla. Stat. ch. 944.292 (1983) as a defense, and obtained a dismissal of the action. The court reversed the order and remanded for further proceedings. The court held that ch. 944.292, when construed as a bar to a felon's maintenance of a civil suit, impermissibly infringed the right of access to courts provision of Fla. Const. art. I, &sect; 21. The court noted that the predecessor to ch. 944.292 only suspended a felon's right to vote, hold public office, and serve on a jury. The court held that while the language containing these limiting conditions was omitted from subsequent versions of the statute, the legislative intent that no substantive change was meant by the omission was evident from legislative debate on the matter. The court also explained that because the right of access was express, and not implied, it was beyond the power of the legislature to abolish without provision for a reasonable alternative for redress for injuries, absent an overpowering and inescapable public necessity.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the order that dismissed appellant's civil action and remanded for further proceedings.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of the judgment of the Circuit Court for Dade County (Florida), which summarily dismissed his Fla.

In his motion, appellant had alleged that the trial court erred in retaining jurisdiction over the first third of his sentence and in imposing sentences for both second degree felony murder and the underlying felony of sexual battery.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant received consecutive terms of imprisonment for his crimes of second degree murder, sexual battery, and false imprisonment. Appellant subsequently filed a motion for post-conviction relief pursuant to Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.850 which alleged that the trial court erred in retaining jurisdiction over the first third of his sentence and in imposing sentences for both second degree felony murder and the underlying felony of sexual battery. The trial court summarily dismissed appellant's motion. On appeal, the court found that the trial court's retention of jurisdiction constituted an unconstitutional ex post facto application of Fla. Stat. ch. 947.16 (Supp. 1978), which authorized trial courts to retain jurisdiction over the first third of a sentence, because appellant was sentenced prior to the effective date of that statute. Based upon prior case law, the court held that the trial court's imposition of separate sentences for sexual battery and for second degree murder was correct. Therefore, the trial court's judgment was remanded for entry of a corrected order on the jurisdiction issue.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of a judgment from the Circuit Court for Orange County (Florida) that convicted her of manslaughter, Fla. Stat. ch. 316.1931(2) (1983) and of leaving the scene of an accident Fla. Stat. ch. 316.027 (1983). Appellant argued that the jury instructions erroneously equated being under the influence of alcohol with being intoxicated, and that certain admissions she made were improperly admitted in evidence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found merit in each of appellant's assignments of error and reversed her convictions and remanded for a new trial. The court noted that Fla. Stat. ch. 316.1931(2) (1983) required proof of intoxication beyond a reasonable doubt before a defendant could be convicted of manslaughter under that section. The court also noted that the instruction given stated that a blood alcohol percent of .10 or greater was prima facie evidence of intoxication. The court explained that this percent was prima facie evidence of being under the influence, that the instruction given was taken from a standard jury instruction in misdemeanor DUI cases, and that being under the influence was not the same as being intoxicated. The instruction therefore was reversible error as to the manslaughter conviction. The court also held that statements made by appellant at a driving class she was required to attend were inadmissible at her trial. The court noted that her instructor was a prosecutor, and that she was virtually compelled to confess to her wrongdoing, and that to admit these statements at trial was unfair and unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed appellant's convictions and remanded for a new trial. The court held that the trial court erred by equating being under the influence of alcohol with being intoxicated, and by stating that a blood alcohol level of .10 was prima facie evidence of intoxication.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the trial court severed appellant mother's parental ties and committed her six children to appellee health department for adoption pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 39.41(1)(f) (1983), appellant challenged the trial court's order. In affirming, the court found that the trial court, after interviewing the children and hearing witness testimony, acted within its discretion in concluding that parental termination and adoption placement was in the children's best interests. Moreover, the court found that appellant failed to substantially comply with the performance agreement, as required by Fla. Stat. ch. 409.168 (1983), in that she missed parenting classes and psychological evaluations. The court rejected appellant's allegation that her failure to comply with the performance agreement was due to conditions beyond her control, specifically, that she missed appointments due to transportation troubles. The court stated that appellant should have made it her responsibility to solve these problems if she wanted her children returned. The court refused to consider appellant's argument that ch. 39.41(1)(f) was unconstitutional because appellant failed to raise that argument below.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of unlawful placement for adoption after he placed an infant with a couple and directed them to proceed with adoption in Mexico. Appellant contended that the statute prohibiting his conduct, Fla. Stat. ch. 63.212(1)(a), was unconstitutional as applied. The court noted that for the statute to be applicable to appellant, the state needed to show only that appellant transferred custody of the child to another for the purpose of effectuating an adoption outside the state. It was undisputed that these events occurred. Thus, the statute was applicable to appellant. In addition, appellant contended that the statute was unconstitutionally vague. The court held that the plain meaning of the statute was specific enough to put appellant, who was presumed to have common intelligence and understanding, on notice of the proscribed conduct. Therefore, the conviction was affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the conviction, finding the statute was constitutional because it was sufficiently specific to notify appellant that transferring a child to another for the purpose of an out-of-state adoption was prohibited conduct.</SPAN></P>

Appellee's undercover agents purchased illegal drugs from two lounge employees. Appellant was charged with maintaining a public nuisance on his licensed premises. A hearing officer recommended dismissal of the charges based upon the fact that the evidence failed to establish that appellant was involved in or knowingly condoned the drug activity. The hearing officer also found that the evidence failed to establish any negligence or lack of due diligence in supervision. Appellee rejected the hearing officer's finding and substituted its own. Appellee then revoked appellant's license. On appeal, the court held that the hearing officer's relevant and material findings of fact were supported by competent, substantial evidence in the record. Therefore, the court further held that appellee erred in revoking appellant's license. Additionally, the court found that appellant had taken reasonable measures to prevent illegal activity on the premises. This supported the hearing officer's finding that there was no negligence.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant mother and appellant agency sought review of an order from the Circuit Court for Duval County (Florida), which dismissed appellants' paternity action against appellee putative father on the grounds that Fla.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At the time appellant mother gave birth to her child, Fla. Stat. ch. 742.011 (1969) provided that only unmarried women could bring paternity actions. The statute was amended in 1983 to reflect a judicial decision that extended the statutory right to married women. The trial court dismissed appellant mother and appellant agency's paternity suit against appellee putative father on the grounds that the amended statute did not apply to appellee because it was not in effect when appellant mother's child was born and because appellant mother, who was married, could not bring suit under the original statute. Appellants sought review. The court held that although the amended statute did not apply retroactively, appellant mother had standing to sue for paternity based on a judicial decision that extended the statutory right to paternity suits to all women. The judicial decision was rendered before the statute was amended and was not limited to prospective application. Based on the judicial decision, appellant mother had standing to sue appellee to establish paternity. The court therefore reversed the dismissal of appellants' paternity complaint and remanded the case for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged an order from the Circuit Court for Orange County (Florida) that dismissed her civil rights action against appellee sheriff after she declined to plead further.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was on her way home from work when she was stopped for a traffic violation. She was arrested for not having a valid driver's license in her possession, and was taken to the county jail. Once at the jail, she was placed in a cell and was subjected to a strip search and a body cavity search. Thereafter, appellant filed a civil rights action against appellee sheriff under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983. The trial court dismissed her complaint after she declined to plead further. Appellant sought review, arguing that the complaint stated a cause of action in its claim for damages that arose from the strip search. The appeals court reversed and remanded the order of dismissal. The court ruled that a strip search and body cavity search of persons arrested for minor traffic offenses was prima facie unreasonable and an unwarranted intrusion of personal privacy, at least without some showing of justification by the arresting authority. Hence, the allegations in the complaint were sufficient to require an answer from appellee. Moreover, the defense of sovereign immunity under state law was not available to appellee in a federally created cause of action.</SPAN></P>

Adult businesses were permitted by appellee city in other areas of the city where businesses obtained a conditional use permit. The trial court granted a temporary injunction that prohibited appellant from further operation of its adult business at its present location. The court affirmed the trial court because there was no evidence that indicated the number of locations where adult businesses operated in the city had been significantly restricted. The court rejected appellant's claim that it would be denied a conditional use permit if it applied for one in another area of the city where such permits allowed the operation of an adult business. The court found this argument irrelevant. Appellant had not applied for a permit to operate its business in an area zoned for adult entertainment. Also, even if the conditional use provision of appellee's zoning ordinances were unconstitutional, appellant lacked standing to challenge the conditional use permits because its rights were not affected by the permit requirements.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant health insurer petitioned for review of a final order of the Circuit Court for Walton County (Florida) denying appellant's motion to intervene in its insured's personal injury action against appellee. The personal injury suit claimed that appellee's negligent operation of his automobile caused the insured's bodily injuries.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a personal injury action, appellant health insurer's insured alleged that he was seriously injured because of appellee's negligent operation of his automobile. Appellant paid medical and hospital expenses arising from the accident and moved to intervene in the personal injury action pursuant to a subrogation clause in its insurance contract, purportedly allowing appellant the right to recover any medical benefit proceeds that its insured might recover from appellee. Although appellant was aware that the collateral source statutes in Fla. Stat. ch. 627.7372 and 627.736(3) appeared to preclude appellant from asserting its subrogation rights, appellant argued that these statutory provisions violated Fla. Const. art. I, &sect; 21, or, alternatively, that they were preempted by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA), 29 U.S.C.S. &sect;&sect; 1001-1381. The affirmed the denial of the petition for leave to intervene, finding Fla. Stat. ch. 627.736(3) and 627.7372 constitutional and holding that the statutes were not preempted by ERISA. The collateral source statutes indirectly regulated the terms of insurance, but did not apply directly to any purported benefit welfare plan.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the denial of appellant health insurer's motion to intervene, holding that appellant was not deprived of a constitutional right of access to courts because, as a subrogee, it derived its rights from the injured party, who did not have the right to recover proceeds from collateral sources. The court held that the statutes were not federally preempted because they did not apply directly to a purported benefit welfare plan.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, former landowners and current easement holders, sought review of an order from the Circuit Court for Osceola County (Florida) that granted summary judgment in favor of appellees, water management districts and their members. The trial court found that appellants had no cause of action to rescind or cancel deeds for lands granted to appellees or to seek a declaration of their rights concerning easements granted to appellees.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, former landowners and current easement holders, claimed that appellees, water management districts and their members, had fraudulently induced them to convey certain lands and easements for a flood control project that was not fully carried out or successful in its purpose. The court affirmed summary judgment in appellants' action for rescission based on fraud because appellants had not alleged that appellees knew their representations were false at the time they were made and because the condemning authority's inability to use the property for the intended purpose was insufficient for rescission. The court found that appellants' suit to construe the easements was not barred by Fla. Stat. ch. 95.12 (1983), which limited actions for recovery to seven years after possession because appellants still owned the lands burden by the easements. The court reversed in part, and concluded that appellants' suit to construe the easements would not have been barred by sovereign immunity even though it was not listed in the express waiver of Fla. Stat. ch. 768.28(1) because appellants nevertheless had a right to seek judicial determination of whether the easements had been abandoned.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the summary judgment for appellees, water management districts and their members, as to the fraud claim by appellants, former landowners and current easement holders. The court found that the pleadings were insufficient to support rescission of the deeds, but reversed as to appellants' declaratory action to construe the easements because such action was not barred by the statute of limitations or sovereign immunity.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant state agency challenged an order of the Career Service Commission (Florida), which reduced an employee's dismissal to a 60-day suspension and reinstated him as an agency employee.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant state agency contended that Fla. Stat. ch. 110.309(4), giving appellee Career Service Commission (commission) the power to reduce an employee's dismissal for misconduct to a suspension, was an unconstitutional and unlawful delegation of legislative discretion since there were no adequate standards to check the commission's power. The court noted that Fla. Const. art. II, &sect; 3 prohibited the delegation of legislative power absent minimal standards. The court determined that there were exceptions where a comprehensive rule was impracticable, and in those cases, the courts inferred a reasonableness standard. The court found that agency disciplinary actions were an area in which direct legislative supervision and detailed legislation was impractical. Therefore, appellee commission had been given broad discretion to make a reasoned disposition of a case. The court affirmed and concluded that the commission's order was reasonable considering the employee's misconduct weighed against his 17 years of exemplary service. The court also determined that the commission's order was valid because Fla. Stat. ch. 110.309(4) was not an unconstitutional delegation of legislative authority.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of a judgment and order from the Circuit Court for Pinellas County (Florida), which convicted him for DWI/manslaughter, and denied his motion to suppress results from a blood-alcohol test.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was involved in a automobile accident in which a passenger in the other car was killed. At trial, appellant moved to suppress blood samples and test results on grounds of lack of probable cause to believe he was intoxicated to require the test, illegal search and seizure, and unconstitutionality of the statute permitting the sample to be taken without being incident to an arrest. The trial court denied the motion, and appellant was convicted of DWI/manslaughter. On appeal, the court affirmed appellant's conviction and the trial court's denial of the motion to suppress, because there was ample evidence to support the officer's suspicion that appellant could be intoxicated at the time of the accident and caused a death. The court further held that the officer's threat to hit appellant over the head to get the sample if necessary was not unreasonable force, particularly given that appellant continued to refuse, despite the words, and being suspected of causing a death while intoxicated, appellant had no legal right to refuse the test. The court also determined that appellant was not entitled to have his counsel present during the testing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant insurer filed a complaint to recover medical expenses it paid covering its insured for injuries she suffered after appellee truck owner's vehicle collided with the insured's vehicle. The trial court dismissed appellant's complaint with prejudice, finding that because the insured was barred from recovery under the provisions of the Motor Vehicle No-Fault Law, Fla. Stat. ch. 627 et seq. (1983), appellant was similarly barred from any subrogation or indemnification rights by reason thereof. Thus, a cause of action for indemnity did not exist. The court agreed with the trial court's conclusion that dismissal of the action was warranted but for different reasons. The court found that appellant possessed no claim for indemnity against appellee because the common law of the state did not and had not in the past permitted such a cause of action. Appellant failed to allege, and could not possibly establish, that its obligation to its insured was based upon some vicarious, derivative, constructive, or technical liability stemming from a special relationship with appellee.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant department of transportation challenged a final order that it did not have jurisdiction to impose its regulations concerning advertising structures within city limits and that it had selectively enforced its rules against appellee company. On appeal, the court found that Fla. Admin. Code Ann. r. 14-10.01, Fla. Admin. Code. Ann. r. 14- 10.02, and Fla. Stat. ch. 479 et seq. (1979) allowed appellant to control advertising structures along all the interstate and federal aid primary highway systems and state road systems outside of cities and towns. Additional case law also stood for the idea that appellant had jurisdiction within incorporated cities along all interstate and federal aid primary highway systems, although a city may enact more stringent regulations. However, the court held that whether there was selective enforcement was a question of fact to have been determined by the trier of fact, and there was competent substantial evidence in the record to have supported the ruling of the trial court. Once a state accorded its citizens a right, it must have accorded it to all, without invidious discrimination.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee, state public service commission, promulgated rules related to contributions in aid of construction (CIAC). Appellant associations sought judicial review of the order of the Division of Administrative Hearings, which upheld the validity of the rules. The court held that appellee presented evidence, including expert testimony by qualified witnesses, that supported the findings of fact and conclusions of law of the hearing officer. Such testimony showed the rational relationship of the rule to accomplishment of its various beneficial objectives, including preserving reasonable rates for utility services, preventing cash-flow crises resulting from insufficient income to cover expenses, creating incentive for the owners to efficiently and effectively manage the company, and properly allocating the risk of potential nondevelopment of new service areas.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant mother and appellee father divorced and appellant, a Florida resident, was awarded custody of the couple's child. Appellee petitioned for and received custody of the child on the grounds that appellant, who was white, was living with a black man. The case was appealed to the United States Supreme Court, which reversed. Appellant filed a writ of habeas corpus in Texas, and in Florida filed a motion to compel return of the child. The Florida court entered an order declining jurisdiction in favor of the Texas court, and appellant sought review. The court affirmed, holding that because the child had resided in Texas for the previous two and one-half years, substantial relevant evidence was available there as to her care, personal relationships, and other relevant factors, and that according to the best interests of the child standard the trial court did not err in concluding that Texas was the most appropriate forum in which to resolve the dispute. The court further concluded that the Supreme Court's decision, though finding the modification of the custody award invalid, did not direct a reinstatement of the original custody award and the return of the child to appellant.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, Board of Trustees of Florida Internal Improvement Trust Fund, sought review of grant motion for summary judgment in an action by appellees, landowners, to quiet title. Among the lands that their deeds encompassed were lands formerly submerged but filled by appellees, who developed a mobile home park. Appellants claimed the filled lands were sovereignty lands, exempt from operation of Marketable Record Title Act (MRTA), Fla. Stat. ch. 712. Appellees argued the MRTA extinguished the sovereign's title to the filled lands. Appellants argued they could not convey sovereignty lands by swamp and overflowed lands deed; therefore, the sovereignty lands were never alienated. Consequently, appellants claimed Fla. Const. art. X, &sect; 11 precluded application of MRTA to appellees' land. The court rejected this argument, concluding appellants did not challenge the conveyances themselves nor contest that they expressly conveyed all the property into private ownership. The court held the lands had been alienated. Further, the court refused to apply Fla. Stat. ch. 712.03(7)(Supp. 1978) retroactively, concluding that would unconstitutionally deprive appellees of rights vested in them.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court affirmed the trial court's order granting summary judgment in favor of appellees, landowners.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his conviction from the Circuit Court for Dade County (Florida) for witness tampering in violation of Fla. Stat. ch. 918.14(1), (2) (1983). The state appealed an order sentencing defendant to non-reporting probation only.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, an investigator for a criminal defendant, warned two potential state witnesses that they might get hurt if they testified against his client, and advised them not to testify. The court affirmed defendant's conviction for witness tampering. The court held that whether a particular communication constituted a true threat which had the probable consequence of causing reasonable apprehension in the hearer was a question of fact for the jury; thus, defendant had not been entitled to a judgment of acquittal. The court further held that Fla. Stat. ch. 918.14 (1983) did not impinge defendant's right of free speech. The court found no error in the refusal of a flawed jury instruction on the definition of a threat, and found that the instruction given was not contradictory or confusing. The court agreed with the state that upon conviction of a felony, Fla. Stat. ch. 948.01(3) mandated a reporting probation. The court, therefore, reversed the sentence and remanded for the imposition of reporting probation. The court held that the state was entitled to review of this sentencing error pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 924.07(5) (1983) and Fla. R. App. P. 9.140(c)(1)(I).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged the order of the Circuit Court for Leon County (Florida) holding that Fla. Stat. ch. 231.533 and 231.534 (Supp. 1984) and Fla. Admin. Code Ann. r. 6A-4.46 did not contravene Fla. Const. art. I, &sect; 6.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, a labor organization, sought a judicial declaration that Fla. Stat. ch. 231.533 and 231.534 and Fla. Admin. Code Ann. r. 6 A-4.46 did not violate Fla. Const. art. I, &sect; 6. The challenged statutory sections and the implementing rule concerned a specific program that would have conferred a grant on selected superior teachers who voluntarily satisfied certain statutory criteria. The amount was payable directly from the state comptroller to the teacher twice each year. Plaintiff asserted that such a program, bypassing as it did the collective bargaining process guaranteed public employees, amounted to an abridgment of the right of those employees to bargain collectively. The trial court held that the challenged provisions were constitutional. The court affirmed and held that the state legislature had the constitutionally mandated authority to unilaterally establish uniform statewide standards of quality for the public school system. The court held that the program at issue did not abridge the right of public employees to bargain collectively because the grant came from a non-employer and the money could not have been considered as wages for purposes of collective bargaining.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the constitutionality of the statutory provisions allowing public teachers to receive grant money because the money came from a non-employer, it could not have been considered as wages for the purpose of collective bargaining, and therefore, did not violate the right of public employees to bargain collectively.</SPAN></P>

Appellant husband and appellant wife filed a complaint against appellees, the manufacturer of the truck, the seller of the truck and the manufacturer of the cement chute mechanism, on a products liability theory. The trial court granted appellees' motion for summary judgment on the ground that the action was barred by the statute of repose. The court affirmed. The court found that appellants filed suit against appellees more than 12 years after the allegedly defective product was delivered to the original purchaser. The court held that appellees had an affirmative defense in Fla. Stat. ch. 95.031(2) (1981), the products liability statute of repose. The court held that even where the injury to appellant husband occurred only four months prior to the expiration of the 12-year period, there was sufficient time remaining after appellants' cause of action accrued to bring suit so as not to offend the access to the courts provision of the constitution.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee developer advised the Department of Natural Resources (DNR) that he intended to construct a dock over sovereign land under Fla. Stat. ch. 403.813 (2)(b) (1983), which appellee believed preempted the requirement to obtain state consent to construct such a dock. The DNR informed appellee that the construction was unauthorized. Appellee sought declaratory and injunctive relief against appellant state officials. The trial court denied appellants' motion to dismiss or to transfer venue, and granted appellee's request for a preliminary injunction. On appeal, the court affirmed the denial of a transfer of venue, holding that since appellee was seeking relief from alleged threats to his property rights, the action could be heard in the county where the alleged wrong was threatened. The court reversed the preliminary injunction, holding that appellee failed to show a substantial likelihood of success on the merits. The court held that ch. 403.813 (2)(b)'s use of the word &quot;permit&quot; did not refer to a lease, license, easement, or other form of consent to occupy land, and that therefore the DNR had the authority to prohibit the building of appellee's dock.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review from the Circuit Court for Dade County (Florida), which found that appellant's medical malpractice action against appellee physician was barred by the four-year statute of repose, Fla.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee physician performed a dilation and curettage (D &amp; C) on appellant in 1976 and informed her that her intrauterine device had been expelled during an earlier miscarriage. Following the D&amp; C, appellant experienced problems. In 1981 appellant learned that the intrauterine device had not been expelled but was lodged in and projecting through the wall of her uterus. Appellant sued appellee in 1983. The court reversed the lower court's decision that appellant's action was barred by the four-year statute of repose. The record did not support the lower court's finding that appellant knew or with reasonable diligence should have known of the existence of her cause of action within four years of 1976, the year of the accident. The issue of whether appellant knew or should have known of the existence of her cause of action was one that had to be resolved by a factfinder.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs were injured in an accident involving a vehicle manufactured by defendants, automobile manufacturers. The accident occurred in the British West Indies. Plaintiffs filed an amended action under Fla. Stat. chs. 48.181 and 48.194, as amended by Fla. Laws. ch. 84-2. Defendants moved to dismiss on the grounds that the causes of action did not arise from any activities of defendants in Florida. Plaintiffs' attorney argued successfully that Fla. Laws ch. 84-2, &sect; 4, which eliminated the requirement that the cause of action have some connection to defendants' activities in Florida, applied retroactively to plaintiffs' action. The court reversed and remanded the lower court's denial of defendants' motion to dismiss. Fla. Laws ch. 84-2, &sect; 4 could not apply retroactively to plaintiffs' action because there was no clear and unambiguous language declaration that Fla. Laws ch. 84-2, &sect; 4 was to be applied retroactively. Fla. Laws ch. 84-2, &sect; 4 may have indicated legislative intent to apply the amendments retroactively, but it did not so clearly and unmistakably evince such intent to overcome the strong precedent holding that long-arm statutes were only to have prospective operation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee parents were accused of failing to insure their children's regular attendance at school. The trial court held that Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 232.02 was so impermissibly vague that appellees could not have known whether their conduct subjected them to criminal liability. Appellant prosecution sought review of the trial court's order. The court reversed the order, holding that the statute was not unconstitutionally vague because it plainly set out the means by which regular school attendance was to be achieved. The statute clearly prohibited an unqualified parent from teaching a child at home under the guise that a private school had been established. The court remanded the case for a full determination of whether appellees had indeed established private schools, or whether they were merely attempting to evade the statutory prescriptions of school attendance under the pretense that the children's home was also their school.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, passengers injured in an automobile, appealed the lower court's decision to grant summary judgment in favor of defendant interstate highway designer. Plaintiffs were injured in an accident that occurred on the highway that defendant designed more than 15 years after defendant designed it. The court reversed and held that the new law enacted by the legislature, Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 95.11(3)(c) (1980), did not bar plaintiffs' claims because the law was enacted after plaintiffs filed suit and the legislature was presumed to know that the statutes would be applied prospectively in the absent of a clear intent otherwise. The court held that even though &sect; 95.11(3)(c) was enacted because a court had overruled an earlier statute that applied the same principles, nowhere within the new law did the legislature put any language to show that the law should be retroactively applied, and therefore the new law did not apply to plaintiffs case and plaintiffs claims were not barred by a 15-year statute of repose.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant personal representative brought a medical malpractice action, alleging appellee medical care providers negligently left a sponge in decedent's chest following surgery and that this contributed to decedent's health problems. Appellees conceded negligence and causation were the sole issues for jury trial. The lower court provided the full standard jury instruction on causation, and, after the jury requested reinstruction, the court provided only portions of that same instruction. The jury found for appellees on causation, and the court awarded attorney's fees to appellees as the prevailing party under Fla. Stat. ch. 768.56(1)(1980). Appellant claimed on appeal that the partial jury instruction constituted error and that attorney's fees were improperly awarded. The court affirmed the jury award and held that where the entire jury instruction was provided initially there was no error. Although the court found that appellees were the prevailing parties because appellant failed to prove each element of his tort action, the court held that Fla. Stat. ch. 768.56(1980) should not have been applied to this malpractice action which accrued prior to the statute's effective date.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The jury verdict entered in favor of appellee medical care providers was affirmed because the trial court did not err error in reinstructing the jury by providing it with only part of the instruction given to the jury because the entire jury instruction was provided initially.

Appellant sought a judgment of acquittal at the close of evidence, arguing that the state had failed to prove a prima facie case. The trial court denied the motion and adjudicated appellant a delinquent. On appeal, the court reversed the adjudication of delinquency after reviewing the two elements of the offense--forward-looking, incipient criminal behavior and that such behavior must be alarming. The court found that appellant's suspicious criminal conduct pointed to an already completed criminal act and did not satisfy the requirement of immediate future criminal activity.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee time-share condominium project owners filed an action against appellant licensing agency, claiming that the time-share seller licensing requirement of Fla.

The lower court held that the licensing requirement, which at the time required owners of condominium projects to use licensed salesmen to sell their condominiums, was unconstitutional and enjoined its enforcement. The court reversed because the requirement did not violate due process. The state regulation was reasonable because time-share sales of the same property to 50 different owners were significantly different from usual real estate sales and involved substantial and unique public interest concerns that required licensing of salespersons.</SPAN></P>

The court found that appellant received a separate sentence for each of two separate offenses, and that the sentence was not a split sentence. The court determined that because probation was not a sentence, a term of probation as to one separate offense could not be added to a term of confinement imposed as a sentence for another offense in computing a total sentence under Fla.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with possession of credit card embossing machines in violation of Fla. Stat. ch. 817.63 (1983). The trial court dismissed two counts of a three-count information because they were vague and overbroad. The state challenged this decision. The court affirmed the trial court's decision. It held that where a statute criminalized legal, protected activities along with illegal, unprotected activities, or when the legislature set a net large enough to catch all possible offenders, leaving the courts to determine who was lawfully charged, the statute in question was overbroad. While the court recognized that, when reasonably possible, doubts about a statute must be resolved in favor of its constitutionality, given the facts of the case, where the statute proscribed mere possession of the machinery, the statute was overbroad because it proscribed legal activity. The court affirmed the lower court's dismissal of the two counts against defendant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant bank argued that appellee, the state's banking department, erred in accepting as a basis for setting the value of dissenting shares of stock held by individual appellees in appellant, at the time of its bank merger, an appraisal about $ 20 higher per share than other appraisals ordered by a hearing officer pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 658.44(5) (1981). The court disagreed, noting that appellee department, even after rejecting some hearing officer factual underpinnings, clearly supported the higher valuation on the basis of substantial evidence still remaining. Simply stated, this valuation need not be rejected simply because appellee department justifiably rejected some hearing officer findings, the court added. Further, the dissenting appellees were not entitled to prejudgment interest, from the merger date, postjudgment interest, from the date of the final order, or costs of the proceedings, the court ruled. While ch. 658.44(5) required the resulting bank to pay appraisal costs, the court declined to impose interest or other costs when the statute was silent, when no legal wrong had been committed during the merger, and when no interest-bearing order was involved .</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant general hospital in a formal administrative hearing contested appellee department's proposed grant of a certificate of need (CON) to another hospital in its service area. In a separate proceeding appellant university hospital applied for and was denied a CON. Subsequently appellant university sought to intervene in the hearing opposing the grant of the CON to the other hospital. The department denied appellant university hospital's motion to intervene. Appellee department ultimately held appellant general hospital in default for bad faith negotiations and precluded it from participating in the hearing. Both hospitals sought review, and the appeals were consolidated. The court reversed the decision of appellee department, holding appellant general hospital in default. The court held that Fla. Admin. Code Ann. r. 28-5.211 was an invalid exercise of undelegated power insofar as it purported to allow an agency or hearing officer to dismiss a proceeding and default a party for failure to comply with procedural orders of an agency or hearing officer.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant hospitals sought review of orders from the Department of Insurance (Florida) that in 1983 assessed the hospitals for the Florida Patient's Compensation Fund (Fund) for the Fund years 1976-1977 to and including 1980-1981. Appellants contended they were over-assessed for these years under Fla. Stat. ch. 768.54(3)(d) (1983), especially given the removal of a statutory cap on assessments against physician insureds.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At issue was whether Fla. Stat. ch. 768.54(3)(d) (1983) permitted back assessment of additional premiums against physicians participating in the Florida Patient's Compensation Fund (Fund). If it did, appellant hospitals arguably were over-assessed for disproportionate physician-related claims against the Fund for the years in question for which member physicians had escaped additional assessment. During these years premiums assessable against physicians were limited to the amount each physician had paid to join the Fund for a particular year of coverage. As to hospitals, however, the law permitted unlimited additional assessments to be made as required by claims experience. But by 1983, when the assessments at issue were made, the cap on physician-related assessments had been removed. The court affirmed the order, however, holding that as to physicians, the cap remained applicable for the prior years. The court held that the Fund operated on an independent basis for each fiscal year. The court also noted that this construction avoided a constitutional issue involving retroactivity and due process.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the order of assessment against appellant hospitals. The court held that the assessment was fair and accurate, because for the years in question member physicians by law were exempt from assessment beyond what they initially paid for the insurance, so adverse claims experience relating to physicians was assessable against appellants alone.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, convicted of burglary and violation of probation for aggravated battery, sought review of an order of the Circuit Court for Monroe County (Florida), which imposed concurrent sentences in excess of the sentencing guidelines.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, convicted of burglary and violation of probation for aggravated battery, argued trial court error in imposing enhanced sentences beyond the sentencing guidelines, because the reasons for doing so were not clear and convincing as required by Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.701(b)(6), (d)(11). The court disagreed, noting that the reasons cited by the trial court included a violation of trust, in that appellant used a passkey provided years earlier by his employer to burglarize a motel room, long-range planning, and violation of probation. Explaining, the court ruled it would accept a departure from the guidelines if the reason was not a &quot;inherent component&quot; of the crime in question and if the override was within the trial court's sound discretion. Nothing was inherent in the crime of burglary that included the element of a violation of confidence that had been placed in the offender. More severe penalties had traditionally been imposed when this element was shown. That the crime was not spontaneous, but the result of long range planning, justified the same conclusion. Deviation from the guidelines was permitted for a crime committed while violating probation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Order affirmed sentencing appellant, convicted of burglary and violation of probation for aggravated battery, to concurrent sentences in excess of the sentencing guidelines, because enhanced sentences imposed on appellant involved breach of trust, long-range planning, and probation violation, as these elements were not &quot;inherent components&quot; of the crime incorporated into the guidelines and override was within the judge's sound discretion.</SPAN></P>

While the appeal was pending, the state filed a notice of voluntary dismissal, stating in the notice that it intended to refile the information. Based on the notice, the court dismissed the appeal. The state subsequently refiled the information relying on state case law that upheld the constitutionality of the trafficking statute. The defense filed a motion to dismiss on the ground of res judicata. The trial court denied defendant's motion. The court reversed and held that the principle of res judicata was applicable. The court explained that when the state dismissed its prior appeal, that dismissal left the trial court's judgment in the same status as if no appeal had ever been taken.

On appeal, the court held that the statute was facially unconstitutional because it was designed to accomplish an object or purpose separate from that of the remainder of the legislation in that there was no logical connection between the regulation of water quality and amendment of the sales tax collection law. The facial unconstitutionality could not be alleviated by reference to the unsworn cash flow analysis which was not a part of the record. Because appellees took the position that they could establish the validity of the provisions, the summary judgment was reversed and the case remanded for disposition by the trial court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Because defendant failed to reserve the right to appeal following the entry of his nolo contendere pleas, defendant was not entitled to a direct appeal, and the state's motion to dismiss the appeal was granted. Defendant entered nolo contendere pleas to filing unauthorized claims, receiving unauthorized payment, and grand theft in violation of Fla. Stat. ch. 409.325(4)(a) and 812.014 (1983). The trial court withheld adjudication of guilt and placed defendant on probation. Defendant appealed. The state brought a motion to dismiss the appeal, claiming that Fla. R. App. P. 9.140(b)(1) did not allow a direct appeal because defendant had failed to reserve the right to appeal. The appellate court granted the motion, finding that because defendant had failed to reserve his right to appeal at the time of the pleas, a direct appeal was not available. Because the intent of the rule was to limit direct appeals, defendant's appeal was dismissed.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, former and current owners of a toxic waste site, sought review of non-final orders from the Circuit Court for Dade County (Florida), which granted preliminary injunctive relief requiring appellants to effectuate the safe and expeditious removal of toxic sludge and to conduct tests to detect the presence of other hazardous substances on-site, and subsequently held certain appellants in contempt for failure to comply with that order.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the court affirmed the grant of injunctive relief against appellants, former and current owners of a toxic waste site, pursuant to the anti-pollution and nuisance provisions of Code of Metropolitan Dade County, Fla., ch. 24. The court held that the applicable provisions of the county code imposed strict liability on appellants for the discharge of hazardous substances on the polluted property and for the maintenance of a nuisance, without regard to whether appellants actively participated in the pollution or tacitly accepted the on-going contamination problem. The court further noted that the retroactive application of Code of Metropolitan Dade County, Fla. &sect; 24-57(g) was not prohibited where the ordinance was a remedial measure affecting a previously existing right of action and did not violate the constitutional prohibition against ex post facto laws because it was not a criminal sanction or due process protections. The court concluded by reversing the orders of contempt, finding that the directives of the preliminary injunctive order were not sufficiently clear and definite to apprise the parties of the lower court's mandate.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the preliminary injunction against appellants, former and current owners of a toxic waste site, finding that appellants were properly held strictly liable for the discharge of pollutants and the maintenance of a nuisance, without regard to any apportionment of knowledge or fault concerning the contamination; contempt order reversed where the injunctive order did not clearly express lower court's mandate.</SPAN></P>

Appellee sued appellant for malicious prosecution and false arrest. The jury returned a verdict against appellant for malicious prosecution, and awarded appellee $ 75,000; the jury returned a verdict in favor of appellant on the false arrest claim. The court reversed the award of damages because there was virtually no evidence presented to the jury that appellee was damaged by the prosecution; his arrest was the sole focus of his injury claims. Therefore, there was no factual basis for the award. Fla. Stat. ch. 768.28(9) (1979), which disallowed suits against municipalities for the malicious acts of their employees, also barred recovery.</SPAN></P>

The trial court dismissed appellee for lack of standing, but let him proceed as a taxpayer.

The court reversed the trial court's finding that ch. 80-368 was unconstitutional, holding that it was within the legislative prerogative to classify property for the purpose of taxation, so long as the classification was based on some reasonable distinction rationally related to the purpose for which the statute was enacted.</SPAN></P>

The trial court held that defendant's rescission was based on a political response, without any due process safeguards to plaintiff, and defendant appealed.

The court affirmed the sentence holding that the trial court specifically asked appellant if he wished to be sentenced under the guidelines and his counsel answered in the affirmative. The court then departed from the guidelines and sentenced appellant to four consecutive five-year terms. The court noted that the violation of probation constituted clear and convincing reasons for departure from the presumptive sentence. The court held that decisions regarding sentencing options and their consequences, such as loss of parole and departure, were matters to be considered and evaluated by defendant and his counsel and did not require further judicial scrutiny. The court found no merit in appellant's constitutional challenges to Fla. Stat. ch. 921.001(4)(a) and the sentencing guidelines.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his resentence from the Circuit Court for Dade County (Florida) that imposed its prior sentences for robbery and probation violation but made them concurrent. The court had previously remanded the case with instructions to resentence defendant according to a plea agreement that defendant declined or to explain the reasons for the harsher sentence to assure the absence of vindictiveness.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At the end of defendant's trial for robbery, and again when the jury retired, the trial court made a plea offer to defendant, who rejected it both times. After the jury returned a guilty verdict, the trial court sentenced appellant to 20 and 5 year consecutive terms for robbery and probation violation. On appeal, the court remanded the case for resentencing in accordance with the plea offer or for a record with findings supporting the harsher sentence. The trial court made the record, imposed the same sentences, but made them concurrent. On appeal, the court held that the record showed that the sentences defendant received were standard sentences for his crimes, and that the plea offer was made for an acceptable reason to assure a term of imprisonment in order to protect society from defendant. Thus, there was no vindictiveness and the record supported the sentences. The court held that the ability to impose a greater sentence after a plea offer was rejected, was an essential element of plea negotiations, and that defendant could not reject an offer, then demand the plea offer's sentence after he was found guilty. Therefore, the court affirmed the resentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the resentence that imposed the prior sentences for robbery and probation violation but made them concurrent because the trial court followed the court's mandate and made a record supporting the sentences and showing that the sentences were not the result of judicial vindictiveness for defendant's refusal of a plea offer. Thus, the trial court properly imposed sentences that were harsher than those in the plea offer.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, food stamp recipients, sought review of the order from the Florida Division of Administrative Hearings that dismissed their challenge to proposed Fla. Adm. Code Rule 10C-3.60 for lack of standing because the rule, which required food stamp recipients to do government work in exchange for benefits, did not apply to appellants' county.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee, a state department of health and rehabilitative services, proposed Fla. Adm. Code Ann. r. 10C-3.60, which required food stamp recipients to work at government sites in order to obtain food stamps. Appellants, food stamp recipients, challenged the rule, and the division of administrative hearings dismissed their challenge for lack of standing. On appeal, the court held that at the time appellants filed their challenge, it was unknown which counties would implement the rule. Thus, the real possibility that appellants would suffer an immediate injury if the rule were implemented gave them standing. However, because it was now certain that the rule would not apply to appellants' county, the rule did not cause any injury to appellants, and it was impossible for the court to grant any effectual relief to appellants. Thus, appellants' claim was now moot. The court held that it could raise the issue of mootness on its own motion, and that the only exception to mootness, a class action, did not apply to the proposed rule challenges. Therefore, the court affirmed the order.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the order dismissing appellants', food stamp recipients, challenge to a proposed rule that required recipients to do government work. The court held that although appellants had standing to challenge the rule at the time they filed their complaint, their challenge became moot when it became known that the rule would not apply to appellants' county, and that the court could raise the issue of mootness on its own motion.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted and sentenced for manslaughter and his probation was revoked. At trial, appellant did not testify, but had given the police three separate statements.

Defense counsel also contended, in closing argument, that in each of appellant's statements he had told the truth. In response, the state's closing argument pointed out the inconsistencies and conflicts among the statements, and appellant's motion for a mistrial was denied. On appeal, the court affirmed appellant's conviction. The court held that when defense counsel argued that appellant had told the truth in the taped statements, the state was justified in arguing the contrary to the jury, and the trial court had was correct in so holding. The court ruled that even if the state's comments were erroneous, it was harmless error because evidence of guilt was overwhelming.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of the judgment from the Circuit Court for Orange County (Florida) that denied his motion to suppress evidence found in his car and convicted him of possession of cannabis and hashish. Appellant claimed that his consent to search was not voluntarily obtained while he was being illegally detained under Florida's Stop and Frisk law, Fla. Stat. Ch. 901.151 (1981).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">While appellant was driving his car, he was stopped by the sheriff's deputies who took appellant in their car to the scene of a robbery for the victims to identify him, but the victims stated that appellant was not the robber. Appellant was returned to his car and, while in the sheriff's car, consented to a search of his car where the deputies found drugs. The trial court denied appellant's motion to suppress and convicted him of possession of cannabis and hashish. On appeal, the court held that although the deputies' initial stop and transportation of appellant was lawful under Florida's Stop and Frisk law, Fla. Stat. ch. 901.151(2) (1981), keeping appellant in the sheriff's car after appellant was returned to his car when he was found not to be the robber was unlawful under Fla.

Stat. ch. 440.11(1) (1983) because of workers' compensation benefits appellee had provided to its injured employee.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant city and appellee corporation were parties to a contract that expressly provided for indemnity. After an employee of appellee was injured on a construction project for appellant, the employee sued appellant for damages, and appellant filed a third-party complaint against appellee seeking indemnity. The trial court dismissed appellant's third-party complaint seeking indemnification from appellee. The reviewing court reversed. The court relied on a prior case which held that a negligent third party's common law action for indemnification against a negligent employer whose injured employee had received workers' compensation benefits was not barred by Fla. Stat. ch. 440.11(1). The court believed that the holding in the prior case applied as well to cases involving express contractual indemnity, where the contract of indemnity extended only to those losses the indemnitee suffered because of the negligence of the indemnitor. Therefore, on the authority of the prior case, the court held that ch. 440.11(1) was unconstitutional as applied to appellant. Application of the statute would destroy appellant's right under its contract of indemnity.</SPAN></P>

She claimed that the trial court committed reversible error with respect to the three issues. The court disagreed and affirmed.

Also, her 15-year sentence imposed under Fla. Stat. ch. 893.135(2) (1983) was neither excessively severe nor constitutionally impermissible.

Appellees filed a motion to strike the demand for attorney's fees on the ground that chapter 768.56(1) was unconstitutional. During the hearing on the motions, appellees argued that the section violated the equal protection clauses of both the Florida and United States Constitutions, and that the section discriminated against that class of unsuccessful medical malpractice claimants who were solvent because it had a &quot;chilling effect&quot; upon their access to the courts. The trial court found the aforementioned statute unconstitutional on equal protection grounds. The court reversed and remanded, holding that the legislature had the power to exempt indigent litigants from the ambit of the statute. Such an exemption did not affect a solvent litigant's right of access to the court, but rather protected an indigent party's right of access to the courts. Therefore, the statute did bear a reasonable relationship to a legitimate state objective and did not violate the right to equal protection.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee was arrested for the crimes of official misconduct and perjury, in violation of Fla. Stat. ch.  839.25(1)(a) (1981), and Fla. Stat. ch. 837.02 (1981), respectively, but negotiated a guilty plea to the charge of misconduct. Appellee withdrew her guilty plea. The state then charged her for both offenses, but she sought to dismiss the charges, arguing that the speedy trial period had run. The trial court agreed. The court affirmed the trial court's decision in part, reversed in part, and remanded. The court agreed with the trial court that Fla. Stat. ch. 839.25(1)(a) was so vague as to violate U.S. Const. amend. XIV and Fla. Const. art. I, &sect; 9. The court disagreed that appellee was deprived of her speedy trial right under Fla. R. Civ. P. 3.191 (a)(1), because once the motion to withdraw plea was granted, the case was outside the ambit of Rule 3.191. The court concluded that the failure to file the perjury count was clearly a feature of the negotiated plea, and that defendant could not defeat the state's opportunity to charge her by negotiating a plea and then obtaining a favorable ruling after the speedy trial time had passed. Thus, the court reversed the perjury decision.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's decision in part, reversed in part, and remanded. The court affirmed the dismissal of appellee's official misconduct charge because the charge was unconstitutionally vague. The court, however, reversed and remanded, finding that appellee was deprived of her speedy trial right because granting appellee's motion to withdraw plea removed the case from the ambit of the speedy trial rule.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant hospitals filed a breach of contract suit against appellee Florida Patient's Compensation Fund.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff condominium associations were assessed taxes from all of the individual time-share units in their developments pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 192.037 (1983). Plaintiffs challenged the constitutionality of both the assessment and the authorizing statute on due process and equal protection grounds. The trial court dismissed their complaint because it was filed after the sixty-day limitation period under Flat. Stat. ch. 194.171(2) for filing tax assessment challenges. The court reversed the dismissal because that limitation period only applied to those cases in which the assessment was challenged as being voidable.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee county sued appellants, the current landowner, former landowners, and former operators of a wood-treating plant, seeking relief for alleged violations of anti-pollution and nuisance ordinances of the Dade County (Florida) Code for environmental hazards on a piece of land. A preliminary injunction ordered appellants to jointly hire a specified contractor to remove, transport, and dispose of toxic sludge on the property. Upon motion by appellee, the trial court subsequently found appellants in indirect civil contempt for failure to comply with the injunction. On appeal, the court affirmed the grant of injunctive relief against appellants pursuant to the anti-pollution and nuisance provisions of the Code of Metropolitan Dade County (Florida) ch. 24, holding that the ordinance applied retrospectively and that the applicable code provisions imposed strict liability for the discharge of pollutants and for the maintenance of a nuisance, without regard to considerations of knowledge or fault. The court reversed the judgment of contempt, concluding that the directives of the preliminary injunction order were not sufficiently clear to apprise the parties of the court's mandate.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant state challenged a decision of the Circuit Court for Sarasota County (Florida), which dismissed two counts of an information against appellee criminal defendant for violating Fla.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant state challenged trial court's dismissal of an information charging appellee criminal defendant under Fla. Stat. ch. 828.12(2)(a) and (b). Appellee had originally challenged the statute as impermissibly vague. In part, the statutory provisions proscribed keeping animals in any enclosure without wholesome exercise and change of air. The trial court dismissed those counts of the information resulting from appellee's keeping of poodles in cages in the back of a van because the statutory language appellant contended appellee had violated was vague, voiding the statute. The court reversed the trial court's dismissal holding that, initially a statute is presumed to be constitutional, and as long as the language of the statute conveyed sufficiently definite warnings of the proscribed conduct when measured by common understanding and practice, the statute was not unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court's dismissal of two counts of the information against appellee criminal defendant, holding that it would be impossible to draft a statute to encompass all situations, and that the provisions of the statute under which appellee was charged were definite enough to apprise persons of common intelligence of the proscribed activities.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner county requested a writ of certiorari to review an award of attorney fees to court-appointed attorneys, respondents, for the trial and appeal of criminal cases, arguing that the trial judge erred in declaring Fla.

In granting the writ and quashing the award to respondents, the reviewing court concluded that, based upon the plethora of authority that existed on the issue, the trial court erred in determining the statute to be unconstitutional and in awarding an excessive fee to respondents. Fla. Stat. ch. 925.036 was mandatory and not directory, and the trial court erred in ignoring the well-established premise that a legislative enactment was presumed valid and was not to be declared unconstitutional unless it was demonstrated beyond a reasonable doubt that the statute conflicted with a designated constitutional provision.

Although ch. 843.035 had been declared unconstitutional, appellant pleaded guilty to the obstruction and loitering charges and did not reserve the right to appeal. As a result, the appellate court did not have jurisdiction to hear the appeal. However, the appellate court reversed appellant's conviction for simple possession. Simple possession and possession with intent to sell constituted the same offense because they contained the same elements. Where two offenses were the same, convictions for both were prohibited.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After denying defendant's alternative motions for a statement of particulars or to dismiss, the Circuit Court for Dade County (Florida) entered a judgment of conviction in accordance with the jury's verdict that found defendant guilty of solicitation to commit perjury and witness tampering. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When an associate told defendant that his bank records had been subpoenaed and that he expected to have to testify, defendant allegedly told his associate, &quot;Just don't remember. Don't remember. There's nothing wrong with amnesia.&quot; Defendant was convicted of solicitation to commit perjury and witness tampering. Defendant appealed. The court affirmed, holding that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by denying defendant's alternative motions for a statement of particulars or to dismiss because the information informed defendant of the charge for which he was to be tried and did not mislead or embarrass him in the preparation of his defense. Moreover, the crime of solicitation was complete with solicitation, even though there could never have been acquiescence in the scheme by the one solicited. Next, in light of a recent state supreme court decision, the court was compelled to reject defendant's challenge to the witness tampering conviction. Finally, defendant failed to preserve error as to the state's allegedly prejudicial closing argument because defendant's mistrial motion was not made before the jury retired for deliberations.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's convictions, holding that defendant was not entitled either to a dismissal or a statement of particulars because the solicitation charge was not unconstitutionally vague and binding precedent required the rejection of any challenge to the witness tampering charge. Also, because defendant did not object to the state's closing remarks until after the jury retired, such issue was not preserved for review.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant municipality hired appellee construction company to perform certain work, and the parties entered into an indemnification agreement through which appellee agreed to indemnify appellant from any claims which resulted from appellee's negligence in connection with the construction. Appellee's employee was injured when a construction site caved in and, although appellee provided the employee with workman's compensation benefits, the employee brought an action against appellant for injuries sustained. Appellant filed a third party complaint against appellee based upon the prior indemnity contract, and appellee claimed immunity under Fla. Stat. ch. 440.11(1)(1983) because workman's compensation benefits had been provided. Appellee's motion to dismiss was granted by the lower court. The court reversed this ruling and held that ch. 440.11(1) did not shelter appellee from additional liability where that liability stemmed from an express contract of indemnity.</SPAN></P>

The jury returned a verdict in favor of appellee after it was instructed that a consent which is evidenced in writing and signed by a person who is mentally and physically competent to give consent was conclusively presumed to be a valid consent. The court reversed the judgment in favor of appellee, holding that the consent statute was unconstitutional. The court found that the test for the constitutionality of statutory presumptions was whether there was a rational connection between the fact proved and the ultimate fact presumed and whether there was a fair right to rebut the presumption.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant filed a motion to withdraw mandate, alleging that the court had not considered whether the trial court improperly retained jurisdiction over one-half of defendant's sentence because defendant committed the offenses committed prior to the effective date of the 1982 amendment to Fla. Stat. ch. 947.16 (1983) and that defendant was improperly sentenced on her plea of guilty to robbery.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant filed a motion seeking to withdraw the court's mandate, alleging that the court had not considered the other two points raised on defendant's initial appeal to this court. First, defendant contended that the court should have considered whether the trial judge improperly retained jurisdiction over one-half defendant's sentence where the offenses committed occurred prior to the effective date of the 1982 amendment to Fla. Stat. ch. 947.16 (1983), which increased from one-third to one-half the length of sentence over which a trial court could retain jurisdiction. Defendant contended that application of the 1982 amendment to her case created an unconstitutional ex post facto application. The court applied precedent from the state supreme court that held otherwise. Second, defendant contended that she was improperly sentenced for robbery and was not properly sentenced for her guilty plea to unarmed robbery. The court declined to consider this issue because the trial court had not ruled on it. The court withdrew the mandate as it pertained the robbery sentence and otherwise affirmed the mandate, remanding for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

At trial, appellant took the stand and gave evidence asserting his innocence. Appellee city filed a motion for a directed verdict, which the lower court granted. On appeal, the lower court's decision was affirmed. The appellate court determined that the sole evidence before the lower court at the time of the directed verdict was that of the appellant, who could not testify as to the nature or extent of the evidence from which the police officers found probable cause to arrest him.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant insurance company challenged on both constitutional and nonconstitutional grounds the decision entered by appellee, the Department of Insurance of the State of Florida, holding that appellant had to refund excess premium payments to its policyholders.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant insurance company was ordered by appellee state agency to refund excess premium payments to its policyholders. Appellant challenged that order, arguing the Workers' Compensation Excessive Profits Law (WCEPL), Fla. Stat. ch. 627.215 (1981) was unconstitutional and had been misapplied. The court rejected appellant's constitutional challenge but agreed with its nonconstitutional argument, remanding the case for further proceedings. The court opined that, insofar as the constitutional challenge went, the WCEPL bore a reasonable relationship to the valid goal of protecting policyholders from excessive insurance rates, and thus the means chosen to enforce that goal was permissible. The court also held that the mere fact that some policyholders would benefit more than did others did not affect the WCEPL's constitutionality, as some marginal inequity was permitted. The court thus found the WCEPL constitutional. However, the court concluded that appellee had miscalculated the amount of the refund appellant must pay, and remanded for a recalculation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee's ruling was affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded. The court held that the Workers' Compensation Excessive Profits Law was constitutional, since it was rationally related to a legitimate state interest and its marginally inequitable effect as to different taxpayer groups was not substantial. However, appellee's computational error warranted remand.</SPAN></P>

The statute was vague and open to arbitrary and capricious application because there was no way of determining which of the myriad of public servants' duties were &quot;imposed by law.&quot; The offense defined by &sect; 839.25(1)(a) was simply too open-ended to limit prosecutorial discretion in any reasonable way and could be used to prosecute, as a crime, the most insignificant of transgressions or, at worst, to misuse the judicial process for political purposes.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee patients filed a medical malpractice suit against appellants, doctors and medical group. A jury awarded damages to one appellee, but found that the other had not sustained any damages. Pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 768.56 (1983), the trial court awarded attorney's fees against appellants to the damaged appellee. Appellants challenged the award, claiming that the trial court erred by applying the statute retroactively, that the statute was unconstitutional, and that the trial court erred when it found appellants equitably estopped to assert the statute's unconstitutionality. The court held that the statute was properly applied because appellees' suit was filed after the effective date of the statute. It was of no consequence that the acts of negligence alleged by appellees occurred before the effective date. The court further held that the statute did not violate due process of law because the statute abrogated no value and impaired no vested rights. Furthermore, because appellants recovered a fee judgment against the nondamaged appellee, they were prohibited from arguing that the statute discriminated against them. Accordingly, the trial court's judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of trafficking in cocaine and conspiracy to traffic. The court reversed. The court found that appellant demonstrated reversible error in his allegation that his right to back-strike jurors during voir dire was erroneously restricted. The court also found that appellant adequately demonstrated that the procedure adopted by the trial court interfered with his right to exercise peremptory challenges. The court noted that the appellate courts have consistently interpreted both Fla. R. Civ. P. 1.431, and Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.310, to protect the right of a litigant to back-strike at any time before a juror is sworn. Thus, the court held that the procedure adopted by the trial judge unreasonably restricted appellant's right to exercise peremptory challenges as provided in Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.310, and constituted an abuse of discretion which required reversal. The court remanded for a new trial.</SPAN></P>

Defendants appealed, arguing that the RICO civil damages provisions were improperly applied because there was no showing that they were connected to organized crime and that the punitive damages were excessive. In affirming, the court noted that it was unnecessary to prove a nexus to organized crime in order to obtain damages in a private civil RICO suit.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant citizen challenged a final amended trial court order finding 1983 Fla. Laws chs. 83-76 constitutional. This law allowed state workers to retire and continue employment while receiving retirement benefits although no work time would be credited toward retirement. Retirement eligibility rules did not change. Appellant had brought suit against appellee state comptroller and appellee Department of Administration seeking declaratory and injunctive relief against the payment of any funds from the state retirement fund by the appellees. Appellant contended this early retirement law violated Fla. Const. art. X, &sect; 14 because the law provided on its face an increase in benefits without a concomitant funding of the increase on a sound actuarial basis. The court affirmed the trial court finding that the state law stating that the absence of an actuarial study did not, per se, render the statute invalid, and that the law did not necessarily provide an increase in retirement benefits. Concluding that appellant had not shown the effect of the law was to reduce the retirement age, thereby causing early retirement of eligible members, the court affirmed the trial court judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant county property appraiser sought review of a judgment from the Circuit Court for Hillsborough County (Florida) which invalidated the property assessments for ad valorem taxes assessed against appellee life care facility for certain tax years. Appellee sought review of that portion of the judgment that affirmed appellant's denial of appellee's claim for charitable deductions for the same years.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee life care facility argued that its claim for charitable exemptions for given tax years was improperly denied by appellant, the county tax appraiser, because the exemptory statutes, Fla. Stat. chs. 196.1975, 196. 012(6) (1979), were unconstitutionally vague. The court ruled that if the statutes were invalid, appellee would not in any event be entitled an exemption because exemptions were only provided by the general laws. However, the trial court's invalidation of appellant's property assessments for the same years was improper, as assessments might be judicially overturned only if no reasonable hypothesis supported them. Here, appellant's selection of the cost approach in making the valuation of the &quot;special purpose&quot; property, rather than the income approach which would have led to a lesser assessment, was justified. Given the dual nature of appellee's facility, residential and nursing, the complications in attempting to predict stability in the income approach for assessment purposes, and appellant's consideration of, and giving appropriate weight to, all factors required for assessment set forth in ch. 193.011, the assessments were proper.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment invalidating property assessments for ad valorem taxes assessed by appellant against appellee life care facility was reversed. Appellant's use of cost approach rather than a lower-assessment income approach was supported by a reasonable hypothesis, given the dual nature of appellee's facility. Judgment denying appellee's claim for charitable deduction affirmed because no exemptions could be claimed if challenged law was invalid.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's conviction for murder and burglary was affirmed, despite defendant's claims that his right to confrontation under U.S. Const. amend VI was violated by the introduction of hearsay under Fla. Stat. ch. 90.804(2)(c) (1981). The trial court admitted the testimony of the victim's girlfriend that the victim had stolen a large quantity of cocaine from defendant, thereby supplying the motive. The court found the admission of the inculpatory statement about the cocaine theft was justified because the declarant was unavailable, the admission of stealing cocaine would tend to subject the declarant to criminal liability for drug trafficking and therefore a reasonable person would not make the statement if believed to be untrue, and the other evidence in the trial provided particularized guarantees of the trustworthiness of the statement. After considering the corroborating evidence presented, the court found that the statement had an adequate indicia of reliability so that the right to confrontation was not violated.</SPAN></P>

Stat. ch. 27.56(1) (1983), as effectuated by 1983 Fla. Laws ch. 83-256, &sect; 1, was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After appellee public defender filed for a declaratory judgment, the trial court entered summary judgment for that party. The trial court held that 1983 Fla. Laws ch. 83-256, &sect; 1, which amended Fla. Stat. ch. 27.56(1) (1983), unconstitutionally violated the separation of powers doctrine in Fla. Const. art. II, &sect; 3. When appellant governor challenged that holding, the court affirmed. The disputed law impermissibly attempted to regulate the conduct of attorneys. Appellee's professional conduct was, in fact, governed by Fla. Code of Professional Responsibility Canon 7, which required appellee to represent his client zealously and within the bounds of the law. Yet, despite such ethical obligations, the disputed law required that appellee seek assessment of costs and attorney's fees against his client. In so doing, the legislature impermissibly invaded the province of the judiciary by creating a rule of practice and procedure and attempting to regulate the conduct of attorneys.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant representative challenged the judgment of the Circuit Court for Duval County (Florida), which granted appellees' motion for judgment on the pleadings and dismissed appellant's wrongful death action for the death of her daughter.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant representative claimed that appellees, owners and operators of a bar, negligently served alcohol to her obviously intoxicated daughter, which was the proximate cause of her death. Appellant claimed that appellees owed a duty to refuse to serve alcoholic beverages under such circumstances. Appellees moved for judgment on the pleadings. They argued that Florida did not have a dram shop law imposing a duty on tavern owners, and in the absence of such a law, Florida did not recognize the instant cause of action. The trial court entered judgment for appellees, because Fla. Stat. ch. 768.125 (1981) only imposed restrictions on sale of liquor if it involved a minor, not an adult. Appellant sought reversal, claiming that the statute was unreasonable, arbitrary, capricious, and in violation of the equal protection and due process clauses of the Florida and United States Constitutions. The court, in disagreement, affirmed the ruling of the trial court. The statute's clear distinction between minor and adult consumers rationally advanced a legitimate legislative interest or goal. The statute was constitutional, and it did not improperly deny appellant access to the courts.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed entry of judgment on the pleadings for appellees in appellant representative's wrongful death action, as they had no duty to cease serving alcohol to appellant's adult daughter when she was intoxicated.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the essential requirements necessary for the issuance of a temporary injunction were met because appellee's motion and supporting documents were adequate for issuance of the injunction. The court also held that the failure of the trial judge to require bond was not reversible error because appellants' counsel had participated in drafting and approved the order granting the injunction, prior to signing by the judge, and should have raised the issue of the bond at that time.</SPAN></P>

The Ethics Commission received the complaint, but ultimately voted to dismiss it for failure to assert a legally sufficient charge. The two county commissioners filed a complaint with the state attorney's office regarding a violation of Fla. Stat. ch. 112.317(6), which criminally proscribed disclosure of the intent to file an ethics complaint or of the existence of a complaint filed with the Ethics Commission. Appellant was subpoenaed for questioning concerning the source of his article. Appellant reporter's motion to quash on U.S. Const. amend. I grounds was denied. Appellant reporter refused to reveal his source and was held in civil contempt. The court affirmed finding that there was no U.S. Const. amend. I privilege to refuse to testify. The court held that a witness to a crime, simply because he was a news reporter intending to write about what was told to him, had no greater right to refuse testimony than any other witness.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, patient and others, challenged the trial court's finding that the physician was afforded immunity under Fla. Stat. ch. 768.28(9)(a) (1981) and granted summary judgment in favor of appellees, hospital and others. Appellants claimed that the physician was subject to personal liability and precluded from asserting immunity under ch. 768.28(9)(a) based on his employment with a private academic fund. The court affirmed the summary judgment holding that there was no genuine issue as to the physician's employee status with appellee hospital. The court held that the facts on record did not indicate an employee and employer relationship between the physician and the academic fund, as none of the evidence demonstrated that appellees were involved in hiring the physician, had the power to dismiss, or had the right to control the physician's conduct. Therefore, because the physician was entitled to immunity as an employee of appellee hospital, absent an allegation of bad faith, malice, or willful and wanton actions, the physician was personally immune for ordinary negligence within the scope of employment with appellee hospital.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant state in three consolidated appeals, sought review of the order from the county court (Florida) that found that Fla. Stat. ch. 856.021 (1983) was unconstitutionally vague and overbroad, and that granted appellees' motions to dismiss the charges of loitering and prowling in violation of ch. 856.021 (1983).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellees in three cases were charged with loitering and prowling in violation of Fla. Stat. ch. 856.021 (1983). The trial court found that ch. 856.021 (1983) was vague and overbroad and thus unconstitutional and granted appellees' motions to dismiss. On consolidated appeal by the appellant state, the court held that ch. 856.021 (1983) did not proscribe merely loitering or idling, but loitering that threatened public safety or a breach of the peace. The statute required an arresting officer to point to facts that warranted a finding that a breach of the peace was imminent or that the public safety was threatened. The officer was required to provide the suspect with an opportunity to provide identification and explain his or her conduct to dispel the officer's probable cause, but the failure to produce identification was not an element of the crime. Thus, ch. 856.021 (1983) was not unconstitutionally vague or overbroad. Therefore, the court reversed the order and remanded the cases for trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee individual obtained a money judgment against appellant account owner and garnished an account that was held jointly with appellant.

Seven days before the hearing, appellant was in Florida and was served with papers. Appellant informed the court that he had to leave for Germany the following day. In appellant's absence, a final judgment was entered for the creditor. The court reversed post-judgment orders and remanded, holding that appellant had standing based on a protectable interest in the account. The court held that Fla. Stat. ch. 77.16 (1983) afforded appellant an opportunity to assert his interest in the account by the filing of an affidavit and that relief pursuant to Fla. R. Civ.

The provision required all employees to contribute a certain number of sick leave or compensatory leave hours in a time pool to be utilized for appellant's business. A hearing officer determined appellee city had committed an unfair labor practice and the Public Employees Relations Commission (PERC) substantially affirmed that ruling. This appeal followed. The court adopted and affirmed PERC's decision. It was contrary to Fla. Stat. ch. 447.301(1) for appellant and appellee city to agree to a contract provision that required all bargaining unit employees, including those who were not members of appellant union, to contribute a portion of their leave time to a pool to be used for appellant's business. The time pool constituted a form of union security which was contrary to the rights guaranteed through statute. Further, the Fla. Const. art.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the trial court denied declaratory and injunctive relief to appellant democrats by refusing to enjoin appellees, elections' supervisor and republican candidate, from placing the name of appellee republican candidate on the November 6, 1984 ballot for the office of Broward County Sheriff, appellants challenged the denial. Appellants contended that appellee republican candidate violated Fla. Stat. ch. 99.021(1)(b)2 (1983), which barred party-switching by candidates within six months of an election. In reversing, the court found that uncontradicted evidence showed that appellee republican candidate was a democratic candidate prior to July 20, 1984, and was then a republican candidate after July 20, 1984. Thus, the court held that appellee republican candidate clearly, as a matter of law, violated the statute and was not qualified to have been the Republican Party nominee in the election.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged the trial court's denial of his motion to dismiss the charge against him. Defendant was charged with and convicted of violating Jacksonville, Fla. Municipal Ordinances ch. 330.105, which prohibited all forms of begging or soliciting for alms. On appeal the court reversed. Although the municipality had the authority under its police power to control undue annoyance of the public and to prevent vehicle and pedestrian traffic from being blocked, Jacksonville, Fla. Municipal Ordinances ch. 330.105 totally prohibited begging and solicitation of alms for an individual's own use, in violation of U.S. Const. amend. I and XIV and Fla. Const. art. I, &sect; 4. Thus, the ordinance was facially unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a consolidated appeal, appellants, tenants and cable company, argued that the trial court erred in finding that Fla. Stat. ch. 83.66 was unconstitutional as a taking of appellant landlords' private property without just compensation. The court held that the statute did serve a legitimate public purpose, which was within the state's police power, by assuring appellant tenants equal access to cable television service of comparable quality and cost as that available to residents of privately owned family dwellings. The court held, though, that the statute amounted to a taking of property compensable under U.S. Const. amends. V, XIV, because it required that appellee landlords allow appellee cable companies access to appellants' premises to install services. The court affirmed because the statute did not contain any provisions for payment of just compensation to appellee landlords.</SPAN></P>

At the motion hearing, the trial court concluded that the statute was constitutionally valid and granted appellee's motion. Appellant sought review.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant pilot was piloting a Cessna aircraft that crashed, allegedly due to a manufacturing defect.

Appellee asserted the affirmative defense that the statute of limitations set forth in Fla. Stat. ch. 95.031(2) (1975) barred appellant's claim because the statute created an absolute bar to the filing of a products liability action more than 12 years after the date of delivery of a completed product to the original purchaser. The trial court found that appellant's claim was time barred and entered judgment in favor of appellee. The court affirmed the trial court and held that Fla. Stat. ch. 95.031(2) was not unconstitutional as applied to appellant because he had approximately 22 months to file his products liability claim against appellant. The court further held that the enactment of Fla.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A Pompano Beach police officer arrested defendant when he violated an ordinance that prohibited sleeping or lodging in a vehicle parked on public property. The lower court found the ordinance unconstitutional, and petitioner city sought a writ of common law certiorari, which was denied by the lower court. The court affirmed the lower court's ruling, and petitioner filed a motion for rehearing that was denied by the court. The court rejected petitioner's interpretation of the ordinance and held that the lower court's determination that the loosely worded ordinance was unconstitutional did not create a genuine hardship on petitioner because the ordinance could have been rehabilitated by adequately specifying the conduct that was prohibited. The court further held that petitioner could have created a preamble that expressed the interests that petitioner sought to protect by prohibiting certain conduct and that would have enhanced the ordinance's capacity to resist constitutional attack.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff machine operator appealed a summary judgment of the Circuit Court for Duval County (Florida) in an action sounding in products liability against defendant manufacturer and others on the basis that his claim was barred by 1975 Fla. Stat. ch. 95.031(2), a statute of repose.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff machine operator, after being injured by a machine he was operating, filed suit against defendants manufacturer and others on the basis of negligence, implied warranty, and strict liability. Although the suit was filed within the four-year limitations period provided for in Fla. Stat. ch. 95.11(3)(e), it was not filed within 12 years from the delivery of the machine to the original purchaser as required by the statute of repose, 1975 Fla. Stat. ch. 95.031(2). Application of that statute of repose reduced the time to file suit after plaintiff's accident from four years to a little over one and one-half years. The court held that application of the statute of repose did not amount to a proscribed limitation of access to courts under Fla. Const. art. I, &sect; 21, of the Florida Constitution nor a denial of equal protection of the law, because such application left plaintiff with sufficient time to institute suit after occurrence of his injury.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Summary judgment was affirmed in a products liability case where plaintiff brought suit against defendant manufacturer and others after a statute of repose had run because the time period of one and one-half years from the date of injury to the date of running of the statute was sufficient time in which to institute suit after occurrence of the injury.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his conviction by the Circuit Court for Martin County (Florida) for possession of methaqualone.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was subjected to a stop and frisk pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 901.151. The officer directed defendant to lift up his pants leg, take out what was in his sock, and dump the contents of a brown bag that defendant removed from his sock. The officer then arrested defendant for possession of methaqualone. Defendant pleaded nolo contendere, reserving the right to appeal the denial of his motion to suppress. On appeal, defendant contended that the search was illegal pursuant to ch. 901.151(5). The appellate court agreed and reversed defendant's conviction. It held that the officer's actions exceeded the limitations found in ch. 901.151(5) because it was not necessary for the officer to go to the extent that he did in order to determine if defendant had a weapon. The court reasoned that if the officer had patted-down defendant and the bag itself, as authorized by the statute, he would have felt pellets or pills and no weapon. Therefore, the officer would have had no justification for proceeding or searching further into the contents of the bag.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the trial court erred in denying defendant's motion to suppress evidence because the evidence was obtained pursuant to an illegal search. The court found that the arresting officer had no authority to require defendant to dump the contents of a bag onto the ground before he had probable cause for an arrest.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner driver sought a writ of certiorari to the Circuit Court for Hillsborough County (Florida), contending that the circuit court had erred in affirming his conviction by the county court for driving under the influence because his arrest at a police roadblock was in violation of his constitutional rights under U.S. Const. amend. IV.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a case of first impression in the state, petitioner driver sought a writ of certiorari to challenge his conviction for driving under the influence on the grounds that a police roadblock maintained for the purpose of stopping motorists to ascertain and apprehend drunken drivers was unconstitutional. Appellant contended the exclusionary rule of U.S. Const. amend. IV should be applied to evidence obtained at the roadblock. Petitioner had filed a pretrial motion to suppress all evidence obtained as a result of what he contended was an illegal seizure. The county court denied the motion. Petitioner then pleaded nolo contendere, reserving the right to appeal the denial of the motion to suppress. He appealed to the circuit court, which affirmed. On further appeal, the court granted the petition, quashed the circuit court's affirmance, and reversed the judgment of conviction, holding that the police roadblock at which petitioner was apprehended was an unconstitutional invasion of his rights under U.S. Const. amend. IV. The court held the public interest in apprehending drunken drivers did not justify the use of indiscriminate law enforcement methods of investigation and apprehension.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted the petition for writ of certiorari and quashed the lower courts' decisions, and reversed petitioner's conviction because the court determined the police roadblock at which petitioner was apprehended and on the basis of which evidence against him was obtained was an unconstitutional invasion of his rights. The court, however, also certified the question to the state's highest court as a matter of great public importance.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A decedent mother had an antenuptial agreement with appellee father, in which both agreed that the decedent mother's property would remain with appellant children upon the decedent mother's death. Later, the decedent mother executed a will that left the bulk of the estate to appellee. The will was probated, appellant received notice of the probate, and was aware of the will's contents. Appellant alleged that appellee induced appellant not to contest the will by representing that appellant would still receive the property. The trial court dismissed appellant's complaint, but the court reversed the trial court. The court held that Fla. Stat. ch. 733.103(2) (1983) did not bar appellant's action as an impermissible collateral attack on a probated will. The court held that where there was fraud alleged in the prevention of a will contest, which precluded adequate relief in probate court, the bar did not operate. The court found that appellant had alleged fraud in the complaint and that the action should not have been dismissed. The court held that ch. 733.103(2) was not an unconstitutional infringement on the supreme court's power to promulgate rules of procedure.</SPAN></P>

The state used a convicted drug statute violator as a confidential informant to bring about defendant's arrest.

The court reversed the trial court order dismissing the criminal information, holding that the trial court erred in holding that Fla.

Defendant could not challenge the constitutionality of the substantial assistance statute, because the statute applied only to treatment of the informant and had no bearing on the personal or property rights of defendant.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed, however, the trial judge's determination that Fla. Stat. ch. 687.06 (1983) was unconstitutional. The court interpreted the language of the statute to mean that when the contract flatly called for a fee of 10 percent or less, there should be no judicial inquiry into the fee's fairness or reasonableness absent some plea for equitable consideration.</SPAN></P>

HRS reported its findings to respondent attorney general, and respondent, suspecting child abuse, filed a petition for detention. The trial court found probable cause to detain the child. At the dependency hearing, the trial court deferred the adjudication, but to move the issue forward, the parents agreed to a stipulated order to review the issue within 30 days. At the review, it appeared that the reviewing judge believed that the issue was fully adjudicated: finding the child was dependent, and declined to hold an adjudication hearing to determine dependency. Petitioners then filed a writ of habeas corpus challenging the detention of their child. The court denied the writ, finding that the detention was not wrongful based on the conditions of the stipulated order. However, the court noted that petitioners had not been afforded a hearing as required by Fla. Stat. ch. 39.408 and ordered the trial court to conduct the hearing.</SPAN></P>

The trial court upheld the statutes as legitimate exercises of the state police power, and appellants challenged the trial court's decision. On appeal, the court concluded that in the absence of any apparent rational relation between the prohibition of rebates and some legitimate state purpose in safeguarding the public welfare, the anti-rebate statutes constituted an unjustified exercise of Florida's police power, and were therefore violative of the due process clause of the Florida Constitution.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant employee sought review of an order granting appellee workers' compensation carrier's motion to assess, under Fla. Stat. ch. 440.39(3)(a) (1979), a lien on the net proceeds to appellant from settlement of appellant's third party tortfeasor action based on an accident in the course of his employment. Appellant argued that Fla. Stat. ch. 440.39(3)(a) (1979) required the grant of a pro rata share of settlement proceeds instead of a 100 percent lien, as he recovered less than the full damages due to the questionable liability of the alleged tortfeasor. The court affirmed the order finding that, under Fla. Stat. ch. 440.39(3)(a) (1979), appellee was entitled to 100 percent of the benefits it paid and future benefits it would pay, and thus to 100 percent of the settlement net proceeds. Appellant's recovery of less than the full damages was not due to issues of comparative negligence or coverage, or limits of insurance coverage and collectibility. Under Fla. Stat. ch. 440.39(3)(a), to diminish appellee's reimbursement by any share of the attorney's fees would be error, and the court found no state or federal constitutional violations of equal protection or due process.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of vehicular homicide. Defendant appealed, questioning the admissibility of blood test results based on lack of probable cause, and the circuit court's failure to give his requested instruction on the definition of reckless driving. In affirming, the court held that state met its burden of demonstrating that the arresting officer had probable cause to order a blood test pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 316.1933(1) because state showed that the arresting officer smelled alcohol on defendant's breath, knew the circumstances causing the accident, and knew that defendant was the driver of the vehicle. The court held that the jury instruction given defined the offense of vehicular homicide sufficiently to inform the jury that the offense required more than ordinary lack of care, but something less than culpable negligence. The court held there was no significant difference in meaning between driving a vehicle in willful or wanton disregard for the safety of other persons and driving it in a reckless manner likely to cause the death of or great bodily harm to another person.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the circuit court granted respondent's motion to dismiss petitioner city's charge against respondent for sleeping in his car in a city parking lot in violation of City of Pompano Beach, Fla., Mun. Code &sect; 31.66, petitioner filed for a writ of certiorari. The court affirmed dismissal of the charge. Section 31.66 was unconstitutionally vague and overbroad. Although it gave ample notice of the proscribed conduct, it was void for vagueness because it left in the unbridled discretion of police officers whether or not to arrest one asleep in a motor vehicle on public property. The court noted that a wide range of persons could have violated the ordinance, including a child asleep in the car while a parent drives or the car is parked. Absent a showing of a compelling subordinating societal interest, petitioner could not thus invade the right of persons, as against the government, to be let alone.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the circuit court's order granting respondent's motion to dismiss because the circuit court did not depart from the essential requirements of law in determining that the relevant statute, which proscribed the act of sleeping in a motor vehicle on a public street, way or parking lot, was both unconstitutionally vague and overbroad. The court denied petitioner's request for a writ of certiorari.</SPAN></P>

Appellants arrested appellee minor for the offense of loitering and prowling under Fla. Stat. ch. 856.021 (1971), but the charge was later dropped without prosecution. The court held that a directed verdict could not be entered if the evidence was conflicting and permitted different reasonable inferences. The court held that the jury could have concluded that the misdemeanor of loitering and prowling had been committed in their presence by appellee minor, which would have justified the arrest.

The trial court imposed an aggravated sentence that departed from the guidelines because it was shown at trial that defendant was a drug dealer. The trial court stated that although the guidelines reflected the four counts of which he was convicted, defendant could have been convicted of up to 20 counts if undercover officers had continued to buy from him rather than stopping at four transactions. The court affirmed defendant's convictions because Fla. Stat. ch. 817.563 (1983) was constitutional and there was sufficient evidence to support the jury's verdict. The court reversed defendant's sentence and remanded for resentencing because under Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.701(d)(11), a trial judge could depart from the guidelines only if there were clear and convincing reasons for an aggravated sentence. The court held that speculation about what defendant might have done in the future was not a clear and convincing reason for departing from the guidelines.</SPAN></P>

The court noted that until the administrative procedure was complete, the matter was prematurely brought for resolution or appeal to the courts. The court noted that whether tender of a new contract by the school board to the principal was beyond its authority depended on a preliminary determination of the length of the principal's existing contract.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, environmental groups, brought a suit for injunctive relief pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 403.412 (2), seeking to compel appellees, the state department of community affairs, a bank, and a county, to commence an action related to a development of regional impact (DRI). Appellants also brought an action before the state land and water adjudicatory commission (LWAC). The trial court dismissed the action, and the LWAC dismissed the action for lack of standing, and appellants sought review of the orders. The court ruled that once local officials made a determination either to grant or deny an application for a DRI development order, the legislature limited the right to appeal such a decision to the owner, the developer, and appropriate regional planning agency pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 380.07 (2). Further, the court held that an exception to ch. 380.07 (2) was not created by appellants' standing to challenge local zoning decisions. The court affirmed in part and reversed in part the orders dismissing appellants' action, concluding that a court of equity did not ordinarily substitute its judgment for that of an administrative board when acting within the scope of its authority.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Orders dismissing appellants' action was affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded where the right to expedited review was insured by limiting standing to appeal a development of regional impact decision of the local government to individuals and groups, but a dismissal without leave to amend could result in an abuse of discretion if the facts in a complaint appeared amenable to amendment.</SPAN></P>

The appeals court found the statements were grossly improper for a court of law because the comments diverted the jury's attention from the task at hand prompted the jury to consider matters extraneous to the evidence. However, the court affirmed appellant's conviction and sentence for grand theft utilizing the harmless error rule. The evidence of guilt was so overwhelming that the court was satisfied that the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. The court reversed appellant's conviction for aggravated assault. The review of the evidence relating to the aggravated assault did not allow the court to say that the prosecutorial error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was found to be not guilty by reason of insanity on the prosecution's charges of sexual battery and attempted murder. The trial judge, based on that verdict, committed appellant to serve involuntary hospitalization pursuant to Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.217. Subsequently, appellant was evaluated for release from hospitalization, and the trial court, based on the testimony of two doctors who had examined appellant at the criminal trial, ordered further commitment. Appellant sought review of that order and the appellate court affirmed. During that review, appellant was evaluated again for release and for the third time the same two doctors evaluated appellant. As before, the trial court ordered further commitment. On appeal, the court held that there was convincing evidence to support the trial court's order, that the trial court had considered alternatives to involuntary hospitalization, that the trial court had the authority under Fla. Stat. ch. 916.11(2) to reappoint the same doctors to examine appellant, and that appellant had failed to overcome the presumption that Fla. Stat. ch. 916.15(1) was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

The court also found that the trial court had considered alternatives to hospitalization, that the trial court had statutory authority to appointment the doctors, and that appellant had failed to overcome the presumption that Florida law regarding involuntary commitments was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

The advertisement in question was placed by appellant in a newspaper of general circulation, and it advertised an upcoming holistic health fair to be held at a shopping mall. Appellant challenged the fine and the regulation as an unconstitutional abridgment of free speech. The court reversed the fine, but not on constitutional grounds. Instead, the court held that the advertisement of a health fair was not the type of advertisement to which the regulation applied.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff filed a medical malpractice suit against defendant hospital and defendant manufacturer after experiencing problems with a prosthetic device. Ten months later, after learning that his problems could be attributable to physician negligence, plaintiff added defendant surgeon as a party. Defendant surgeon moved for summary judgment on the basis of the statute of limitations and subsequently moved for a directed verdict on that same basis at trial. Defendant appealed an adverse judgment, arguing that the trial court erred in failing to conclude that plaintiff's claim against him was barred by the statute of limitations. In affirming, the appellate court noted that the statute of limitations began to run when plaintiff discovered a malpractice claim, and where there was a question as to notice or discovery, it was for the jury to decide when the statute of limitations began to run. Where there was evidence that plaintiff did not learn of defendant surgeon's negligence until after suit had been commenced, this was sufficient to take the question to the jury and to sustain the jury's conclusion that the cause of action was not barred by the statute of limitations.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment for plaintiff in his medical malpractice action was affirmed, as plaintiff's claim against defendant surgeon was not barred by the statute of limitations where there was a question as to notice or discovery.

Appellees deraigned their titles from these deeds, which contained no reservations of any right, title or interest by appellant trust. Appellees sought to quiet title to these lands pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 65 (1981). Appellant company claimed the lands were state owned sovereignty lands subject to a lease between it and its lessor, appellant trust, entered into in 1946. The trial court granted appellees' motions for summary judgment, because under the doctrine of legal estoppel, the conveyances of the lands by the United States and the State of Florida vested fee simple title in appellees. The court found that the state's unconditional conveyance of land to appellees without reservation of public rights was a contemporaneous finding that the land was not sovereignty land. Also, the court found that the doctrine of legal estoppel barred any claim of ownership by appellant trust, since it did not reserve any rights in the deeds to appellees' predecessors.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiff sued defendant firm and broker alleging common law and federal and state securities law claims with respect to securities transactions in her account. Defendants moved to compel arbitration of all claims except the federal securities act claim. The trial court found that the claims were not arbitrable. The appellate court reversed. The court held that the agreement evidenced a transaction involving interstate commerce, was subject to the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA), 9 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1-14 (1976), and was broad enough to apply to claims against defendant broker. The fraud and punitive damage claims were arbitrable. Fla. Stat. ch. 517.241(2) (1983), exempting actions under the Florida Securities Act from arbitration, conflicted with the FAA and was unconstitutional. Defendant firm did not waive its right to arbitrate the Florida Securities Act claim.

Initially, the civil service board entered its rulings that appellees were dismissed without cause and that they be restored to their prior rank with all back pay. On review, however, the circuit court held that pursuant to the Brevard County Sheriff's Civil Service Act, 1967 Fla. Laws ch. 67-1149(17), the civil service board only had authority to award 30 days' back pay. Subsequently, in separate civil actions, the lower court awarded appellees back pay past 30 days, interest, benefits, and attorney's fees for the wrongful discharge. The court held that it was error to award appellees back pay past the 30 days provided for under ch. 67-1149(17) because a deputy sheriff holds office by appointment, rather than by employment. Thus, the court held that as officers, rather than as employees, appellees had no property interest in their office and no constitutional due process protections when they were dismissed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state sought review of the order from the county court (Florida), which dismissed the driver's license suspension proceeding for driving under the influence of alcohol against appellee driver and declared Fla. Stat. ch. 322.261(2),(3) &amp; (4) (Supp. 1982) unconstitutional under the Florida Constitution, which provided that only the state supreme court could promulgate court rules of practice and procedure.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court found that Fla. Stat. ch. 322.261(2),(3), and (4), which mandated the suspension of appellee's license when a continuance requested by appellee delayed the hearing on the suspension beyond the statutorily prescribed time, constituted an unlawful encroachment upon the judicial rule-making authority. However, the court held that ch. 322.261(4) did not attempt to deny to the trial court power to grant a continuance; it merely limited the privileges of appellee once such a continuance was sought and granted. Chapter 322.261(4) did not preclude nor require that the trial court grant a continuance. Rather, the statute imposed a 20-day limit on the amount of time which a person who has refused to take a breath test can continue a case and retain their full driving privileges. Furthermore, the court noted that the purpose of the statute was to preclude appellee from delaying the hearing indeterminably while allowing appellee, who refused to take a breathalyzer test, back on the public highways. Thus, the court found the statute constitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Lower court judgment was reversed and remanded. There was a compelling state interest in keeping public highways safe, which justified legislature in allowing suspension of appellee's driver's license for failing to take breathalyzer or blood alcohol test. The statute which limited appellee's driving privileges to 20 days if appellee sought a continuance of the suspension hearing after she refused to take a breathalyzer test was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

Appellant insurer provided workers' compensation insurance to appellant employer. As a consequence of surgery to correct claimant's injuries, he developed complications. Approximately nine years after his accident, claimant died from a cerebral hemorrhage. Although claimant's death occurred well outside of the five-year limitation placed on recovery of death benefits, appellee, claimant's widow, filed a claim, contending the applicable law, Fla. Stat. ch. 440.16(1), was unconstitutional in that it denied her due process of law. In particular, appellee alleged she was denied access to the courts because the five-year limitation of ch. 440.16(1) denied her a remedy, even though she met the causal relationship and dependency requirements for recovery. The deputy commissioner declined to enforce ch. 440.16(1) against appellee and awarded her death benefits. Consequently, appellants sought review.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants trust beneficiaries sought review of the judgment from the Circuit Court for Pinellas County (Florida) that determined that appellee trustee was to distribute trust assets to a child who was an adopted away child.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Testator created a testamentary trust which named eight beneficiaries. In the event any of the remaindermen were not living at the time of the distribution of the trust assets, his share was to pass to his issue per stirpes. When the testamentary trust was to be terminated, one of the remaindermen was survived by two children, appellants in the instant case, and by his adopted away grandson who was the son of the remainderman's deceased child. Appellee trustee filed a petition for determination of remainder beneficiaries and whether the adopted away grandson was entitled to a portion of the trust assets. The trial court determined that at the time of the creation of the testamentary trust, and at the time of the adoption of the adopted away grandson, an adopted away child inherited from his natural kindred and the adopted away grandson was entitled to a distribution. The court reversed the trial court's determination because the applicable law was the law in effect at the time of the termination of the trust which provided that an adopted away child did not inherit from his natural kindred.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant cable company was denied access to an apartment complex, owned by appellee apartment complex, when its representative responded to the requests of several tenants for cable television service.

Appellee raised the affirmative defense that ch. 83.66 and &sect; 8A-132 permitted the unconstitutional taking of property without compensation.

The court reversed the agency action finding that the rule that was allegedly violated was too vague. According to the court, the requirements of due process were not fulfilled unless the language of a penal statute was sufficiently definite to apprise those to whom it applied of the conduct it prohibited. The court held that while the test for vagueness was more lenient for an administrative rule than for a penal statute, the requirement that a person of common intelligence be properly apprised of the conduct proscribed by the rule remained intact. Because the terms medicine and vitamin was not defined in the rule, the court construed the terms according to their plain and ordinary meaning. The court found that the test was whether the substance was administered or employed as a medicine. The court held that the rule was too vague because a substance could be a medicine under one set of circumstances and non-medicine under another set.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, a workers' compensation claimant, was involved in an industrial accident. Plaintiff petitioned for a lump sum advance of his permanent and total disability benefits pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 440.20(10) (1978). Plaintiff introduced a financial plan at the hearing in support of his petition, and plaintiff requested an amount that was derived in accordance with the procedures mandated by Fla. Stat. ch. 440.20(10). The deputy commissioner ordered defendant employer/carrier to pay plaintiff a lump sum advance. The court affirmed. Subsequent amendments to the lump sum statute, which provided for a higher discount rate and which limited the amount of a lump sum that could be awarded, were substantive, not procedural, because they substantially reduced the amount of a lump sum award; thus, the amendments did not apply retroactively. Defendant also failed to present evidence to support its allegations that Fla. Stat. ch. 440.20(10), was unconstitutional or that defendant would suffer material prejudice because of the lump sum award. That the discount factor was less than investment market interest rates was not a sufficient basis on which to deny a lump sum advance payment.</SPAN></P>

The trial court found that the statute was unconstitutional as applied to respondent because he was a good bail risk and was raising a substantial point on appeal. The state's motion for certiorari was granted and the trial court's order was quashed because respondent's particular surrounding circumstances were totally immaterial.

Appellant then challenged an order denying her motion to vacate the order of involuntary placement and to schedule a hearing on the need for involuntary placement. The court affirmed because there were other remedies available to appellant that she failed to pursue by which she could have had a hearing on her need for placement. First, Fla.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner sought a writ of certiorari to overturn the decision of a circuit court acting in its appellate capacity. Petitioner argued that Fla. Stat. ch. 843.035 (1983) was unconstitutional because it violated the single subject matter requirement for legislation in the state constitution. Fla. Const. art. III, &sect; 6 required that the subject be briefly expressed in the title, and that the bill contain only matters properly connected with the subject. The court held that the title of the act in this case briefly expressed the substance and was not misleading, but that the two sections were not germane, nor properly connected to a single subject. Fla. Stat. ch. 843.035 defined the crime of obstruction by false information, and provided for a punishment. The statute also dealt with provisions changing the membership and staff of the Florida Council on Criminal Justice, altering the members' voting rights, terms of office, and adding a sunset review provision. The bill in question was not a comprehensive law or code type of statute. The court held that it failed the one subject requirement because the two matters were too independent and unrelated and granted the writ.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Writ of certiorari was granted where court held that the applicable statute violated single subject matter requirement for legislation in state constitution. The court held that the two matters were too independent and unrelated and granted the writ and certified a conflict with this decision and another district court of appeals. The court also quashed the opinion of the circuit court and reinstated the county court ruling.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged his convictions from the Circuit Court for Dade County (Florida) for conspiracy to traffic in cocaine, trafficking in cocaine, and possession of cocaine in violation of Fla. Stat. chs. 777.04, 893.135, and 893.13(1) (1981). Appellant also sought review of his sentence of twenty years imprisonment pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 893.135(1)(b)(3) (1981). Appellant alleged entrapment and unlawful electronic surveillance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Because appellant criminal offender had not paid him for some work, an informant reported to police that appellant was involved with the use and sale of cocaine and cooperated in setting up contacts with undercover agents, which included the taping of several telephone conversations and a conversation in appellant's home. Appellant was convicted of conspiracy to traffic in cocaine, trafficking in cocaine, and possession of cocaine. Because the informant did not testify at appellant's trial, the court affirmed the trial court's refusal to permit the testimony as to the informant's character and state of mind under the rules excluding hearsay. The court held that appellant had not been entrapped because the evidence showed his predisposition to commit the crimes. The court held that recording of telephone calls to appellant's home did not violate his Fla. Const. art. I &sect; 12 right to privacy and that there was neither prosecutorial misconduct nor inconsistent verdicts. Because appellee state did not file a motion to mitigate appellant's mandatory minimum sentence for assistance with the conviction of co-conspirators, appellant was not entitled to a reduced sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed appellant's convictions and sentence. The court held that appellant had not been entrapped and that his constitutional right to privacy was not violated by the taped telephone conversations. The court further held that appellant was not entitled to a reduction in the mandatory sentence for assistance with the prosecution of co-conspirators in the absence of a request by appellee state to do so.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs appealed a decision from the Circuit Court for Monroe County (Florida), which granted summary judgment in favor of defendant fund in plaintiffs' medical malpractice action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1978, plaintiff husband was hospitalized at defendant hospital. After undergoing surgery, plaintiff husband fell and struck his head. Plaintiffs, husband and wife, initiated a medical malpractice action against defendant hospital in 1980. Defendant fund was made a party to the litigation in 1982. Defendant fund moved for summary judgment, alleging that plaintiffs' action was barred by the two-year limitations period found in Fla. Stat. ch. 95.11(4)(b). The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of defendant fund. Plaintiffs alleged chapter 95.11(4)(b) was inapplicable because defendant fund's liability was solely derived from defendant hospital's negligent conduct. Plaintiffs also contended that the two-year period began to run when they discovered that defendant fund's coverage extended to defendant hospital. On appeal, the court disagreed with plaintiffs and affirmed the decision.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the decision granting summary judgment in favor of defendant fund. Plaintiffs' medical malpractice action against defendant fund was not timely. The action against defendant fund was not commenced within two-years of plaintiff husband's fall in defendant hospital.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to Fla. R. App. P. 9.100(d), petitioner publishing companies challenged an administrative order of respondent, the Circuit Court for Pasco and Pinellas Counties (Florida), which provided for the sealing of certain documents used in criminal proceedings, as contrary to the purpose of the Public Records Act, Fla. Stat. ch. 119.07(2) (1983).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent court entered a general administrative order of court procedure which provided for the sealing of public records in criminal cases, such as confessions, witness lists, and other statements, pursuant to the Public Records Act, Fla. Stat. ch. 119.07 (1983). Petitioner publishing companies filed this action under Fla. R. App. P. 9.100(d) for review of the administrative order entered by respondent and argued that it transgressed Fla. Const. art. V, &sect; 2. The court vacated respondent's administrative order and held that, although the order did not encroach upon the supreme court's rule-making authority under Fla. Const. art. V, &sect; 2, it was invalid as overbroad. Additionally, the court held that the order provided a nonselective approach that could improperly lead to the sealing of entire documents and depositions, contrary to the purpose of the Public Records Act, Fla. Stat. ch. &sect; 119.07(2)(a) (1983), which stated that only that part of the record for which an exemption is asserted should be sealed. Lastly, the court held that the order was invalid because it eliminated any procedure for an in camera inspection as mandated by Fla. Stat. ch. &sect; 119.07(2)(b) (1983).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court vacated the general administrative order of respondent court, which provided for the sealing of certain records of criminal proceedings, without prejudice to respondent reformulating an order consistent with the Public Records Act and the court's opinion. The court held that the administrative order was overbroad and encouraged results that were contrary to the purpose of the Public Records Act.</SPAN></P>
