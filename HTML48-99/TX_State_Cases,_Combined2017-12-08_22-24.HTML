</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant heirs challenged the order of the 115th Judicial District Court of Upshur County (Texas), which granted summary judgment to appellees, oil and gas lease holder and other heirs, as to appellants' claims of an interest in certain property.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant heirs sought review of an order, which granted summary judgment to appellees, oil and gas lease holder and other heirs. Appellants claimed an existing interest in the land. In 1954, a deed in the chain of title of appellees was executed and purported to transfer an interest in the property, which would have divested appellants of the property. Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 1299 (1925) (repealed 1963) required that a husband join a wife in the conveyance of her separate property and that the instrument be acknowledged by the wife privately and apart from her husband. The deed at issue did not comply with this statute. Appellees claimed that the defect in the deed was of no consequence because art. 1299 was subsequently declared unconstitutional and thereby void. The court reversed. The law in effect at the time of the transaction governed, and the trial court was not able to treat the unconstitutional statute as though it never existed. The court held that the doctrine of after-acquired title (estoppel by deed) did not apply because the deed did not convey any future interest to anyone, thus, appellants were not estopped from claiming one.</SPAN></P>

The law in effect at the time the grantor gave a deed to appellants governed the transaction and, the subsequent repeal of the applicable law did not allow the trial court to treat the unconstitutional statute as if it never existed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant taxpayers brought an action against appellee city for injunctive and declaratory relief, contesting the validity of the data used and the method by which appellee calculated the effective tax rate and the constitutionality of the state tax code. The trial court granted summary judgment for appellee. The court affirmed, holding that appellee complied with the provisions of Tex. Tax Code Ann. &sect; 26.04 (1982) in calculating the effective and adopted tax rates. The court found nothing in the record to refute the presumption that there was a valid levy and assessment of appellants' tax liability, made by a legally constituted taxing authority, and that all conditions precedent to the levy and assessment were performed. The court found appellants' claim that appellee overestimated and misrepresented the tax levy was based on hindsight. Because the actual rate of taxation was based on the estimated effective tax amounts, it was virtually impossible for the estimated rate to equal the actual rate. Appellants' constitutional claim was not properly before the court because appellants provided no argument or authority to support their claim on appeal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court convicted appellant for investing in the manufacturing of a controlled substance, amphetamine, in violation of Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 4476-15, &sect; 4.052(a)(2) (1986) and for possession of cocaine. Officers had observed appellant buying for cash, large quantities of chemicals and equipment used for drug manufacture. A search of his home revealed a laboratory. On appeal, appellee state contended that the court lacked jurisdiction because the notice of appeal was untimely pursuant to Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 44.08(b) (1986). The court disagreed, finding that appellant in his motion for new trial, alternatively gave notice of appeal in the event the motion was overruled. Even assuming the notice of appeal was premature, it was effective to confer jurisdiction on the court. Appellant contended that the evidence was insufficient to support the jury's verdict that he invested in the manufacture of amphetamine. The court held appellant violated &sect; 4.052(a)(2) even though he spent his own money in purchasing chemicals and equipment. From the evidence a jury could find he knew or believed the funds spent were intended for the manufacture of drugs.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed appellant's conviction. The court had jurisdiction because appellant in his notice for a new trial alternatively gave notice of appeal in the event the motion was overruled. The statute under which appellant was convicted for investing in drug manufacture was properly applied to him even though he had used his own funds in the purchase of chemicals and equipment.</SPAN></P>

An appraisal indicated that the amount was far above market value.

The court determined that the methods used by the appraiser were sound and that the results were legally acceptable. The court fund that appellee was entitled to attorney fees for the last year because appellee prevailed on appeal.

Appellant reached into his pocket, removed his knife, and lunged at the victim. Appellant alleged that the trial court erred by refusing to charge the jury with the lesser-included offense of involuntary manslaughter because he did not intend to kill the victim or injure him severely. The court held that appellant was not entitled to a charge on involuntary manslaughter because there was no evidence that appellant could only be guilty of involuntary manslaughter. The court held that appellant was not prejudiced by the court's charge to the jury on the law governing parole and good conduct time pursuant to Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 37.07, &sect; 4(b). Appellant alleged that the instruction violated Tex. Const. art. II, &sect; I and Tex. Const. art. IV, &sect; 2. The court held that Tex. Code Crim. Proc.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed appellant's conviction of securities fraud. The court held that the indictment was not time-barred because the earlier three-year limitation period had not expired prior to the passage of a five-year limitation amendment. The fact that appellant had filed the deed and statement with the county did not give constructive notice of the loan negating an intent to commit fraud because the doctrine of constructive notice, as applied to real property records, was inapplicable in criminal securities fraud cases. The statutory definition of fraud was not unconstitutionally vague or overbroad because the statute gave fair notice that the existence of a mortgage was a material fact which had to be disclosed. The expert witness's opinion testimony was admissible in light of the complex nature of the financial transactions. The extraneous offense evidence was admissible because the jury was entitled to know all of the relevant circumstances surrounding the charged offense, the offenses were a part of a continuing episode of conduct, and any error was harmless because the evidence did not contribute to the conviction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged his conviction from the 174th District Court of Harris County (Texas) for murder. Appellant contended that the state failed to prove the corpus delecti and therefore, his motion for an instructed verdict should have been granted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged his murder conviction, arguing that the court erred in refusing to grant his motion for an instructed verdict based on the state's failure to prove the corpus delecti. Appellant was originally charged and convicted of kidnapping the victim. Later, he was convicted of murder after her decomposed remains were found. The court noted that the corpus delecti in a murder prosecution included two elements: (1) the body of the deceased must have been found and identified; (2) the death of the deceased must have been shown to have been caused by the criminal act of another. The court noted that due to the time-gap between commission of the offense and recovery of the body, the identity of the deceased had to be proved by circumstantial evidence. The judgment was affirmed because the cumulative evidence presented by the medical examiner and the victim's son sufficiently established the identity of the deceased, and appellant confessed that he had kidnapped the victim with the intent to inflict bodily harm.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant's murder conviction was affirmed, and the court found that sufficient evidence was presented by the state to prove the corpus delecti and to connect appellant with the murder of the victim. The court found that cumulative evidence by the victim's son and the medical examiner sufficiently identified her, and appellant's testimony also could have been interpreted in support of a conviction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants challenged a decision of the 236th District Court of Tarrant County (Texas), which denied their postjudgment application for turnover under former Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 3827a, contending that the trial court erred in finding that, where the employer has agreed to pay the employee income earned in one year, in another year, the future receipts of income are exempt as current wages under Tex. Const. art. XVI &sect; 28.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants challenged a decision of the trial court which denied their postjudgment application for turnover, contending that, despite the fact that the income was earned for services performed during one year, the payment procedure between appellee and his employer called for deferred payments, together with interest in future years, therefore the income stream was not current income, and the exemptions of Tex. Const. art. XVI &sect; 28 did not apply. On appeal, the court examined the controlling state statute,&nbsp;Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 3827a, which allowed garnishment of wages, but was in conflict with the constitutional provisions, which should be liberally construed. The court resolved the conflict by applying the controlling constitutional language, rejecting appellants' argument for postjudgment turnover under the applicable property code, Tex. Prop. Code Ann. &sect; 42.001(a). The court held that current wages were not capped, and affirmed the trial court's denial of appellant's postjudgment application for turnover.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In the action below, an individual sued a physician seeking damages. The parties to the suit reached a settlement agreement and the lower court entered an agreed final judgment providing that the records of the case be sealed from public access and disclosure. Appellant newspaper sought reversal of the judgment sealing the records, arguing that the judgment abridged its rights under Tex. Const. art. 1, &sect; 8, and violated U.S. Const. amend. I. The court held that Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 8 did not provide greater rights of access to judicial records than U.S. Const. amend. I. As such, the court held that the limited right of access to criminal trials afforded by U.S. Const. amend. I did not mandate the opening of judicial records in a civil suit. Therefore, once the confidentiality order was entered by the lower court and relied on by the parties, the lower court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to unseal the records where appellant failed to show some extraordinary circumstances or compelling need for the records. The court affirmed the lower court's judgment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged his conviction, from the 228th District Court of Harris County (Texas), arguing that the jury instruction permitting consideration of the existence of parole violated the separation of powers because the issue of parole was within the purview of the Board of Pardons and Paroles.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of his conviction, contending that the jury instruction given by the lower court, authorizing the jury only to consider and discuss the existence of parole and good conduct time, effectively violated the constitutional separation of powers doctrine because parole was a matter within the jurisdiction of the Board of Pardons and Paroles. On appeal, the conviction was affirmed. In support of its ruling, the court held that the constitutionality of a statute may not be raised on appeal unless the issue was first raised in the lower court. The court further held that as there was no objection by appellant's counsel to the portion of the charge urged as a basis for appeal, the argument was waived. The court also found, however, that the jury instruction, that tracked the language of Tex. Crim. P. Code Ann. art. 37.07, &sect; 4(a) (1985), was valid as it properly reduced or eliminated the amount of misinformation about parole and good conduct time that could be disseminated during jury deliberations.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Relator wife's divorce proceeding was referred to a court-appointed master. The master entered what purported to be a judgment of divorce bearing his signature only. The clerk of the court refused to accept the judgment because it only bore the signature of the master. Relator then filed a motion to enter judgment, which was denied by respondent judge solely on the basis that the master's signature was a sufficient ministerial satisfaction of entry of judgment pursuant to Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 1918b, &sect; 4(b). On review, the court found the last sentence of &sect; 4(b) unconstitutionally ambiguous. Without the offending sentence, the other provisions consistently referred to the master's authority to recommend the judgment to be made in the case and did not express authority to enter judgment. The court held that relator was entitled to an entry of judgment by respondent as the referring judge. Confident that respondent would abide by its decision, the court stated that a writ of mandamus would issue only if respondent failed to do so.</SPAN></P>

The state filed a counterclaim, requesting that the lower court declare that the public had an easement over all land located seaward of the natural line of vegetation, and that this easement shifted with the movement of the natural line of vegetation and the mean low tide line. The lower court entered judgment in the state's favor. On appeal, the judgment was affirmed.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was tried and convicted by a jury of aggravated robbery with a deadly weapon as a repeat offender. The trial court found the enhancement allegation to be true and assessed punishment at life imprisonment. On appeal, defendant argued that the trial court erred in permitting the state, in its opening statement to the jury, to relate that a detective talked with two persons in Louisiana, and based on that conversation, issued a warrant for the arrest of defendant. The appeals court affirmed. The court ruled that the alleged &quot;hearsay by inference&quot; testimony was properly admitted. The court reasoned that the trial court limited the detective's testimony to a statement that he had a conversation and did not permit him to relate either side of the conversation. The court also ruled that since the arrest of the defendant was not a material issue unless raised by the defendant, any attempt by the state to offer evidence relevant to such issue could have been barred by proper objection by the defense as to relevance. However, because the basis of defendant's objection was hearsay, and the trial judge appropriately restricted the testimony, no error was shown.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from the 181st Judicial District Court, Potter County (Texas), which denied defendant's application for a writ of habeas corpus to bar his retrial for the offense of delivery of a controlled substance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of delivery of a controlled substance. That conviction was reversed. The state then again charged defendant with delivery of a controlled substance. Defendant sought a writ of habeas corpus, asserting that through prosecutorial misconduct, the state concealed evidence favorable to him. A witness had revealed to the state that the drugs defendant gave him had fill added. The state did not reveal this information to defendant. Defendant contended that the misconduct operated as a double jeopardy bar to retrial. The trial court denied the writ, and the court of appeals affirmed. Generally, there was no double jeopardy bar to retrial except on a finding of insufficiency of the evidence. However, prosecutorial misconduct could be a bar where the state intended to provoke the defendant into requesting a mistrial. The state did not withhold the information concerning the fill to provoke defendant. Even without the fill, the weight of the narcotic was enough to convict defendant. The court of appeals was bound by the clearly erroneous standard and could not find that the trial court's determination was in error.</SPAN></P>

Double jeopardy could bar retrial where prosecutorial misconduct provoked a defendant into requesting a mistrial. The withholding of information that a container of narcotics contained fill was motivated by a desire to convict, not provoke, defendant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was a cadet officer and ordered two cadets to perform exercises from a written list; one cadet died and when an officer telephoned defendant and asked for the list, defendant destroyed the list. Defendant was convicted of the misdemeanor offense of tampering with evidence and assessed a fine and one year probation as punishment. On appeal, defendant argued that the words &quot;investigation&quot; and &quot;privilege&quot; as contained in Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 37.09 (a)(1), (b) (1974) were so inadequately defined that fair notice was not given to defendant. The court disagreed, holding that the terms of the statute were not so vague as to make persons of common intelligence guess as to their meaning. The court held that, as the list was merely an evidentiary, non-testimonial document, the privilege of self-incrimination did not attach and that it was not improper for the trial court to refuse defendant's proposed jury charges as no evidence supported the defense of privilege and the other charge misstated the law. The court held that the trial court submitted all requested instructions on intent and, thus, affirmed the trial court's conviction.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the order of the trial court that convicted defendant of the misdemeanor offense of tampering with evidence and assessed a fine and one year probation. The court held that the terms of the statute were not so vague so as not to give defendant fair notice of the crime, the list destroyed by defendant was not covered by the privilege of self-incrimination as it was not testimonial, and the jury instructions given were proper.</SPAN></P>

Penal Code Ann. &sect; 28.03 contained a presumption that, if a gas meter had been tampered with, the person in whose name the gas supply was billed did the tampering. Appellant was convicted of criminal mischief when the trial court applied the presumption and he sought review. The court found that adequate evidence existed to justify the conclusion that the offense of criminal mischief had occurred but no evidence linked appellant himself to the offense. The court held that the statutory presumption operated only against that class of persons who received economic benefit and who were billed by the utility in their own name. The connection between the proven tampering and the name of the person to whom the bill was mailed was arbitrary, lacking a basis in common experience and unconstitutional as applied.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant convenience store owner applied to appellee Board of Adjustment for a license to sell alcoholic beverages for off-premises consumption; the store was located in an area zoned &quot;heavy commercial,&quot; and a &quot;liquor store&quot; was permitted in an area so zoned subject to special conditions. Appellee denied the variance in accordance with the city's zoning ordinance because the store was within 300 feet of a lot used for school purposes. On review, appellant argued that the city's zoning ordinance was unconstitutional because it was in conflict with Tex. Alco. Bev. Code Ann. &sect; 109.33 (Supp. 1986), which provided a means of measurement less strict than the city's ordinance. The court affirmed the trial court's decision because Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant husband sought relief through motion for rehearing to contest the jurisdiction of the County Court at Law of Wichita County (Texas), in an action which awarded a divorce between appellant and appellee wife. The county court at law had been established as a non-district court with authority over divorce cases concurrent with that of district courts pursuant to Tex. Const. art. V &sect; 1.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant husband had been divorced from appellee wife by a county court at law, which had been established as a non-district court with authority over divorce cases concurrent with that of district courts pursuant to Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art 1970-166d (1986). After his original appeal, appellant moved for reconsideration, raising for the first time that the statute which conferred divorce jurisdiction on county courts at law conflicted with Tex. Const. art. III &sect; 56, and Tex. Const. art. V &sect; 8. The court reaffirmed the divorce and noted that while Tex. Const. art. III &sect; 56, precluded the legislature from passing any local or special law granting divorce, the purpose of the provision was to ban the legislature's right to grant divorce by a special act. Because the parties were divorced by a properly authorized county court at law rather than by the legislature, there was no violation of Tex. Const. art. III &sect; 56, and the divorce was valid.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Upon reconsideration, the court again affirmed the divorce between appellant husband and appellee wife because the county court at law which issued the divorce decree had the authority to do so; the constitutional provision that precluded passage of any local or special law granting divorce did not interfere with the legislature's having conferred on the county court at law the power to grant divorces.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant mother challenged a decision of a District Court of Dallas County (Texas), which issued a take-nothing summary judgment for appellee alleged father in appellant's action to establish the paternity of her child. The trial court awarded summary judgment to appellee in appellant's original paternity action based on the statute of limitations of Tex. Fam. Code Ann. &sect; 13.01. The trial court found the second action barred by res judicata.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant mother first brought action to establish appellee alleged father's paternity of appellant's minor child, but the trial court granted summary judgment to appellee because the action was barred by the one-year statute of limitations contained in Tex. Fam. Code Ann. &sect; 13.01, as it existed at that time. Appellant did not challenge that judgment, and it became final. Later, appellant brought a second paternity action, and the trial court granted a take-nothing summary judgment to appellee on the basis that action was barred by the doctrine of res judicata. The court held that the fact that &sect; 13.01, was declared unconstitutional after the judgment in the original action had become final, did not prevent application of res judicata. Appellant acquiesced in the application of the statute by not appealing from the original judgment. The court held that the proper affirmative statute of limitations defense satisfied the requirements for the rendition of a valid and final judgment. Thus, appellant's second paternity claim was barred by the doctrine of res judicata.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the summary judgment rendered by the trial court to appellee alleged father in appellant mother's action to establish paternity of her minor child because it was barred by res judicata. The fact that the statute of limitations, which barred appellant's first paternity action was later declared unconstitutional did not make that judgment void ab initio so as to render it assailable as a void judgment in a collateral attack.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, defendant asserted the trial court erred in rendering judgment for plaintiff because the acts of defendant were protected from liability by the doctrine of governmental immunity and there was no waiver of the Texas Tort Claims Act, Tex.

The court reversed, holding that governmental immunity was not waived by defendant's city charter because the defense of governmental immunity could be waived or abolished only by a specific act of the legislature and under art. 6252-19, liability of a unit of government was limited to personal injuries or death of a person; and to property only when caused by the negligent acts of a governmental unit's employees in the operation of a motor vehicle.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, teachers association and others, filed suit against appellees, the Central Education Agency, the State Board of Education and others, seeking a declaratory judgment that Tex.

Appellants sought an injunction prohibiting appellees from implementing the testing law, which would impose certain competency testing requirements on certified school teachers and administrators. Appellants asserted that teachers' certificates were statutory contracts, which could not be impaired in violation of the contract clause, U.S. Const. art.

The trial court denied appellants' motion for summary judgment and request for injunctive relief declaring &sect; 13.047 constitutional.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant offender was arrested and convicted by a jury for compelling prostitution. Defendant asserted the trial court erred in denying defendant's motion to set aside the indictment. The court affirmed the judgment finding the indictment sufficient under Tex.

Defendant claimed the jury charge was fundamental error but the court found no objection had been leveled at trial and held reversal would only be mandated if defendant had been denied a fair and impartial trial. Defendant claimed denial of a speedy trial under Tex. Code Crim. P. Ann. art. 32A.02 (1986), ineffective assistance of counsel, and that the trial court erred in overruling defendant's objection to the relevancy of a witness' testimony. The court concluded that the trial court properly denied defendant's motion to dismiss because the state produced evidence at the hearing that it was then ready for trial, the record reflected that counsel throughout trial represented appellant in a reasonably effective manner, and that the witness testimony complained of was harmless.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment from the 262nd District Court of Harris County (Texas), which entered a conviction after a jury found defendant guilty of theft of a motor vehicle of a value over $ 750 and under $ 20,000.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was found guilty by a jury of theft of a motor vehicle of a value of over $ 750 and under $ 20,000. Defendant raised three points of error on appeal. First, defendant asserted that the trial court erred in failing to allow defense counsel to fully cross-examine the state's witnesses in violation of defendant's U.S. Const. amend. VI rights. The court held that defendant had failed to preserve the error by not making a bill of exceptions showing what the witnesses testimony would have been if defendant had been allowed to elicit their answers. Defendant's second and third points of error claimed that the trial court's jury instruction was unconstitutional because it was in violation of the separation of powers requirement and because it was vague. The court held the issues had not been raised at the trial court below and could not be urged for the first time on appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment holding that the trial court should have allowed defendant offender broad latitude in the examination of the witnesses; however, because defendant failed to perfect a bill of exception to show what the testimony would have been if defendant had been allowed to elicit answers, the there was nothing preserved in the record for review.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of a decision from the County Court at Law No. 2, Hidalgo County (Texas), which convicted him of unlawful use of a criminal instrument and assessed punishment of a $ 150 fine and 20 days in jail which was probated for 1 year. Appellant challenged the validity of Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 16.01(a)(1) (1986) and the sufficiency of the complaint and the information.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was searched after he was arrested for public intoxication and the police found a wire with a loop on the end, two screwdrivers, and a pair of pliers. Appellant stated that he had not burglarized any cars, but that he had planned to do so. The trial court denied appellant's motion to quash and appellant pled guilty. A police report that contained his admission that he intended to burglarize automobiles was offered and accepted into evidence without objection from appellant. Appellant was convicted of unlawful use of a criminal instrument. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment of the trial court. The wire with a loop at the end, found on appellant's person, was specially designed or made for use in the burglary of vehicles and appellant admitted his intent to so use the wire. Because Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 16.01 (1986) clearly applied to appellant's conduct, he could not successfully challenge it for vagueness. The court found that the complaint and information substantially tracked the language of &sect; 16.01, setting forth an offense against the state in plain and intelligible words and providing appellant with notice of the nature of the charge against him.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment convicting appellant of unlawful use of a criminal instrument finding that the statute upon which the prosecution was based was not vague because it clearly applied to appellant's conduct. The court also found that the complaint and the information substantially tracked the language of the statute upon which the charge was based providing appellant with notice of the nature of the charge against him.</SPAN></P>

Appellant had been convicted by a jury of aggravated sexual assault. The court assessed punishment at 50 years in the Texas Department of Corrections. Appellant asserted grounds that his right to counsel and his right to confrontation were violated.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of his conviction for aggravated sexual assault. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment and held that statements made by appellant to a cellmate were not the result of &quot;custodial interrogation&quot; and did not violate appellant's right to counsel. The court concluded that the entering of taped testimony of a child pursuant to Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. &sect; 38.071 did not violate appellant's right to confrontation. The court reasoned that the state could prevail over a fundamental right upon a showing that the statute was necessary to the accomplishment of a compelling state interest. The court held that the state had a legitimate interest in protecting children from the emotional harm that could be endured due to legal proceedings and repeated interrogations and that &sect; 38.071 was designed to reduce the risk of harm. The court found that it was within the trial court's discretion to admit a tape when the challenge was to its quality. The court also found that admission of a written statement did not violate appellant's right to an attorney where appellant contacted district attorney several times without the district attorney having sought a statement.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed her conviction for attempted capital murder of a police officer. Defendant requested removal of the trial counsel so that she could represent herself. The trial court granted the defendant's request. The court abated the appeal and instructed the trial court to appoint counsel to assure the effective assistance of counsel on appeal. The trial court denied defendant's counsel for self-representation, with a standby counsel, because defendant refused to unconditionally waive her right to counsel. The court affirmed, and held that defendant was not constitutionally entitled to hybrid representation or standby counsel. The court held that the trial court did not err in overruling the motion to suppress. Further, the court reviewed the record and found that the order granting defendant's motion was not violated. Finally, the court held that defendant had not shown that, but for her counsel's error, the result of the proceeding would have been different or that she was thereby denied a fair and impartial trial. The judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of aggravated robbery. On appeal, the court affirmed the conviction, holding that the fact that defendant was charged under the aggravated robbery statute rather than the theft statute did not deprive the trial court of jurisdiction to hear the case, as the theft statute was not more specific than the aggravated robbery statute. The court ruled that the means of committing the offense was more specific in the aggravated robbery statute, and that defendant was properly charged under the aggravated robbery statute. The court further held that defendant's motion to quash the indictment was properly denied because the terms &quot;uses&quot; and &quot;exhibits&quot; used in the indictment were not unconstitutional vague and in themselves gave defendant fair notice of the prohibited act. Further, the court rejected defendant's argument that the lineup identifications violated her right to counsel because defendant did not make such an objection at trial, and therefore, defendant's right to counsel argument was not preserved for review on appeal.</SPAN></P>

The trial court charged the jury that it could consider the presumption provided in Tex.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of deadly assault on a law enforcement officer. On appeal, the court concluded that the attire worn by the peace officer constituted a &quot;distinctive uniform&quot; under Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 22.03(b) so that the trial court properly charged the jury regarding the statutory presumption that defendant knew from the uniform that the person he assaulted was a peace officer. In addition, defense counsel's failure to object to the jury charge regarding the uniform served to waive any error. The court found that the evidence was sufficient, even without the application of the statutory presumption, to establish defendant's knowledge that the person he assaulted was a peace officer. Lastly, the court found that closing remarks by the prosecutor to which defendant failed to object were not so extreme as to deprive defendant of a fair trial or so prejudicial as to constitute reversible error.

The court agreed and reversed the conviction. The court disagreed with the state's contention that the Speedy Trial Act was unconstitutional because its caption failed to give fair notice of the effect of the Act as required by Tex. Const. art. III, &sect; 35. The caption could not be construed as failing to give fair notice to a reasonable reader of the subject and contents of the Act. It informed the reader that the law relating to speedy trial of criminal cases had been amended and added to. The court also rejected the contention that the Speedy Trial Act constituted an encroachment of the legislature on the authority of the courts. No authority was cited for this proposition.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant business licensee contracted with a restaurant to exhibit three video games. Appellee city's ordinance prohibited the location of coin-operated machines with 300 feet of residentially zoned property. The restaurant fell within this limitation.

Appellant sought a declaratory judgment that City of Garland, Tex., Ordinance No. 3447 conflicted with Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 8814 (Supp. 1986), and was therefore is unconstitutional.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, home owners, sought review of the judgment of the 250th District Court, Travis County (Texas), which directed a verdict for appellee, attorney general, in an action to remove appellants' house from the beach on the grounds that the property line had shifted giving the public an easement and right of access to appellants' property.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a violent hurricane, the remains of a beach house owned by appellants, home owners, were located entirely seaward of the natural line of vegetation on the beach. Appellee, attorney general, sought to enjoin appellants from repairing their house on the grounds that the public had acquired rights in the beach area where appellants' house stood. The trial court granted judgment for appellee, and the court affirmed holding that the public had acquired a right of use or an easement in the vicinity of appellants' property by custom. The court held that the doctrine of custom had been acknowledged in Texas' courts and that there was proof to support the conclusion that the public acquired an easement over appellants' property by custom. The court further held that public easements shifted with the natural movements of the beach and thus the easement now encompassed appellants' property. The court further held that the issue of the vegetation line was not an issue which could be finally adjudicated, but must always remain open to relitigation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment ordering removal of appellants, home owners', beach front home affirmed because the public had acquired a right of access and easement to the property through the shifting of the vegetation line, and the issue of the vegetation line was always open to relitigation.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the El Paso schedule set fees at three times the minimum fee authorized under Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 26.05.

The court found that the imprisonment for 30 days was punitive and, thus, a criminal proceeding. The court concluded that because indigent relator was not represented by counsel, and did not intentionally and intelligently waive his right to assistance of counsel, the trial court violated relator's U.S. Const. amend.

The court found that the support arrearages and court costs were civil contempt, but were also punitive in nature because relator did not have the ability to pay to purge the contempt.

Appellant was arrested at the scene of the exchange and convicted of bribery. Appellant sought review, and the court affirmed. The court held that there was sufficient evidence of the elements of bribery under Tex. Penal Code &sect; 36.02, that Dallas, Tex., Rev.

The court further held that although the trial court erred in failing to quash the indictment for insufficient notice of the offense, the error did not prejudice appellant, that appellant was given notice of what he would be called upon to defend against, that appellant was not entrapped as a matter of law, and that the codes were not available under the Open Records Act.</SPAN></P>

The trial court revoked defendant's probation and sentenced him to prison. Defendant appealed and alleged that the trial court erred because the probation condition was unreasonable, that the terms of his probation violated his constitutional right to travel, and that his punishment was cruel and unusual. The court affirmed and held that because the only way to achieve the essential objective of defendant's probation was to prohibit his contact with the complainant, the condition was not unreasonable or ambiguous. The revocation of probation was based solely on the finding that defendant had contacted the complainant, therefore, a ruling on any alleged violation of the travel restriction was unnecessary. Because the punishment assessed by the trial court was within the limits prescribed by Tex. Penal Code Ann &sect; 22.02(c) (Supp. 1986) for third degree felonies under Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 12.34 (1974), it was not cruel and unusual.</SPAN></P>

The trial lasted four days for which relator submitted a voucher for pay far greater than that permitted under state or county maximum fees. The trial court rejected relator's voucher, and relator sought mandamus relief alleging that unless forced service was accompanied by reasonable compensation, the appointment was involuntary servitude, prohibited by U.S. Const. amend. XIII. The court granted relator's petition to the extent that respondent was required to set a reasonable fee for relator's appointed service. All other relief sought was denied. The court found no basis for requiring an attorney to submit a voucher limited to the fees set by the state or the county district judges and to use an excessive claim as an excuse to delay setting a fee. Relator submitted a voucher, which while apparently exceeding the county fee schedule was nonetheless adequate for respondent to set a reasonable fee.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, withdrawing church members, sought review of the judgment of the District Court, Dallas County, Texas, which held that title to the church's real and personal property vested in appellees, church members who remained loyal to the parent church.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, withdrawing church members, challenged the trial court's finding that title to church property vested in appellees, remaining members loyal to the parent church. The appellate court affirmed the trial court's decision, holding that the trial court's judgment based on the deference rule did not violate U.S. Const. amend. I and amend. XIV. The court rejected appellants' argument that a U.S. Supreme Court case required that the court apply the neutral principles of law theory to determine ownership of church property; rather the states had the option of which theory to use. Under the deference rule, which was the precedent for the state, the court deferred to the parent church's identity of the loyal members as the representatives of the local church. An erroneous finding of fact and legal conclusion did not alter the trial court's judgment where the judgment was supported by other findings. The trial court's error in decreeing title in the church as a corporate entity was reformed by the appellate court to reflect the actual party.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court that decreed appellees, loyal church members, the owners of the church's property, based on the deference rule, which was held to be the controlling precedent. Under this rule, the trial court deferred to the judgment of the parent church as to the identity of the rightful owners of the property.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of a decision from the County Criminal Court at Law of Brazos County (Texas), which convicted him of the offense of driving while intoxicated under Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 67011-1. Appellant contended that the evidence was insufficient to convict him.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged his conviction of driving while intoxicated. The trial court denied appellant's motion to quash the information on the grounds that the definition of intoxication under Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 6701 1-1 was unconstitutionally vague to provide notice. The trial court also denied appellant's motion to quash the complaint and information because they were both file stamped at the same time, and the trial court denied appellant's motion to set aside the information under the Speedy Trial Act (Act), Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 32A.02, because the state failed to comply with the procedural dictates. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's judgment. The court found that appellant's actions, of stumbling out of the vehicle, the failure of two field sobriety tests, and appellant's comment to the officer that he was drunk, were sufficient evidence. The court found that appellant presented no evidence that he was not tried within the time limit established by the Act and overruled his point of error. The court found that because appellant was convicted on his physical actions, the definition of intoxication and notice were inapplicable.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's judgment which convicted appellant of the offense of driving while intoxicated because the record reflected that appellant was convicted on evidence that went directly to his impaired physical and mental faculties, and not to any specific blood alcohol level, so that appellant's argument that the statute was unconstitutionally vague in its definition of intoxication was useless.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant hospital authority challenged the order of the 153rd District Court, Tarrant County, Texas, which granted appellee taxing authorities' pleas to jurisdiction, and dismissed appellant's action seeking a declaratory judgment that its property was exempt from taxation based on Tex.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant hospital authority filed an action against appellee taxing authorities seeking a declaratory judgment that its property was exempt from taxation as a matter of law. The lower court granted appellee's pleas to jurisdiction and dismissed the action without prejudice. Appellant challenged the judgment, and the court affirmed. The court held that under Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 4437e, &sect; 16, appellant's property must have been held only for public purpose in order to be tax exempt. The court found that appellant's property was not used exclusively for the use and benefit of the public as private doctors were leasing part of the property for their own commercial enterprise. Therefore, the court ruled that, as appellant's property was not exempt as a matter of law, appellant was required to exhaust its administrative remedies before seeking judicial review. Because appellant did not exhaust administrative remedies, the lower court did not err in dismissing the claim for want of jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants commission and officials appealed from the judgment of the 201st District Court of Travis County (Texas) enjoining enforcement of Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 5221b-17(g)(5)(B) (1971), upon declaring unconstitutional the statute's exclusion of agricultural labor from unemployment compensation coverage. Plaintiffs union and workers cross-appealed an order denying, on sovereign immunity grounds, motions for attorneys' fees and costs.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to the Texas Unemployment Compensation Act, Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 5221b-17(g)(5)(B) (1971), agricultural workers were not eligible for unemployment compensation benefits. In a challenge by plaintiffs union and workers, the trial court enjoined defendants commission and officials from enforcing the exclusion upon declaring it unconstitutional. Plaintiffs' motion for attorneys' fees and court costs was denied, however, on sovereign immunity grounds. Defendants and plaintiffs appealed. Meanwhile, an amendment to the Act took effect to provide coverage for agricultural workers. In reversing and remanding with instructions to dismiss the main judgment, the court ruled that plaintiffs' claims were moot given the amendment that eliminated the exclusion complained of. In affirming the order denying plaintiffs' motion for attorneys' fees, the court ruled that the statute relied on by plaintiffs, the Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act, Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann. &sect; 37.009 (1986), did not provide a waiver of the state's immunity from monetary liability. On the other hand, costs were not subject to governmental immunity, so the denial of costs was reversed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment against defendants was reversed and the case was remanded with directions to dismiss because, pending appeal, a legislative amendment to the statute took effect to remove the agricultural labor exception, thereby mooting plaintiffs' suit. The denial of fees was affirmed because the state had not legislatively waived its immunity from liability. The denial of costs was reversed because governmental immunity did not apply to costs.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the offense of exposure of person meant exposure of those parts of the person which were commonly considered private and custom and decency required should be concealed from public sight. Thus, appellant's public exposure of her vagina was a clear violation of &sect; 1.04(2) and not unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff construction company challenged the trial court's decision directing a verdict for defendant landowner on defendant's counterclaim alleging that plaintiff had charged usurious interest on the amount plaintiff charged for a landscaping project.

While the parties were embroiled in litigation, plaintiff continued sending invoices with interest penalties attached, prompting defendant's counterclaim. On appeal, the court held that the treble penalty for usury mandated by Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 5069-1.06 (1986) did not violate the due process guarantees in U. S. Const. amends. V, XIV, or Tex. Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 13, 19. The statute promoted public policy, deterring the practice of usury by placing the cost of violation on perpetrators such as plaintiff.

Appellant superintendent denied appellees' grievances, and appellant school district denied appellees' request for review before the board of trustees.

Appellant school district's policy also did not violate Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 5154c, &sect; 6 (1971). This statute only required that public employees have access to those in a position of authority to present their grievances; it did not require that presentation of grievances be made to the board. The board was empowered to delegate its authority to appellant superintendent to remedy appellees' grievances.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the grant of summary judgment in favor of appellee school employees, dissolved the injunction, and rendered summary judgment in favor of appellant school district and appellant superintendent. Appellant school district's policy that foreclosed review by the board of trustees of adverse grievance determinations did not violate appellees' constitutional or statutory rights.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged a judgment from the 147th District Court, Travis County (Texas), where he had pled guilty and was convicted of driving while intoxicated, Tex.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant pleaded guilty to driving while intoxicated, Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 6701l-1 (1983). He brought three grounds of error: the definition of &quot;intoxication&quot; in Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 6701l-1(a)(2)(B) (1983) was impermissibly vague in violation of U.S. Const. amends. V and XIV, and Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 19; article. 6701l-1 (1983) violated due process because it was vague; and the indictment should have alleged the manner and means by which appellant &quot;operated&quot; a motor vehicle. The court affirmed. The court held that a statute may have been challenged for vagueness either on its face or as applied in a particular case. Appellant's Intoxilyzer reading was .21. Under any interpretation of the statute, he was intoxicated, as the highest reading that appellant contended would be necessary to demonstrate intoxication based on a breath test was .21. Therefore, the statute could not have been void as applied to appellant. The notice required by due process was &quot;fair notice.&quot; The statute gave adequate notice of the proscribed conduct. The allegation that appellant &quot;operated&quot; a motor vehicle was adequate to put appellant on notice of the charge against him.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed appellant's conviction for driving while intoxicated because the charging statute was not void as it was applied to appellant. The fact that appellant &quot;operated&quot; a motor vehicle was adequate notice of the charge against him. Appellant was given fair notice that his conduct, in driving after drinking, would have violated the law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The real party in interest, a candidate, filed an application to be placed on the primary ballot for the position of criminal court judge. Relator judge challenged the sufficiency of the petition, claiming it had only 247 valid signatures instead of the requisite 250. Specifically, he challenged the validity of thirteen signatures. In reviewing relator's petition for writ of mandamus, the court addressed the first three signatures challenged by relator as invalid due to an incomplete signing as to the date. The court overruled that challenge, holding that in view of all the circumstances, the signature dates could not mean anything other than January 22, 1986. In so holding, the court noted that the preceding signatures reflected a January 22, 1986 completion date, the person circulating the petition swore by affidavit to the circulation of the petition in on January 21 and 22, 1986, and the petition form showed an issuance date of 1/86. Having overruled these challenges, at least 250 valid signatures appeared on the petition and the validity of the remaining challenged signatures were not addressed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted by a jury of possession of amphetamine over 400 grams and was sentenced to 25 years confinement. On review, appellant complained generally of an illegal search and seizure, insufficient evidence to support the jury verdict, error in the jury charge, jury misconduct, and prosecutorial misconduct. The appellate court affirmed. While there was some conflicting evidence as to whether appellant invited the officers inside, such consent was not necessary in light of undisputed evidence that the officers did not conduct a physical search of the premises. The officers went inside merely to prevent evidence from being destroyed, for a short period of time, and with a good faith belief that a warrant was being obtained. No search was instigated prior to the issuance of the search warrant. The trial court did not commit reversible error in overruling appellant's motion to suppress. The evidence showed that appellant exercised care, custody, control, and management over the contraband, and that he knew the amphetamine was contraband. The court concluded that appellant was not denied a fair and impartial trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Legal survivors appealed from the trial court, which granted summary judgment to appellee hospital, appellee physician, appellee nurse, and appellee health care entity, in appellants' wrongful death action. Appellants claimed that their constitutional rights under the Equal Protection Clause, U.S. Const. amend. XIV and Tex. Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 3, 3a, were violated by the hospital because the hospital categorized patients into two different classes: those who were regular patients of the hospital's staff doctors; and, those who were not regular patients of the hospital's staff doctors. The deceased's vital signs were never taken. The court failed to see how it could be determined that the deceased was not suffering from a &quot;true emergency or life threatening situation,&quot; or &quot;a condition which was obviously a matter of life or death,&quot; without at least checking his vital signs. The court found that appellants might be able to establish that the very determination of what was a &quot;true emergency&quot; was made in such an arbitrary and capricious manner as to be unconstitutional. The hospital's plea of sovereign immunity was not enough to show that it was entitled to judgment as a matter of law.</SPAN></P>

The court further held that &sect; 21.031 was unconstitutional because it partially exempted property from taxation without any showing of sufficient contact with another jurisdiction to establish tax situs so as to require apportionment under federal law.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged his conviction for engaging in organized criminal conduct, arguing that Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art 18.20 (1986), permitting the use of wiretaps, violated his rights under Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 9. The court held that the statute was constitutional and that since the offense for which appellant was convicted was within the ambit of 18. U.S.C.S. &sect; 2516, appellant lacked standing to challenge the constitutionality of the statute as applied to other offenses. Appellant claimed error in the refusal to charge the jury that they must all agree on the same overt act. The court held that the jury could be charged disjunctively and a general verdict of guilty was proper. Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 71.01(b) on conspiracy did not require that two persons work together to commit the same act, only that two persons each perform one overt act. The admission of tapes of wiretapped conversations was proper where all copies were not sealed because only the tapes admitted into court and played were required to be sealed. State was not required to prove &quot;unlawful manufacture&quot; count alleged in the indictment where that count was not charged. The court affirmed the judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The regulations of appellant, the Texas Department of Mental Health and Mental Retardation (agency), provided that its employees could be required to take a polygraph in agency investigations of alleged employee misconduct.

The court found that the state had an important and substantial interest in the safety and order of the mental-health system and that appellant's employees had common law rights of privacy and freedom from unreasonable employment conditions. The court held that an employee could not be required to submit to a polygraph unless the agency first determined that it was reasonable in view of the intrusion, the public interest at stake, and the existence of reasonable alternatives. The determination had to be made by a neutral agency official unrelated to the investigation and after notice to the employee and an opportunity for the employee to protest.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant owners challenged the forfeiture of their vehicle, which was ordered pursuant to the Texas Controlled Substances Act, Tex. R. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 4476-15, &sect; 5.03(a) (Supp. 1986). On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment and held the statute was not unconstitutional and not violative of Tex. Const. art. III, &sect; 38 because the caption to the article gave reasonable notice of the changes contained in the amended statute. The court found there was sufficient evidence for forfeiture of the vehicle because Tex. R. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 4476-15, &sect; 5.03(a) (Supp. 1986) did not require the state to prove actual delivery. Hence, because a controlled substance existed within the confines of the moving vehicle with appellants' knowledge, the vehicle was subject to forfeiture. Also, &sect; 5.03(a) unambiguously provided for forfeiture when a vehicle was used or intended to be used to transport a controlled substance regardless of the quantity of the controlled substance and appellants' admission to the police that there was marijuana remaining in her vehicle after several sale were made evidenced the vehicle was used to transport and facilitate the sale of marijuana.</SPAN></P>

The trial court denied appellant's petition for a writ of mandamus to order appellees to perform the ministerial act of payment. On appeal, the court reversed the trial court and held payment was not constitutionally prohibited because appellant's appointment as counsel was not an interest in a contract prohibited under Tex. Const. art. III, &sect; 18, hence, payment was a ministerial act, and appellant was entitled to the fees. An attorney's representation of an indigent defendant was not a contract between the attorney and the state or county merely because of the incidental benefit of attorney's fee.

However, appellant was arrested because of it and was told he was a suspect in a murder case. Appellant was taken directly to the police station, not to a magistrate, and he confessed. The confession was introduced at the murder trial. The conviction was reversed and remanded to the trial court because the appellate court found that the warrant under which appellant was arrested was invalid because it was based on a defective complaint. It followed that the arrest based on the invalid warrant was illegal. The voluntary confession was obtained pursuant to the illegal arrest and should not have been introduced because appellee state did not meet the burden of determining that the taint of the illegal arrest was purged. There was no event or circumstance that occurred or manifested itself so significantly as to intervene to attenuate the taint of the illegal arrest.

The court affirmed defendant's conviction. In doing so, the court found that Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 42.09 did not violate U.S. Const. amend. I because the relevant terms of the offense, &quot;deface,&quot; &quot;damage, &quot; and &quot;physically mistreat&quot; were not vague, but were well understood terms, and that &sect; 42.09 was not unconstitutionally overbroad because it did not prohibit legitimate protest activities.

The court found that appellant's act of burning the flag constituted symbolic speech requiring scrutiny under U.S. Const. amend. I because appellant intended to convey a particularized message that was very likely to be understood by those who viewed it. However, infringement of defendant's constitutional rights to free speech was justified because the act of burning the flag was so inherently inflammatory that the state could have acted to prevent breaches of the public peace, and to protect the flag as a symbol of national unity.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant criminal defendant sought reversal of his conviction for aggravated robbery, alleging that although he was with co-defendant, he did not know co-defendant intended to rob the store and he did not participate in the robbery. Appellant asserted that there was no identification of co-defendant, and no evidence of ownership of the money taken in the robbery or that the victims were in fear of imminent bodily injury or death. The court affirmed the conviction, finding that identity was established when the co-defendant testified about the robbery, and that the store manager's testimony established both ownership of the money and the victims' fear of imminent bodily injury or death. The court also held that the statutes providing for criminal responsibility for aiding or soliciting another person's crime, Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 7.01(c), 7.02(a)(2) (Vernon 1974), were not unconstitutional. Further, the denial of appellant's requested jury instruction was not error, as it was not a complete instruction on the offense.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged the judgment of the 228th District Court of Harris County (Texas), which imposed conditions of probation that he must make restitution to the county and serve 30 days in the county jail after a jury had found defendant guilty of murder, had assessed his punishment at 10 years confinement, and had recommended probation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that the trial court erred in imposing conditions of probation that required restitution to the county and for defendant to serve 30 days in the county jail after a jury had recommended probation following defendant being found guilty of murder and an assessment of punishment at 10 years confinement. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment, and held that although the trial court was required to grant jury recommended probation, it was authorized to set the conditions of probation pursuant to Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 42.12, &sect; 6. The court ruled that Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 42.12 was not unconstitutionally vague and indefinite with regard to the conditions of probation imposed upon defendant, and that nothing in Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 42.12 &sect; 6(a)(8) required the county to be a victim of a crime in order for reparations to be authorized. The court also held that a fundamental error did not exist from the trial court not instructing the jury on the trial court's power to order 30 days detention in a penal institution, because it was unlikely that the jury would have reduced the amount of confinement time assessed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged his conviction for aggravated sexual assault upon a girl who was younger than 14 years of age on the grounds that the statute was unconstitutional because it did not require proof that defendant knew the victim's age and that the verdict was against the weight of the evidence. The court affirmed the conviction because Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 22-011 (1985) imposed strict liability when the victim was younger than 14 years old and, therefore, the state did not need to allege or prove that defendant knew the victim's age.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of arson under Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 28.02(a)(4) (1986). Defendant challenged the conviction, arguing that there was insufficient evidence that he had the intent to commit arson because he initially intended to commit suicide when he lit the fires, that the lesser-included offense of criminal mischief should have been included in the charge to the jury, and that he was denied his right to a speedy trial. The court affirmed the conviction, finding that although &quot;intent&quot; or &quot;purpose&quot; was not synonymous with &quot;motive,&quot; the intent to commit suicide was closely akin under the facts to a motive for a purposeful act of arson and that defendant purposefully lit the fires. Criminal mischief was also properly not included in the jury instruction because it required proof of the value of the property damaged or destroyed. The court further held that defendant was not denied his right to a speedy trial because he did not prove that he was prejudiced in any way and that all re-settings of the trial were mutual.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's arson conviction was affirmed by the court, holding that defendant had purposefully laid and set the fires, and it was his conscious desire to set the apartment on fire, even if the ultimate result he originally intended to accomplish was suicide. The court also held that it was proper for the state not to instruct the jury on the lesser offense of criminal mischief and that defendant had received a speedy trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of the judgment of the County Criminal Court No. 2 of Tarrant County (Texas), which convicted her of two charges of unlawfully practicing dentistry, where appellant contended that Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 4551a(5) (Supp. 1986) was unconstitutionally vague because the terms &quot;fit&quot; and &quot;adjust&quot; were not defined in the statute and were vague and ambiguous.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following her convictions for unlawfully practicing dentistry, appellant sought review. After the court of appeals reversed and remanded the two causes against appellant, the state sought discretionary review to the court of criminal appeals. Thereafter, the high court reversed and remanded the two causes back to the court of appeals. On remand, the court affirmed the convictions. The court addressed the issue of whether Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 4551a (5) (Supp. 1986), was unconstitutional because the terms &quot;fit&quot; and &quot;adjust&quot; were not defined in the statute and were vague and ambiguous. The court noted that for a law to be valid and enforceable it must be sufficiently definite that the law's terms and provisions could be known, understood, and applied; however, a statute would not be rendered unconstitutionally vague merely because the words or terms were not specially defined. The court found that although experts might disagree whether a certain procedure constituted &quot;fitting&quot; or &quot;adjusting,&quot; both terms were common everyday words understood by ordinary men and, therefore, when read as a whole, art. 4551a(5) was sufficiently clear as to give adequate notice.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed appellant's convictions for unlawfully practicing dentistry. The court ruled that the applicable statute was not unconstitutionally vague, because a statute was not rendered unconstitutional simply because its terms were not specially defined.

The court noted that aside from the apparent tactical aspects of defendant's failure to object, defendant had sufficient notice of the existence of a viable attack upon the constitutionality of art. 38.071, &sect; 2 at the time of his initial appeal. The court also noted that the constitutional claim was not so novel that its legal basis was not reasonably available to counsel. The court held that defendant had waived his objection to the new and obviously questionable statute by failing to object to it at trial.

The court held that respondent, alleged father of the child, failed to meet his burden to establish each necessary element of the affirmative defense of laches as a matter of law. Therefore, the court held that respondent failed to establish his right to summary judgment by establishing all of the elements of any one or more of his defenses as a matter of law. The court also held that, as a matter of law, limitations did not bar the prosecution of the lawsuit. Accordingly, the court reversed the judgment of the trial court and remanded the cause for trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant taxpayer disputed the ad valorem tax assessment made by appellee school district, and filed a protest with the Appraisal Review Board (Board). Appellant did not pay the disputed taxes, so appellee filed suit. Appellant counterclaimed, and alleged that the assessment was unfair. The trial court found for appellee and denied appellant's counterclaim because appellant had not exhausted its administrative remedies since the tax protest was unresolved. Appellant challenged the trial court's judgment, and argued that the administrative remedy was not exclusive and that appellee could not collect the disputed taxes until the protest had been resolved. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment. The court held that pursuant to Tex. Prop. Code Ann. &sect; 42.01, it was mandatory for the administrative review process to be exhausted before appellant could obtain judicial review. The court held that pursuant to Tex. Prop. Code Ann. &sect; 42.09, appellant could not raise the issues involved in its tax protest as a counterclaim to the collection suit.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested and charged with driving while intoxicated. The jury found that defendant had a blood alcohol level equal to or greater than 0.10 and convicted defendant under Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 6701l-1(a)(2) (Supp. 1985). Defendant challenged the conviction and claimed that art. 67011-1(a)(2) created an irrebuttable presumption of intoxication and that the statute was unconstitutional because notice of the new definition was not given in its caption, predetermined his guilt, shifted the burden of proof and deprived him of a fair trial and due process of law. The court affirmed defendant's conviction and found that art. 67011-1(a)(2) was not unconstitutional and did not create a presumption at all, much less an irrebuttable one, but was a separate, independent, additional way in which the crime of driving while intoxicated could be committed and that defendant's blood alcohol level was an ultimate fact that still had to be proved at trial.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of attempted murder and his punishment was assessed at life imprisonment. He sought review of the conviction. On review the court affirmed. The court held that the state's argument that the Speedy Trial Act, Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 32A (1985), violated several provisions of the Texas Constitution was improper. The court held that the statute was in compliance with the Texas Constitution because it gave fair notice of its subject matter and it did not constitute an impermissible encroachment on the functions of the judiciary. The court further held that appellant had not been denied a speedy trial, because the state exercised due diligence in proceeding to trial once it knew of his whereabouts. Further, the state was ready for trial within the 120-day time limitation that was set forth under Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 32A (1985). The court also held that the trial court did not err when it admitted evidence of appellant's prior acts of misconduct, because such evidence was admissible to show appellant's state of mind at the time of the offense.</SPAN></P>

Defendant challenged his conviction and claimed that the trial court erred in not dismissing the indictment because the police failed to videotape defendant after he was arrested as required by Tex.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After appellant was arrested for aggravated robbery and Mirandized, appellant confessed. Appellant was convicted of aggravated robbery, and appellant's punishment, enhanced by prior felonies, was set at 99 years confinement. Appellant sought review, and the court affirmed. The court found that appellant had been unable to complain of the confession's voluntariness because appellant had introduced the confession. Similarly, the court found that the confession had been admissible regardless of discrepancies in complying with the confession statute under Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 38.22, &sect; 2 (1979) because the discrepancies had not affected the correctness of Miranda warnings provided in Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 15.17 (Supp. 1985). The court also found that the statement was admissible because the trial court's dictation of findings into the record was sufficient to satisfy Tex. Code Crim. Proc.

The court affirmed, holding that the indictment properly alleged an offense under Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 4476-15, &sect; 4.03 (1976). The court held that defendant knew he would receive an eight year sentence, which was at the lower end of the sentencing range. Defendant had received numerous admonitions from the trial court. The court ruled that defendant's plea was knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily entered.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction, holding that he knowingly, voluntarily, and intelligently pleaded guilty without duress or coercion because he pleaded guilty to an offense where an eight year sentence was possible; thus, he knew he would receive an eight-year sentence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of a judgment of the 163rd District Court of Orange County, Texas, which convicted him of aggravated robbery and sentenced him to 50 years. Appellant contended that Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 12.46 was unconstitutional in its application to his case.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted by a jury of aggravated robbery and received a 50-year sentence. Appellant contended that Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 12.46, regarding the use of a conviction for enhancement purposes, was unconstitutional as applied to his case. June 7, 1979, was the effective date of &sect; 12.46. Appellant argued that because the enhancement allegation had its basis in a June 13, 1978, conviction, &sect; 12.46, as applied to him, was an ex post facto law, and that &sect; 12.46 inflicted a greater punishment than the law provided when the June 13, 1978, felony was committed. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment and the sentence, holding that on November 8, 1983, the date of the principal offense, &sect; 12.46 was fully effective and that appellant received a fair and impartial trial. The court stated that the reason that a conviction which occurred before the statute was enacted may be used for enhancement was that the statute providing for a greater penalty upon a subsequent conviction did not seek to punish the offender for the original crime a second time, but rather, the repetition of criminal conduct aggravated guilt and justified heavier penalties.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

Due to her incompetence, the court held that the admission of the child's videotaped statement violated the requirement in Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 38.071, &sect; 2(a)(8) that the child be available to testify. The court found that, excluding the videotape, scarcely any evidence remained to support the verdict and without that evidence a rational trier of fact could not have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>

Appellant had brought suit against appellees for violation of his civil rights under 42 U.S.C.S. 1983, pertaining to an arrest and incarceration on traffic offenses of which he was later acquitted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant claimant alleged that he was falsely imprisoned by appellee city and municipal court judge, when appellee clerks of the municipal court signed and filed complaints against him for failure to appear in court for traffic violations. Appellant contended in his 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 action that his arrest and incarceration resulted from his criticism of appellee city's administration and violated his constitutional right to free speech. The district court granted appellee city's motion for summary judgment and appellant challenged the order. On review, the court reversed the summary judgment in favor of appellee city because the doctrine of sovereign immunity was not an absolute bar to a &sect; 1983 action. Furthermore, the court found that the notice requirement of the Texas Tort Claims Act was not applicable, as appellant was not entitled to file suit under the act for false imprisonment. The court found that appellant's pleading was deficient, but appellee city did not assert it in its motion for summary judgment. The court affirmed summary judgment for appellees judge and clerks of the municipal court, as they had judicial immunity while acting within the course of their duties.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed summary judgment in favor of appellee city, because sovereign immunity was not an absolute bar to a civil rights action for constitutional deprivations inflicted on appellant claimant pursuant to a governmental decision, and the notice requirement of the Torts Claims Act did not apply to appellant's action. The court upheld summary judgments for appellees judge and clerks of the court, because they were judicially immune.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the legislature intended the second paragraph of &sect; 16(j) to function as an exemption to the whole Act and not to be merely applicable to the provision incorrectly placed in the Penal Code. Appellant also argued that the trial court gave an improper instruction. The court held that the issue submitted by the trial court phrased in terms of &sect;16(j) was correct and that appellant had not shown that it was harmed by the submission of issue number one since the court also gave the qualifying instruction phrased in terms of &sect;1a(1)(a).

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged his conviction for aggravated sexual abuse entered by the 183rd District Court of Harris County (Texas). Appellant alleged ten points of error, including insufficient evidence, improper denial of his challenges for cause to veniremen, improper use of videotaped testimony pursuant to Tex. Code Crim.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following appellant's conviction for aggravated sexual abuse, he challenged the trial court's decision. The court affirmed and overruled appellant's 10 points of error. First, the evidence was sufficient because an outcry witness and a physician corroborated complainant's videotaped testimony. Second, appellant failed to request additional challenges for cause after he exercised all of his peremptory challenges. Third, pursuant to Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 35.16(b)(3), the state could inquire whether a juror was biased against any phase of the law on which the state relied for conviction. Fourth, although argument of other crimes was not proper, it was cured by a charge to the jury. Fifth, pursuant to Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 38.071, &sect; 2(b), appellant's right to confrontation was not violated by introduction of videotaped testimony because he had an opportunity to cross-examine complainant and chose not to call her to the stand. Sixth, because a witness's ability to take an oath is a question of law, no jury charge on the issue was required. And finally, testimony of an outcry witness was properly admitted pursuant to Tex.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant husband sought review of a divorce judgment from the 308th District Court of Harris County (Texas), which divided certain property, including real property located in Egypt, pursuant to Texas' quasi-community property statute, Tex. Fam. Code Ann. &sect; 3.63(b) (1985); awarded attorney's fees to appellee migrant spouse; and entered sanctions against appellant.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a divorce action between two Egyptian citizens, the trial court granted the parties a divorce and divided certain property, including real property located in Egypt. On review, appellant husband contended, among other things, that the trial court erred: (1) in applying the Texas quasi-community property statute, Tex. Fam. Code Ann. &sect; 3.63(b) (1985), (2) in awarding excessive attorney's fees to the appellee, and (3) in entering sanctions against the appellant. The court found that appellant's contacts with the state, when coupled with the state's interest in protecting appellee migrant spouse, warranted the application of state law to the division of the property located within the state. Therefore, there was no error in refusing to apply Egyptian law in this case. Further, there was no abuse of discretion in entering sanctions against appellant because, by his own admission, he failed to comply with the trial court's ordered discovery request. However, the court concluded that the evidence was insufficient to support an award of attorney's fees and, therefore, remanded that issue. Accordingly, the judgment was affirmed in part, and reversed and remanded in part.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">That portion of the judgment, which awarded appellee migrant spouse attorney's fees, was reversed, severed, and remanded to the trial court for a hearing because the evidence was insufficient to support the award. However, the remainder of the judgment was affirmed because the trial court properly applied Texas' quasi-community property statute and did not abuse its discretion in its division of the property.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from the judgment of the 54th District Court of McLennan County (Texas), entered upon a jury verdict, convicting him of the murder of a security guard, following denial of his motions for discharge under the Speedy Trial Act, Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 32A.02, removal for cause of a prospective juror, and mistrial for alleged improper cross-examination of defendant by the prosecutor.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with the murder of a security guard. After it said it was ready for trial, the state moved for a continuance due to the absence of a material witness. It sought another continuance when a prosecutor chose to attend a seminar. Another delay was caused by the trial judge's vacation. Defendant's motion for discharge under the Speedy Trial Act, Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 32A.02, was denied and, during jury selection, a defense challenge for cause was overruled. After defendant testified at trial that he had never been convicted of a felony, the prosecutor cross-examined him by emphasizing that he was never &quot;convicted&quot; of a felony. Defendant's objection was sustained and the jury was instructed to disregard, but his motion for mistrial was denied. Defendant was convicted and he appealed. In affirming, the court ruled that the state met the time limitations of the Speedy Trial Act, but even if it had not, there was no violation because the Act violated Tex. Const. art. III, &sect; 35, by having an insufficient caption. Error regarding the juror challenge was not preserved and any impropriety by the prosecutor was cured by the instruction to disregard.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The murder conviction was affirmed because the record showed that the state was ready for trial within the time limitations of the Speedy Trial Act; even if the time limit were not met, the Act was invalid, in that its caption was insufficient under the state constitution; defendant failed to preserve error as to his challenge to a prospective juror; and any error from questioning by the prosecutor was cured by a jury instruction to disregard.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Applicant sought leave for an order allowing him to file a motion for rehearing in a district court of Dallas County, Texas, where his application for a writ of habeas corpus seeking to avoid extradition was denied, contending that the amendments to Tex. Crim. Proc. Code Ann. art. 44.38 constituted an ex post facto law in violation of Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 16.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's order denying applicant's writ of habeas corpus to avoid extradition was affirmed by the court, and applicant tendered his motion for rehearing to the clerk of this court for filing. The clerk initially accepted the motion but returned the motion to applicant. Applicant asserted that the refusal to allow him a motion for rehearing was an ex post facto application of Tex. Crim. Proc. Code art. 44.38, which abolished the right to a motion for rehearing in extradition appeals when the order approving extradition has been affirmed, violated Tex. Const. art 1, &sect; 16 because he was entitled to the benefit of the rules in effect at the time he commenced his appeal. The court disagreed, holding that because there was no express legislative intent to the contrary, the amendments to Tex. Crim. Proc. art. 44.38 applied from the effective date of the legislation. And since applicant right to a rehearing would have come into existence the date this court decided appellant's case, which was after the amendments' effective date, the amendments applied to applicant, were not retroactive, and did not violate the constitutional prohibition against ex post facto laws.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied the applicant's request for a writ of mandamus, holding that the subject amendments to the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure did not violate the Texas Constitution since the decision was not delivered until after the amendments' effective date, that the applicant took no action before that date that could be affected by the amendments so that the amendments applied to applicant and were not retroactive.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was stopped at a roadblock, where the officer noticed the smell of alcohol, did field sobriety tests, and arrested him for driving while intoxicated. The trial court ruled that the roadblock was legal and the evidence was therefore admissible. After being found guilty on the charge, the state moved to revoke his probation on a prior charge, using the same evidence. The trial court granted the motion. On appeal, appellant argued the evidence should have been suppressed because it was taken illegally. The court ruled that evidence obtained as a result of an illegal seizure was not admissible in the probation hearing. However, it also ruled that the roadblock was justified because the police had set up the roadblock for the sole purpose of checking driver's licenses. Thus, the roadblock was legal under Tex. Rev. Stat. Ann. art 6687b, &sect; 13 (Supp. 1985). Although the trial court failed to make findings of fact on the sole purpose for the roadblock, a different result was not compelled and the verdict was sustained.</SPAN></P>

Goods were not in interstate transit where there was an interruption in the continuity of transit.

The court found that the rationale for the duplicity rule was not offended by indictment because appellants could readily ascertain that they were charged with causing serious bodily harm to their child by failing to provide him with the food and medical care that the law required them to provide. The court also found that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in determining that the state's witness qualified as an expert. Further, the court concluded that a rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the offense of injury to a child had been proved beyond a reasonable doubt by the state. Finally, appellants' complaint with regard to the jury charge was not properly before the court because they were raised for the first time in the supplemental brief. Accordingly, the judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff restaurant sought review of a decision from the trial court, Taylor County (Texas), denying plaintiff's application for a liquor license because plaintiff's restaurant did not meet the requirements of defendant City of Abilene's zoning ordinance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff restaurant challenged the trial court's refusal to approve plaintiff's application for a license to sell alcoholic beverages at plaintiff's place of business, which was located in an area zoned &quot;heavy commercial&quot; within defendant city's boundaries. Defendant's board of adjustment had denied plaintiff's request for a variance from the requirements of Abilene, Tex., Zoning Ordinance &sect; 23-306.5.H(13)(b), which barred on-premise consumption of alcohol within 300 feet of any residential lot. The trial court affirmed. On appeal, the court held that home rule cities such as defendant had authority to regulate the sale of intoxicating beverages. Defendant's zoning ordinance was not inconsistent with Tex. Alco. Bev. Code Ann. &sect; 109.33 (1985), which limited the availability of alcoholic beverages to establishments more than 300 feet from churches, schools, and hospitals but made no mention of residential lots. The ordinance was not inconsistent with the state statute because defendant's zoning powers could not be limited by state liquor laws. The court affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's decision upholding the constitutionality of defendant city's zoning ordinance. A state law governing the serving of on-premise alcoholic beverages did not restrict defendant from promulgating a less-permissive ordinance because state liquor statutes had no effect on the zoning powers of home-rule cities such as defendant. Plaintiff restaurant's application for a zoning variance was properly denied.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, heirs of a mineral rights owner, challenged the judgment from the 31st District Court of Lipscomb County (Texas) that granted the motion of appellees, assignees of a surface rights owner, for summary judgment on appellants' action to set aside an old judgment divesting them of their rights. Appellants claimed that the failure of the original plaintiff to use due diligence to find devisee's address made service by publication invalid.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The father of appellants, his heirs, purchased the mineral rights in a tract of land after the predecessor of appellees, its assignees, waived priority of its vendor's lien in favor of the father. After the father died, the predecessor filed a trespass to try title suit against the father's unknown heirs, and obtained service by publication and a judgment that divested appellants of their mineral rights. Years later appellants sued to set aside the judgment, and the trial court granted appellees' motion for summary judgment. On appeal, the court held that because appellants produced evidence showing that the address of appellants' mother, their fathers' devisee, was easily ascertainable at the time the predecessor filed its suit, appellants raised issues of material fact on whether the predecessor had failed in its common law duty to use due diligence in attempting to find the devisee's address, and whether the predecessor's acts in failing to use due diligence or present material evidence to the trial court constituted fraud or wrongful acts that would entitled appellants to relief from judgment. Therefore, the court reversed the judgment and remanded the case for trial.</SPAN></P>

Defendant alleged that the evidence was insufficient to support a finding that he was intoxicated to a point of presenting a danger to himself and that the recent amendments to Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 28.02 were unconstitutional under Tex. Const. art. III, &sect; 35.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pled guilty to arson of a vehicle and the trial court imposed probation. Following two incidents of public intoxication, the court revoked probation and sentenced defendant to imprisonment. On appeal from a revocation of probation, the court held that the prosecution's evidence was sufficient to support a finding that defendant was intoxicated to a point of presenting a danger to himself. The court noted that he was staggering drunk and on the verge of falling and that he was vulnerable to criminal conduct. The court found it was not an abuse of discretion for the trial court to conclude that he posed an additional danger if he drove away in his vehicle while intoxicated. The court held that the amendments to Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 28.02 to include the burning of one's own vehicle in the definition of arson did not violate Tex. Const. art. III, &sect; 35, as the caption to the amending legislation gave fair notice of the change.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee licensing commission denied an application by individual appellant for an on-premises beer and wine retailer's permit on the ground that the place or manner in which appellant might conduct his business would adversely affect the general welfare, health, peace, morals, safety, and sense of decency of the people of the area, contrary to the provisions of the Tex.

The permit was denied following a hearing in which property owners living in the immediate area, church members, members of the board of a nearby public school, the mayor, chief of police, and the sheriff opposed the grant of the permit. On appeal, the court determined that the location of the proposed licensed premises was adjacent to a church where civic and social activities were held, and also to a low-income housing project as well as a school.

Appellants brought an action for declaratory judgment to set aside the sale of patent land. The trial court granted judgment against appellants. Appellants contended that appellee city could not sell the lands because they were owned by the public school fund. The court found the point to be without merit because the lands were not owned by the state when it was sold to appellee city. The court rejected appellants' arguments that the land was a public park subject to regulation as it was never designated as a park. Contrary to appellants' contention, no valid referendum was presented to the city council. The court found no violation of Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 5421c-12, which concerned notice requirements prior to the sale of political subdivision's land. The court found that the trial court correctly refused to grant leave to amend appellants' affidavits and exhibits because their request was not timely.

Penal Code Ann. &sect; 30.02 (1974). The court reversed and remanded, holding that the trial court committed reversible error in not granting appellant's motion to set aside the indictment for violation of the Texas Speedy Trial Act, Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. arts. 32A.01, 02 when the indictment was issued a year after he was charged. The court held that merely requesting the issuance of a bench warrant to procure a defendant's presence at trial within 120 days did not constitute due diligence with the meaning of Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 32A.02, &sect;&sect; 4(5), (9). The court held that there was no exceptional circumstances exception to take the case out of the Texas Speedy Trial Act because prosecutor could have verified whether the bench warrant had been issued. The court held that Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. arts. 32A.01, 02 were not unconstitutional due a defective caption because the caption to the Speedy Trial Act succinctly provided fair notice to a reasonable reader of the subject and content of the bill.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of the decision by the 107th District Court of Cameron County (Texas), which convicted him of sexual assault, indecency with a child, and injury to a child.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant pled nolo contendere to charges of sexual assault, indecency with a child, and injury to a child, all of which were contained in one indictment. The trial court assessed punishment at ten years. The appellate court reversed and remanded for reassessment of the punishment. The appellate court reasoned that sexual assault did not become an offense until after the date it was alleged that appellant committed the crime. As a result, the count of sexual assault was reversed. The court did find sufficient evidence to find that appellant penetrated the victim's vagina with his hand, and intent to arouse or gratify sexual desire was inferred from the circumstances. Likewise, intent to gratify sexual desire was inferred by appellant's conduct in touching the breasts of victim. There was no evidence in the record to support appellant's allegation that the victim was 14 years old at the time the conduct occurred. Language in the indictment that specified the instrument used to inflict injuries upon the victim, was surplus and state did not have to prove the use of that instrument. The court remanded for sentencing on the counts except for the sexual assault count.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed appellant's conviction for sexual assault because the crime was not an offense at the time it was committed. The court found that evidence supported the other convictions, but remanded for sentencing because sentencing had been imposed for all three crimes together at trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant father challenged the trial court judgment denying his cross-action petition for voluntary legitimation and managing conservatorship of his and appellee mother's biological child in the prospective adoptive parents' action to terminate appellant and appellee's parent-child relationships. The trial court appointed the child welfare unit of Wichita County Family Court Services (CWU) managing conservator of the child. The court affirmed. It was within the trial court's discretion to determine appellant's fitness to assume parental responsibility, and in light of appellee and CWU's testimony against appellant's fitness, the trial court's finding that the best interest of the child was served by denying appellant's petition was not clearly erroneous. The requirement of Tex. Fam. Code Ann. &sect; 13.21 (Vernon Supp. 1985) that appellee show that legitimation was in the child's best interest did not violate due process and equal protection because the statute's gender-based distinction substantially relates to the important state objective of promoting illegitimate children's best interests.

Appellees filed a counterclaim based on usury under Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 5069-8.01 and art. 5069-8.02 (Vernon 1983), but the jury found the usury to be the result of an unintentional and bona fide error.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant creditor sought judgment on a defaulted truck installment sales contract, and its initial and first amended pleading erroneously included unearned interest and charges, without credits. Appellees, a debtor and guarantor, filed a counterclaim based on usury under Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 5069-8.01 and art. 5069-8.02 (Vernon 1983), but the jury found the usury to be the result of an unintentional and bona fide error and the trial court followed the jury verdict and gave judgment to appellee. The court reversed judgment against appellant debtor and remanded, and held that appellee's own pleadings established usury because they were an attempt to &quot;collect&quot; interest, and that although a bona fide error was a defense to usury, it was only available by showing not only that bona fide error existed but also that the error was made notwithstanding the maintenance of procedures adopted to avoid the error. Appellee had its financial person review the pleadings for form, not content, so it had not shown the second element. Usury was not a defense for a guarantor, however, unless the guaranty agreement so provided, so the judgment against appellant guarantor was affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment against appellant borrower based on the usury defense and remanded, because appellee lender had not shown that it had and followed established procedures intended to avoid errors, so the claim of bona fide error was not available against usury, which was established by appellee's pleadings. The court affirmed judgment against appellant guarantor because usury was a personal defense of an obligor.</SPAN></P>

At the trial, appellant filed a motion to suppress a videotape interview of the complainant on grounds that the videotape had to be taken before the proceeding began under Tex. Code Crim. Proc.

The court held that the state was not required to allege that the complainant was under age 12 in the indictment. The age requirement was satisfied because the complainant testified to being 11 years old. The provisions of Tex. Code Crim. Proc.

Code Crim. Proc. art. 1.14, to waive his right to have the matter of extradition heard by a district judge. Extradition was ordered, and appellant applied to the trial court for habeas corpus relief, which was denied. On appeal, the court affirmed the denial because the governor's warrant appellant claimed could not stand on an alleged unreliable identification affidavit was not requisite to the warrant's validity. The court found that the demanding state's governor's warrant and attached documents were sufficient proof that appellant was in the demanding state on the date of the offense and overruled his point that the extradition proceeding held before a magistrate was tantamount to a trial on the merits because the hearing did not involve a ruling on any issue of law or fact, the decision on which could result in dismissal of the case.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, a dealer of secondhand personal property, bought some items from sellers; he did not obtain the information required by Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 31.03(c)(3) (1985), when he paid $ 25 or more for such property. A dealer not in compliance with &sect; 31.03(c)(3) was presumed to know that the property was stolen. Appellant was arrested for theft, found guilty, and given a probated sentence. On appeal, the court affirmed and held that &sect; 31.03(c)(3) did not deprive appellant of due process in violation of U.S. Const. amend. XIV by shifting the burden of proof from the state to appellant because the presumption did not undermine the jury's responsibilities; the jury was instructed to decide first beyond a reasonable doubt if the property was stolen then to consider all the evidence to determine if appellant knew the property was stolen. The court found that the magistrate who issued the warrant and then had accompanied the officers to the arrest scene had behaved improperly, but ruled that he was merely an observer.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In the underlying action, appellant customer sued an alarm systems installer for breach of a contract to install a burglar alarm system in appellant's place of business. The trial court entered judgment for appellant, and awarded treble damages and attorney's fees under the Deceptive Trade Practices Act. Appellant then filed an action against appellee surety, seeking to satisfy his judgment from the surety bond filed by the installer as required by Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 4413(29bb), &sect; 40(a). The trial court denied appellant's recovery on the bond, and appellant sought review. On appeal, the court affirmed and held that the bond required by &sect; 40(a) was not a performance bond, but a fidelity bond given to protect the employer or user of the services from abuses arising out of confidential information possessed by the licensee. If the bond were a performance bond, appellee's breach of contract would constitute a violation of the act for which appellee would be subject to penal sanctions.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted for two counts of sexual abuse of a child, pursuant to Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 21.10 (1974). Defendant was charged with assaulting the complainant when he was 13 years old and after his 14th birthday, and the state charged both offenses in one indictment. Defendant contended that the joinder of the two separate offenses in one indictment was improper. The court held that, because the two separate offenses did not arise out of the same episode, the joinder was improper, pursuant to Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 21.24(a) (Supp. 1985) and Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 3.01 (1974). The court reversed and remanded the second conviction. The court held that the portion of Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 21.10 (1974) that improperly discriminated according to the sex of the abused child was unconstitutional. However, the court held that defendant's statutory defense could not be predicated on the sex of the abused child. The court affirmed the first conviction of the trial court.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court reversed and entered a judgment of acquittal, holding that art. 32A.02, as part of the Speedy Trial Act (Act), was constitutional, because it met the &quot;fair notice&quot; standard. The court noted that the standard applied because the Act's caption contained the participles &quot;adding&quot; and &quot;amending&quot;, which conveyed to the readers the character and quality of the legislation. Further, the Act was an addition to the Code of Criminal Procedure rather than an amendment of any statute dealing with speedy trials.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff taxpayer was a wholesale liquor dealer and the bulk of its taxable property consisted of its inventory of liquor. Defendant county tax assessor-collector sent plaintiff a tax statement, showing an increased valuation of the property, along with the increase in taxes due, without notifying plaintiff of any hearing at which it could protest this unilateral imposition of an additional tax burden upon its property. Plaintiff sought a declaratory judgment that the increase in valuation was invalid because of defendants' failure to give plaintiff notice prior to increasing its valuations. Plaintiff also sought, and obtained a temporary restraining order enjoining defendants from increasing the valuation on plaintiff's property. The temporary restraining order was converted into a temporary injunction. At the bench trial, it was established that plaintiff's valuation was increased without prior notice having been given. Defendants appealed, and the court agreed with the trial court, concluding that the appraisal board never acquired jurisdiction of the proposed increase in value, and, therefore, its approval thereof was a void act.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee hardware corporation filed a motion for rehearing an appeal, claiming that the court erred in ignoring the trial court's factual findings, that those findings were binding on the court in its review of the constitutionality of the Blue Law, that the court should have considered only its evidence and construed all inferences in its favor, and that the court erred in reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence. The court held that where a statute's constitutionality was challenged under the due process and equal protection clauses of the state and federal constitutions, the reviewing court was required to examine all the evidence presented to demonstrate the absence of any rational relationship between the statute's means and ends. On original submission, the court reviewed all the evidence, including that admitted by judicial notice, but absent an evaluation of witness credibility, in determining that appellee failed to meet its burden. The standards of review developed to evaluate the constitutionality of economic legislation narrowly circumscribed the powers of the appellate judiciary.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee city sought and obtained a temporary injunction against appellant business based on appellant's violation of Houston, Tex., Ordinance ch. 83-1812, &sect; 28.73(B), which made it unlawful for a business with a sexual orientation to operate without first obtaining a permit from appellee. In affirming the judgment, the court found that the ordinance did not violate the U.S. Const. amend. I right to free expression guaranteed to the states by U.S. Const. XIV because it did not prohibit all such entertainment but only sought to regulate it. The court found that the standard of review was whether the trial court clearly abused its discretion in granting the injunction and that it had no authority to delve into the merits of the case. Thus the court found that appellant's claim that its business was limited to coin operated machines was not properly before it. The court also found that Tex. Rev. Civ. Code Ann. art 2372w, &sect; 3b did not prohibit the ordinance in question. The court found no error in the injunction's limitation to live performances because no evidence had been submitted to the trial court of the materials contained on appellant's coin operated machines.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant patient last received medical care from appellee podiatrist on March 1, 1982, but learned of an unauthorized procedure that appellee performed on her and his failure to perform a surgical procedure on January 3, 1983. Appellant's attorney sent a statutorily required notice of claim on March 7, 1983, but she did not file her medical malpractice cause of action until April 2, 1984. When appellee's motion for summary judgment, based on the expiration of the statute of limitations under Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 4590i, &sect;10.01 was granted, appellant sought review of the dismissal. The court affirmed the grant of summary judgment and held that the unconstitutionality of &sect; 10.01 was applicable only to medical malpractice actions where discovery of the alleged malpractice could not have been reasonably discovered until more than two years after the discovery. Because plaintiff discovered her alleged malpractice at least 13 months prior to filing the action, she had a reasonable opportunity to discover it and to commence the action within the time limits of the statute. The court, therefore, overruled her points of error and affirmed summary judgment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the summary judgment of appellant patient's medical malpractice cause of action against appellee podiatrist on statute of limitations grounds, because the action was filed after two years from the last treatment date, and the dismissal was not an unconstitutional violation of equal protection because of her inability to avail herself of any statute of repose.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant's son suffered severe injuries after diving in the shallow end of a pool. Appellant alleged several negligence claims. Additionally, appellant alleged strict liability, charging that the defective design of the pool rendered it unreasonably dangerous. Appellee contended that Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 5536a barred all of appellee's causes of action. The trial court granted summary judgment to appellee. Appellant sought review. The critical inquiry was whether appellee's role in constructing the pool was more analogous to a builder or to an owner or supplier. Appellant argued that appellee was merely a residential developer. Appellee countered that, as supervisor of the project, it was sufficiently involved in the construction process to merit the protection of the statute. The court agreed that appellee was a &quot;person performing or furnishing construction of an improvement.&quot; Thus, the statute protected appellee from suit after ten years. The court affirmed. The summary judgment evidence established as a matter of law that article 5536a barred commencement and prosecution of each of appellant's causes of action.</SPAN></P>

The indictment alleged that appellant received a bet from another person on the final result of a college football game, but then, in setting forth the transaction between appellant and that other person, the indictment alleges that appellant made a bet with that other person. Appellant filed a motion to quash based, in part, on insufficiency of notice. The court below denied the motion to quash.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, a group of individuals against abortion, filed a class action on behalf of children born following abortion attempts, unborn children, and taxpayers against appellees, a group of doctors, a private hospital, and the University of Texas, to enjoin the performance of abortion procedures in Texas, the expenditure of public funds for the procedures, declaratory relief as next friends for the classes of unborn and recently born children, and declaratory relief for the classes of Texas taxpayers. The trial court rendered summary judgment for appellees and awarded them attorney's fees. The court affirmed, holding that appellants did not have individual standing because they did not show a personal or particularized injury. Appellants also failed to provide evidence that the expenditure of public funds for abortion violated the Texas constitution or was otherwise unlawful. Because the alleged personal representatives of the class lacked personal standing, the claim on behalf of the class of Texas taxpayers also failed.

This writ of garnishment was an interlocutory order of the trial court intended to protect funds, which might have been owed to appellee garnishor as a result of a judgment against a partnership of which appellant was a partner.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee garnishor held a judgment against a partnership and applied for a writ of garnishment against a corporation asserting that the corporation was indebted to the partnership. The corporation acknowledged its debt and indicated that partnership assigned the debt to appellant individual, a partner in that partnership. The trial court denied appellant's motion to dissolve the writ of garnishment. The trial court held that appellee had a judgment against the partnership, which was outstanding, and ordered the corporation to pay into the trial court's registry all funds owed to the partnership. The court dismissed the challenge to the trial court's judgment denying appellant's motion to dissolve the writ. Garnishment proceedings were not meant to challenge the underlying judgment and the majority of appellant's motion to dissolve the garnishment related to the underlying judgment, which he was also challenging by way of a bill of review. The court held that the trial court's orders placing the funds in its registry were designed to protect the interests of the parties pending the outcome of the bill of review. These orders were interlocutory and thus not final and appealable.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged his conviction for delivery of a controlled substance on the basis that there was insufficient or no evidence adduced to support the jury verdict as it related to all of the elements of the offense charged, and insufficient or no evidence and a fatal variance between evidence adduced and the allegation as to &quot;Pentazocine.&quot; The court affirmed the judgment on the basis that although the indictment included the statement that appellant delivered a controlled substance in a quantity not less than 200 grams, the 1979 Controlled Substances Act (Act) was applicable to appellant's prosecution and it did not have a weight differential scheme. As weight was not an essential element of the offense, it was not required to be proven. Relating to the allegation as to Pentazocine, the court found that despite difficulty with the pronunciation of Pentazocine throughout the trial, the jury heard testimony from a chemist and defense counsel stated that he was not challenging what the substance was. There was sufficient evidence to support the finding that appellant delivered Pentazocine, and there was no fatal variance between the indictment and what was proven.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed appellant's conviction for delivery of a controlled substance because under the 1979 Controlled Substances Act, weight was not an essential element of the offense and the state was not required to present evidence as to the weight of the substance. The court also found sufficient evidence for the jury to find what appellant delivered was Pentazocine, and that there was no fatal variance in what was alleged and proven.</SPAN></P>

The summary judgment that plaintiff take nothing was based on the ground that her action for injuries resulting from her use of an intrauterine device manufactured by defendant was barred by limitations.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff injured party was fitted with an intrauterine device (IUD) that was manufactured by defendant manufacturer. A few months later she developed pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) caused by the IUD. Several years later plaintiff learned that defendant had been sued for its defective design of the IUD. Plaintiff 's doctor told her that her IUD was the same one that was the subject of the lawsuits. Plaintiff sued defendant alleging defective design, breach of warranty, and negligence. The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of defendant on the ground the statutes of limitations periods had expired. Plaintiff appealed, and the court affirmed. Plaintiff's actions accrued when she knew or should have known of her injury. Here, plaintiff discovered her injury at the time she was diagnosed with PID. However, she waited seven years, which was when she learned of the other lawsuits, before filing her own action. The discovery rule did not operate to toll the running of the limitations period until such time as plaintiff discovered all the elements of a cause of action. Once she learned she had been injured, the burden was on her to determine whether she should file suit.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of a judgment of the County Criminal Court at Law No. 8 of Harris County, Texas, that convicted him for selling an obscene magazine. On appeal, he argued that his conviction was unconstitutional under U.S. Const. amends. I, XIV, that the evidence was insufficient to establish that the material sold was constitutionally or factually obscene, and that there was no proof that he knew the content or character of the material.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted and sentenced for selling an obscene magazine. On appeal, he advanced several arguments. First, he contended that the statutes under which he was convicted, Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 43.21, 43.23, were unconstitutional under U.S. Const. amends. I, XIV. The court found this argument lacked merit in view of applicable case law. Appellant also maintained that the evidence was insufficient to establish that the material sold was either constitutionally or factually obscene. The court reviewed the magazine under the applicable standard and determined that it was both factually and constitutionally obscene. Finally, appellant maintained that there was no proof that he knew either the content or character of the material. The court found that significant circumstantial evidence presented by appellee indicated that that appellant may have had reason to know that the magazine contained sexually explicit material. However, the entirety of the evidence did not establish that appellant had knowledge of its contents and character.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants challenged an order of the District Court of Dallas County (Texas), finding that items taken in four seizures by police of appellants' store were drug paraphernalia, thus the trial court ordered forfeiture of the items pursuant to the state's notice of seizure and intended forfeiture under the Texas Controlled Substances Act, Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 4476-15, &sect; 5.05.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Police seized drug paraphernalia from appellants' store on four occasions. After the first seizure took place, the state filed an original notice of seizure and intended forfeiture under the Texas Controlled Substances Act, Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 4476-15, &sect; 5.05. The remaining seizures took place and the state filed notices of seizure and intended forfeiture on each. The forfeiture actions were consolidated. The trial jury found that items taken in the seizures were drug paraphernalia and the trial court ordered forfeiture of the items. Appellants argued that the proceedings regarding the first two seizures were not instituted within 10 days of the seizures as required by the 10 day time limit for filing notices of seizure and intended forfeiture that was reinstated by the criminal appellate court. The state argued that the drug paraphernalia forfeiture was a civil matter, not a criminal matter, thus, the civil appellate court was not bound by the decision of the criminal appellate court. The civil appellate court reversed and remanded the action as to the first two seizures, because they were not subject to the trial court's jurisdiction for purposes of forfeiture.</SPAN></P>

The forfeiture of certain items seized by police from appellant's store were improperly determined to be forfeited items of drug paraphernalia, because the state's notice of seizure and intended forfeiture was not filed within 10 days after the first two seizures, thus the notices of seizure and intended forfeiture were not timely filed. However, other items seized were forfeited.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants owned property that fronted a road. Appellee city decided to wide the road, so it assessed appellants and other property owners a fee per square feet for such widening.

Appellants contended the ordinance that apportioned the assessment was void. The trial court entered summary judgment in favor of appellee.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, joint account survivors, challenged the judgment from a probate court of Dallas County (Texas), which granted summary judgment to appellee executor in appellee's action to recover the non-testamentary disposition of the decedent's interest in joint bank accounts.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decedent had set up joint accounts with appellants, joint account survivors. Appellee executor filed suit, contending that the accounts were assets of the estate. The probate court granted summary judgment to appellee. One appellant had also moved for summary judgment contending that the accounts were gifts. The court of appeals affirmed except on the issue of interest. The Probate Code, in particular Tex. Prob. Code Ann. &sect; 439(a), controlled over Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 342-706 (1973). The latter section concerned itself with the right of possession, not the ownership of funds. Under &sect; 439(a), a joint account did not automatically create a survivorship agreement. There had to be a separate written agreement. The signature cards for the accounts merely identified to whom a bank should deliver possession. There was no mention of joint tenancy or a right of survivorship. Section 439(a) trumped any common law intervivos gift rights. The Probate Code provided the exclusive means of disposing of a joint account. However, the granting of prejudgment interest to appellee from the date of appellants' possession of the accounts was an error.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In appellant's conviction for sexual abuse of a child, the trial court held that a videotape recording of an interview of the complainant, a 12 year old child with a rape crisis therapist, was admitted into evidence pursuant to Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 38.071, &sect; 2, (1985). The court reversed appellant's conviction and held that article 38.071, &sect; 2 was unconstitutional because the videotape procedure denied appellant his U.S. Const. amend. VI right to confront a witness. Article 38.071, &sect; 2 did not afford appellant an opportunity for face-to-face confrontation, and the statute specifically prohibited his presence at the videotaping session. The court found that limitation of appellant's right of confrontation was not essential to advance the state's compelling interest in protecting the child because neither the record or legislative history showed that the child or sex-abuse victims were emotionally disturbed, reluctant to testify, or intimidated by the accused. The court held that the child's testimony as a rebuttal witness and appellant's cross-examination was not sufficient to preserve his constitutional right or make it harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the trial court did not err in overruling appellant's motion in limine and in admitting evidence of other offenses as they were part and parcel of the offense charged. The court held that the indictment did not fail to allege an offense under &sect; 71.01 because it did not contain a requirement that five or more persons committed the burglary. Section 71.01 only required that appellant &quot;commit&quot; the underlying offense and that he did so with intent to establish, maintain, or participate in a combination.

The deceased was shot as he lay sleeping in his bed. Neighbors found the deceased lying on the sidewalk outside his apartment. During the investigation, the police found a .44 caliber revolver in a case under the mattress in the bedroom of defendant, and the bullet found in the deceased was determined to have come from that gun. The trial court convicted defendant of involuntary manslaughter. On appeal, the court was unable to determine if defendant acted recklessly in his handling of the weapon. A thorough examination of the record led the court to conclude that the evidence was insufficient to sustain the conviction. However, the court concluded that the evidence would be sufficient to support a conviction for a lesser offense, without violating defendant's double jeopardy rights. The court remanded the cause to the trial court with instructions to conduct an independent review of all the evidence in the record and determine whether a conviction upon criminally negligent homicide should be entered. The judgment of the trial court was reversed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In disputing his conviction for engaging in organized criminal activity, appellant brought multiple points of error. The court held that evidence of appellant's offenses was properly admitted and that they were not extraneous to the crime of engaging in organized criminal activity. The court held that there was no error in overruling appellant's motion in limine, and no limiting instruction was necessary. The court found that appellant's written motion to quash was inadequate and that an oral motion raising a different ground would not cure it. The court concluded that it was not error to submit the issue of whether one of the members of the combination who helped the police was an accomplice witness as a matter of fact. The court held that the officer was acting within his capacity as an undercover law enforcement agent, and the testimony of the accomplices and agents, combined with the circumstances surrounding appellant's arrest, provided more than sufficient evidence to convict him. The court concluded that testimony regarding hearsay conspiratorial conversations was properly admitted when there was no allegation of conspiracy. The judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

Appeal was taken on three grounds. On remand from the court of criminal appeals, the court addressed appellant's remaining two points of error. Appellant's first point of error asserted that the amendments made to the pre-existing Controlled Substances Act pursuant to Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 4476-15 was unconstitutional because it was misleading and inadequate to apprise the legislature or the general public of the changes made. The court held that the pre-existing Controlled Substances Act stood as though the amendments never existed, and the constitutionality of the amendment did not invalidate the conviction. The court overruled appellant's first point of error. Next, the court held that sufficient evidence supported appellant's conviction on the basis that appellant acted as a party to the transaction for drug delivery.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant attorney sought review of the decision of the 237th District Court, Lubbock County, Texas, which held that appellee Texas State Bar had established that appellant engaged in an act of professional misconduct and suspended appellant's license to practice law for six months.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee Texas State Bar accused appellant attorney of violating Tex. Code of Prof. Resp. DR 2-101(C)(2) by advertising his services in an area of family law without a disclaimer that he was &quot;Not certified by the Texas Board of Legal Specialization.&quot; Appellee took a summary judgment and the lower court adjudged a six-month suspension as the penalty. The judgment was reversed by the court because the penalty was improperly imposed. Although the Texas Supreme Court issued Tex. Code of Prof. Resp. DR 2-101(C)(2) without its prior approval by a majority of appellee's membership, the measure was valid because the Texas constitution of 1876 vested in the supreme court inherent authority to regulate and control the practice of law. The binding effect of that inherent authority precluded discussion of appellant's argument that the disciplinary rule was an unconstitutional infringement on protected commercial speech. While appellee's summary judgment was proper based on the admissions in appellant's pleadings, it was an abuse of discretion to impose the penalty assessed without an evidentiary hearing or consideration of the factors in R. Gov. the St. Bar of Tex., art. X, &sect; 23(B) (1984).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed and remanded the summary judgment and six-month suspension against appellant attorney because, while the evidence conclusively established that the advertisement he published was an act of misconduct under the disciplinary rules of appellee Texas State Bar, it was an abuse of discretion to impose the penalty without an evidentiary hearing or consideration of the factors designed to inform disciplinary decisions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted for possession of methamphetamine, a controlled substance. The court assessed punishment, enhanced by two prior convictions, at 25 years' confinement. Defendant appealed and presented three grounds of error: insufficient evidence to prove the offense charged, an improper conviction pursuant to a void statute, and insufficient evidence to prove the two enhancement allegations. On appeal, the court affirmed defendant's conviction and sentence because it found that after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. The court further determined that where an amendment to a statute was found unconstitutional, the original statute remained in full force and effect. The court concluded that the language of defendant's indictment was sufficient to state an offense under the original controlled substances act, and that penitentiary records were proof of defendant's prior convictions.</SPAN></P>

The city sent him letters notifying him that his keeping dilapidated cars and trash on his land and allowing the land to be covered with high weeds was a violation of McKinney, Tex., Code Ordinances ch. 20, art. V, no. 1350 (1983). After a visit by a code enforcement officer, defendant removed 2 of the 16 vehicles, but took no further action. Defendant was charged with a violation of the ordinance and convicted after a trial. On appeal, defendant contended that the ordinance was unconstitutional because it was vague and overbroad. The court affirmed the judgment of the lower court, holding that defendant's failure to raise the issue of the constitutionality of the ordinance precluded his raising the issue on appeal. While the court based its holding on defendant's failure to raise the issue at trial, it went on to review the ordinance and conclude that it was neither unconstitutionally vague nor overbroad in its application to defendant.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant physician sought review of a judgment from the 41st District Court of El Paso County (Texas), entered upon a jury verdict, which found him guilty of the murder of a newborn infant in violation of Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 19.02(a)(1) (1974).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant physician sought review of a conviction under Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 19.02(a)(1) (1974), for an alleged affirmative act of murder directed against a newborn infant. The state's theory was that appellant performed an abortion by which the fetus was withdrawn alive, and that appellant then caused the death of the newborn by exercising various means of suffocation. Appellant, among other things, challenged the constitutionality of the prosecution due to the incorporation of an overboard definition of &quot;born alive.&quot; The court agreed with appellant's contention that the murder statute could not constitutionally apply to a nonviable fetus. However, appellant's criminally challenged conduct occurred after the removal of the fetus. If at that point of extraction the victim exhibited the statutory or comparable signs of life and was alive at the time of his alleged acts, he was susceptible to conviction for murder. The court concluded that the evidence was sufficient to show that the victim was alive at the time of appellant's alleged conduct. Accordingly, the judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of conviction was affirmed. Based upon the evidence of fetal development, the signs of life observed by the eyewitnesses, and the conduct of appellant physician, the jury was justified in concluding that the child was born alive and was alive until such life was intentionally and knowingly taken by the conduct of appellant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant judge challenged his conviction for official misconduct in the form of nepotism entered by the 171st District Court of El Paso County (Texas). Appellant contended that the indictment should have been quashed since it failed to negate the proviso contained in Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 5996a (Supp. 1985), and that it should have been dismissed due to bias of the convening judge in the grand jury proceeding.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following appellant judge's conviction for official misconduct in the form of nepotism, he challenged the decision. The court affirmed. First, the court held that appellant's motion to quash the indictment was properly denied because the proviso in Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 5996a was a defense, not an exception, and therefore did not need to be negated in the state's pleadings. Second, the evidence at trial did not support the defense because the uncle that appellant appointed to represent an indigent defendant was not a public defender, and appellant erroneously interpreted the base point for the two-year computation of the defense. Third, even though the convening judge in the grand jury proceedings testified as a grand jury witness, appellant's due process rights were adequately safeguarded by the ensuing deliberation of the grand jury, the rulings of the trial court and the assessment of the evidence by the trial jury. Moreover, because the stipulated evidence, coupled with the testimony of appellant and his uncle, was tantamount to a confession, the judge's testimony before the grand jury could hardly be said to have deprived appellant of due process of law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed appellant judge's conviction for official misconduct in the form of nepotism holding that the statutory proviso was a defense, not an exception, and thus did not need to be negated by the indictment. Appellant was not deprived of due process based on the testimony of the convening judge in the grand jury proceeding because adequate safeguards existed and appellant's testimony was tantamount to a confession.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, convicted of burglary of a habitation with intent to commit rape, burglary of a habitation with intent to commit theft, and aggravated rape in the lower court in Montgomery County, (Texas), alleged that the lower court committed reversible errors as to in-court identification of appellant by the victim, insufficiency of the indictment, multiple sentences could not be obtained on separate counts in one indictment, and double jeopardy.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The victim had been raped by the same man once before, and made a tentative, but not positive photo identification of appellant. Subsequently, she positively identified appellant in a lineup. Once convicted, he sought to challenge the lineup as illegal, but the appellate court held that his face could not be the suppressible fruit of an illegal lineup. Further, because count I of the indictment alleged burglary of a habitation with intent to commit rape while count II of the indictment alleged burglary of a habitation with intent to commit theft, appellant could not be sentenced on both counts. Therefore, the court ordered a judgment of acquittal on burglary of a habitation with intent to commit theft. As reformed, the judgment of the trial court was affirmed. The court vacated the burglary with intent to commit theft and aggravated rape convictions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court reformed the judgment, acquitting appellant of burglary of a habitation with intent to commit theft because the indictment was duplicitous of the burglary with intent to commit rape, and otherwise affirmed appellant's convictions. On rehearing, the court set aside and vacated the burglary with intent to commit theft and aggravated rape convictions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed a judgment convicting appellant of the offense of delivery of a simulated controlled substance proscribed in the Texas Controlled Substances Act (Act), Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 4476-15b. The court rejected appellant's contention that the statute underlying his conviction violated principles of due process and equal protection, that the evidence was insufficient to support the conviction, and that the indictment was fundamentally defective for failing to state an offense. The court held that art. 4476-15b, &sect; 3 set forth several factors in addition to all other logically relevant factors which a court could consider in determining whether a person had represented a simulated controlled substance to be a controlled substance in a manner that would lead a reasonable person to believe the substance was a controlled substance. These factors were met in appellant's case. The testimony of an officer and a chemist established that the physical appearance of the substance was substantially identical to a controlled substance, marihuana.

Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 9001, which prohibited the sale of various items on weekends. Appellee launched a constitutional attack. The trial court held in appellee's favor, concluding that art. 9001 violated U.S. Const. amend. XIV. On appeal, the court reversed the trial court's judgment and remanded for entry of a permanent injunction. Finding that appellee had failed to demonstrate the absence of any rational relationship between art. 9001 and its goals, the court held that the statute did not violate the substantive due process or equal protection clauses of U.S. Const. amend. XIV or similar provisions of the Texas Constitution. While acknowledging that art. 9001 was not without imperfection, the court held that the statute was not unconstitutionally vague or indefinite. Concluding that art. 9001 passed due process scrutiny as a valid exercise of the state's police power, the court further held that the statute's private enforcement scheme, as applied to appellee, was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant taxpayers challenged decisions of the 343rd District Court of San Particio County (Texas), which denied their motion for summary judgment and granted the motion of appellee tax assessors for summary judgment. The issues were whether appellees' summary judgment proof showed that they had complied with Tex. Tax Code Ann. &sect; 41.47(d) (1982) and whether appellants' constitutional claims barred appellees' summary judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After an administrative protest of their property tax assessments, appellant taxpayers sued in the district court. Summary judgment was granted for appellee tax assessors and denied appellants. On appeal, the court described the tax assessment administrative and judicial review procedure. Appellees' summary judgment was granted based upon appellants' alleged failure to comply with Tex. Tax Code Ann. &sect; 42.06 (1982). The court noted that Tex. Tax Code Ann. &sect; 41.47(d) (1982) required the tax appraisal review board to send appellants a notice of its issuance of the order determining the validity of their administrative protest and a copy of the order. Appellees' affidavits in support of its motion for summary judgment merely raised the inference that they had complied with &sect; 41.47(d), so their summary judgment proof was insufficient, as a matter of law, to prove that they were entitled to summary judgment under Tex. Tax Code Ann. &sect; 42.06(a) (1982). Appellants' constitutional claims had no merit, because their legal remedy lay under Tex. Tax Code Ann. chs. 41 and 42 (1982). The court overruled other points of error raised by appellants. The court reversed and remanded for trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed and remanded for trial. The tax appraisal review board was required to send a statutory notice to appellant taxpayers of its decision on their administrative protest. Appellee tax assessors' affidavits in support of its motion for summary judgment raised only an inference that notice was sent, so their summary judgment proof was insufficient. Appellants' constitutional claims had no merit, because they had a statutory remedy.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee sued appellant television station for libel arising out of a television news broadcast that alleged that appellee was engaged in a gun smuggling scheme. After a jury trial, appellee was awarded general, special, and exemplary damages. Appellant sought review. The court found an action for libel could be maintained even though appellee made an affirmative waiver of damages for injury to reputation as an element of actual damages because a false statement that charged appellee with a crime was libelous per se and the law presumed it defamed appellee and injured his reputation. The publication could be defamatory to appellee even though it did not directly reference appellee. The court found sufficient evidence to conclude the statements made in appellant's broadcast were not supported by evidence and appellee was entitled to recover actual damages for mental anguish without proof of other injury. The court found sufficient support for the jury finding that the statements were maliciously made. The award of actual and punitive damages was excessive and the court ordered remittitur because appellee's mental anguish was transitory in nature.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted for burglary of a motor vehicle. On appeal, he contended that the trial court erred when it conducted his trial in the absence of a waiver of his right to compulsory process and when it proceeded in the absence of an effective waiver of his right to trial by jury because he was not aware that the court could not consider his evidence. These grounds for appeal were based upon his reading of Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 1.15. Appellant maintained that the statute required that the trial court's judgment be based solely upon appellee's evidence--an unconstitutional end. The court deferred to applicable rules of statutory construction and determined that the text of the statute did not carry the meaning ascribed by appellant. The statute's statement that the trial court's judgment was to be based upon appellee's evidence was a holdover from the old statute. The court in turn determined that there was no requirement that the trial court be limited to consideration of only appellee's evidence in non-jury trials where the plea was not guilty. As the trial court did not in effect misconstrue the statute, the judgment of the trial court was affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the trial court was affirmed. Texas law did not require a trial court to limit its consideration of only appellee's evidence in bench trial of appellant for burglary offense.</SPAN></P>

Appellant was convicted of driving while intoxicated and sought review. The court held that the definition of intoxication in art. 67011-1(a)(2)(B) of having a blood alcohol content of 0.10 percent or greater did not give rise to a presumption of intoxication, but constituted intoxication standing alone. It was a separate, independent, additional way in which the crime of driving while intoxicated could be committed. The court also held that art. 67011-1(a)(2)(B) did not deprive appellant of due process and did not require a limiting instruction to the jury.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When appellant father and appellee mother were divorced, appellant was ordered to pay child support for their younger son until that son's eighteenth birthday and for their older, mildly-retarded son past that son's eighteenth birthday. When both sons were past age eighteen, appellant filed a request to modify the support for the older son. The trial court denied the request, and appellant sought review. The court affirmed. The court found that the son still required continuous care and supervision under Tex. Fam. Code Ann. &sect; 14.05(b) (1975) and that although he had a job, he did not earn sufficient income to be self-supporting. Considering appellant's substantial discretionary income and the son's income from a job that paid slightly more than the minimum wage, the court held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to at least reduce appellant's support payments. Weighing appellee's emotional and financial support of the son, the court found that appellant was not unconstitutionally deprived of equal protection under the law even though the son's age precluded entry of a court-ordered support obligation against appellee.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed the judgment on the breach of contract claim because appellee did not raise its contentions at the trial level and, therefore, could not raise them on appeal. The court held further that appellant's action was an action for debt which could be based on either a written or oral contract and as such was not time barred by Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, allegedly a mentally ill person, challenged a judgment from County Court at Law No. 1 of Bexar County (Texas), which committed her to a state hospital for observation and treatment for a period not to exceed ninety days, pursuant to the Texas Mental Health Code, Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 5547-50 (1985). Appellant contended that her due process rights were violated.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In disputing the evidence, appellant, allegedly a mentally ill person, challenged the constitutional requirements of due process in the mental health code. The court asserted that a careful reading indicated that the clear and convincing evidence standard, a specific legal term of art, was in the primary paragraph and that the use of the term &quot;likely&quot; was only in subordinate paragraphs. The court found no ambiguity involved in not requiring imminent harm since, as the court pointed out, there were no Texas decisions requiring imminent harm. The jury finding that appellant was dangerous to herself was sufficient to commit her involuntarily, but appellant argued that the trial court applied an overly broad standard of commitment. The court explained that even though the language of an earlier statute was broader than the current one, it incorporated a dangerousness standard that was precise enough to meet due process requirements, and it followed that the current statute was sufficiently narrow to meet due process requirements. The court opined that legislative enactments would not be found unconstitutional and invalid unless it was absolutely necessary. The judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court's judgment limiting plaintiff patient's damages to $ 827,878.00 and rendered judgment awarding plaintiff $ 200,000.00 for past pain and suffering and $ 700,000.00 for future pain and suffering. The court ordered a remittitur of $ 500,000.00 for plaintiff's past and future loss of earning capacity to $ 600,000.00. Defendant hospital stipulated liability in plaintiff's medical negligence suit for injuries he sustained during surgery. The court found the evidence sufficient to support the jury's findings regarding damages for past and future pain and suffering, and that they were not excessive because the record reflected a decline in plaintiff's health after he entered defendant hospital. The court held that the amount of damages awarded by the jury for plaintiff's past and future loss of earning capacity was excessive. The court held that Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 4590i &sect; 1.02(b) (1985) violated U.S. Const. amend. XIV and Tex.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of a judgment from the 85th District Court of Brazos County (Texas) convicting him of delivery of a simulated controlled substance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, convicted of delivery of a simulated controlled substance, sought relief. The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court to convict appellant and denied appellant's motion to quash the indictment for failing to describe the simulated substance delivered. Under Tex. Crim. Proc. Code &sect; 21.03 (1966), the state had no duty to show what the delivered substance was other than the controlled substance it purported to be. Appellant had testified that he was selling methamphetamine when the substance was really nasal decongestant. Neither was the state required to prove the substance was chemically different from the purported substance when the jury could conclude the differences logically. The court affirmed the trial court's denial of a mistrial upon admission of appellant's parole status as the issue went to appellant's past crime. Appellant's argument that the statute was unconstitutionally vague in its use of the words &quot;reasonable person&quot; was unfounded as the phrase was clarified by examples set forth in the statute. The error in the admission of pen packets containing a void judgment was not preserved for review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the conviction of appellant by the trial court because the charging indictment properly set forth the charges against appellant, gave him adequate notice, and was not unconstitutionally vague. The admission of appellant's prior parole sentence was not grounds for a mistrial as it went to the issue of a prior conviction. The error alleged in the admission of pen packets containing a void judgment was not preserved for review.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant guardian ad litem sought review of the decision of a District Court of Dallas County (Texas), which rendered judgment on a jury verdict in favor of an estate. On special issue, the jury found that a certificate of trust was delivered as a part payment of a note to the estate and not as a pledge to secure the payment of the note. Appellant contended that there was insufficient evidence to support the verdict.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Almost 100 years earlier, a certificate of a trust was issued. Appellant guardian ad litem contended that title to the certificate was vested in the assignee for the benefit of creditors of the original estate, which had been determined as owner of the certificate by a New York judicial proceeding in 1899. At trial, the trial court submitted the issue of whether the certificate was delivered as part payment of a note to the estate or as a pledge to secure the payment of the note. The jury found that the certificate was partial payment. The court determined that it was not at liberty to substitute its view for that of the jury, unless the evidence was so against the great weight and preponderance as to be manifestly unjust. The court found that, although weak, there was more than a scintilla of evidence from which the jury could have concluded that it was a partial payment. The New York judicial proceeding did not collaterally estop appellee trust company from contesting that the certificate was not a partial payment because the issues were not identical and there was no final judgment. The court found that a broad jury instruction did not cause rendition of an improper verdict.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment in favor of the estate of the original owners of the certificate as against appellant guardian ad litem, who represented those who asserted interests in the certificate as creditors of the original estate. The court found that there was more than a scintilla of evidence from which the jury could have concluded that the certificate was delivered to the estate as a partial payment of a note to the estate.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was found guilty by a jury of driving while intoxicated. Defendant appealed his conviction on the ground that he was improperly denied a right to counsel prior to making a decision as to whether to take an intoxilyzer examination. The court reversed, holding that defendant had a right to counsel prior to making a decision regarding whether to submit to the chemical test referred to in Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. arts. 6701L-1, 5. The court found the decision of whether to submit to the test was a critical pretrial stage because defendant had been taken into custody, informed of his constitutional rights, and informed that his operator's license could be suspended if he refused to take the test. Under those circumstances, counsel's absence might have derogated defendant's right to a fair trial. The court, cognizant that the passage of time would skew the test results, held that a person required to submit to a chemical test of the alcohol content of his blood, breath, or urine would have the right to consult with a lawyer of his choosing before making that decision, provided that such consultation did not unreasonably delay the administration of the test.</SPAN></P>

The trial court declared that 1982 values were to be used. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that the trial court properly determined that 1982 values were to be used. The court found it &quot;glaringly clear&quot; that the legislature mandated that the ordinance designating a reinvestment zone would necessarily be adopted in a year prior to the zone taking effect and noted that the original Act directed cities to commence collecting taxes with the first levy after the zone took effect, which was an acknowledgement of a difference between the year of designation and the year a zone took effect.</SPAN></P>

The jury assessed punishment at imprisonment for life under Tex. Pen. Code Ann. &sect; 12.42(d) (1985). Defendant contended on appeal that he did not recklessly disregard the safety of another and that the blood test results at the hospital were barred by the physician-patient privilege. Affirming the conviction, the court held that an exception to the physician-patient privilege had gone into effect for blood-alcohol test results and that defendant had recklessly disregarded the safety of others by driving while intoxicated, knowing of the risk that he could have caused the death of another by doing so.</SPAN></P>

Defendant contended that his conviction, heard by the magistrate, was void, and therefore, the subsequent revocation was also void.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant entered a plea of guilty to burglary of a building, a second degree felony, before the magistrate's court. The plea was accepted, and the punishment was set at four years' confinement, probated. Defendant made no complaint at that time about being brought before the magistrate rather than the district court. Thereafter, the state petitioned to revoke defendant's probation, and the motion was granted after a hearing before the district court. Defendant appealed the revocation of his probation on the ground that his initial conviction was void, therefore, the subsequent revocation was void. On appeal, the court affirmed defendant's revocation of probation because his initial conviction was valid, pursuant to Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 1918c, which provided for the appointment of magistrates in Dallas County by the district judges of that county, to perform the functions authorized by the act, and the district court could refer to the magistrate any criminal case. Such referral was proper pursuant to Tex. Const. Ann. art.

Appellant charged that the combined effects of the utility's tariff charges and certain of its business policies were discriminatory and anticompetitive, and requested that appellee amend the utility's tariffs and business policies, as necessary, to prevent the violations alleged. Appellee denied appellant's relief, and sued for judicial review. While the court was dissatisfied with the commission's findings, it was required to review the order solely on the grounds invoked by the agency and affirmed appellee's order.

After posting bond, he failed to appear on his court date and was eventually rearrested and tried almost one year after the original arrest date.

The trial court denied the motion and, following his sentencing, appellant sought review of his conviction, contending that the trial court erred in overruling the motion to dismiss the information. On review, the court affirmed the trial court's judgment, finding that the trial court properly excluded the period during which appellant's location was unknown and he was attempting to avoid apprehension or prosecution from calculations of the pertinent time under the Speedy Trial Act.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted by a jury of possession with intent to deliver a controlled substance, cocaine, under the Controlled Substance Act, Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 4476-15, &sect; 4.03. He challenged the constitutionality of the 1981 amendments to the Act and the admission of certain reputation evidence. The court affirmed the conviction. The indictment alleged an offense under the pre-1981 act; therefore, there was no error. The court also overruled appellant's contention that the evidence of appellant's reputation in the community was improper. Such testimony was admissible even if it was partially based upon discussion concerning the primary offense. There was no showing that it was based exclusively upon the primary offense.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Relator father was required to make periodic child support payments. The district court found relator in contempt for failing to make the child support payments that were previously ordered and placed him on probation for five years. Relator's ex-wife filed a sworn motion alleging non-compliance with the probation order and sought revocation of probation. The district court ordered a warrant issued for relator's arrest. Relator was arrested and incarcerated in jail. Relator had been in jail for eight days when he filed an application for a writ of habeas corpus. The court issued the writ and held that relator had been illegally confined. The court ordered his discharge and release from any bond liability. The court concluded that relator was not promptly brought before the district court as required by Tex. Fam. Code Ann. &sect; 14.12(d). The court ruled that a reasonable definition of &quot;promptly&quot; was 72 hours from the time an arrested probationer arrived in the county jail of the court causing the arrest, excluding weekends and holiday periods. The hearing required by &sect; 14.12(d) did not have to occur within 72 hours, but a court appearance must have been held within that time period.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was found guilty of aggravated promotion of prostitution and was placed on probation with conditions. The probation was revoked and sentence was imposed after the trial court found that appellant had violated a condition of his probation. Appellant sought review asserting that he was denied due process, that the probation condition was vague and indefinite and therefore invalid, and that the evidence was insufficient to prove the violation by a preponderance of the evidence. On review, the court examined the condition and the deferred adjudication of guilt. The court rejected the contention that probationary conditions were limited statutorily because reasonable conditions of probation were within the discretion of the court and there was no denial of due process. The court found that a condition regarding the promotion of prostitution was not vague and that sufficient notice of the type of conduct prohibited was given. The court next found that appellant was shown to have violated the condition by a preponderance of the evidence. Other procedural and substantive arguments were overruled as well. The decision was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

Appellant was convicted of violating the Controlled Substances Act (Act), Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 4476-15, and he appealed. The court affirmed. Appellant contended that he was not a practitioner as that term was defined under the Act at Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 4476-15, &sect; 1.02(24)(A). The court disagreed and held that a pharmacist fell within the definition of &quot;practitioner&quot; because a pharmacist clearly was someone licensed to distribute or dispense a controlled substance. The court also found no merit to appellant's argument that the Act was unconstitutionally vague. Appellant further argued that the state did not prove he dispensed the substances, as alleged in the indictment, but that he merely delivered them.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant pro-life activist was arrested after he entered an abortion clinic, which he was picketing. After the trial court convicted appellant of criminal trespass, appellant challenged the conviction. In affirming, the court held that the trial court did not err when it denied appellant's pre-trial motion to compel the abortion clinic to produce names, addresses, and telephone numbers of all females who were in the waiting room when appellant entered because their testimony was irrelevant. The court also held that the trial court did not err in excluding medical evidence concerning when human life began since the excluded material was irrelevant to appellant's criminal trespass charge. Moreover, the court found that the trial court did not err in denying appellant's requested jury instruction on the defense of free speech because such a charge mistakenly suggested that the jury should have interpreted the law. Finally, the trial court did not prohibit appellant's right to free speech when it required, as a condition of probation, that appellant not enter upon the premises of any establishment of which he was picketing.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant life insurance company sought review of a judgment of the 147th District Court, Travis County, Texas, which rendered judgment for appellee insurance board and its commissioner in appellant's claim alleging that the Texas Agents Qualification and License Law for Agents of Legal Reserve Life Insurance Companies, Tex.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant life insurance company filed a claim against appellee insurance board and its commissioner, challenging the constitutionality of the Texas Agents Qualification and License Law for Agents of Legal Reserve Life Insurance Companies, Tex. Ins. Code Ann. art. 21.07-1, &sect; 10. Appellant contends that the statute, which dealt with the licensing of temporary life insurance agents, violated the due process and equal protection clauses of the United States and Texas Constitutions. The trial court denied appellant's claim, finding the statute constitutional. The court affirmed, holding that the statute was not unduly vague and bore a rational relationship to legitimate state interests. The statute's limit as to the temporary licenses issued each year, the provision forbidding licensees from selling or soliciting policies in replacement of existing policies held by prospective purchasers, and the statute's classifications based on full and part-time agents furthered the legitimate state interest in assuring the competence and training of agents while simultaneously protecting the public from the ill effect of licensees' lack of training and competence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, surety on a bail bond, challenged a decision from the 289th District Court of Bexar County Trial Court (Texas), which allowed only a 50 percent remittitur of the amount of the bond after the principal was returned to custody.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the principal failed to appear in court, a bail bond was declared forfeited and a judgment nisi was signed. The principal was rearrested, and a summary judgment on the bond was rendered against appellant, surety on the bail bond. The trial court granted appellant a 50 percent remittitur of the bond. At the time of the judgment nisi, the applicable statute limited the amount of remittitur to 50 percent of the amount of the bond. Appellant argued on appeal that, because he procured the return of the principal within two years of the judgment nisi and after the effective date of the amendment mandating a remittitur of 95 percent, the trial court erred in limiting the remittitur to 50 percent. The reviewing court previously held that Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 2372p-3 &sect; 13(b), which required a 95 percent remittitur, was unconstitutional. As appellant's claim was based solely on the provisions of an unconstitutional legislative act, it was rejected and there was no need to consider whether the enacted 1981 amendment was applicable to a declaration of forfeiture and a judgment nisi entered prior to the effective date of such amendment. The trial court's judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The reviewing court held that the statute that appellant, surety on a bail bond, relied upon to support his argument that he was entitled to a 95 percent remittitur on a bail bond was unconstitutional. Therefore, appellant's claim was rejected and the judgment from the trial court granted appellant 50 percent remittitur on the bond was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Decedent suffered an insulin overdose, which caused his death. Plaintiff estate, plaintiff wife, and plaintiff adult children filed a wrongful death and survivor action against defendant pharmacy, which had mistakenly filled decedent's prescription for insulin syringes with non-insulin syringes, causing the overdose. At trial, the jury returned a verdict that awarded damages to all plaintiffs. The trial court disregarded the jury's answer that awarded damages to plaintiff wife for loss of consortium following her husband's death. On appeal, the court upheld the award of damages for pain and suffering and pecuniary loss with respect to plaintiff wife and two of plaintiff adult children. The court reversed the pecuniary loss claim of the third adult child. The court found that the trial court correctly refused to order remittitur or otherwise limit recovery. However, the court found the amount awarded for loss of consortium prior to death was excessive.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his conviction for burglary of a habitation. Defendant's first contention was that because the indictment failed to set out how consent in the cause was ineffective, it was fundamentally defective. The court held that it was well-settled that when an indictment alleged &quot;without effective consent,&quot; the defendant was given sufficient notice that consent was lacking for any of the reasons set out in Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 1.07(12). The court reiterated the rule that an indictment need not plead evidence relied on by the state, only the facts essential to give notice. Hence, the reviewing court found no merit to defendant's point of error, and overruled it. Next, defendant argued that Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 30.02 was unconstitutionally vague and ambiguous. The court held that a statute was vested with a presumption of validity, and that the presumption remained until the contrary was shown beyond a reasonable doubt. The presumption of validity was not overcome. Defendant's second point of error was also overruled, and his conviction was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was accused in three indictments for the offense of theft by receiving under Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 31.03(c)(3). Prior to trial, appellant filed applications for writs of habeas corpus in each cause; the trial court denied all applications. Appellant challenged those denials, arguing that &sect; 31.03(c)(3) created a mandatory presumption that was unconstitutional; the provision at issue stated that a person in the business of buying or selling secondhand property was presumptively guilty of theft by receiving if he possessed stolen property valued at 25 dollars or more and failed to have proper records concerning it. The court found that the elements of the offense of theft by receiving stolen property had been correctly alleged in the indictment. Furthermore, whether or not the presumption was applied and how it was applied were fact questions that could only be decided at trial. The presumption had nothing to do with the indictments by which appellant was charged; thus, constitutionality of the presumption was prematurely before the court. The court also found that &sect; 31.03(c)(3) was not unconstitutionally vague or ambiguous. The orders below were affirmed.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed and remanded, finding that the age restriction was permissible because it was a reasonable means of achieving legitimate goals, and exceptions to the restriction were a reasonable way to do so without undue hardship and required that reasonable criteria be used. Further, the court found that appellees had notice of the restriction. The court also concluded that there were genuine questions of fact as to whether the application of the restriction against appellees was discriminatory, arbitrary, or oppressive where there was conflicting and inconclusive evidence and as to whether appellees' claims of waiver, estoppel, and laches had merit.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted by a jury in a trial de novo to a charge of sleeping and dozing in a public place in violation of Dallas, Tex., Rev. Code of Civ. and Crim. Ordinances &sect; 31-13 (1960). Appellant challenged the conviction, contending that the complaint should have been quashed for failure to allege a culpable mental state, and that such defect rendered the complaint fundamentally defective. The court noted that Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 6.02(b) (1974) supplied a required mental state by providing that unless the definition of the offense plainly dispensed with any mental element, a culpable mental state was required. As the definition of sleeping in public did not plainly dispense with any culpable mental state by not mentioning any mental state at all, &sect; 6.02(b) consequently applied, and added the requirement of culpable mental state to the definition of the offense. Because a culpable mental state was thus an element of the offense of sleeping in public, the failure of the complaint to allege that element rendered it fundamentally defective. The complaint was therefore void, the judgment was reversed, and the complaint was ordered dismissed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant filed a medical malpractice action against appellee hospital, doctor, and nurses after discovering that a sponge was left inside her abdominal area during a surgery performed 13 years earlier. Appellees filed motions for summary judgment, which the trial court granted based on the two-year statute of limitations in the Medical Liability and Insurance Improvement Act (Act), Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 4590i, &sect; 10.01. Appellant argued that the court erred in ruling that her claim was barred by the Act, because she did not discover the claim until one year before filing suit. The appeals court reversed and remanded. The court reasoned that appellant had no way of discovering the negligent act within two years from the date of the medical treatment because she was asymptomatic for 13 years. Thus, the limitation was unreasonable when applied to appellant because it denied her a cause of action before she knew she was injured. The court established the rule that in situations where there was no showing that the patient knew or could have known of the negligent treatment, the limitation should not be applied.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant illegitimate child challenged an order of the 83rd District Court of Reagan County (Texas), which entered a take-nothing judgment against her in her suit against appellee administratrix to establish a share in the estate of her natural father because she did not meet the requirements of Tex. Prob. Code Ann. &sect; 42(b) (1979).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant illegitimate child was born to her natural father and mother, who were never married, and appellant was subsequently adopted by another man. After her natural father's death, appellant filed an action against appellee administratrix to establish a share in the estate of her natural father. The trial court entered a take-nothing judgment against her, and appellant challenged the judgment. On appeal, the court affirmed, finding that Tex. Prob. Code Ann. &sect; 42(b) (1979) provided the only means by which illegitimate children could share in their natural fathers' estates. The court found that appellant did not meet the requirements that she was born or conceived before or during the marriage of her mother and natural father; that she was legitimized, or that her natural father executed a statement of paternity. The court found that such denial did not violate appellant's equal protection rights because the state had a rational basis for the legislation. The court found that the evidence supported the finding that appellant's mother and natural father were never married.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the lower court, finding that appellant illegitimate child was not entitled to share in her natural father's estate because the requirements set forth in the Probate Code for illegitimate children to inherit from their fathers had not been met. The court found that such exclusion did not violate appellant's rights to equal protection because the state had a rational basis for the legislation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant pled guilty of robbery and was placed on shock probation after he served 91 days of confinement. After he violated terms of his probation it was revoked and he appealed. Appellant alleged that his conviction should have been reversed because the indictment was fundamentally defective, in that it failed to describe the property he intended to steal. The court affirmed finding that robbery was an assaultive offense rather than an offense against property, and therefore the property he intended to steal did not have to be described.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed appellant's conviction and found that the evidence was sufficient to connect him to the illegal manufacture of the controlled substance even though the legal title to the property was in his wife's name. The court held that it was not error to deny appellant's motion for a mistrial because the testimony of a police officer elicited evidence of an extraneous offenses and that he was currently under indictment, was not calculated to inflame the minds of the jury, and was cured by the instruction to disregard the testimony. The court held that the magistrate had a substantial basis for finding that probable cause existed for the search based on the totality of the circumstances presented in the 3 1/2 page affidavit. The court held that the display of guns before the jury was not reversible error because the court instructed the jury to disregard it.

Appellant did not sufficiently rebut state's claim of preparedness for trial. State's summation of argument was supported by the record. The error in the charge made to the jury was not fundamental and conviction was not permitted on proof less than required in the indictment or by statute. Appellant did not demonstrate that based on a five part test the jury's discussion of parole required reversal. As a result of these findings, the court affirmed the conviction.</SPAN></P>

After finding defendant guilty, the trial judge assessed punishment at seven years confinement, in accordance with the plea bargain agreement. The court affirmed the judgment of conviction because defendant waived his motions for severance, discovery, and suppression prior to entering his plea by failing to present them to the trial judge for a ruling. The court stated that defendant's motions were never presented to the trial court, but were apparently abandoned. The court also stated that it was true that the trial judge, in giving the admonishment required by Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 26.13(a)(3) (1984), did tell defendant that he could have appealed for motions previously filed. However, the mere filing of a motion was insufficient to raise a matter on appeal, unless the motion was ruled upon.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant governmental lawyer challenged an order from the District Court of Travis County, 147th Judicial District (Texas) that denied appellant's pretrial petition for writ of habeas corpus in which appellant contended that he was unlawfully restrained pursuant to indictments that alleged commercial bribery under Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 32.43(3) (1974).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant governmental lawyer solicited an attorney representing a private corporation to breach the attorney's fiduciary duty to that attorney's client. Appellant was indicted for commercial bribery under Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 32.43(3) (1974). The denial of appellant's pretrial petition for habeas corpus relief was affirmed because, as a general rule, when there was a valid penal statute under which a prosecution could be brought, habeas corpus was not available to test the sufficiency of the charging instrument prior to trial. Further, appellant's claim was not within the narrow exception to that rule which permitted pretrial habeas corpus to challenge the legal authority of state to prosecute. The court rejected claims that Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 32.43(c), and the definitions of fiduciary and beneficiary contained in Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 32.43(a) were unconstitutionally vague because it must be proved that appellant acted with the requisite culpable mental state, which mitigated any vagueness especially when the statute provided adequate notice of the proscribed conduct. Also, the reasonableness requirement within the definition of benefit narrowed the scope of &sect; 32.43(c).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the order that denied appellant governmental lawyer's pretrial petition for habeas corpus relief because a habeas corpus proceeding could not be used to challenge the sufficiency of the charging instrument before trial. Also, the statute that criminalized commercial bribery was not vague because its required proof of scienter and provided adequate notice that the conduct was proscribed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court convicted appellant of aggravated kidnapping. The court overruled a motion for rehearing on appeal. The court reasoned that although the kidnapping statutes did not define the term terrorize, Tex.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, city and city engineer, sought review of an order of the 157th Judicial District Court of Harris County (Texas), which granted summary judgment for appellee sign company, declaring a portion of a city sign ordinance unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, city and city engineer, refused to allow appellee sign company to repair six hurricane-damaged billboards, which were erected prior to the passage of appellants' sign ordinance; and appellee filed suit. The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of appellee, finding pertinent portions of the ordinance unconstitutionally vague and void. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that the ordinance was violative of due process and fatally vague because the portion of the ordinance appellants relied on to refuse repairs to a sign that a substantial part thereof had been blown down or destroyed did not set out a definition of &quot;substantial parts&quot; or an objective standard by which damage to &quot;substantial parts thereof&quot; could be measured; therefore, the terms of the regulation were so vague, indefinite, and uncertain that men of common intelligence must guess at their meaning.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the grant of summary judgment in favor of appellee sign company because persons of common intelligence were left to guess at the meaning of the portion of the city sign ordinance in question; thus, that portion was unconstitutionally vague and unenforceable by appellants, city and city engineer.</SPAN></P>
