<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The city directly annexed certain acreage in the town. The court affirmed the trial court's decision sustaining the annexation and dismissing the complaint. Direct annexation was authorized by Wis. Stat. &sect; 66.021(2)(a). When announcing its findings of fact, the trial court applied the &quot;rule of reason.&quot; Three parts of the rule of reason were: (1) exclusions and irregularities in boundary lines could not be the result of arbitrariness; (2) some reasonable present or demonstrable future need for the annexed property had to be shown; and (3) no other factors could exist which would constitute an abuse of discretion on the part of the municipality. The city had two purposes in annexing the land: first, to acquire undeveloped property which could be used for single family residences; second, since its municipal wells were adjacent to the annexed area, to protect its groundwater from future contamination. The city demonstrated a reasonable need for present and future development. A city could annex to expand its residential areas. Also, extension of municipal services to substantial numbers of residents in the annexed territory was a factor to be taken into account.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant pleaded guilty in the Circuit Court for Milwaukee County (Wisconsin) to party to the crime of criminal trespass to dwelling, and party to the crime of criminal damage to property. He was subject to sentence enhancement for committing the misdemeanors while armed, in violation of Wis. Stat. &sect; 939.63(1)(a), and to the habitual criminal statute,&nbsp;&sect; 939.62. He appealed the order denying his motion to withdraw his guilty plea.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued that his guilty plea was unconstitutional and that the trial court did not properly sentence him. The court affirmed and held that the sentencing court did exactly as Wis. Stat. &sect; 971.08(1)(b) required. The trial court explained why it sentenced defendant as it did and defendant was affirmatively advised by the trial court that the total misdemeanor sentence depended on how the trial court ruled on the habitual criminality statute. Further, the court held that the record showed that, before the court accepted the guilty plea and sentenced defendant, he understood the happenings and the court's reasoning. The court also held that the penalty enhancer statutes were applied properly and the misdemeanor crimes remained misdemeanors even if the maximum penalty was increased because defendant was armed while committing the crime. The court notes that the added fact of being armed while committing a misdemeanor was not only a necessary condition for sentence enhancement but was also an element of the crime charged. Further, the court held that the plain language of the repeater statute did not divide its application into misdemeanors and felonies.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff widow appealed two orders that were consolidated for appeal from the circuit court for St. Croix County (Wisconsin), which entered judgments in favor of defendants, a fire association (GFA) and a fire department (GVFD), in two wrongful death actions brought by the widow to recover for the death of her husband, caused by a collision between the husband's motorcycle and a municipally-owned vehicle driven by an association employee.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The widow brought the first lawsuit against the GFA and its insurer. That suit resulted in a payment of $ 250,000 to the widow by the GFA to satisfy the limit of liability imposed on the GFA pursuant to Wis. Stat. &sect; 345.05(3). The widow challenged the constitutionality of the cap on liability. The trial court rejected the widow's arguments and found the limit to be constitutional. The trial court also denied the widow's motion to recover a second $ 250,000 limit from the GVFD, ruling that the GFA and the GVFD constituted only one agency, and, therefore, limited the widow to a single $ 250,000 limit under Wis. Stat. &sect; 893.80(3). The widow initiated a second lawsuit against the GVFD, which was dismissed. The widow appealed the judgments, and they were consolidated. The court affirmed and held that the statutory limit on damages was not constitutionally infirm, that the mere continuation of an insurance policy in excess of the statutory limit of liability did not constitute a waiver of the right to rely on the statutory limit and that the GVFD was merely a subdivision of the GFA, and, therefore, the widow was entitled to only one recovery under &sect; 893.80(3).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the capped judgment in favor of the widow and against the GFD and affirmed the dismissal of the widow's action against the GVFD.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The credit unions were members of the corporation, which was a state created deposit insurer that went into liquidation, and sought to participate along with other member credit unions in the corporation's mandated distribution of assets to members operating under Wis. Stat. ch. 186. The credit unions filed a complaint seeking a declaratory judgment that they were entitled to participate in the distribution under Wis. Stat. &sect; 186.35(11) or, in the alternative, for a declaratory judgment ruling that the statute was unconstitutional in precluding them from participating on an equal basis with other members of the corporation. The trial court granted the corporation's motion for summary judgment and the credit unions appealed. The court reversed the judgment, holding that the credit unions were members but not operating under ch. 186. The court concluded that the corporation offered no reasonable rationale for the distinction between members operating under the statute and members not so operating, and as a result, the credit unions were entitled to participate and to a declaratory judgment that &sect; 186.35(11) denied them equal protection of the laws.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed his conviction by the Circuit Court for Marathon County (Wisconsin) on four felony counts of failing to pay child support for the calendar years 1986 through 1989 pursuant to Wis. Stat. &sect; 940.27(2) (1987), and a post-conviction order upholding his conviction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court accepted defendant's pleas of no contest, found him guilty and sentenced him to four consecutive two-year terms of imprisonment and ordered restitution. Defendant's post-conviction motion challenged the conviction and restitution order on the grounds, inter alia, multiplicity. Defendant argued that Wis. Stat. &sect; 940.27(2) (1987) contemplated only a single non-support charge for a violation of its terms, and the State could not prosecute multiple counts under &sect; 940.27(2). The court affirmed, holding, inter alia, that multiple charging under the felony non-support statute met the requirement of the &quot;additional fact&quot; test, which examined whether each count required proof of an additional fact which the other count or counts did not. The State was required to prove that defendant formed a separate intent to violate the order that formed the basis for each individual charge, as well as a different 120-day time frame. Further, the court held that the legislature intended to allow for multiple prosecutions under the nonsupport statute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The property owner remodeled his commercial property into a pub and restaurant. The village assessed additional residential equivalent units (REU) and increased the owner's contributions to the cost of the sewage system.

However, the trial court set aside that portion of the ordinance that permitted the village to assess interest on the additional REU's calculated from the date of the enactment of the ordinance to the date of the assessment. On appeal, the owner argued that the ordinance under which the assessment was made was inapplicable to him and that the ordinance was unconstitutional. The court rejected these arguments and affirmed the assessment. The court held that the owner benefitted from the improved sewer system and the assessment was reasonable. The court also concluded that the trial court properly determined that the interest provision of the ordinance was unreasonable under Wis. Stat. &sect; 66.60(1)(b).

The central issue on appeal involved the interpretation of &sect; 767.329. The court concluded that &sect; 767.329 did not mandate court approval of a stipulated post-judgment custody transfer without examining the best interests of the child. The court reversed and remanded for further proceedings. The court reasoned that the consequences would be absurd if &sect; 767.329 were read to prohibit an examination of the best interests of the child.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court remanded the cause to the trial court to address the commissioner's motion to intervene and the commissioner's challenge as to whether the parents' stipulation served the best interests of the child.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The county sued the property owner for violating an ordinance restricting the height of fences to four feet. The property owner took the fence down and cut two feet off the six foot boards. He then built a berm on the original fence line and put the fence back. The total height from the street level to the top of the fence boards was over four feet. The county continued to object. The circuit court ordered the property owner to remove the fence or pay the county for its removal. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that the ordinance was not unconstitutionally overbroad or vague. The court held that the word fence was to be defined as a nontechnical word and given its ordinary and accepted meaning. The reasonable person was on notice that the standard for measuring structures, such as a fence, is found under &quot;building height,&quot; determined by measuring from the mean elevation of the finished lot grade along the street yard face of the structure. Therefore, the ordinance was neither unconstitutionally vague or overbroad because it prohibited enclosures from exceeding the building height.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellants, previous store owners and new store owners (retailers), challenged an order of the Circuit Court for Milwaukee County (Wisconsin), which granted summary judgment to respondent City of Milwaukee (Wisconsin) in the action under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 and Wis. Stat. &sect;&sect; 133.03, 134.01 in which appellants alleged that denying a liquor license application violated their due process rights and was a conspiracy to injure and to restrain trade.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The retailers alleged that the refusal to renew one liquor license and the denial of an application for another violated due process rights and constituted a conspiracy to restrain trade and to wilfully or maliciously injure trade. The grant of the motion for summary judgment was based on findings that there were no material issues of fact, neither retailer had liberty or property interests that were protectable under due process or equal protection arguments, and they could not sue the City for conspiracy damages. The court affirmed, concluding that the retailers were not entitled to relief. Res judicata barred the claims of one retailer, the other retailer's predecessor, because the issues could have been tried and litigated in the earlier action as to the denial of its request to renew its liquor license. The court held that a liquor license was a privilege and that terming it a right violated public policy. The court determined that the presumption that the denial of the successor retailer's application was not arbitrary and unreasonable, and the conspiracy claims failed because the City could not have been held liable for the intentional torts of its officers or agents.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant state officials sought relief from a decision by the Circuit Court, Dane County (Wisconsin) granting respondent religious foundation judgment on the pleadings and finding that Wis. Stat. &sect; 20.505(1)(fm) (1989) unconstitutionally violated the First Amendment and the Wis. Const. art. I, &sect; 18 in providing a grant to one specific religiously affiliated educational institution for the planning of an international center.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The state officials sought relief from the trial court's decision. The court reversed and remanded. It found that the religious foundation brought an action seeking declaratory relief on its allegations and seeking a temporary restraining order enjoining the state officials from delivering the grant. Thus, the court noted its dismay about the trial court's reasons for issuing a final judgment when neither party filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings. However, the court found that the statutory governmental aid did not offend the state and federal constitutions if the statute had a secular legislative purpose, its principal effect neither advanced nor inhibited religion, and it did not foster an excessive government entanglement with religion. Based on this test, the court found that the complaint raised an inference that the grant had a sectarian purpose, raised questions of fact concerning the grant's primary effect, and was sufficient to state claims. Then, the state officials' responses raised genuine issues of disputed fact. Thus, the trial court erred in granting judgment on the pleadings and finding the statute unconstitutionally invalid on its face.</SPAN></P>

He argued that the trial court ignored the lesser misdemeanor status of the crime of disorderly conduct by imposing the maximum sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant admitted to six prior convictions and did not contest his status as an habitual criminal. His prior offenses included armed burglary and endangering safety by conduct regardless of life, for which he received a four-year prison term, battery, obstructing an officer, a federal robbery conviction with a prison sentence, and another disorderly conduct conviction as a repeater with a prison sentence. The district attorney advised the trial court that the present offense had occurred within 48 hours of defendant's last release. Evidence and witness testimony showed that, after giving a usual and friendly greeting to defendant, the victim was assaulted. The jury apparently disbelieved defendant's testimony that he intervened in a dispute to aid his brother. The trial court held that defendant's aggressive nature mandated the sentence imposed. The court agreed, holding that the trial court's reasoning was correct, given the gravity of the offense, other sentences imposed on other offenders, and similar sentences in other jurisdictions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The owners claimed that paying the accrued interest to the county constituted a taking without compensation and that &sect; 59.42(2) was unconstitutional. The court rejected both claims and affirmed the judgment. The court's review of the legislative history supported the conclusion that the reference to &quot;any funds&quot; in &sect; 59.42(2) meant exactly that and included the interest that accumulated on the compensation award. Section 59.42(2) did not violate either Wis. Const. art. I, &sect; 13 or U.S. Const. amend. V, which prohibited taking private property for public use without just compensation. The court reasoned that the owners' reliance upon a United States Supreme Court decision that held another state's statute unconstitutional because it required the depositing of funds with the state court and authorized both a fee for the clerk's services and payment of interest accrued on funds deposited with a state court, was misplaced because Wis. Stat. &sect; 59.42(2) did not impose both a service fee and retention of interest. More importantly, the owners pursuant to Wis.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Respondent-appellant father sought review of the decision of the Circuit Court for Racine County (Wisconsin), which issued a two-year domestic abuse injunction under Wis. Stat. &sect; 813.12. The injunction prevented the father from having contact with petitioner-respondent mother. The father asserted that &sect; 813.12 was unconstitutional and that the mother's petition lacked the necessary elements for an injunction under that statute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Pursuant to Wis. Stat. &sect; 813.12, the trial court issued an injunction against a father accused of having abused a mother. The court affirmed the trial court's decision, found that the father's appeal was frivolous, and remanded for costs, fees, and reasonable attorney's fees under Wis. Stat. &sect;&sect; 809.25(3)a, 809.25(3)(c)2. Although the father asserted that &sect; 813.12 was unconstitutional, the court found that the statute was constitutional under principles of equal protection and due process pursuant to the Fourteenth Amendment. Further, the court noted that injury to reputation was not constitutionally protected because reputation was not liberty or property within the meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment. The court found that the trial court had acted within its discretion when it granted the father's motion for an adjournment and that the trial court had the authority to grant an injunction under Wis. Stat. &sect; 813.12(4)(a). Similarly, the court found that the trial court acted within its discretion in the manner in which it conducted the judicial proceeding. The court found that the father's assertion that he was deprived of his right to a trial by jury lacked merit.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the trial court's decision and concluded that the appeal was frivolous. The court remanded the matter for a determination of costs, fees, and reasonable attorney's fees.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The State sought review of a portion of an order from the Circuit Court for Brown County (Wisconsin), which prevented the use of defendant's third operating after revocation (OAR) conviction as a prior conviction under Wis. Stat. &sect; 343.44(2). Defendant cross-appealed that portion of the order permitting the use of his second OAR conviction as a prior conviction under &sect; 343.44(2).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was charged with his fifth OAR offense and one month later, he was charged again with a fifth offense OAR. Both fifth offense OAR charges were based on his four prior OAR convictions. The charges were consolidated for trial and disposition. The trial court allowed defendant to collaterally attack two of his four prior OAR convictions and issued an order declaring the third OAR void for sentencing purposes and declaring the second OAR conviction valid. On appeal by both parties, the court affirmed. Defendant was properly allowed to collaterally attack prior OAR convictions that were being used for enhancement purposes on constitutional grounds. Defendant's third OAR was not constitutionally obtained because the record was not only silent as to whether his plea was made voluntarily and intelligently, but it also indicated that he was not even present at the proceedings. Defendant failed to meet his burden of proving that his second OAR conviction was unconstitutionally obtained where his only supporting evidence that he did not waive his right to counsel was his conclusory affidavit.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The State filed a petition to terminate the mother's parental rights to her four minor children. The State contended that the mother was unfit because her children were in continuing need of protective services and she suffered from continuing parental disability due to her mental disorders. The trial court granted the State's petition. The mother alleged that: (1) her rights could not be terminated when she was incompetent and unable to assist in her defense; (2) the trial court erred in permitting testimony regarding her medical records; and (3) there was insufficient evidence to support the jury's findings. In affirming the decision, the court found that the mother's interests were protected by counsel and her guardian ad litem. The admission of the testimony regarding the mother's medical records constituted harmless error because two doctors testified regarding their independent examinations of the mother and concluded that she suffered from a mental illness. There was overwhelming evidence to support the jury's findings based upon testimonies from a social worker, numerous doctors, and the minors' foster parents.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The inmate's HIV test results were common knowledge at the jail. On review, the court found that: (1) the jail employees were not liable under Wis.

Stat. &sect; 895.50(2)(c); (4) the inmate failed to allege a physical injury for negligent infliction of emotional distress and failed to allege a disability as a result of his severe mental distress for intentional infliction of emotional distress; (5) the inmate stated a constitutional claim for violation of privacy as the jail employees were acting under the color of state law; (6) the dissemination of the inmate's HIV test results was outside the scope of their official duties so they were not entitled to immunity under 893.80(4) or qualified immunity; and (7) the inmate did not establish the county was deliberately indifferent to his rights.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Circuit Court for Winnebago County (Wisconsin), which convicted him of delivery of a controlled substance and delivery of a controlled substance, party to a crime.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant asserted that he merited resentencing for several reasons. The court found that the penalty enhancer provisions of Wis. Stat. &sect; 161.49 (1987-88), in effect when the offenses were committed, did not contain an express scienter requirement. Based on a review of the legislative history of &sect; 161.49 and 21 U.S.C.S. &sect; 845a, both of which provided for an enhanced penalty for distribution of controlled substances within 1,000 feet of a school, the court held that the legislature did not intend to require proof of scienter in order to invoke the more severe penalty. The court concluded that it was not cruel and unusual punishment to require a three-year mandatory minimum sentence for one found guilty of knowingly engaging in an illegal drug sale in a statutorily protected zone. The court also held that &sect; 161.49 did not violate defendant's constitutional right to equal protection. The legislative classification in the statute was rationally related to the deterrence of illegal drug transactions near schools, and seeking to eliminate such an atmosphere near schools by more harshly penalizing those who contributed to it was not patently arbitrary or irrational.</SPAN></P>

The court disagreed with the trial court that the defendants' conduct did not fall within the hard core prohibitions of the statute.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The testatrix and her husband executed the joint will as a single document. The joint will gave all of their property to the survivor. Upon the death of the survivor, the joint will gave the remaining property to designated beneficiaries. The husband died first. The testatrix executed a later will. The testatrix died. The bank was named the personal representative pursuant to the later will. The bank discovered the joint will and petitioned the court to determine the testatrix's true beneficiaries. Two of the named beneficiaries under the joint will, the testatrix's brother and the hospital, declined to participate in the proceedings. The court affirmed the finding that the joint will was contractual. The court reversed the trial court's ruling that the testatrix's brother and the hospital were barred by laches from recovering under the joint will because prejudice was not shown. The trial court had correctly found that after the husband's death, the gifts to the beneficiaries who had died after the husband had died had vested. After-acquired property was included in the joint will pursuant to the common law and Wis. Stat. &sect; 238.03 (1969).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the trial court's rulings that the joint will was contractual, that it disposed of after-acquired property, and that no lapse occurred. The court reversed the ruling the denied a legacy to the testatrix's brother and to the hospital. The matter was remanded.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The valuation of the property owner's shopping mall increased substantially over a two year period. The increased assessment was triggered by the sale of the mall to the property owner during that time. The property owner contended that the board of review incorrectly assessed the value of the shopping mall. The court held that real property valuation had to be based on the fair market value of the property which was the amount the property would sell for upon arms-length negotiation in the open market between an owner willing, but not obliged to sell, and a buyer willing, but not obliged to buy. The court found that the sale of the shopping mall was an arm's length transaction and that the assessment was made in accordance with Wis. Stat. &sect; 70.32(1) and the Wisconsin Property Assessment Manual. The court further held that the assessment had to be upheld because the board of review did not exceed its jurisdiction, it acted according to law, its decision was neither arbitrary, oppressive or unreasonable, and the evidence before the board of review was such that it could reasonably sustain the assessment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant's driver's license was revoked by the trial court. Defendant appealed that judgment and an order which denied his request for a free transcript, contending, among other things, that the officer who arrested him lacked probable cause to believe he was operating a motor vehicle under the influence of alcohol and that he was represented by ineffective trial counsel. The court held that because defendant did not file a copy of the trial transcript, it was compelled to accept the trial court's conclusion that the evidence was sufficient to find that the arresting officer had probable cause to arrest defendant. Further, a claim of inadequate trial counsel had to be raised by a hearing in the trial court, at which trial counsel could testify concerning the reasons behind the actions taken. Therefore, if defendant wished to pursue such a claim, he had to raise the issue by motion to the trial court pursuant to Wis. Stat. &sect; 974.06. Defendant's conviction was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed from an order of the Circuit Court for Milwaukee County (Wisconsin), denying his motion for post-conviction relief and modification of sentence under Wis. Stat. &sect; 974.06. Defendant claimed that his attorney rendered ineffective assistance of counsel, that the trial court erroneously admitted evidence seized pursuant to his illegal arrest and that the trial court erroneously denied his motion for sentence modification.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court found that it could not review defendant's claim of ineffective assistance of counsel because defendant did not allege to the trial court that his attorney was ineffective. Thus, there was no trial court record on the issue. Additionally, the record demonstrated that defendant did not make any objection before or during the trial to his arrest or to the admission of the seized evidence. Where defendant failed to make an objection required to be raised before trial under Wis. Stat. &sect; 971.31(2), that failure precluded defendant from obtaining appellate review as a matter of right. Thus, defendant waived any appellate challenge to the legality of his arrest or the admission of evidence seized pursuant to the unchallenged arrest. Finally, the trial court's denial of defendant's request for sentence modification was correct. Wis. Stat. &sect; 974.06 did not authorize sentence modification unless the sentence was constitutionally or jurisdictionally defective. No such error was alleged or demonstrated by defendant's motion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The inmate unsuccessfully claimed that respondents disposed of a mailed typewriter without due process and disposed of his personal effects in retaliation for his refusal to voluntarily do so himself and for his filing of inmate complaints challenging their actions. The court held that given the plain violation of the prison mailing rule, the respondents were not required to provide defendant with a hearing before returning the prohibited typewriter to its sender. The inmate complaint system used to challenge respondents' actions provided a meaningful post-deprivation remedy for the loss and satisfied procedural due process requirements. The property interest involved was insubstantial as the inmate was simply denied possession of his property while incarcerated. Balancing the government's substantial interest in limiting the risks to security and in minimizing administrative and fiscal burdens, defendant received all the process that was due him. The decision to send the prohibited property to defendant's parents was a discretionary under Wis. Adm. Code &sect; DOC 303.10(3)(d) and respondents, as public officials, were immune from suit for actions undertaken to implement it.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court denying the inmate's motion for summary judgment and granting respondents' motion for summary judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The layoff provision stated that layoffs would be based on inverse order of seniority provided that the racial balance of schools was not disturbed. The teachers union alleged that this violated the constitutional rights of certain teachers and sought a declaratory ruling from WERC pursuant to Wis. Stat. &sect; 111.70(4)(b). WERC agreed that the provision was a prohibited and illegal subject of collective bargaining. The circuit court overturned WERC's decision, holding that the dispute was not ripe and that WERC usurped the judicial function by declaring the provision to be unconstitutional. The court rejected the circuit court's ruling as based on erroneous facts and ordered the reinstatement of WERC's decision. The matter was ripe because layoffs had been conducted under the disputed provision and there was proof of actual injury. WERC did not usurp the judicial function by invalidating the provision. Instead, it was fulfilling its mandate under Wis. Stat. &sect; 111.70(4)(b). WERC had the authority to determine if a provision was a prohibited subject of bargaining. If a provision was unconstitutional, then it necessarily was a prohibited subject of bargaining.</SPAN></P>

During the incident, one of the attackers took the victim's shoes. The jury found that defendant acted against the victim because of the victim's race. On appeal, defendant attacked the constitutionality of &sect; 939.645 by claiming that it punished activities protected by the First Amendment. Affirming, the court held that &quot;intentionally selects&quot; and &quot;race&quot; as used int &sect; 939.645 were clearly understood by an ordinary person to mean purposely pick out a victim because of his race; therefore, the statute was not vague. The court found that the statute was directed at the action of selecting the victim and not at speech. The words used by defendant were merely circumstantial evidence that defendant specially selected the victim because of race. The court also found that the resultant beating and theft were probable consequences of defendant's incitement.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant claimed that the circuit court erred in concluding that extended juvenile jurisdiction was not available in the action and that it had abused its discretion by waiving defendant into adult court. Defendant also charged that the classification of certain crimes given extended juvenile jurisdiction under Wis. Stat. &sect; 48.366 violated the Equal Protection Clause. The court determined that the classifications were to be sustained because there were rational reasons to support such classifications. The court found that the circuit court was required to determine whether the matter had prosecutive merit before proceeding to decide if it should waive jurisdiction of the action. The court determined that a finding of prosecutive merit was to be based on a showing that reasonable grounds existed to believe that the juvenile had committed the violation of criminal law as charged. The court held that the decision whether to waive juvenile jurisdiction lied within the sound discretion of the juvenile court. The court found that inasmuch as the circuit court had kept the best interests of the child in mind when deciding to waive jurisdiction, it had not abused its discretion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">While at his job the dispatcher appeared intoxicated. After making a dispatching error, he was relieved of his duties and ordered to submit to a urinalysis. The Department found the dispatcher guilty of violating Milwaukee, Wis., Fire Department R. 27.2, items 2, 13. The Board dismissed the intoxication charge for insufficient evidence and affirmed the other finding. The trial court did not misapply the law and did not abuse its discretion when it denied him permission to amend his pleadings to include certiorari review. It was undisputed that the dispatcher sought certiorari review more than six months after the Board's decision. The dispatcher argued, however, that prejudice must have been established for the doctrine of laches to be asserted. The court held that there was no need for prejudice to have been shown for the doctrine of laches to apply. The dispatcher's original pleading did not reference any facts or allegations that would have constituted sufficient grounds for certiorari review. His request for certiorari review came more than six months after the decision of which he sought to review. He was guilty of laches and was not entitled to amend his pleadings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant retained the law firm to represent him in a homicide case. When he was unable to provide the additional compensation that he owed to the law firm, defendant and the law firm petitioned the trial court for payment of attorney fees and compensation for expert witnesses. The trial court denied the request. Defendant and the law firm sought a supervisory writ to order the trial court to provide the fees and for removal of the trial judge, contending that he had a personal interest in the outcome. The court denied the writ, ruling that it was within the trial court's discretion to provide funds and expert witnesses to defendant and he did not make the necessary showing of a particularized need. Rather, it appeared that the request for funding was made because the law firm did not want to accept the reduced fee rate that was available through the state public defender if the law firm was appointed through the state public defender. The court concluded that the trial judge's remarks did not require his removal because they were no more than comments that the taxpayers should not have to pay for defendant's trial when the law firm had already received a significant retainer.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The grantees obtained title to one-half of an undivided interest in the joint tenant's home after the IRS levied upon and sold the interest to satisfy income tax arrears. The joint tenant (tenant) argued on appeal that because the IRS lacked the legal authority to sell the interest in the homestead that she shared with her husband, the grantees did not have good title and could not receive rent or partition. The grantees appealed denial of a request for attorney fees based on the alleged frivolous refusal of the tenant to admit certain facts. The court affirmed judgment for the grantees for rent and partition. The court held that the husband's interest in the home was a &quot;right to property&quot; under Wisconsin law and the federal tax consequences of I.R.C. &sect; 6331 applied. The homestead could be seized despite the affect on the tenant's interest. The sale severed the joint tenancy and created a tenancy in common, entitling the grantees to rent and partition. The court held that the tenant's appeal was not frivolous. The court remanded for a determination of whether the tenant had reasonable grounds to deny requests for admission and whether the grantees were entitled to attorney fees.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the evidence supported respondents' malpractice claims. Pursuant to Wis.

The committee upheld the student's non-resident classification, among other reasons, that he entered and remained in Wisconsin principally to obtain an education. The student paid non-resident tuition for an additional year of law school and again appealed his non-resident status, claiming that since the time of the first appeal he had additional contacts with the State of Wisconsin. On review the court found no error. The court rejected the student's claim that the committee improperly required him to prove residency by conclusive evidence rather than clear and convincing evidence. The court held that the student took the term &quot;conclusive evidence&quot; out of context. The committee simply meant that the student's claims and proffered evidence were not in themselves conclusive on the subject of his residency.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Police stopped defendant's vehicle after it was observed travelling at an excessive rate of speed. Police requested defendant to perform field sobriety tests because he exhibited signs of possible intoxication. Defendant was arrested and transported to a hospital for a blood test, which revealed his BAC to be in excess of the legal limit. Defendant was convicted of operating a motor vehicle with a BAC in excess of the legal limit. The trial court denied defendant's motion for postconviction relief, and he appealed. The court affirmed. Defendant contended that the trial court erred when it refused to instruct the jury on an alternative method of computing BAC. Though defendant was entitled to an instruction on a valid theory of defense, he was not entitled to an instruction that merely highlighted evidentiary factors. Such an instruction was improper, and the trial court was correct to reject it. Defendant further contended that the State violated its duty to disclose exculpatory evidence when it failed to disclose that the blood testing kit contained ethyl alcohol. The constitutional duty of a prosecutor was to disclose exculpatory evidence within his exclusive control.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 66.191 (1981-82), to respondent deputy sheriff for injuries he suffered while employed by the county.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The deputy injured his knee while on duty. Cartilage was removed from his knee by arthroscopic surgery. The treating physician assessed 15 percent permanent partial disability at the right knee. The deputy later resigned and cited his knee injury as the reason. He also waived disability benefits under Wis. Stat. &sect; 40.63, and elected to receive disability benefits under Wis. Stat. &sect; 66.191. The county argued that it had never opted into &sect; 66.191 via Wis. Stat. &sect; 59.07(4), so the deputy was not eligible for benefits thereunder. The deputy argued that op-in was not required. The Commission awarded benefits to the deputy under Wis. Stat. &sect; 66.191. On appeal, the court reversed. The court held that Wis. Stat. &sect; 59.07(4) revealed a legislative intent that a county board had the option of applying Wis. Stat. &sect; 66.191 to those deputy sheriffs it so chose. Therefore, because the county did not elect to provide that &sect; 66.191 apply to the deputy, he was not eligible for relief under that section.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judge filed suit seeking a declaratory judgment that Wis. Admin. Code &sect; DOC 302.32(2), which authorized the early release on probation of certain prison inmates, was unconstitutional because it violated the separation of powers doctrine. The trial court dismissed the action and the judge appealed. The court held that the constitutionality of a provision of the administrative code was a question of law which the appellate court decided de novo. The court stated that statutes and regulations carried a heavy presumption of constitutionality and the challenger had the burden of proving unconstitutionality beyond a reasonable doubt. The court also noted that &sect; DOC 302.32(2) did not violate the separation of powers doctrine because under the adversary process, the executive branch assumes the responsibility of directing the correctional and rehabilitative processes of the parole and probation system. The court observed that it was the function of the executive branch to grant paroles and pardons and therefore regulation of the timing and method of release from prison to parole was well within the department's powers. The court upheld the dismissal of the lawsuit.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant county sought review of an order from the Circuit Court for Rock County (Wisconsin), which dismissed a petition to terminate respondent parent's parental rights.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The county appealed from an order dismissing a petition to terminate parental rights. The trial court initially determined the parental rights should be terminated. Upon reconsideration, however, the trial court concluded that, because only two of six dispositional orders contained the warnings required by Wis. Stat. &sect; 48.356, the county could not establish that grounds existed under Wis. Stat. &sect; 48.415 for termination of parental rights. The court held that termination cases for abandonment under Wis. Stat. &sect; 48.415(1), only a single order need include the warnings. Because one of the grounds relied on by the trial court for termination was abandonment under &sect; 48.415(1) and because the dispositional orders contained the required warnings, the trial court erred by dismissing the action upon reconsideration. Under Wis. Stat. &sect; 48.415(1)(a)(2), the court found that the parent had abandoned the children before orders were entered. The court held that the phrase &quot;incidental contact&quot; was sufficiently unambiguous. Therefore, the attorney could not be deemed ineffective for failing to assert a vagueness challenge that would have been unsuccessful.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued that the hostage-taking statute,&nbsp;Wis.

The court found that the statute unambiguously punished more severely those who did not release their hostages unharmed before the hostage-taker's arrest. The court further found that defendant's misreading of the statute led him to the incorrect notion that the statute was vague and was a strict liability statute that violated his due process rights by not requiring the state to prove at trial that he had the intent to injure his hostage. Finally, the court found that the statute did not violate defendant's equal protection rights by means of an irrational classification. The classification in the statute had a rational basis.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In consolidated judicial proceedings, the state moved to impose sanctions on several juveniles under Wis.

The children each challenged the constitutionality of &sect; 48.355(6) on the basis that it deprived juveniles of liberty without due process of law. The trial court found the statute was unconstitutional. Upon review, the court reversed. The court found that the sanctions under &sect; 48.355 were merely incidental to the state's legitimate interests rather than unconstitutionally punitive where the purpose behind the statute was to save delinquent children from the consequences of criminal behavior. The court held that no basis existed for the conclusion that the statute granted juvenile courts contempt power. The court determined that the statute met due process requirements where notice of the intent to sanction needed to be given to the parties, all motions needed to state with particularity the grounds therefor, evidence against the juvenile needed to be disclosed at the sanctions hearing, and the child was entitled to present evidence at the hearing.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The vendor brought an action against the partners to foreclose a land contract and to obtain a deficiency judgment.

The trial court concluded that under Wisconsin law the partners had no personal liability to the vendor and dismissed his deficiency claim. The vendor filed a motion to dismiss his complaint in order to obtain appellate review. The trial court granted the vendor's motion. The court concluded that Iowa law applied pursuant to the Wisconsin Revised Uniform Limited Partnership Act (1976), specifically Wis. Stat. &sect; 179.81, because the foreign limited partnership was formed in Iowa. The court further concluded that the Iowa Revised Uniform Limited Partnership Act (1976), rather than the Iowa Revised Uniform Limited Partnership Act (1985) applied because the intent of the Iowa Legislature was that the 1985 version should only be prospective to the extent necessary to protect partners' expectancies.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Tax Appeals Commission (Commission) denied the corporation's deduction because Wis. Stat. &sect; 71.04(5)(a) and (d)(1) (1975) allowed deductions for gifts to the state, but did not allow a deduction for a gift to the federal government. On appeal, the corporation claimed that the statute was unconstitutional. The court upheld the dismissal of the corporation's appeal because the corporation failed to raise the issue before the Commission. The constitutional issue had to be raised and the record developed even though the Commission lacked power to decide the issue. Such was the mandate of the Wisconsin Supreme Court and the court concluded that it was compelled to follow that precedent. The corporation's passing reference to constitutional concerns of the statute before the Commission was not enough to raise the issue because the argument was not developed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The charges arose out of the burglary of a residence. Defendant's accomplice was the principal witness against defendant. Defendant and his accomplice had been arrested without a warrant. After the arrests, the police obtained a warrant to search defendant's car. They found guns and items stolen in the burglary. Before the trial, defendant moved to suppress the physical evidence the police took from his car on grounds that the seizure resulted from his unconstitutional stop, detention, and arrest. The trial court denied the motion. The trial court held that the stop was reasonable, considering the information in the possession of the officer who stopped defendant. It held that defendant's pre-arrest detention was also reasonable because the police believed it necessary to have an eye-witness identification, which required bringing the witness some distance to the scene of the stop. The court agreed, holding that the investigatory stop and pre-arrest detention were justified. The court also found no merit in defendant's arguments that the verdict was coerced, that defendant was improperly sentenced, and that he was ineffectively represented. The judgment and order were affirmed.</SPAN></P>

When her son was born, he was placed in foster care pursuant to a voluntary agreement. A CHIPS petition was subsequently filed, and the child was found to be in need of protection and services. The mother was told to fulfill certain requirements in order to obtain custody of her son, including that she complete a parenting class and establish suitable housing. When the mother made little or no progress in meeting the court's conditions, the case was referred for a petition to terminate parental rights. The court rejected the mother's claims of error and affirmed the trial court's order. Wis. Stat. &sect; 48.424(4) had previously been found to be constitutional. Because the jury found that grounds for termination of the mother's parental rights existed, the trial court was correct in finding the mother an unfit parent. The mother was not entitled to have a jury determine unfitness. The trial court did not abuse its discretion by admitting evidence regarding the mother's neglected pets and her roommate's drinking problem and abusive behavior. Respondent department of social services made diligent efforts to provide the services ordered by the court.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff health insurer appealed a judgment and order from the Circuit Court for Dane County (Wisconsin), which, under Wis. Stat. &sect; 102.30(7)(b), denied the insurer's request to intervene in a workers' compensation (WC) proceedings and dismissed the insurer's complaint against defendants, the insured and a WC carrier, for reimbursement of medical payments.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A health insurer paid an insured's medical bills; filed a complaint against the insured and the insured's employer's WC carrier for reimbursement of the bills, and filed a request to intervene in the proceedings on the insured's claim against the carrier for WC benefits. The trial court denied the request and dismissed the complaint. On appeal, the court affirmed and held as follows: Wis. Stat. &sect; 102.30(7)(b) expressly precluded the insurer from intervening in the insured's WC proceeding. However, if the insured prevailed on his claim for WC benefits, Wis. Stat. &sect; 102.30(7)(a) allowed the insurer to petition the Wisconsin Department of Industry, Labor and Human Relations for reimbursement. Any settlement between the insured and the carrier was not binding on the insurer. Thus, the insurer had a remedy for its wrongs if any payments should not have been made, although it was not the remedy that the insurer would have preferred. Therefore, Wis. Stat. &sect; 102.30(7)(b) did not violate Wis. Const. art. I, &sect; 9.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Based on plaintiff's five convictions for out-of-state driving offenses, the DOT revoked his operating privilege for five years under Wis. Stat. &sect; 351.025. Upon review, the lower court reversed the DOT's revocation order on the ground that only three of the offenses could be counted toward the four offenses needed to qualify as a habitual traffic offender under Wis. Stat. &sect; 351.02(1)(a). Essentially, the lower court found that two offenses could only be counted as one because they arose out of the same occurrence and that a Michigan law under which plaintiff had been convicted was not in substantial conformity with Wisconsin law. The state appealed. Although the lower court did not exceed its authority under Wis. Stat. &sect; 351.027(2) to review the DOT's license revocation decision, the court reversed because the lower court erred by requiring that laws of other jurisdictions must be in &quot;substantial conformity&quot; with Wisconsin law to be counted under Wis. Stat. &sect; 351.02(1)(a)10. Rather, the 1989 amendment of the habitual traffic offender statute deleted the requirement that an out-of-state offense could only be counted when such an offense was in strict conformity with Wisconsin law.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed from the sentencing provisions of two judgments of the Circuit Court For Kenosha County (Wisconsin), convicting him of first-degree sexual assault and from an order denying his motion for resentencing. Defendant argued that this sentence was invalid because the trial court improperly considered his use of reading materials protected under the First Amendment and because the trial court engaged in &quot;mechanistic&quot; sentencing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The convictions resulted from defendant's illegal sexual contact with his juvenile daughter. The presentence investigation report noted that defendant had an interest in pornography, especially the novels containing graphic descriptions of adults having sexual contact with children. The text of the trial court's decision indicated that while defendant's choice of reading material was not the major factor influencing the sentence, it was nevertheless a relevant factor. The court found that the reading materials were constitutionally protected and that they did not constitute child pornography because they did not involve visual depiction of children engaged in sexual activity. However, there was a reliable showing of a sufficient relationship between the criminal activity and the constitutional activity so that the trial court's consideration of the reading materials did not violate defendant's First Amendment rights. The sentencing court's remarks, viewed in their totality, also did not merely pay &quot;lip service&quot; to the various sentencing criteria considered. Instead, the trial court touched on all the factors, positive and negative, which were relevant to defendant's sentencing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The ex-employee was injured in 1977. After she resigned, she applied for and was denied benefits under Wis.

The Commission modified and affirmed the findings, and the trial court affirmed the Commission's decision. On appeal, the Department argued in part that the ex-employee was not entitled to benefits because she was not a protective occupation participant at the time she applied. The court affirmed, holding that: (1) Wis.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A victim obtained a temporary restraining order against defendant, who then had contact with her on two occasions. Defendant was convicted for violating the order and for violating the conditions of his bail on an unrelated charge. Four days after the temporary restraining order was issued, a permanent injunction was issued. Defendant again had contact with the victim, and was charged with violating the injunction. The charge was dismissed, but defendant was convicted for another count of bail jumping. On appeal, defendant argued that the temporary restraining order was unconstitutionally vague, and that the evidence did not support his conviction. The court affirmed the convictions, holding that the temporary restraining order did not violate due process because it only prohibited harassing behavior, where &quot;harassing&quot; was defined in terms of a statutory definition that had already withheld constitutional scrutiny. Further, evidence which showed in part that defendant watched the victim's daughter undress and followed the victim into a private office was sufficient to support the convictions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant custodian sought appeal from a judgment of the Circuit Court For Pierce County (Wisconsin), which dismissed the custodian's 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 claim against respondent school district (district) for terminating his employment without adequate notice and a fair hearing in violation of his procedural due process rights.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The custodian was terminated after a job-related injury. The trial court dismissed the custodian's &sect; 1983 claim because it held that worker's compensation law provided the exclusive remedy. On appeal, the court held that because the exclusivity of the worker's compensation law did not bar a &sect; 1983 claim when the state terminated an employee without adequate notice and an opportunity to respond the judgment was reversed. The court found that the custodian was entitled to notice and a meaningful opportunity to respond before he was terminated. The court noted that because post-termination state remedies could not cure any violation of this right, the trial court erred by holding that the Worker's Compensation Act provided the exclusive remedy. The court disagreed with the district that a pre-deprivation hearing on the issue of termination was neither feasible nor practical where the termination was based on workplace injury. The court also rejected the claim that the custodian needed to exhaust administrative remedies before bringing a &sect; 1983 action because the court noted there were no administrative remedies available to the custodian as the district did not provide a review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the judgment of the lower court and held that the custodian's action was improperly dismissed.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 895.52 barred their complaint.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The drowning occurred in an outdoor swimming pool owned and operated by the city. At the time of the drowning, there were three lifeguards on duty, none of who were at their assigned stations. Appellants maintained that the city was not entitled to immunity under &sect; 895.52 because of the duty of care created by the Wisconsin Department of Health and Social Services' regulations governing safety at public swimming pools. Upon review, the court found that there was no express intention in Wis. Stat. &sect; 140.05 to create a standard of care whereby a violation served as an independent basis for a negligence action. Thus, a violation of the Department's regulations could not support their action. Under Wis. Stat. &sect; 895.52(2)(a)(1) the city had no duty to supervise properly trained lifeguards. The exception for immunity when the municipal property was used for an event in which the owner charged an admission fee for spectators under &sect; 895.52(4)(a) was unavailable because pool patrons could not be considered &quot;spectators&quot; at an &quot;event.&quot; Summary judgment for respondents was proper.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed summary judgment for respondents in appellants' action against them for negligent in the drowning death of their son in the city's outdoor swimming pool.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued that a valid search warrant which specifically authorized the search of a house and the seizure of cocaine and related paraphernalia did not implicitly carry with it the right to search any individual who happened to be present in the house at the time of the search for weapons or contraband. The court disagreed. A no-knock warrant was executed on a residence. Defendant was present at the time, and was searched. The warrant and its supporting affidavit referenced cocaine and cocaine-related paraphernalia. The court found that the search of defendant was reasonable because it was minimally intrusive and was reasonably necessary to assure the officers' safety and to prevent the disposal or concealment of contraband. Furthermore, the address searched was not a public place, the site had been recently raided by police and the searches yielded weapons, drugs, and drug-related paraphernalia. It was reasonable to infer that the location was a drug house. It might have been difficult to accurately predict who might be on the premises at a given time. Therefore, although the warrant did not specifically name defendant, he had been lawfully searched.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant Department of Industry, Labor, and Human Relations (DILHR) sought review of a judgment of the Circuit Court for Dane County (Wisconsin), which upheld the constitutionality of Wis. Stat. &sect; 227.26 in an action brought by respondent individuals and joined by respondents, Joint Committee on Legislative Organization (JCLO) and Joint Committee for Review of Administrative Rules (JCRAR).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The DILHR adopted Wis. Admin. Code &sect; Ind. 72.01(16), which set forth the requirements for probationary employment. Subsequently, the JCRAR exercised its power under Wis. Stat. &sect; 227.26 and suspended parts of Wis. Admin. Code &sect; Ind. 72.01(16), diminishing the time in which an employee was to be considered a probationary employee. The DILHR notified employers that the JCRAR lacked the authority to suspend the rule and implemented the rule as drafted. The individuals brought an action against the DILHR, seeking to require it to enforce &sect; 72.01(16) as it read following the JCRAR's suspension and the JCRAR and the JCLO intervened in the action. The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of the individuals and the DILHR sought review. The court held that Wis. Stat. &sect; 227.26 violated the separation of powers because it allowed the JCRAR to create new law without presentment to the governor and deprived the executive branch of the opportunity to exercise its power of veto. The court found that the JCRAR was not entitled to impermissibly interfere with executive powers and could not suspend Wis. Admin. Code &sect; Ind. 72.01(16).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court, holding that the doctrine of separation of powers had been violated when the JCRAR suspended an administrative rule, reversed the trial court's decision and remanded the matter for a determination of issues not previously decided.</SPAN></P>

The juvenile argued that because the stop and frisk was constitutionally infirm, evidence seized and his incriminating statement should have been suppressed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The delinquency petition alleged that the juvenile, as party to a crime, knowingly possessed 10 grams or less of cocaine with intent to deliver. At the suppression hearing, an officer testified that he executed a &quot;no-knock&quot; search warrant at a flat. The warrant was based on an informant's tip that he had purchased cocaine from a person in the flat less than 72 hours earlier. The officers involved in the search were advised that a man with a gun and a lookout might be found near the flat. Police records showed that cocaine and money had previously been seized at the flat. The officer testified that he saw the juvenile standing on the porch leading up to the flat. The officer conducted a &quot;stop and frisk&quot; and found cocaine and money. Another officer took the juvenile's statement, which implicated him in the sale of cocaine at the flat. Under the totality of the circumstances, the court agreed that the stop and search was reasonable under Wis. Stat. &sect; 968.16. The officer was justified in stopping and frisking the juvenile for his own protection. The trial court properly denied suppression of the cocaine and money seized and statements taken as a result of the stop and search.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Circuit Court for Racine County (Wisconsin), which entered a conviction against him for unlawfully possessing a firearm as a convicted felon pursuant to Wis.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The issue before the court was whether the seizure of defendant, as a parolee, in his residence upon a parole violation apprehension request was valid under the U.S. Const. amend. IV. After verifying the apprehension warrant and obtaining defendant's address, the arresting officer went to defendant's residence and knocked on the door. Defendant partially opened the door, but then attempted to close the door. At that point, the officers pushed the door open and entered the apartment and seized defendant on the apprehension warrant. The court affirmed defendant's subsequent conviction for unlawful possession of a firearm as a convicted felon. Specifically, the court held that in light of a parolee's conditional liberty and diminished expectation of privacy under amend. IV, a judicially issued arrest warrant was not a prerequisite for the seizure of defendant, an alleged parole violator, in his residence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Circuit Court for Grant County (Wisconsin), which convicted him, upon his no contest plea, of possessing a switchblade knife, a violation of Wis. Stat. &sect; 941.24(1).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Before pleading no contest to a charge of violating Wis. Stat. &sect; 941.24(1) by possessing a switchblade knife, defendant unsuccessfully moved to dismiss on grounds that &sect; 941.24(1) was unconstitutionally vague and overbroad. He appealed the judgment of conviction that was entered upon his plea, but the court affirmed the judgment because &sect; 941.24(1) was constitutional. Even though defendant entered a no contest plea, his claim that the statute was unconstitutional survived his plea. The phrase &quot;other device or movement&quot; in &sect; 941.24(1) was not vague because even if such language could be stretched to include a jackknife, such holding would only add jackknives to the range of prohibited knives. Section 941.24(1) remained sufficiently definite to alert an ordinary person to the type of conduct prohibited. The use of the terms &quot;other device,&quot; &quot;gravity,&quot; &quot;thrust,&quot; and &quot;movement&quot; was not broadly sweeping language covering jackknives. Furthermore, defendant made no attempt to establish a constitutional right to carry a jackknife or any other kind of knife. He offered no other examples showing how &sect; 941.24(1) could have deterred individuals from exercising purported constitutional rights.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant challenged an order of the Circuit Court for Vilas County (Wisconsin), which convicted her on a jury verdict of obstructing a police officer and imposed a fine of $ 200 and costs. Defendant's arrest was part of a mass arrest of Indian spear-fishing protesters who refused to terminate their sit-in at a public boat landing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant challenged the sufficiency of the complaint and the evidence at trial, the admission of evidence of the activities of protestors other than herself, and the constitutionality of Wis. Stat. &sect; 166.04 and Wis. Stat. &sect; 166.02, which permitted the use of law enforcement officers from other jurisdictions. The court declined to review the constitutional issue because defendant did not give notice to the attorney general and did not raise the issue before the trial court. The court reviewed the report of an officer of the sheriff's department describing the circumstances leading to the mass arrest of over 100 persons at a boat landing. Defendant was among persons who surged across snow fences, plastic &quot;POLICE LINE DO NOT CROSS&quot; tape, and a police line of about 40 officers in order to block a boat ramp. The court found that the trial court's finding that there was probable cause for the complaint was not clearly erroneous. Photographs showing defendant standing to the forefront of those on the boat landing, waving a large American flag, and defendant's own testimony that she knowingly stepped across the police line constituted sufficient evidence to support the verdict.</SPAN></P>

The sentencing court found that defendant's contact with the victim was adequate to sustain revocation of his probation. On appeal, the court rejected defendant's argument that the sentencing court had mistakenly relied on the evidence of the unproven battery. The sentencing court had properly evaluated defendant's character and was entitled to consider the underlying evidence of the victim's physical condition, despite the affidavit. The sentencing court had not failed to consider the victim's wish that defendant not be incarcerated. It had properly considered her wishes and disregarded them. Defendant had failed to prove that his sentence violated the Eighth Amendment. The sentencing court did not lose jurisdiction over defendant because he had been bound over pursuant to Wis.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The State appealed an order of the Circuit Court for Eau Claire County dismissing charges of prostitution filed against four defendants who were each charged with one count of prostitution, contrary to Wis.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The State contended on appeal that the trial court erred by ruling that defendants were selectively prosecuted in violation of the fourteenth amendment's equal protection clause. The court found that no males who engaged in sexual contact with defendants were arrested and held that the trial court properly applied the &quot;discriminatory effect/discriminatory purpose&quot; standard which required defendants to show both that the state's enforcement system had a discriminatory effect and was motivated by a discriminatory purpose. The court further held that the trial court did not err in finding that defendants and their male patrons were similarly situated and that the state's program of enforcement had a discriminatory effect. Because the police intentionally focused their investigation on, and made their arrests of, only the female violators of Wis. Stat. &sect; 944.30, and there was no important governmental objective substantially related to this enforcement scheme, the court concluded that the State selectively prosecuted defendants in violation of the equal protection clause.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiffs, representing disadvantaged Milwaukee public school students, brought an action in the Circuit Court for Dane County (Wisconsin) to compel defendant state school superintendent to comply with Wis. Stat. &sect; 119.23, which required the state to pay private school tuition for the students. A taxpayer and others intervened as defendants, challenging the statute's constitutionality. The trial court upheld the statute and defendants appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The statute, a multi-item state budget adjustment bill, provided a state subsidy for low-income children in cities of the &quot;first class&quot; to attend private school. Reversing the circuit court, the court found that the statute violated Wis. Const. art. IV, &sect; 18, which provided that no private or local bill could embrace more than one subject. The purpose of art. IV, &sect; 18 was to prevent bills benefiting private or local interests from being &quot;smuggled&quot; through the legislature. The court applied the classification test to determine that the bill was &quot;private or local&quot; within the meaning of the constitution. The statute failed to satisfy at least two parts of the test: first, there was nothing substantially distinct about cities of the first class (of which Milwaukee was the only one) that made it necessary for them, as opposed to all other cities, to have the Parental Choice Program. Second, the classification was not &quot;germane&quot; to the purpose of &sect; 119.23, which was to conduct a test program in education. The statute was therefore &quot;private or local&quot; legislation that could not constitutionally be passed as part of a bill which embraced more than one subject.</SPAN></P>

The county's zoning ordinance governing work on nonconforming buildings prohibited work that exceeded 50 percent of the value the building became a nonconforming use. After the work commenced, the county filed an action against the developer alleging that the developer exceeded the authorized expenditures and thereby exceeded 50 percent of the estimated fair market value of the cottages. The developer argued that the county unconstitutionally applied the ordinance when it determined fair market value at the time the permit was issued. The trial court entered summary judgment for the developer. The county appealed. The court held that the developer could not enjoy the benefits of the zoning ordinance and attack its validity.</SPAN></P>

A jury in the Circuit Court for Milwaukee County (Wisconsin) made findings against the mother, and the trial court granted the TPR petition. The mother appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The county alleged that the mother had abandoned the child under Wis. Stat. &sect; 48.415(1)(a) and that she had failed to assume parental responsibility under &sect; 48.415(6). The mother claimed that she had seen the child periodically in the backyard of his foster home and had talked to him by telephone once. The trial court did not submit to the jury the question of whether the mother had failed to visit or to communicate with the child for six months or longer, but answered the question itself affirmatively, reasoning that any contact between the mother and the child was incidental and did not amount to normal visits or communication. The court held that the contacts were indeed incidental and thus did not preclude the trial court from finding that the mother failed to visit or communicate with the child. Even if the trial court erred in not submitting the question to the jury, the court added, the error was harmless because the contacts were incidental. The court also held that Wis. Stat. &sect; 48.424(4), under which a parent would be presumed unfit after the judge or the jury determined that grounds existed for a TPR, did not violate the right to a jury trial and was not overbroad.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant asserted that the trial court erred in admitting his breathalyzer test results into evidence because the arresting officer failed to provide him with warnings he claimed were required under Wis. Stat. &sect; 343.305(4) (1987-88), and because his breathalyzer results varied widely. In affirming defendant's convictions the court rejected defendant's contention that an OWI-BAC suspect had to be advised not only of the statutory language in &sect; 343.305(4)(c), but also of the specific penalties which might flow from an OWI-BAC, including a fine, forfeiture, suspension, or revocation of driving privileges, point reduction, and a possible jail sentence. The court noted that the use of the term &quot;any&quot; in &sect; 343.305(4)(c), in requiring a person to be informed of the consequences of failing any BAC test, instead of the term &quot;each,&quot; which was used in &sect; 343.305(8)(b)2.d in describing which of the tests might be challenged in an administrative proceeding, might dissuade an accused from taking subsequent tests, but held that it was for the legislature to correct this contradiction in terms.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The employee worked as an interviewer for a university research laboratory, conducting public opinion surveys. The employers granted the employee's request not to work on a survey of shoppers' attitudes toward group activities in shopping malls because of his political views. Before the survey was complete, the employee provided a copy of the questions to a newspaper, which published some of the questions and quoted the employee. The employers discharged the employee for violating a confidentiality agreement. On appeal, the court held that the employers' interest in promoting the efficiency of their services did not outweigh the employee's interest in commenting on a matter of public concern. Although factors of confidentiality and work rule violations weighed heavily in favor of the employers, the employee's speech touched matters of public concern with sufficient directness to outweigh those factors. The employers were not entitled to qualified immunity because reasonable officials would have known that discharging the employee for the exercise of free speech was unlawful. The jury was improperly instructed concerning the conditions under which punitive damages could be awarded.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant was injured while working in a sawmill. He commenced an action more than six years after substantial completion of the sawmill's renovation. The trial court granted summary judgment on the ground that the suit was not commenced within the time required by Wis. Stat. &sect; 893.89. The appellate court affirmed the trial court's dismissal, and the Wisconsin Supreme Court denied appellant's petition for review. However, that court did accept a petition for review in another case involving the same statute of limitations and ruled that &sect; 893.89 was unconstitutional on its face. Appellant sought to reopen and vacate the earlier decision, but the trial court believed that it had no authority to vacate a judgment that had been affirmed by the court of appeals. Because a recent decision of the Wisconsin Supreme Court established that the trial court did have that authority, the court concluded that the order had to be reversed and the cause remanded for the trial court to exercise its discretion and determine whether exceptional circumstances justified granting relief.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant home occupants brought an action against appellees, insurance companies and a private inspection agency, and others, alleging that that their houses retained excessive moisture as a result of defective design, inappropriate building materials, and faulty construction. The county circuit court granted summary judgment to appellees and concluded that plaintiffs' negligence and strict liability claims failed because the home builder had had not provided timely notice to appellee insurers, and the inspection agency had no duty to plaintiffs outside of its contract with the builder where plaintiffs had failed to demonstrate breach. On appeal, the court reversed the lack of notice ruling, concluding that there was an issue as to when the builder's duty to report arose. The court concluded that the business risk exclusion barred coverage for the cost of repairs, but that bodily injuries and other consequential damages were covered. In addition, the court held that the professional service and pollution exclusion clauses did not apply, rulings as to the effect of the statutes of limitations on the individual claims were not permissible, and that the joinder of claims was proper.</SPAN></P>

In affirming defendant's conviction, the court found the prosecutor was operating in a de facto capacity at the time of trial and his failure to renew the bond was not grounds for reversal. The impact of prosecuting defendant for practicing law without a license was incidental to his free speech rights. The constitutional protection afforded such rights did not extend to persons delivering legal advice without licenses. The warrant described the property to be seized as a typewriter and papers purporting to be legal documents. The items to be seized were described with sufficient particularity. By signing the waiver of his rights under the Interstate Agreement on Detainers Act, defendant waived his right to challenge any custody transfer.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff, the City of Milwaukee, appealed an order from the Circuit Court for Milwaukee County (Wisconsin), which granted summary judgment in favor of defendant motor vehicle owner. The trial court declared that Wis. Stat. &sect; 346.55(2) and the City's related ordinance unconstitutionally infringed upon the owner's economic free speech rights by prohibiting him from leaving his vehicle for sale on a street within the City.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The owner was arrested for violating &sect; 346.55(2) and the City's related ordinance by parking his automobile on a street with a &quot;For Sale&quot; sign. The trial court declared &sect; 346.55(2) and the ordinance unconstitutional on the basis that it infringed upon the owner's economic free speech rights. On appeal by the City, the court affirmed. Although the &quot;For Sale&quot; sign was distracting, the commercial activity in selling the automobile was truthful and legal rather than misleading or illegal. Therefore, the owner's offer to sell was First Amendment commercial speech protected under the Fourteenth Amendment. Although the City had a substantial interest on traffic safety, the City failed to show that &sect; 346.55(2) and the ordinance were not more extensive than necessary.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The victim began therapy with defendant in 1981 and continued her treatment with him until the fall of 1985. In the fall of 1982, defendant and the victim started having a sexual relationship in the context of their patient-therapist relationship. The sexual relationship continued after the therapy sessions terminated. Three weeks after the parties ended their relationship, the victim contacted the police department. On the basis of the stipulated facts presented to the court, defendant was found guilty of sexual exploitation by a therapist. Defendant appealed his conviction and argued that consent was a defense. Defendant also argued that the Wis. Stat. Ann. &sect; 940.22(2) (1983-84) was unconstitutionally vague. The court affirmed defendant's conviction. The court determined that under Wis. Stat. Ann. &sect; 940.22(2) (1983-84) consent was not a defense. The court concluded that &sect; 940.22(2) was not unconstitutionally vague. The court found that the precise scope of &sect; 940.22(2) was plain and clear, in that it was meant to prevent the sexual exploitation of patients by their therapist. The court found that defendant had fair notice of what the statute sought to proscribe.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant sought review of a judgment entered in the Circuit Court for Outagamie County (Wisconsin) that convicted him of violations that arose from a breached contract to build a garage. Specifically, defendant was convicted of failure to include the start and finish dates in a written home improvement contract, failure to furnish proper lien waivers, and failure to comply with the terms of a home improvement contract.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant contended that the entire regulatory scheme was vague and overbroad; that the evidence adduced at trial was, as a matter of law, insufficient to support the verdict. Further, defendant contended that criminalizing a breach of contract under Wis. Admin. Code &sect; 110.05(9) violated the Thirteenth Amendment's prohibition of involuntary servitude. The court rejected defendant's first two arguments, but agreed that Wis. Admin. Code &sect; 110.05(9) was unconstitutional. The court noted that the overbreadth doctrine did not apply here because defendant did not raise any claim that the statute infringed on his First Amendment rights. The court further noted that the lack of an element of intent within the administrative regulation did not violate defendant's due process rights. As to defendant's claim that Wis. Admin. Code. &sect; 110.05 (9) was unconstitutional, the court noted that both the federal and state constitutions prohibited criminalizing the breach of a labor contract in the absence of any fraud or misrepresentation. The court found that the regulation at issue in this case violated the federal and state constitutions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed defendant's convictions for failure to include the start and finish dates in a written home improvement contract and for failing to furnish proper lien waivers. However, the court remanded the case to the trial court with directions to vacate defendant's conviction and sentence for failure to comply with the terms of a written home improvement contract.</SPAN></P>

Milwaukee, Wis., Zoning Ordinances &sect; 295-27 did not unconstitutionally delegate legislative authority to the building inspector; the inspector did not have unlimited discretion to grant or deny special use permits. There was no proof that the property owners did not receive a fair hearing before the board or defendant municipal plan commission. Overwhelming evidence supported the board's denial of the property owners' application. The board made sufficient findings supporting its decision. There was no evidence that the denial of the property owners' application amounted to selective enforcement of the zoning ordinances. The property owners were not entitled to a trial de novo because the case was properly decided by the trial court on the existing record.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 71.05(1)(a). The class action by appellee federal retirees alleged that the statute was unconstitutional and in violation of 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The retired federal employees alleged that the current and three former secretaries of the DOR, in their personal and official capacities, discriminated against retired federal employees and in favor of similarly situated state and local employees by taxing federal retirement benefits. The class action sought declaratory, injunctive, and monetary relief. The class action did not allege that the former secretaries had official duties with DOR. The current and three former secretaries of the DOR argued that the trial court lack jurisdiction to issue the preliminary injunction because a claim for refund of state taxes could not be maintained under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983, a violation of 4 U.S.C.S. &sect; 111 did not give rise to a cause of action under &sect; 1983, and that because the action could not be maintained in a federal court it could not be maintained in a state court. The court rejected each contention, holding that the trial court had jurisdiction under &sect; 1983 to grant the injunctive relief. The court, however, held that the former secretaries of the DOR were improperly sued in their official capacities because they no longer served in any relevant official position.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">With a modification as to the parties sued, the court affirmed the orders granting injunctive relief and certifying the class.</SPAN></P>

Code &sect; HSS 328.22 (July 1987). Revocation proceedings were initiated shortly thereafter. The inmate argued that the detention procedure, pursuant to Wis. Admin. Code &sect; HSS 328.22 and Wis. Stat. &sect; 57.06(3), improperly abridged his freedom. The court affirmed and held that the inmate's temporary detention did not constitute a grievous loss and was consonant with society's interest. The court also held that it was not error for the department of health and social services to detain the inmate on the basis of his report to the police because his claim of self-defense did not preclude an investigation into the two parole violations the inmate had admitted: the possession of the knife, and the stabbing. The inmate also argued that the rules of parole were vague, but the court held that the inmate's possession and use of the knife were patently prohibited by the rules.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After being convicted of 14 counts of first-degree sexual assault of three of his stepdaughters, defendant filed a motion for post-conviction relief, claiming that the videotaped testimony of the victims, originally given at defendant's preliminary hearing, had been improperly admitted during defendant's trial. Defendant further contended that the evidence had been insufficient to convict, and that the trial court had abused its discretion in imposing sentence. The trial court denied defendant's motion, and defendant appealed. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment. The court held that the videotapes were admitted in accordance with the provisions of Wis.

The court further concluded that &sect; 908.08 was constitutional both on its face and in its application. The court also determined that the evidence was sufficient to convict defendant.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant Wisconsin Department of Revenue (DOR) appealed from a summary judgment by the Circuit Court for Dane County (Wisconsin) declaring that plaintiff wholesaler engaged in trade spending, which did not violate Wisconsin's tied-house law, Wis. Stat. &sect; 125.33(1)(a).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The wholesaler sold its fermented malt beverage products to retailers holding Class &quot;B&quot; licenses under Wis. Stat. &sect; 125.26. The DOR notified the wholesaler that it had received a complaint that the wholesaler had violated Wis. Stat. &sect; 125.33(1)(a) by engaging in trade spending and that it was going to investigate the complaint. The wholesaler sought declaratory relief, requesting that the trial court determine whether trade spending violated &sect;125.33(1)(a) and, if so, whether the statute was constitutional. The trial court granted the wholesaler's motion for summary judgment and the DOR appealed. The appellate court reversed the trial court's judgment, holding that trade spending violated &sect; 125.33(1)(a) and that the statute was constitutional. The court found that the phrase &quot;thing of value,&quot; as used in &sect; 125.33(1)(a), was unambiguous and when the wholesaler's sales agents or employees bought beverages for a retailer's customers, the wholesaler was giving the retailer a thing of value within the meaning of &sect; 124.33(1)(a). The statute was constitutional because it was a reasonable and rational exercise of the state's police power and it was not unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The administrative rule in question required all air contaminant sources and their owners or operators to establish emission limitations for hazardous pollutants. Under the rule, hospitals as incinerators of infectious waste were treated differently. Appellants contended that the board had no statutory authority to promulgate the rule, and the hospital contended that the rule denied them equal protection of the law. The court held that the board was properly authorized but that there was insufficient evidence to deny the equal protection claim. The court held that: (1) appellants had standing to challenge the rule because their interests, including those of the association's members, were affected by the rule; (2) the board did not exceed its statutory authority because the elements of the enabling statute matched the rule against those elements; (3) where the constitutionality of an administrative rule was challenged, the existence of facts on which a reasonable justification depended, should appear in the record; and (5) because the record provided no factual basis for the classification, summary judgment should not have been granted supporting its constitutionality.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The city annexed a parcel of land containing no residences on its western border, pursuant to Wis.

One of the petitioning landowners testified that he did not know why respondent landowners' property was included in the annexation and that it was no concern of his whether the city desired to include it. The trial court found that although &sect; 66.021 was facially constitutional, the annexation was arbitrary and capricious. The court found that: (1) the trial court's finding that the city, not the petitioning landowners, determined the boundaries of the annexed territory was supported by ample evidence and was not clearly erroneous; (2) the boundaries of the annexation had to be scrutinized for an abuse of municipal discretion if the annexing municipality was shown to be the real controlling influence in direct annexation proceedings initiated by property owners; and (3) because the city failed to demonstrate a reasonable need for respondent landowners' property, the annexation violated the rule of reason and was invalid.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The legislature repealed a tax credit previously available to state utilities. The utility did not challenge the repeal, but other state utilities did so. During the pendency of the litigation, the utility paid its taxes without protest. The tax credit repeal was later held unconstitutional. The utility later sought a rate increase. The PSC found that the utility's failure to pay its taxes under protest was imprudent. The PSC determined a reasonable rate of return and deducted from that amount one tenth of one percent in setting the rate. The trial court affirmed the decision. On appeal, the court held that: (1) a finding of imprudence was warranted because the utility failed to take reasonable steps to protect its assets; (2) the PSC had wide discretion in determining factors upon which to set a rate schedule; (3) the PSC needed to consider imprudence only in setting the final rate, not in finding the zone of reasonableness; and (4) the court was bound to affirm the PSC's decision because imprudence was but one factor the PSC considered in setting rates, the &quot;remedy&quot; for imprudence was to be accorded great deference, and the PSC set a reasonable rate of return.</SPAN></P>

The court noted that it was not unreasonable for the officers to believe that defendant would conceal or dispose of the drugs. Defendant's paralysis prevented the officers from conducting a standard search and thus, the officers' search was not unreasonable given the extensiveness of the intrusion. Second, the court held that the informant's affidavit was sufficient because the informant gave lengthy details as to defendant's vehicle and the fashion in which he sold the drugs.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The putative father sought to establish his paternity with respect to two children born to the mother while married to her husband. The trial court initially ordered blood tests but then dismissed the action on the basis of the newly enacted Wis.

The court affirmed the trial court's decision and found that the putative father had no constitutionally protected liberty interest in a relationship with the children and thus no right to a blood test because those children were born into an extant marital family. Furthermore, the fact that the initial decision to order blood tests was upheld on appeal was not recognition of the putative father's right to a blood test. The court also found that &sect; 767.458(lm) was intended to be applied retroactively and that the putative father had waived his right to contest the constitutionality of its retroactive application because he did not raise the issue in the trial court.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The consignor failed to perfect its security interest in machinery loaned to the consignee by filing the proper financing statements. The loaned machinery bore tags indicating that it belonged to the consignor. The bank had a perfected security interest in the inventory, machinery, and proceeds of the consignee. The bank seized the consigned machinery after the consignee defaulted on loans with the bank. The consignor sought to recover the machinery, and the trial court held that the bank's security interest in the consignee's collateral had priority over the consignor's unperfected interest. The court affirmed, finding that the consignor's relationship with the consignee was governed by the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), Wis. Stat. ch. 402, 409, because the UCC predated the parties' agreement. The court held that the tags on the machinery did not give the consignor priority because there was no applicable sign posting law for consignors, and because the bank's perfected security interest had priority regardless of the bank's knowledge. The court held that the UCC did not impair the constitutional obligation of contracts provisions because the UCC preceded the claimed contract.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant company, whose newspaper was delivered free of charge to readers, disputed an order of the Circuit Court for Milwaukee County (Wisconsin), which entered summary judgment for plaintiffs, a rival corporation and its principal, in their action for declaratory and injunctive relief against the company and defendant City of West Allis, Wisconsin. The issue was which entity should have been awarded a contract for publishing legal notices.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The company's bid for the contract was significantly lower than plaintiffs' bid. On appeal, the court considered whether the company was qualified to publish the notices under Wis. Stat. &sect; 985.03(1)(a), pursuant to which a newspaper in which such notices were published had to have a bona fide paid circulation that was 50 percent or more of its circulation. The court rejected the company's argument that paid circulation meant payment from any source, including advertisers. Section 985.03(1)(a) was unambiguous and the City's contract with the company contravened &sect; 985.03(1)(a) and was void. The company's argument rendered parts of &sect; 985.03(1)(a) superfluous. The structure of Wis. Stat. &sect; 985.03 showed that the legislature intended to distinguish between a &quot;paid circulation&quot; and a &quot;circulation;&quot; there was no merit to the company's argument that the trial court's interpretation of Wis. Stat. &sect; 985.03(1)(a) violated the equal protection provisions of U.S. Const. amend. XIV, &sect; 1 and Wis. Const. art. I, &sect; 1. A strict scrutiny test was not required because no suspect class was involved and the legislative purpose in enacting Wis. Stat. &sect; 985.03(1)(a) was neither arbitrary nor irrational.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed. Wis. Stat. &sect; 342.06 did not require that the person who made the false statement be the one who submitted the application to the Department. The statute was clear. Also, a criminal statute must be sufficiently definite to give a person of ordinary intelligence who sought to avoid its penalties fair notice of conduct required or prohibited. Wis. Stat. &sect; 342.06(2) only punished a person who knowingly made a false statement in an application for a certificate of title. The jury found defendant knowingly made false statements.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The patient's complaint alleged his birth date and that he was admitted to the hospital and treated by the hospital, and the doctors.

The trial court dismissed the complaint on summary judgment motions based on the statute of limitations, pursuant to &sect; 893.55. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment that dismissed the hospital. There was no evidence of concealment by the hospital, and &sect; 893.55(1)(b) applied equally to adults and to minors in barring a suit after five years from the injury. Application of the statute did not violate the patient's constitutional rights as a minor. The court reversed the judgment with respect to the doctors because there were contested issues of fact that would determine whether the patient could rely on the tolling of the statute of limitations allowed in &sect; 893.55(2), where the doctors intentionally concealed their negligent acts.</SPAN></P>

Stat. ch. 227 review, affirmed a decision from the Tax Appeals Commission that sustained the decision by respondent Department of Revenue that the estate was not entitled to an income tax credit under the Farmland Preservation Credit statute,&nbsp;Wis. Stat. &sect; 71.09(11) (1977), and declared it to be constitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The estate consisted of the interests of the wife of the husband, who farmed land as a joint tenant with his wife. They had household income of $ 180,987, while she had income of $ 6000. She applied for an income tax credit under &sect; 71.09(11), which the Department denied because her household income exceeded the $ 38, 429 statutory threshold. The Commission and then the trial court upheld that determination and the trial court also declared &sect; 71.09(11) constitutional. On appeal, the estate contended that &sect; 71.09(11) was a tax statute within the meaning of the uniformity clause of Wis. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 1. The court affirmed without reaching the constitutional issue because it concluded that Wis. Stat. &sect; 71.09(11) was a relief statute and not a tax statute and therefore was not subject to the uniformity requirement. The court noted that the legislative purpose of &sect; 71.09(11) was to provide economic relief to needy farmland owners whose land was subjected to use restrictions in the nature of restrictive covenants. The estate also failed to show that the fiscal eligibility requirement was an impediment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff stockholder appealed an order of the Circuit Court for Racine County (Wisconsin), which granted to defendants, a corporation and its former president, motions for summary judgment in the stockholder's action that alleged that the corporation undervalued the stockholder's shares, demanded a declaration of the fair value of his shares, and sought damages in that amount.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The stockholder objected to a merger, and after the merger was approved, he made a written demand of the fair value of his stock. The stockholder did not present his stock certificates for notation on them of his demand for payment of fair value as required by Wis. Stat. &sect; 180.72. The trial court held that absent fraud or wrongdoing, &sect; 180.72 established the stockholder's exclusive remedy and because the stockholder did not fully comply with the statute, summary judgment in favor of defendants was proper. On appeal, the court agreed. The stockholder did not plead fraud or other illegality; the crux of his complaint was dissatisfaction with the price offered to him, which did not constitute fraud or illegality. The statute required strict compliance, and the doctrine of substantial compliance did not apply. The dissenting stockholder who failed to observe the requirements of &sect; 180.72 forfeited the right to judicial valuation of his stock. Thus, the statute was accompanied by a penalty for failure to comply, which made strict compliance mandatory. The statute was constitutional because it sought to enforce property rights, not abrogate them, and its provisions were reasonable.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the grant of defendants' motions for summary judgment.</SPAN></P>

Defendant claimed that he had a statutory right to a sentence credit and that the deprivation of that right condemned him to incarceration for a longer time than the period to which he was sentenced, in violation of his right to due process and to be free from double jeopardy.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In earlier proceedings, defendant sought sentence credit for the time he was hospitalized after his accident and arrest. The court concluded that defendant was not in custody and affirmed denial of defendant's motion for sentence credit. Defendant next brought a postconviction motion challenging, upon constitutional grounds, the denial of sentence credit. The court affirmed denial of sentence credit. There were three elements required for arrest: The suspect's freedom of movement was restricted; the arresting officer intended to restrain the person; and the person under arrest understood that he was in custody. Although defendant was arrested, the court specifically had rejected in the previous proceeding, and again rejected here, defendant's claim that he was in custody. Because defendant did not know of a hold request, the existence of that request was irrelevant. Viewed objectively, a reasonable person in defendant's position would not have understood that he or she was in custody. The court concluded that it reached the correct result in the earlier proceeding and, therefore, rejected defendant's claim.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In consolidated cases, the city sought review of a decision of the Circuit Court for Dane County (Wisconsin), which dismissed citations issued by a city police officer to defendants for their violations of the city's anti-noise ordinance, City of Madison, Wis., Madison General Ordinances &sect; 24.04(1), because it was unconstitutionally vague and overbroad.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants were professional musicians who were issued citations for violations of &sect; 24.04(1) while playing music one night in a mall area adjacent to a street. Traffic was limited on the street and the city encouraged use of the mall area for the public's recreation and entertainment. On the complaint of a nearby resident, a police officer came to the area, listened to defendants' music, and issued the citations. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment of the circuit court on the basis that &sect; 24.04(1) was unconstitutionally vague. The court found that &sect; 24.04(1) was not overbroad because the &quot;core&quot; conduct it intended to proscribe was the making of any noise that tended to unreasonably disturb the peace and quiet of persons in the vicinity. An overbroad statute was one designed to proscribe activities that were not constitutionally protected but operated to include activities protected by the First Amendment. Section 24.04(1) was unconstitutionally vague because it had no discernible boundaries in its application and did not place noise within boundaries sufficiently distinct for citizens, police, juries, and the courts to determine what conduct it proscribed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was the president and a stockholder of company. Defendant allegedly misrepresented his company as profitable when it was losing hundreds of thousands of dollars each year. The court rejected defendant's contention that Wis. Stat. &sect;&sect; 551.21(1), 551.24(5)&nbsp;unconstitutionally shifted the burden of proof from the state to defendant. The argument failed because the exemption provided for in the latter statute was not an element of the statutory offense in the former statute. The delegation of legislative authority in the provisions of &sect; 551.63(1) was not unconstitutional. The technical distinction between the types of commercial paper handled by the federal reserve system and those commonly marketed to the general public was best drawn by an agency rather than the legislature. Defendant was not prejudiced by the state's amendment of the charges from party to a crime to principal status because an individual that directly committed the crime was liable under the party-to-the-crime statute. The state was not required to prove intent to defraud before defendant could be convicted of the offenses charged, only a knowing commission of the acts charged.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's judgment. The court determined that the town failed to establish the elements of laches. The court found that the city's delay in filing the petition was not unreasonable, that the town should have known that the city intended to pursue its rights to the adjustment, and that the town suffered no prejudice from the delay. The court determined that Wis. Stat. &sect; 66.03 contained sufficient procedural safeguards to insure the due process rights of all the parties. The court also determined that &sect; 66.03 was not constitutionally deficient merely because it did not specify the method of valuation.

In affirming, the court concluded that the evidence was sufficient to support defendant's conviction. Evidence that defendant voluntarily and without reasonable excuse quit two jobs shortly after learning that child support payments would be withheld, and that defendant made no payments for an 11-month period despite a court order mandating that make such payments, was indicative of defendant's intent not to pay. Further, the fact that defendant received public assistance did not require the jury to find that defendant lacked the ability to make the required child support payments, and the evidence was sufficient to permit the jury to conclude that defendant avoided employment for the purpose of intentionally avoiding his support obligations.</SPAN></P>

In response, defendant looked into his leather jacket and started to reach for the inside breast pocket. The officer warned defendant to move his hands away from his jacket. The officers conducted a pat-down search of defendant for weapons but found none. The officers then requested identification from both men. As defendant removed his wallet, he also appeared to push something into the inside breast pocket of his jacket. The officer then opened defendant's jacket and saw a baggie, which later proved to contain cocaine. The court ruled that the second pat-down search was proper. Defendant's furtive gestures toward the inside of his jacket pocket would reasonably suggest that defendant possessed a weapon.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the extension and determined that: (1) the trial court had jurisdiction to hear the extension order because the expiration of the prior order was clearly specified by the date of the original order; (2) the extension order statute was not unconstitutionally vague because the criteria for extension of the order were well documented in the law; (3) the Department showed that it attempted to provide services but the mother refused to cooperate with requests; and (4) there was no demonstration that a complaint against the trial court on another issue rendered him impartial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Proceeding pro se, plaintiff landlord appealed a judgment from the Circuit Court for Walworth County (Wisconsin), which dismissed his complaint against defendants, a city and its light and water commission, and which found that the landlord's suit was frivolous.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The city passed an ordinance assessing a delinquent utility bill belonging to the landlord's tenant as an amount due on the landlord's real estate taxes. The landlord filed an action under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 as a result. The suit was dismissed in the trial court, in federal court, and again in the trial court when it was refiled. The landlord contended that res judicata did not bar his suit and that certain of his claims were not addressed. The court agreed that it was error to fail to address certain claims but otherwise upheld the trial court's judgment. First, res judicata prevented the landlord from subjecting the city to repetitive litigation. In any event, the existence of a state remedy precluded his &sect; 1983 claim as a legal cause of action. Second, no special benefit was required for assessment of the delinquent utility bill and the ordinance was not unlawful under Wis. Stat. &sect; 66.60. Third, the landlord could not establish beyond a reasonable doubt that the ordinance denied him equal protection of the laws. Finally, the landlord's knowledge of the appellate decisions in his previous cases should have led him to conclude that further pursuit of his claim was frivolous.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed that portion of the trial court's judgment finding two of the landlord's claims to be frivolous which the trial court did not previously address. The court affirmed the judgment in all other respects. The cause was remanded for an allocation of costs and attorney fees for the frivolous portion of the action in the trial court and on appeal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The child suffered brain damage immediately after birth. It was determined that child suffered from neonatal hypoglycemia. The parents alleged that they contacted several attorneys and other physicians but no one was able to assist in determining the cause of the hypoglycemia. Some 24 years later, the parents received a medical report indicating that the neonatal hypoglycemia was the result of medical malpractice. The trial court dismissed the action as time barred. On appeal the court affirmed. First, the court held that the claim was filed well beyond the three-year statute of limitation period. The court further noted that the action was not filed within one year after the child reached the age of majority pursuant to Wis. Stat. &sect; 330.205 (1959). Second, the court held that even if the discovery rule was applicable, the parents failed to exercise reasonable diligence in ascertaining the nature of the child's brain damage. The court concluded that where an otherwise healthy baby was brain-injured after birth by a known illness contracted while under the care of a physician in a hospital, reasonable diligence suggested further inquiry than what occurred in the present case.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The property owners filed a variance request with the Zoning Board, which the Zoning Board denied. The property owners filed a request for a writ of certiorari with the trial court, which the trial court denied. The property owners filed an appeal. In affirming the trial court's order, the court held that the Zoning Board operated within its discretionary authority when it denied the property owners' variances. The court found that the Zoning Board gave legitimate consideration to the concerns for the public health, safety, morals, and general welfare of the community and therefore concluded its denial of the variances was not arbitrary or unreasonable. The court stated that the ordinance had a reasonable and rational basis that called for the type of housing requested in the variance to be dispersed throughout the community without any over intensification in limited areas. The court concluded that the property owners failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the legislation violated the Equal Protection Clause. The court found that the property owners failed to cite any authority for their due process argument and thus deemed it abandoned.</SPAN></P>

The inmate sought compensatory and punitive damages under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983, declaratory relief under 28 U.S.C.S. &sect;&sect; 2201-2202, and injunctive relief.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The inmate alleged that defendants denied him procedural due process after an altercation with a correctional officer and placement in temporary lockup. The court concluded that defendants were not sufficiently involved in placing and continuing the inmate in temporary lockup for liability under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983. The court opined that defendants reasonably should have known that the inmate was entitled to adequate notice and an opportunity to present a defense, calling witnesses of his choice. The court pointed out, however, that the inmate had no constitutional right to an advocate of his choosing. The court held that the inmate had more than 24 hours to prepare a defense, but he was denied due process in not being provided with a statement from his requested witness, and he was entitled to a trial on damages. The court determined that the inmate received adequate notice of his disciplinary hearing under Wis. Admin. Code &sect;&sect; HSS 303.76(1), (3), 303.81, so he was not entitled to declaratory relief. The inmate did not claim any continuing, present adverse effects from his past exposure to defendants' alleged illegal conduct, so the court rejected his claim for injunctive relief.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the trial court's judgment in part, holding that the inmate was entitled as a matter of law to judgment that the hearing officer violated his due process rights to call a witness in his defense, and the cause was remanded to determine damages. In all other respects, the court concluded that defendants were entitled to summary judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The son was found to be a child in need of protection and services under Wis. Stat. &sect; 48.13(3) and (10) based on evidence that he was not getting sufficient nutrition, his home was not sufficiently heated, his sister threatened him with a knife and punched and pulled on his penis and genital area, and he was raped by a cousin. The court affirmed the orders of the trial court. Section 48.13(3) was not overbroad. The statute was jurisdictional and the relevant inquiry was not necessarily whether the parent was negligent. The statute also was not fatally vague. The terms used in &sect; 48.13 were not so uncertain that a person of ordinary intelligence must guess at their meaning. Likewise, the statute did not fail for not precisely delineating a parent's duty of care. The focus of the children's code was the best interest of the child. Moreover, it was not necessary for a nexus between the son's abuse and any act or omission by his mother to have been shown. Because there was ample evidence of sexual abuse, the court determined that there was no need to decide whether sufficient evidence supported the jury's finding of physical abuse.</SPAN></P>

A deputy sheriff from Iowa County had received a dispatch concerning the burglary and proceeded to the car's location, which was about 50 feet into Grant County. Defendant was taken into custody. A subsequent inventory of the car produced bags containing money that were identified as having been stolen from businesses in Iowa County.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The former director was permanently enjoined from serving as director or trustee of the nonprofit corporation and ordered to pay disgorgement and interest because he committed gross misconduct and breached his fiduciary duties. On review, the court held that the trial court did not clearly err when it ruled that the corporation was not a religious corporation, as defined in Wis. Stat. &sect;&sect; 776.46, 182.030, or Wis. Stat. ch. 187. Rather, it was a charitable corporation that made grants to religious organizations. Therefore the corporation was not excluded from the trial court's subject matter jurisdiction over the matter pursuant to Wis. Stat. &sect; 776.32(4). The court then found that the injunction did not interfere with the former director's constitutionally-protected right to free exercise of religion. With regard to the former director's culpability under &sect; 776.32(4), the court concluded that his abuse of power and fraud were contemplated under the term &quot;gross misconduct,&quot; and were not mere exercises of business judgment. The court rejected the former director's claim for indemnification from the corporation, and affirmed the judgment in favor of respondent officers.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted in the Circuit Court for Milwaukee County (Wisconsin) of first-degree sexual assault, Wis. Stat. &sect; 940.225(1)(b), and kidnapping while armed, Wis. Stat. &sect;&sect; 940.31, 939.63. Pursuant to Wis. Stat. &sect; 974.06, he moved the trial court to withdraw his guilty plea to the kidnapping charge. His motion was denied, and he sought review of the order.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The victim was walking to her place of employment when defendant approached her from behind and placed a knife to her throat. He then took the victim to an isolated area and sexually assaulted her. He initially pleaded guilty to first-degree sexual assault and kidnapping while armed and was convicted. He later sought to withdraw his guilty plea to the kidnapping charge. He appealed after the trial court denied his motion. On review, the court upheld the order. The court rejected defendant's argument that his conduct did not fulfill the element of kidnapping prescribing the intent to hold the victim to &quot;service against his will, &quot; and that because he misunderstood the scope of this element, his plea was not made knowingly and voluntarily. The court ruled that the word &quot;service,&quot; as it was used in Wis. Stat. &sect; 940.31, included acts done at the command of another and that it clearly embraced sexual acts performed at the command of another. The court found that it was clear that defendant not only intended to hold his victim to service against her will but actually did so. The court held that defendant knowingly and voluntarily made his plea.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The mother's parental rights were terminated primarily due to her drinking problem and her unsuccessful attempts to overcome it. On appeal from the order terminating her parental rights, the mother asserted that the trial court should have made an independent determination regarding her unfitness as a parent. The court affirmed the order. Specifically, the court held that Wis. Stat. &sect; 48.424(4) required the trial court to find the mother unfit once the jury had determined that the grounds for termination of parental rights existed. The court found that &sect; 48.424(4) was not unconstitutional because the object sought by the State was the protection of the rights and well-being of children and the statutory means for terminating the parental rights had a real and substantial relation to protecting children. Furthermore, the criteria set forth in &sect; 48.424(4) was not &quot;unreasonable, arbitrary, or capricious.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In tax proceedings, appellants, a railroad company and a corporation, sought review of an order of the Circuit Court for Douglas County (Wisconsin), which entered judgment in their favor against respondent city but awarded them post-judgment interest at a rate of five percent under former Wis. Stat. &sect; 74.73(1r) rather than at the requested 12-percent rate under Wis. Stat. &sect; 815.05(8).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The city was determined to be liable for tax refunds for taxes that were collected but later determined to be unconstitutional. On appeal from the trial court's order awarding postjudgment interest under former Wis. Stat. &sect; 74.73(1r), the court reversed. Section 74.73(1r) applied to unlawful taxes, not to taxes declared unconstitutional. The court determined that Wis.

Stat. &sect; 66.09, which applied to governmental bodies, applied, and that the legal rate of interest prescribed under Wis. Stat. &sect; 138.04 prescribed a rate of five percent. Wis. Stat. &sect; 66.09 mentioned nothing about the rate of interest to be paid. Furthermore, conflicts between statutes were not favored and would not be held to exist if the statutes could otherwise be reasonably construed. Therefore, the court determined that Wis.

Defendant was sentenced to the maximum sentences available and his postconviction motion was denied.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant pled guilty to the charges of attempted criminal damage to property, intimidation of a witness, and second-degree murder, all of which were designated as party to a crime. He was sentenced to nearly maximum sentences allowed for each crime. Defendant sought modification of his sentences in a postconviction relief motion. The motion was denied. Although the trial court failed to timely decide defendant's postconviction motions, pursuant to Wis. Stat. &sect; 809.30(2)(i), such a failure was not grounds for remand. The court affirmed, holding that the trial court did not err when imposing the maximum two and one-half-year sentence for attempted criminal damage to property, as defendant affirmatively approved the sentence and could not attack it on appeal. The court rejected defendant's contention that his first offender status required consideration, as the gravity of the offense reduced that first-offender status to insignificance. The allegations of cruel and unusual punishment, contrary to U.S. Const. amend 8 and Wis. Const. art. I, sec. 6, were not supported, and therefore, not reviewed on appeal. The victim impact statements were properly used in sentencing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The write-in candidate argued that votes that had been cast for him at the election for town chairman had been erroneously disallowed because the board of canvassers of the town had determined that because stickers bearing the write-in candidate's name had been pasted on the face of the ballots by voters, covering the name of the other candidate on the ballot, the disputed ballots had to be invalidated, which decision was affirmed by the circuit court. Reversing, the court held that &sect; 7.50(2)(f)'s prohibition against placing sticker votes over other names on the ballot was applicable only to straight party ballots. Therefore, because the election in question was nonpartisan, the votes at issue had been erroneously disallowed and the town clerk was required to issue a certificate of election to the write-in candidate. In reaching this conclusion, the court attempted to ascertain the legislature's intent in light of the strong preference to give effect to the will of the electorate when construing election laws.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Department determined that the corporate taxpayer had underpaid its state franchise taxes. The commission upheld the determination. On appeal, the trial court affirmed the decision. The corporate taxpayer appealed from that judgment, arguing that the Department had abused its discretion in directing a change in the corporate taxpayer's accounting methods which led to increased state franchise tax liability. The court affirmed, holding that its review was limited to whether the commission's determination was arbitrary or unreasonable. The court concluded that the Department reasonably and properly exercised its discretion to direct the change in accounting practices. The court was not convinced that the corporate taxpayer's recoupment claim was a grievance to the assessment. The court found that it was an equitable claim for an offset to the reassessment which was not barred from the commission's consideration by the taxpayer's failure to argue it to the Department. The court also noted that the apportionment formula resulted in an increase in the corporate taxpayer's state tax liability but that increases of 15 to 43 percent had been upheld.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff employer appealed from a judgment and an order of the Circuit Court for Rock County (Wisconsin), which affirmed a decision of defendant Labor and Industry Review Commission (LIRC) awarding educational vocational rehabilitation benefits to defendant employee. The employer contended that the LIRC's decision was unreasonable because it enabled the employee to improve upon his preinjury earning potential.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The employee lost the use of his left arm in an industrial accident while working for the employer. He was only 19 years old at the time and attending a community college part time. The LIRC's determination extended educational vocational rehabilitation benefits to allow the employee to obtain a degree in mechanical engineering. The court held that the LIRC properly accepted another state's determination that the employee was eligible for the program because the employee was a resident of the other state and the program was part of the Federal Rehabilitation Act. Instructional benefits under the Act were administered by the agency in the state where the handicapped person resided. However, the court reviewed the LIRC's decision for reasonableness. The employer argued that it was unreasonable and violated the provision of Wis. Admin. Code &sect; Ind. 80.49(4) that did not allow training beyond 40 weeks if it was primarily to improve the employee's preinjury earning capacity. The court held that LIRC's conclusion that additional training was warranted was reasonable because at 19 he had not yet established his full earning capacity.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed from his convictions for first-degree sexual assault, and sexual exploitation of a child. On appeal, he challenged the propriety of the investigation and search warrant that yielded the evidence supporting these convictions. He urged three arguments for dismissal of the action: (1) that the circuit court lacked jurisdiction because a necessary element of &sect; 940.203(4) (1985-86), importation, was manufactured by a government sting operation that set up the search situation; (2) that the conduct of the government in securing his conviction was outrageous to the extent that it denied him due process; and, (3) that the search warrant did not allege probable cause and was insufficiently particular. The gist of defendant's due process argument was that the government, aware that mere possession of pornography was no offense, contrived his importation of pornography. The court disagreed with defendant's contentions, and affirmed. The court found no due process violation, noting that although the government provided the opportunity, it was defendant who committed the crime. The court also found that there was probable cause to issue the warrant against defendant.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was a prisoner at a Wisconsin correctional facility. An interstate detainer charging aggravated robbery was lodged against him by Minnesota authorities and was received by the prison on April 5, 1988. A hearing was held on July 1, 1988. Defendant filed a motion to dismiss the detainer, which the trial court denied. Defendant appealed and contended that his procedural rights under the Interstate Agreement on Detainers Act were violated because he was not brought before a judge &quot;forthwith&quot; as required by Wis.

The court held that there was no indication that defendant knew of the 30 day requirement and therefore he could not have waived it.

Defendant argued &sect; 939.62 violated the Equal Protection Clause. The trial court found &sect; 939.62 was constitutional. On appeal, the court affirmed. In affirming, the court held that under an equal protection analysis, the court would uphold a statute if a rational basis existed to support the classification, unless the statute impinged on a fundamental right or created a classification based on a suspect criterion. The rational basis test was applied. That test provided that equal protection of the law was denied only where the legislature made irrational or arbitrary classification. The basic test was not whether some inequality resulted from the classification, but whether there existed any reasonable basis to justify the classification. The court held that the decision to treat repeat offenders differently served a legitimate governmental interest. Thus, &sect; 939.62 was not irrational because it subjected all repeat misdemeanor offenders to the same maximum sentence. Further, the court held that &sect; 939.62 was not unreasonable merely because different results could be reached in its application.</SPAN></P>

The two young men were taken to the emergency room. The nurse testified that she asked the friend what had happened and was told that the insured was running up behind a car, grabbing its bumper, and being towed behind it over icy streets. The arbitration panel found that the insured failed to meet his burden of proving that he was struck by an automobile whose driver was negligent or that any contact with an automobile was causally related to his injuries. The trial court granted the insurer's motion to confirm the award. The insured argued that award should be vacated because the arbitrators disregarded the law in failing to grant his motion to exclude the nurse's testimony. In affirming the award, the court found that the nurse's testimony was admissible since it was relating a prior inconsistent statement of a witness and that Wis.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of criminal trespass to a medical facility in violation of Wis. Stat. &sect; 943.145 in connection with his entry into an abortion clinic in order to protest. On appeal, he contended that the abortion clinic was not a &quot;medical facility&quot; as defined by the statute. Second, he argued that &sect; 943.145 was unconstitutional because it gave disparate treatment to labor and non-labor related speech, sought to suppress a particular viewpoint, and created a heckler's veto. Third, defendant argued that the trial court unduly restricted voir dire by refusing to allow inquiry into prospective jurors' attitudes about abortion. Finally, defendant claimed that the trial court impermissibly denied him the right to present a defense by refusing to allow the jury to consider coercion and the defense of others. The court noted that these precise issues had been recently decided by the Wisconsin Supreme Court in two other abortion-protest cases in favor of the State. Further, the court found that the trial court did not abuse its discretion during voir dire because the questions regarding abortion reached the threshold of sufficiency. Accordingly, the judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant challenged a judgment from the Circuit Court for Dane County (Wisconsin), which convicted him of three misdemeanor charges of unlawful use of a telephone, violations of Wis. Stat. &sect; 947.012(2). Counsel for defendant filed a no merit report pursuant to Anders and Wis. Stat. &sect; 809.32, and defendant did not respond to the report.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant pleaded no contest to unlawful use of a telephone. After his probation was revoked, he was sentenced to 33 months in prison as a repeat offender. In a consolidated appeal, after reviewing the record, the court concluded that any further proceedings would have been frivolous and without arguable merit. The trial court complied with the requirements set forth in Bangert to insure defendant had knowingly and voluntarily pleaded no contest. The trial court properly exercised its discretion in sentencing defendant after his probation was revoked. Committing these types of harassment offenses had become habitual for defendant, he had not responded to treatment or otherwise benefited from probation, and his continuing criminal acts posed a threat to society. These were proper factors to consider, and they justified sentencing defendant as a repeater. Defendant received effective assistance of counsel. His counsel had no choice but to accept the plea agreement in light of the evidence. Defendant's subsequent revocation and imprisonment was in no way attributable to errors of counsel. Any challenge to the constitutionality of Wis. Stat. &sect; 947.012(2) would have failed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed defendant's conviction for unlawful use of a telephone and relieved his appellate counsel of further representation of him on appeal.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The homeowners were cited for violating an ordinance that prohibited homeowners from keeping excessive amounts of garbage on their property. A default judgment was entered against homeowner one when he failed to appear in court and homeowner two lost at trial. Both homeowners appealed and the court affirmed. The court concluded that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to vacate the default judgment, that the issue with regard to service on the attorney general was moot, that the ordinance was constitutional, and that the penalty provision was correctly interpreted and applied. Because homeowner one was aware of the proceedings and charges against him and was given proper notice, there was no ground for vacating the default judgment entered against him. The court declined to hear the overbreadth challenge because the homeowners did not show any danger that the city's ordinance would infringe upon any first amendment protections of individuals not before the court. The trial court did not err when it determined that the phrase &quot;for each day the violation exists,&quot; applied to both the forfeiture and the jail sentence provisions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant father challenged an order of the Circuit Court for Racine County (Wisconsin), which dismissed his motion to modify child support arrears. The trial court concluded that Wis. Stat. &sect; 767.32(lm) prohibited it from modifying the father's arrears, and rejected the father's claim that &sect; 767.32(lm) was unconstitutional. Respondents were the county child support agency and an individual.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The father claimed that Wis. Stat. &sect; 767.32(lm) was unconstitutional, pointing out that prior to its enactment he had a cause of action under Wis. Stat. &sect; 767.32(1) to request a modification of his accumulated child support arrears. The father claimed that if Wis. Stat. &sect; 767.32(lm) deprived him of that cause of action, he was denied due process. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's order. The court noted that divorce was a statutory proceeding, and the rights and remedies of the parties were limited to those provided by the statutes. The exclusive procedure for revision of child support provisions was also provided by statute.Because the father's cause of action to modify his support arrears was created by statute, the state was free to eliminate it, unless by doing so the father was deprived of a vested right. The court held that child support payments were not vested rights; statutory changes could alter them. The court noted that the father was not deprived of life, liberty, or property by application of the revision of judgment statute to the child support provision, hence &sect; 767.32(lm) had not deprived the father of a constitutionally protected interest.</SPAN></P>

The trial court properly extended the hearing date on whether to extend foster home placement and that a hearing was not required before such an extension could be ordered. The mother failed to establish any due process right to a publicly-compensated attorney at an extension hearing, and she failed to show entitlement under the statutory provisions, Wis. Stat. &sect; 48.23(2)(b), (3).

Wis. Stat. &sect; 767. 32(1m), effective in 1987, limited the trial judge's power. A trial judge could not revise the amount of child support due prior to the date that notice was given of an action to revise the amount of support. The father was in arrears for the period between 1980 and 1988. The trial judge reduced the amount of the arrearage and reduced his monthly obligation. On appeal, the mother asserted that &sect; 767.32(1m) removed the trial judge's power to reduce or cancel child support arrearages. The court agreed and concluded that arrearages were included in the statutory language of child support due. It held that the statute was unambiguous, but even if it was ambiguous, &sect; 767.32(1m) was enacted to ensure that the State continued to receive federal funds. 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 654 required states to have laws necessary to improve child support enforcement effectiveness. 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 666(a)(9)(C) specified that such laws were required to provide that a child support judgment was not subject to retroactive modification.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The employee, who worked on a farm, was assisting another employee in removing a tractor cab's window when the window exploded in his face and injured his eye. He brought a personal injury action against the employers. The evidence at trial centered on the tractor and its maintenance. The employee requested a jury instruction stating that an employer had a common law duty to provide a safe place of employment. The trial court declined to give the instruction. The trial court submitted standard negligence and causation instructions and an instruction stating that an employer had a duty to provide and maintain a safe motor vehicle as well as to repair it. The jury returned a verdict for the employers. On appeal, the court held that the trial court properly declined to give the employee's requested instruction because the overall meaning communicated by the instructions submitted to the jury was a correct statement of law in light of the evidence adduced at trial. The court also held that the employee failed to preserve for review his argument that the farming exclusion from Wis.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant, the co-personal representative of an estate, challenged an order of the Circuit Court for Burnett County (Wisconsin), which dismissed the personal representative's action against respondent adjoining property owner upon finding that the personal representative's claim was barred by res judicata, that the adjoining property owner was protected by Wis. Stat. &sect; 30.122, and that the res judicata defense was not frivolous.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The adjoining property owner, who owned land on the lake near the estate's property, filled in an artificial ditch that had drained the lake. The filling caused the lake level to rise the flood the estate property. The Department of Natural Resources ordered the adjoining property owner to restore and maintain the ditch at his own expense. The trial court affirmed the agency decision. The estate brought an action for damages against the adjoining property owner. The trial court dismissed on grounds that the prior review of the agency decision was res judicata and barred the action and that Wis. Stat. &sect; 30.122 protected the adjoining property owner. The estate contended that res judicata did not bar the action, that the adjoining property owner's defense of res judicata was frivolous, and that &sect; 30.122 did not protect him from liability. On appeal, the court affirmed the ruling that the res judicata defense was not frivolous, but reversed the dismissal and finding that the adjoining property owner was protected. The court held that Wis. Stat. ch. 227 regulatory review had no substantive connection to the civil suit for property damage and was consequently not res judicata.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court upheld the ruling that the res judicata defense was not frivolous, but reversed the rulings that the proceeding was res judicata and that the adjoining property owner was protected from liability by statute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant, the Secretary of the Wisconsin Department of Health and Social Services, appealed from an order of the Circuit Court for Dane County (Wisconsin), which declared Wis. Admin. Code &sect; HHS 309.466(1)&nbsp;unconstitutional in plaintiff prisoner's action challenging the validity of &sect; HHS 309.466(1) and ordered the immediate release of the funds in the prisoner's account.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The prisoner was serving a life sentence. He filed a complaint challenging &sect; HHS 309.466(1), which allowed prison officials to withhold 15 percent of all money earned or acquired by inmates, up to a maximum of $ 500, and to deposit all such funds into a &quot;Mandatory Release Account&quot; for the individual inmate's use upon release from prison. In his complaint he argued that because of he was serving a life sentence, &sect; HHS 309.466(1) violated his right to due process and equal protection of the law. The trial court entered judgment for the prisoner. On appeal, the court reversed the judgment. There was no basis for any claim of a substantive due process violation because the prisoner had no inherent or absolute interest in his personal property while incarcerated. There was no procedural due process violation with regard to his limited property interest in the funds. There was no equal protection violation even though he was a lifer with no mandatory release date. The dual goals of promoting the successful reintegration of released prisoners into society and of preserving the limited state funds available for operation of the prison system were valid and substantial governmental aims.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed an order of the Circuit Court for Kenosha County (Wisconsin), which denied his motion to suppress evidence and from a judgment convicting him of operating a motor vehicle after his driver's license was revoked, fourth offense, in violation of Wis. Stat. &sect; 343.44(1).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A police officer observed defendant's vehicle traveling slower than the speed limit. The car caught his attention because he could not see a driver behind the steering wheel. The officer stopped the vehicle because he suspected that it was being driven by an unlicensed juvenile. When stopped, defendant could not produce a driver's license, and the officer determined that defendant's license had been revoked. Defendant pleaded not guilty to the charge against him. In addition, he filed a motion with the trial court to suppress evidence gleaned after the stop was made. Defendant argued that the stop was unconstitutional because the officer lacked reasonable suspicion to believe that a crime was being committed, making the stop unwarranted. The trial court denied defendant's motion. Defendant then pleaded guilty to the charge. The trial court adjudged him guilty and sentenced him to 90 days imprisonment with Huber privileges. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that the officer had reasonable suspicion to believe that the vehicle he observed was being driven unlawfully and that the officer's stop of defendant's vehicle did not violate his constitutional rights.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The employee was a bus driver fired after his fifth &quot;chargeable&quot; accident within a four-month period. The employee filed a grievance, which the employer denied. The employee's union found that the grievance lacked sufficient merit to take to arbitration. After dismissal of the employee's action alleging that the union breached its duty of fair representation, the employee pursued an action claiming that the employer violated his due process rights. The trial court granted partial summary judgment in favor of the employer, holding that the employee received adequate post-termination process. After trial, the jury returned a verdict finding that the pre-termination procedures were inadequate. The trial court entered a judgment NOV in favor of the employer on that claim. The court affirmed the partial summary judgment because the grievance/arbitration provisions of the employee's bargaining agreement provided adequate post-termination process. The court reversed the judgment NOV, which was nullified by an intervening United States Supreme Court decision, but it held that the employee waived his right to more than nominal damages by failing to request actual damages in the verdict.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The alleged nonmarital child conceded that his mother was lawfully married when he was conceived and born. Therefore, in order to show that he was a nonmarital child of the decedent, he had to overcome the presumptions of legitimacy and paternity codified in Wis. Stat. &sect;&sect; 891.39(1)(a), 891.41. Pursuant to those statutes, he had to overcome the presumption that he was a marital child by producing a clear and satisfactory preponderance of evidence that the man to whom his mother was married was not his father. The court agreed with the trial court that the offer of proof was insufficient to rebut the presumption of legitimacy that arose upon proof that his mother was married when he was conceived and born. The alleged nonmarital child offered no evidence that it was physically or biologically impossible for his mother's husband to have been the father of the son born to her during the marriage. Most of his evidence dealt with the decedent's acknowledgments of paternity and the nature of his relationship with the alleged nonmarital child. That evidence, however, was premature. The requirement that such a child first illegitimatize himself did not render the statute unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the order dismissing the petition of the alleged nonmarital child seeking a declaration that he was a child of the deceased for purposes of inheritance.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was charged shortly after his 18th birthday in the Circuit Court for Fond du Lac County (Wisconsin) as an adult with three counts of first-degree sexual assault committed when he was 15 years old. He moved to dismiss the charges for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and prosecutorial delay. Defendant sought appellate review of the denial of both motions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court held that defendant was subject to the adult court's jurisdiction because the determinative factor was his age on the date the action was filed, rather than his age when the alleged offenses were committed. The court held that the State successfully met its due process burden of showing that defendant was charged as an adult based solely on his age rather than as the result of intentional manipulation designed to avoid juvenile court jurisdiction. The court also held that the State acted with due dispatch in bringing the charges against defendant under the circumstances of the case at bar. The court held that defendant had a due process right not to be deprived of the potential benefits of juvenile jurisdiction through deliberate State manipulation designed to avoid juvenile jurisdiction. The court held that due process did not protect defendant from the loss of juvenile court jurisdiction due to the mere passage of time, absent manipulative intent by the State. The court held that the trial court's factual findings supported a finding that the State did not act with manipulative intent to avoid juvenile court jurisdiction and affirmed the orders entered below.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the trial court's finding that the period of time between the alleged incident's report and defendant's eighteenth birthday represented time spent on legitimate investigation and was not the product of intentional or negligent delay. The court held that the trial court's findings were not clearly erroneous and held that there was no intentional State manipulation. The court affirmed the trial court's orders.</SPAN></P>

When he reached majority the child brought an action against the father to determine paternity and for back child support. The trial court held that the action was barred by res judicata because of the illegitimacy agreement, and dismissed the action. The child appealed. The court held that because there was no judgment, res judicata did not bar the litigation of the child's paternity. The dismissal of the action for back child support was correct, however. The purpose of the illegitimacy agreement was accomplished; the child was supported to the age of majority. A child who had reached majority had no cause of action against a parent for an award of child support.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the trial court properly proceeded before the expiration of the third notice provided by the landlord. The tenants argued that the landlord filed the eviction action as retaliation for the tenants' threats of reporting building code violations. The court held that the trial committed reversible error in giving the jury an instruction that the landlord was prohibited from evicting the tenants solely for retaliation. The court concluded that retaliation was a defense to the eviction proceeding if the retaliation was a factor in the eviction, not the sole factor for the eviction.</SPAN></P>

At the preliminary hearing, the mother testified that defendant told her that he was running a tavern, doing odd jobs, and painting during the two years. The trial court found probable cause and bound defendant over for trial. Defendant then filed a motion to reduce the charges to misdemeanor nonsupport because the State failed to prove that defendant earned income for 120 consecutive days. The trial court granted defendant's motion. The State appealed. The court held that the State met its burden of proving all of the elements required for a violation of &sect; 940.27. Defendant was entitled to show as an affirmative defense that he had insufficient income to pay child support, but the State was not required to prove that defendant had income.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Three civilians and a police officer were injured and one police officer was killed as a result of the pursuit of defendant. The trial court convicted defendant of three violations of Wis. Stat. &sect; 346.17(3)(b) and three violations of Wis. Stat. &sect; 346.17(3)(d). Defendant contended that Wis.

The court determined that &sect; 346.17(b) unambiguously required proof that a defendant's conduct was a substantial factor contributing to property damage, great bodily harm, or death, or to any combination of those losses. The court explained that the term &quot;results in&quot; was a causative term and it sought to prohibit attempts to elude a traffic officer or marked police vehicle. The court noted that &sect; 346.17(b)-(d) was not void for vagueness because the statute prescribed the offense with reasonable certainty. The court concluded that the trial court's finding that defendant's conduct was a substantial factor in causing the collision was supported by ample evidence because had defendant stopped when he should have, the accident would not have occurred.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was arrested for unlawfully operating a motor vehicle while intoxicated, Wis.

Long after the time for appeal had expired, defendant moved to reopen and vacate the order and dismiss the case on grounds that the statute of revocation had been repealed and because the order of revocation was unconstitutional. The issue was whether the trial court abused its judgment. The court held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion. To permit defendant to reopen the case after the time for appeal had expired on grounds he could have raised on a direct appeal would have been tantamount to allowing him to extend the time for appeal beyond the statutory limit. Wis. Stat. &sect; 806.07 did not authorize the trial court to expand the time for appeal when the time for such appeal had passed.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 967.055(2). Defendant was charged with a second offense of operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of an intoxicant (OWI), and he claimed that &sect; 967.055(2) violated the separation-of-powers doctrine and failed to contain standards necessary for proper implementation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">When the citing officer discovered that the offense was defendant's second, he referred the matter for a criminal complaint, and without independently inquiring into the first charge, the prosecution prepared, signed, and filed a criminal complaint. The trial court refused a prosecution motion to amend the charge to a civil forfeiture, finding the 11 reasons supporting the motion to be contrary to public interest under &sect; 967.055(2), and defendant unsuccessfully challenged the constitutionality of that section. On review, the court held that a well-established presumption of constitutionality attached to all legislative acts, and that once the prosecutor failed to exercise his broad discretion in issuing the criminal complaint and the prosecution commenced, the charge became subject to judicial control under &sect; 967.055(2). The court found that the &quot;in the public interest&quot; standard was reasonable because it required an examination of all relevant factors concerning the public's interest in deterring drunk driving.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant husband and respondent wife sought review of the decision of the Circuit Court for Waukesha County (Wisconsin), which granted the wife's petition for a divorce, divided the marital estate, and denied the wife's motion to amend the divorce petition to include a cause of action based on Wis. Stat. &sect; 766.70.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The parties were divorced. The husband asserted that the trial court made numerous factual errors when dividing the marital estate. Valuation of assets, property division, and maintenance all rested within the sound discretion of the trial court. Because the trial court's decision was based upon a reasoned rationale, the court affirmed the division. The wife contested the trial court's denial of her motion to amend the divorce petition to include a cause of action under &sect; 766.70 for property damages resulting from the breach of the duty of good faith. Wis. Stat. &sect; 767.05 prohibited divorcing spouses from suing under Wis. Stat. &sect; 766.70. The court determined that Wis. Stat. &sect; 767.05 was constitutional. Wis. Stat. &sect; 766.70 was not designed to create remedies for women, but for partners in a marriage. Therefore, the prohibition in &sect; 767.05 was not gender biased simply because it could be used by a husband to undo an action under &sect; 766.70. Although &sect; 767.05(7) did create two classes of spouses, the classification was not unconstitutional. It was reasonable to merge all litigation between divorcing spouses into the divorce proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant city government sought review of a judgment rendered by the Circuit Court for Douglas County (Wisconsin), which held that it was required to refund plaintiff railroad company occupational taxes paid pursuant to a tax statute that was later deemed unconstitutional. The railroad company filed a cross-appeal, arguing that the trial court erred in the calculation of judgment interest it was entitled to collect.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The city collected taxes pursuant to Wis. Stat. &sect; 70.40(1) from the railroad company. The statute was later declared unconstitutional under the Commerce Clause by a court decision and the railroad company filed suit to collect its taxes paid. The trial court ordered the city to make a full refund plus prejudgment interest. The city appealed, claiming that it was not required to make a refund and the railroad company filed a cross-appeal, claiming that the trial court erred in the calculation of prejudgment interest. The court held that retroactive application of the decision, which held that the statute was unconstitutional, was proper because the decision did not establish a new principle of law, the retroactive application would not further or retard the operation of the new law, and retroactive application would not produce substantially inequitable results to the city because it was put on notice that the statute was unconstitutional. The court also concluded that the trial court erred in its calculation of interest because the railroad company was entitled to interest from the date it made payment, not when it filed a return, since the statute was void ab initio.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On appeal, defendant raised the issues of whether the trial court erred by admitting evidence of other bad conduct, whether newly discovered evidence required a new trial, and whether the trial court improperly imposed restitution on two sentences. The court held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it ruled that the conduct testimony evidence was relevant. After determining the relevancy of the other acts evidence, the trial court balanced the probative value of that evidence against the risk of unfair prejudice and ruled that the evidence was admissible. The court also held the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it denied the motion for a new trial because it found that were a reasonable jury to hear the new evidence, the result would not have been different. However, the State conceded that the trial court should not have entered a judgment of probation conditioned on restitution for the first two counts. Restitution could not be imposed for an offense for which defendant was sentenced to prison. Therefore, the court reversed that part of the judgment ordering restitution on the first two counts and otherwise affirmed the judgment.</SPAN></P>

Defendant asserted a right to a second trial because the court refused to submit to the jury the lesser-included offense of imperfect self-defense under Wis. Stat. &sect; 940.05(2).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of attempted first-degree murder. The trial court entered a judgment of conviction. Defendant did not appeal, and the time to take an appeal had long expired. Defendant offered no explanation for his failure to appeal, but filed a motion for post conviction relief. The trial court concluded that it should submit only attempted first-degree murder, the lesser-included offense of endangering safety by conduct regardless of life, and the perfect self-defense instruction. The State agreed that because the trial court properly instructed the jury on perfect self-defense, refusal to instruct on imperfect self-defense was reversible error and an appeal would have resulted in a new trial. However, defendant did not appeal his conviction, and the State contended that because the error was not constitutional, relief was unavailable under Wis. Stat. &sect; 974.06. The court agreed with the State's position and affirmed the judgment.</SPAN></P>

The use made of the alley by the easement user and her family, customers, and delivery vehicles was clearly open and visible. The family's acts of maintaining and improving the alley could have been deemed by the jury to be hostile, adverse, and based on an open claim of right because it was done in disregard or nonrecognition of the alley's true ownership during the 20-year period. The court rejected the landowner's contention that the action was barred by laches.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In two consolidated appeals, appellant city sought review of an order and a judgment by the Circuit Court for Milwaukee County (Wisconsin), which both held that the city had a mandatory duty to provide uninsured motorist coverage under Wis. Stat. &sect; 66.189. In one of the appeals, respondent police officer cross-appealed the judgment that respondent insurer was an excess insurance carrier.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The first case involved a police officer who was hit by an uninsured motorist. The second case involved a passenger in a police squad car that was struck by an uninsured motorist. Both the police officer and the passenger had insurance with the insurer. In both cases, the circuit court found the city to be primarily liable. The central issue in both appeals was whether the city had a mandatory duty to provide uninsured motorist coverage under Wis. Stat. &sect; 66.189. The court held that (1) &sect; 66.189 was unambiguous and required the city to provide uninsured motorist coverage for officer-employees and passengers; (2) the insurer was not required to enforce &sect; 66.189 through a writ of mandamus; (3) the court refused to exercise its discretion to determine the constitutionality of &sect; 66.189 as allegedly violative of the public purpose doctrine; and (4) the insurer's insurance coverage was not excess and the insurer was liable for a prorated share of the police officer's damages up to its policy limits. The judgment in the first case was affirmed in part and reversed in part. The order in the second case was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the property owner was correct that certain defenses were not barred by res judicata because the defenses were not relevant to the prior proceeding and were not actually litigated.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant beauty salon sought review of a judgment of an order of the circuit court for Dane county (Wisconsin) that affirmed an order of appellee Cosmetology Examining Board suspending the beauty salon's license for 30 days. The board found that the beauty salon aided in the unauthorized practice of cosmetology, contrary to Wis. Stat. &sect;&sect; 458.09(4), 458.13(1), and 458.14(2).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The beauty salon's license was suspended following a judgment that it had aided in the unauthorized practice of cosmetology. The salon had allegedly aided in the unauthorized practice of cosmetology by employing unlicensed persons to render cosmetology services to patrons on two occasions, and by permitting the beauty salon to operate on three occasions without the manager of record, a licensed manager or a qualified designee on the premises. The court affirmed the judgment except for the charge that a licensed barber had provided cosmetology to one of the salon's patrons and that the salon had aided in the unauthorized practice of cosmetology. The court found that &sect;&sect; 458.09(4), 458.13(1), 458.14(2)(h), and the administrative regulations did not establish that the cutting of hair by a licensed barber in a beauty salon constituted the unauthorized practice of cosmetology. Because there was no substantial distinction between cosmetology and barbering, the court found that the allegation was not proved. The court found that the salon did not substantially comply with the licensing requirements and affirmed the remainder of the trial court's judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The victims were defendant's children and her nephews.

On review, the court held that, to resolve the conflict between the rape shield law and defendant's constitutional rights, the Davis balancing test was to be applied, which required that defendant be allowed limited inquiry into the prior sexual assault for the purposes of negating the inference that the testifying victim's sexual knowledge was gained from defendant's alleged assault. On remand, the trial court was to restrict the testimony where necessary to avoid embarrassment or humiliation of the testifying victim while at the same time protecting defendant's right to put her defense theory before the jury. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in prohibiting testimony of prior untruthful allegations of sexual assault made by the victim because its probative value was outweighed by the confusion that would ensue.</SPAN></P>

In affirming, the court held that the warrant authorized the seizure, that a separate warrant was unnecessary to examine the safe's contents, and that the trial court properly refused to order the disclosure.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff judgment lienholder challenged the decision of the Circuit Court for Dane County (Wisconsin) that granted the summary judgment motion of defendant county and dismissed his action to collect a judgment lien on a parcel of real estate that the county had obtained through a tax deed. When the county sold the property, the lienholder sought imposition of a constructive trust on the proceeds and an order directing the county to pay his lien.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The lienholder argued that because the county did not notify him that it was selling the property for taxes and because it retained the surplus funds over and above the taxes due on the property, his constitutional rights to due process and equal protection were violated. The court affirmed the judgment. The court explained that a judgment lien was not a lien on any specific real estate of the judgment debtor but was a general lien on all of the debtor's real property. The court reasoned that, as a result, the lienholder did not have the type of property interest that entitled him to specific notice of the county's intention to take a tax deed to the property in question. The court found that a procedure allowing tax sales to proceed without requiring the county to search out and notify all general lienholders of its intent to take title to the property advanced a governmental interest. And, therefore, the court opined, that by establishing such a procedure, the legislature had not unconstitutionally classified public and private lienholders.</SPAN></P>

The Department assessed tax on the taxpayer's capital gains on the property. The taxpayer argued that he served as his fiancee's agent in the transaction and did not incur gains on the property. The trial court affirmed the Department's assessment. The taxpayer appealed. The court found no error in the trial court's decision. The taxpayer and his fiancee, both attorneys, failed to include any agency language in the purchasing documents.

The trial court ruled that the action was barred by the six-year statute of limitations provided in Wis. Stat. &sect; 893.89.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The contractor constructed a concrete foundation for a building on the owners' farms using concrete supplied by the concrete company. The owners contended that because of allegedly defective concrete and negligent construction, the foundation cracked and collapsed. The owners argued that &sect; 893.89 was unconstitutional because it denied them due process and equal protection. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment. The court reviewed its recent opinion concerning similar issues and held that &sect; 893.89 did not violate Wis. Const. art. I, &sect; 9 because six years after substantial completion, the owners no longer had a legally recognized right for which they were denied a remedy. The court concluded that the legislative declarations of policy, which were to cut off claims at some point and to distinguish owners from those associated with the construction of the building on the basis of possession and control, provided a rational basis for the classifications &sect; 893.89 created. Further, the court found that in &sect; 893.89 the legislature had expressly dictated that the limitations period began to run on substantial completion of construction, and thus the discovery rule did not apply.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant challenged an order of the Circuit Court for Dane County (Wisconsin), which convicted him on a jury verdict of two counts of second-degree sexual assault in violation of Wis. Stat. &sect; 940.225(2)(a). The issues involved Wisconsin's rape shield law, Wis. Stat. &sect; 972.11(2)(b)1, and the exclusions permitted by Wis. Stat. &sect; 971.31(11).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant claimed that evidence of his past relationship with the victim was improperly excluded. The trial court held that the evidence was neither material nor relevant to the issue of consent. The court found that the trial court allowed defendant great leeway in questioning the victim about various aspects of their sexual relationship, pursuant to Wis. Stat. &sect; 972.11(2)(b)1. In the court's view, the jury was made aware of a wealth of details. The additional evidence that defendant wished to present included events from months before the assault and other written and pictorial materials that had no reasonable bearing on whether the victim consented. Thus, the evidence was excludable under Wis. Stat. &sect; 971.31(11). Regarding defendant's claim that his prior bad acts were admitted in error, the court opined that the exceptions in Wis. Stat. 904.04(2) were illustrative rather than exhaustive. Thus, the jury was entitled to hear defendant's prior bad acts to complete the picture that defendant developed on cross-examination of the victim. The court declined to use its discretionary reversal power because the evidentiary issues were properly decided.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant challenged a decision from the Circuit Court for Dane County (Wisconsin), which convicted him on six counts of burglary and sentenced him to a total of 15 years' imprisonment, consecutive to an out-of-state sentence and ten years probation, consecutive to the prison term.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was denied parole in 1985, 1986, and in 1987 because he had not served sufficient time for punishment and his release posed an unreasonable risk to the public. Defendant argued that Wis. Stat. &sect; 57.06(1) was amended effective in 1983 to change the parole eligibility threshold from one-half the minimum term prescribed by statute for the offense to 25 percent of the sentence imposed. The trial court concluded that defendant had not shown a new factor and denied defendant's motion to modify his sentence. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment. The court noted that defendant was correct that a retroactive application of an amendatory statute, which increased the period of time a prisoner was required to serve before he was eligible for parole consideration violated the ex post facto clauses under Wis. Const. art. I, &sect; 12 and U. S. Const. art. I, &sect; 9. However, defendant's remedy was to challenge that application by seeking review of the parole board's decision by certiorari or through a mandamus proceeding. The court held that a sentence modification was an inappropriate remedy for an unconstitutional application of parole eligibility rules and practices.</SPAN></P>

The board upheld a city building inspector's grant of the permit even though the proposed development did not conform to limitations on the use of the property contained in a city zoning ordinance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A former owner of the land on which the building was to be constructed had petitioned the city to rezone the property from single- to multiple-family residential use. The petition was granted, on the express condition that the building conform to the plans as submitted and that, in the event that the condition was not complied with, the property would automatically revert back to the single-family classification. When a new owner subsequently sought a building permit for a proposed apartment complex, which differed from the original submitted plans, the city building inspector determined that the imposed conditions were invalid. On appeal from the trial court's ruling that the conditions were arbitrary and unenforceable, the landowners argued that the board lacked the authority to declare the zoning ordinance arbitrary. The court, in reversing the trial court's decision, agreed and determined that the board had exceeded its powers. The court, noting that the board made no factual findings and gathered no evidence, found that the board's powers were limited, under Wis.

The court concluded that the test results were inadmissible, but that any error was harmless because there was sufficient admissible evidence to support defendant's conviction. The court held that the evidence of the test results was barred by Wis. Stat. &sect; 343.303, as the preliminary test was only admissible to show probable cause for an arrest or to prove that a chemical test was required. The court held that the testimony of the police officer, stating that he smelled alcoholic beverages, provided sufficient evidence to support the conviction.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the conviction, concluding that the valid decision to charge defendant with a continuing offense justified the six-year timeframe in the complaint and that any evidentiary error was harmless. The court reasoned that the victim testified that the incest occurred for several years, that the timeframe was selected to comply with the limitations period, and that defendant had adequate information to allow him to prepare a defense. The court also held that, although there was no basis for allowing the expert to be present throughout the trial, there was no evidence that either the verdict or his testimony would have been different if he had been sequestered. The court further determined that the other evidence of guilt was so overwhelming that defendant would have been convicted even if the victim had not been allowed to testify as to the photos.</SPAN></P>

The court could not conclude that the trial court should have found a reasonable likelihood of community prejudice. Pretrial publicity was substantial, but the media accounts were primarily informational. The court further found that the testimony of a five-year-old witness was consistent with established physical facts to provide a sufficient basis for the jury to find that petitioner participated in the killing. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in rejecting the request that the witness's testimony be stricken and a new trial ordered.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Fund and the Trust were mutual money market funds, which distributed substantially all of the income earned to their shareholders. The Fund invested solely in direct obligations of the federal government -- U.S. Treasury bills, notes, and zero coupon securities. The Trust invested exclusively in treasury obligations and those of other federal agencies, such as Federal Home Loan Banks. The Trust also entered into repurchase agreements, through which it purchased government obligations from third parties, normally banks, pursuant to a contract in which the bank agreed to repurchase the obligations from the Trust on a specified date and at a set price and rate of interest. The Fund, the Trust, and several investors brought a declaratory judgment action after the Department interpreted the Wisconsin income tax statutes as applying to the shareholder distributions. The trial court ruled that such an interpretation violated the provisions of 31 U.S.C.S. &sect; 3124(a). The court affirmed in part and reversed in part, concluding that the state could not tax any of the investment distributions, but that distributions based on income from the Trust's repurchase agreements were taxable.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 893.80(4). On cross-appeal, the commission sought costs and attorney fees pursuant to Wis. Stat. &sect;&sect; 814.04(9), 823.08(4).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The landowners were farmers. Their property lay adjacent to drainage ditches Nos. 3, 4, and 8, which the commission controlled and managed. The commission removed stop logs from dams 12 and 53. The landowners claim that that caused substantial widening and deepening of the ditches resulting in soil erosion, destruction of trees and vegetation, and that it decreased property and crop values. The trial court entered judgment in favor of the commission. On appeal, the court held that the trial court's finding that the commission had balanced the competing interests in making the stop log decision was supported by the record and was not clearly erroneous. Defendants' decisions were policy decisions inasmuch as they were the result of a conscious balancing of risks and advantages. The commission was entitled to Wis. Stat. &sect; 893.80(4) immunity. Whether to award equitable relief was within the trial court's discretion. The facts cited by the trial court did not support its conclusion that the landowners' request for an order was barred by &quot;unclean hands.&quot; With regard to the cross-appeal, the commission could not recover costs and attorney fees under Wis. Stat. &sect; 814.04(9) or &sect; 823.08(4).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the ruling that defendants were immune from suit, reversed the trial court's denial of the landowners' request for equitable relief, and remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant insurer sought review of a judgment and order from the Circuit Court for Shawano County (Wisconsin), which dismissed its complaint against respondents, a worker who installed electrical wiring in the building of involuntary appellants, the insureds, and the worker's insurer. The action was dismissed because it was not commenced within six years as required by Wis. Stat. &sect; 893.89.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In 1978, the worker installed electrical wiring in a building being constructed for the insureds. In 1986, a fire destroyed the building and its contents. The insurer made a payment to the insureds and then sued the worker and his insurer for defective workmanship in 1978. The building was substantially completed more than six years before the fire. The trial court dismissed the action pursuant to &sect; 893.89, which provided that a six-year statute of limitations began to run upon the substantial completion of construction for actions against those involved in construction. The court upheld the dismissal. First, the court held that the insurer lacked standing to challenge &sect; 893.89 on the basis of a denial of equal protection because neither it nor its insureds were denied the protection provided by the statute of limitations under the facts of the case. Thus, they were not members of the class subject to the unequal protection of which they complained. Second, the court held that &sect; 893.89 did not run afoul of Wis. Const. art. I, &sect; 9 because six years after substantial completion, the insurer no longer had a legally-recognized right for which it was being denied a remedy.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiffs appealed the order from the Circuit Court for Milwaukee County (Wisconsin), which dismissed their complaint against defendants that alleged (1) violation of 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983; (2) assault and battery; (3) intentional infliction of emotional distress; (4) invasion of privacy; (5) malicious prosecution and abuse of process; and that (6) Wis. Stat. &sect; 813.12 was unconstitutional on its face and in its application.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff wife alleged that the trial court improperly sustained the constitutionality of Wis. Stat. &sect; 813.12, and that the trial court erred as a matter of law in dismissing all of her causes of action. Plaintiff's constitutional challenge consisted of five parts: (1) inadequate notice of hearing and denial of a pre-TRO hearing; (2) denial of the right to a jury; (3) vagueness; (4) overbreadth; and (5) denial of equal protection. Plaintiff alleged inadequate notice of the injunction hearing and the nature of the charge, and no hearing prior to the issuance of the ex parte TRO on the domestic abuse charge. When the rights of a person were affected by judicial or quasi-judicial decree, adequate due process required that the notice must reasonably convey information about the proceedings so that respondent could prepare a defense or make objections. The court found that the facts asserted in the petition formed the basis for the claim of domestic abuse, placed plaintiff on notice of the claim, and provided her with circumstances to formulate a defense or raise objections. The seven-day notice was sufficient for due process purposes. The court affirmed in part and reversed in part.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed as to the statute's constitutionality. Because the trial court improperly dismissed the assault and battery action against defendant husband, the court reversed and remanded. Because the remaining claims constituted a collateral attack on the injunctive order of the family court commissioner; the court reversed and remanded with directions.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff insurer appealed an order of the Circuit Court for Jefferson County (Wisconsin) that granted summary judgment to defendants, a general contractor and architect, ruling that Wis. Stat. &sect; 893.89 barred a subrogation action, and dismissed a claim against defendant, the manufacturer of the allegedly defective fireplace and chimney, on the basis of laches.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">An apartment building burned four years after its substantial completion. The insurer paid the owner's claim and over two years later filed an action against the architect, general contractor, and the manufacturer of a fireplace and chimney that had allegedly caused the fire. The trial court ruled that the action against the contractor and architect was barred by Wis. Stat. &sect; 893.89, which established a six-year limit for commencing actions based on improvements to real property. The trial court held that the insurer was guilty of laches where the manufacturer's right of contribution against the contractor and architect was precluded by &sect; 836.89. In reversing the dismissal of the claim against the manufacturer, the court held that the trial court exceeded its discretion because laches did not apply in an action at law and the insurer had no duty to protect the manufacturer's right of contribution. Where 18 months had passed between the insurer's payment of the claim and the commencement of its subrogation action, the insurer lacked standing to challenge the constitutionality of &sect; 836.89 because the dismissal was the result of its own delay rather than the statutory bar.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed and remanded that part of the judgment that dismissed the insurer's claim against the manufacturer, and affirmed the grant of summary judgment to the architect and general contractor.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed from an order of the Circuit Court for Milwaukee County (Wisconsin), which denied his Wis. Stat. &sect; 974.06 motion for postconviction relief. Defendant was convicted of first-degree murder as party to a crime and attempted robbery as party to a crime. The court of appeals had affirmed his conviction and the Wisconsin Supreme Court had denied his petition for review before defendant filed his &sect; 974.06 motion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In his motion for postconviction relief, defendant contended that: (1) the evidence was insufficient to convict him for first-degree murder as party to a crime; (2) his conviction for first-degree murder violated his right to due process; (3) he was deprived of due process when the trial court improperly instructed the jury; (4) he was denied a fair trial by the state's alleged failure to fully disclose the plea agreement offered to one of the witnesses against him; (5) Wis. Stat. &sect; 939.05, the party to a crime statute, was unconstitutional; (6) allegedly prejudicial remarks in the prosecutor's opening and closing statements denied him a fair trial; and (7) he was denied effective assistance of counsel at trial and on appeal. The court affirmed the denial of defendant's motion. Regarding the first two claims, the court held that defendant had challenged the sufficiency of the evidence in his direct appeal and could not relitigate the issue. The court further held that the trial court properly instructed the jury, that the statute was constitutional, that the prosecutor was allowed to give his opinion of the evidence, and that defendant received effective assistance of counsel.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The prosecutor brought a charge against defendant for felony intimidation of a witness after he was acquitted of committing battery on a woman. Defendant was found guilty and appealed. The court held that the criminal statutes,&nbsp;Wis. Stat. &sect; 940.42 and Wis. Stat. &sect; 940.43, were not unconstitutionally vague because the statutes alerted a person of ordinary intelligence to the type of conduct that was prohibited and the phrase 'implied threat of force' was not overbroad because it was not so sweeping that its sanctions could be applied to conduct that the state was not permitted to regulate. The court also stated that defendant was not entitled to a prosecutorial vindictiveness presumption because defendant failed to prove a realistic likelihood of vindictiveness and the prosecutor only charged defendant with an offense after he was acquitted of the battery charge. Further, the court noted that the complaint had no material omission and the trial court did not abuse its discretion in not severing the intimidation charges since defendant failed to prove substantial prejudice. Finally, the court concluded that defendant received effective assistance of counsel and denied his appeal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant police officers (officers) challenged the order of the Circuit Court for Milwaukee County (Wisconsin), which denied their petition for a writ of certiorari and upheld the disciplinary action taken against the officers by respondent Board of Fire &amp; Police Commissioners for the City of Milwaukee (board). Such disciplinary action arose out of the officers' failure to render aid, one officer's excessive force, and the death of a suspect.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The suspect was stopped by the officers. A struggle ensued, and the officers used force to subdue him that included putting a knee on the suspect's neck. The suspect became motionless, could not be roused with an ammonia capsule, and had a rapid pulse and trouble breathing. Although the officers were aware of the suspect's condition, they gave no aid to him and he died. The officers were suspended without pay, and one officer was discharged. The trial court's order, which the court affirmed, upheld the disciplinary action. The court held that the officers' conduct fell within the &quot;hard core&quot; of Milwaukee, Wis., Police Dept. R. &amp; Regs. 4, &sect; 67, which stated that an officer who failed to render first aid whenever necessary would be charged with a neglect of duty. Rule 4, &sect; 67 was not unconstitutionally vague just because it required the exercise of some discretion. Ordinary men of common intelligence would have known that first aid was required. The suspension of the officers prior to the disciplinary hearing and the failure to adjourn the hearing pending the criminal matter against certain of the officers failed to show the board's alleged bias.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 32.19(4m)(a)1.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The property owners sought to have declared unconstitutional the Wisconsin statute setting a $ 50,000 limit on business replacement damages in eminent domain proceedings. They claimed that the limit was contrary to Wis. Const. art. I, &sect; 13, which provided for just compensation for property taken for public use. The property owners were business partners whose commercial location was acquired by the city in order to complete a street expansion project. The city conceded that the type of damages contemplated under Wis. Stat. &sect; 32.19(4m) exceeded $ 50,000, even after adjustments for a larger replacement facility. The trial court granted the City's motion for summary judgment. On appeal, the property owners argued that their situation was similar to one in which a 12-month limit for rental losses caused by condemnation were held unconstitutional. The court held that the case under consideration differed because rental damages bore a direct relationship to fair market value and that business replacement expenses, and traditional incidental damages, such as moving expenses, did not. The court held that the statute limiting the property owners' damages was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The inmate sought a ruling on the validity of certain prison rules. The prison officials filed a motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction because the inmate did not serve the Joint Committee for Review of Administrative Rules (JCRAR) with a copy of his petition until more than 60 days after he filed his declaratory judgment action. The trial court held that Wis. Stat. &sect; 893.02 voided the late service on the JCRAR and deprived it of jurisdiction over the action. The court rejected the prison officials' contention that Wis. Stat. &sect; 227.40(5), which allowed the JCRAR to become a party to the proceedings upon approval of the legislative organization committee, elevated the JCRAR to de facto status as a party defendant to the action so as to invoke the 60 day service provision of Wis. Stat. &sect; 893.02. The court held that while the JCRAR had a right to become a party to the action, it could only do so after approval by another legislative committee and as such, it was not automatically a party by operation of law. Thus, the JCRAR was not subject to the 60 day service requirement of &sect; 893.02 and the inmate's late service on the committee was not fatal to his action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the trial court's dismissal of the inmate's action and it remanded the case for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The residents brought an action for a declaratory judgment to invalidate a county zoning ordinance that relocated the county fair. The trial court dismissed the residents' complaints. The residents sought review of the trial court's ruling. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's decision, finding that the trial court did not err in treating motions to dismiss as motions for summary judgment under Wis. Stat. &sect; 802.06(2) because the parties did not object. The court also ruled that the trial court's dispositive order did not give leave to the residents to replead and that the resident's failure to notify the attorney general pursuant to Wis. Stat. &sect; 806.04(11) of their constitutional claim did not void the trial court's order because the trial court did not reach that claim. The court held further that the county's approval of ordinance did not violate Wis. Stat. &sect; 59.97(5)(e)4 and that the county did not engage in spot or contract zoning. The court also found that the resident's claim under Wis.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Circuit Court for Ashland County (Wisconsin), which entered convictions against him for three counts of first-degree sexual assault, repeater, one count of abduction, repeater, and an order denying his motion for a new trial or for a sentence modification. Defendant asserted on appeal that his arrest was illegal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On appeal from his convictions, defendant argued that his arrest was illegal because the officers lacked probable cause and used the probation officer and the probation hold order as a subterfuge to arrest him. Defendant further contended that Wis. Admin. Code &sect; HSS 328.22(1), under which the probation officer authorized his apprehension, was unconstitutional. The court rejected defendant's contentions and affirmed. Specifically, the court held that where the victim's initial description of the assailant fit defendant, the assailant told the victim he was a rapist, defendant been convicted of two prior rapes, and the vehicle tracks at defendant's parents' residence were visually similar to the tracks left at the scene of the assault, there was probable cause for his arrest. Furthermore, the court found that because &sect; HSS 328.22(1) was constitutional and the probation officer had a reasonable basis to believe that defendant had engaged in assaultive conduct, the trial court's finding of a bona fide probation hold request was not clearly erroneous.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant property owners challenged an order of the Circuit Court for Winnebago County (Wisconsin), which granted the motion for summary judgment that respondent Winnebago County (Wisconsin) filed in the action in which the owners challenged the validity of the county's condemnation of the owners' farm for the purpose of constructing a landfill on that site.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The owners alleged that disputed material facts existed as to if the county could have reasonably expected to achieve the stated public purpose, that the county did not negotiate in good faith toward an agreed price prior to the condemnation, and that it was not reasonably necessary to acquire a part of the farm as a source of covering soil and as an environmental buffer zone. The court affirmed the grant of summary grant, concluding that that county made a prima facie case for condemnation. The court reasoned that the funds that were needed to buy the farm would have been available, that the county would have been able to resolve the environmental and the town's issues, and that the farm was the only available site for the needed landfill. The court also held that the licensing process did not present a material dispute as to if the taking is for a public use and that obtaining a valid appraisal and ceasing the efforts to buy the farm on learning that the owners would not sell for any price that the county was willing to pay showed good faith. The court further determined that the need for the buffer and for the source of topsoil was shown to be reasonable necessary.</SPAN></P>

The court also held that defendant did not hear that admonition because she was late for the hearing because she chose to stay at school and to pick her mother up prior to attending the hearing of which defendant had full knowledge. Noting that defendant had ample notice of the hearing date and had shown a lackadaisical attitude toward meeting the deadlines in the proceedings, the court further determined that the circuit court validly ruled that her tardiness waived her right to be informed of the requirements of &sect; 345.43(1).

It was determined that the child was suffering from a ruptured hollow viscus in the abdomen, with fluid peritonitis present. During surgery the doctors found a laceration in the child's stomach. Although the laceration was sutured, the child died the following morning. It was determined that the stomach laceration was due to a blunt force of trauma. It was determined that the injury was inflicted upon the child and that his death was not accidental. Defendant was convicted of second-degree murder. On review, defendant's major assertion was that the lesser-included offense of reckless homicide should have been given. The court reversed and remanded. The court held that because there was a void in the evidence concerning defendant's specific conduct it had to conclude that viewing the evidence in light most favorable to defendant that submission of the lesser included offense of reckless homicide was required.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant claimed that the juvenile propositioned him. The juvenile accused defendant of rape.

The trial court convicted defendant of third-degree sexual assault pursuant to &sect; 940.225(3) and sentenced defendant to four years incarceration to be served consecutively with the term he was serving as result of parole revocation. On defendant's appeal, the court reversed the decision of the trial court and remanded the case to the trial court with directions. The court determined that U.S. Const. amend. VI and Wis.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The county condemned the property owners' land to construct a county jail. The trial court dismissed their appeals because they were not filed within 60 days of the taking award. The property owners argued that Wis.

The court affirmed. As long as the statutes' classification had a reasonable basis, they did not deny equal protection of the laws. The two condemnation procedures covered two distinct classes of condemnation: transportation and all others. The procedural differences between the statutes were rational, and thus constitutional. The legislature could rationally conclude that transportation condemnation were best served by an early transfer of title, as the number of claimants and real estate parcels processed justified a more flexible procedure. The legislature could also rationally conclude that nontransportation condemnations were better served by a later transfer of title given the small number of claimants and parcels, which allowed a more restricted procedure.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On appeal, the issues were: (1) Whether the taxpayers had standing to attack &sect; 46.26(4)(a); (2) Whether the statute was a tax provision, and if so, whether it violated the requirement in Wis. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 1, that the rule of taxation was required to be uniform. The court found that the taxpayers had a direct and personal pecuniary interest in the litigation and thus had standing the attack the constitutionality of &sect; 46.26(4)(a). The court disagreed with the taxpayers' contention that the effect of &sect; 46026(4)(a) was the imposition of a tax in their county and was therefore a taxing statute. The court reasoned that the fact that &sect; 46.26 provided funds or grants-in-aid to assist counties and to pay all or part of the cost of services the state provided did not detract from the counties' responsibilities. The court held that &sect; 46.26(4)(a) was not a tax statute.

Defendant also alleged that his trial counsel was ineffective because he consented to a six-person jury, rather than a twelve-person jury, failed to point out defendant's weight when a hypothetical used a person 20 pounds lighter, and failed to present an independent expert toxicologist to refute the testimony of the State's medical expert. The court affirmed the conviction holding that the phrase, &quot;under the influence of an intoxicant,&quot; was not vague or unconstitutionally overbroad and that people intuitively knew when they were overdrinking. Defendant was not prejudiced by the size of the jury or the failure to challenge the State's reliable intoxication testimony.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed a judgment from the Circuit Court, Milwaukee County, Wisconsin, that convicted her of homicide by intoxicated use of a vehicle under Wis. Stat. &sect; 940.09(1)(a), (b). Among other points of error, defendant argued that &sect; 940.09 was unconstitutional, that the State inordinately delayed prosecution, that a blood alcohol test was inadmissible, and that the accident would have occurred even if she had not been intoxicated.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was crossing an intersection when a motorcycle struck the car. The motorcyclist died. Defendant's blood alcohol content was .198 percent. Charges were not filed because the prosecutor mistakenly thought he had to prove that her intoxication caused the death. A supreme court decision clarified that a death and an accused's intoxication did not have to be causally linked. Defendant was charged under &sect; 940.09(1)(a). The first blood test was suppressed, but a second blood sample taken at the hospital showed a blood alcohol content of .251 percent. The complaint was amended to include a charge under &sect; 940.09(1)(b). Defendant's claim that she was prejudiced by the delay in prosecution was rejected. There was no proof that the delay was improperly motivated. She was not prejudiced by admission of the second blood test and the amended information. The test was done for valid, medical purposes. The State properly notified her of the blood test as soon as it was discovered, which was eight months before trial. The evidence supported the jury's conclusion that defendant was not entitled to the affirmative defense under Wis. Stat. &sect; 940.09(2). Section 940.09 was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The landowners purchased the property in July 1984 and placed two mobile homes on it. The previous owners had a mobile home until August 1983 that was a nonconforming use. The landowners asserted that their homes were a continuation of an existing use or, alternatively, requested a variance. The Board denied the request and concluded that the new homes were not a nonconforming use. The court affirmed in part and reversed in part. Although the trial court had a summary of the Board's hearing to review rather than a verbatim transcript, the landowners provided no authority for the proposition that the Board was required to prepare a hearing transcript. Because the Board did not respond to the landowners' contention that the trial court erred in ordering them to remove the homes, the court remanded with directions to delete that language. However, the court held that the landowners did not meet their burden of showing that the value of the new homes did not exceed 50 percent of the assessed value of the previous owners' home. Thus, the landowners could not complain that the Board failed to make proper findings regarding the continuation of a prior nonconforming use.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued that the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction because the charging documents failed to allege an existing offense. The court affirmed the judgment, finding that because the documents charged a crime, defendant had to show actual prejudice in order to be entitled to any relief. Defendant made no such showing and, in view of an amended information that charged a violation of &sect; 161.14(4)(t), the court found none. Defendant also argued that defects in the complaint deprived the trial court of personal jurisdiction. The court concluded that defendant waived his objections to the trial court's personal jurisdiction when he entered an Alford plea. Defendant further contended that a court commissioner was without authority to issue search warrants because he had not filed an oath of office. The court found that the acts of a &quot;de facto&quot; officer were valid as to the public and third parties. Finally, defendant argued that the trial court abused its discretion by sentencing him to prison for three years.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted in the Circuit Court for Shawano County (Wisconsin) of uttering a forgery, Wis. Stat. &sect; 943.38(2). Postconviction relief was denied. On appeal, the issues included whether he was illegally arrested and denied both effective assistance of counsel and a speedy trial and whether the forgery penalty provision violated equal protection of the laws because the maximum for similar crimes was substantially less.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court ruled that what defendant claimed was an illegal arrest was a reasonable Terry stop. Defendant argued that a seven-month failure to file a detainer caused a delay in bringing him to trial such that his constitutional right to a speedy trial was denied. On appeal, after reviewing the applicable test and Wis. Stat. &sect; 976.05, which gave effect to the Interstate Agreement on Detainers Act, the court held that the delay was hardly inexcusable in light of the established record. As to his claim that he was illegally arrested, after reviewing the facts and Wis. Stat. &sect; 968.24, which codified the Terry standard for temporary detention, the court held that a police officer had sufficient reasonable suspicion to make an investigative stop. Because the investigative stop was reasonable, the court did not have to address defendant's claim that trial counsel's failure to challenge it was ineffective assistance of counsel. Contrary to defendant's claim, a store manager's testimony was not hearsay because he testified to his present sense impression, Wis. Stat. &sect; 908.03(1), as to defendant's presentation of a forged check for payment. Wis. Stat. &sect; 943.38 was not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the judgment of conviction and the order denying postconviction relief.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the stop was constitutional because the officer had specific and articulable facts on which to reasonably believe that the driver had violated the traffic laws. Moreover, judicial precedent had determined &sect; 343.305(3)(b)5 to be constitutional.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After law enforcement officials used binoculars to observe defendant growing marijuana on his property, ostensibly for use in his capacity as priest of a cult, defendant was arrested and charged with manufacturing controlled substances in violation of &sect; 161.41(1)(b). The trial court denied his motion to suppress evidence seized from his property, and defendant was convicted. He appealed, and the court affirmed, holding that defendant's right to free exercise of religion under U.S. Const. I was not violated because the State had an overriding interest in regulating controlled substances. Although some of the marijuana was grown in the curtilage near defendant's home, the trial court properly denied defendant's motion to suppress because he could not have had a reasonable expectation of privacy concerning property that was in plain view. Defendant was unable to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that &sect; 161.41(1)(b) violated equal protection principles because although certain churches were able to use controlled substances in connection with their services, defendant's church lacked the unique cultural and historic attributes of those churches.</SPAN></P>

The trial court entered an order that found the child to be in need of protection and services under Wis. Stat. &sect; 48.13(2) and placed the child outside the home. On appeal, the mother requested relief from the order because of ineffective assistance of counsel. The court held that: (1) nothing in the performance of any of the mother's lawyers prevented the real controversy from being tried or resulted in a miscarriage of justice; (2) denying a lawyer's motion to withdraw and ordering the lawyer to try a case as best as possible was a viable option when a client failed to appear; (3) the term &quot;abandonment&quot; as it was used in Wis. Stat. &sect; 48.13(2) was not unconstitutionally vague; and (4) when the best interests of the child came into conflict with the rights of a parent, resolution of the conflict was in favor of the child's interests.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 346.37(1)(c)1, after he was involved in a motor vehicle collision while driving an ambulance.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was operating an ambulance on an emergency call. He was approaching an intersection with a red traffic signal and there was another car approaching the other way. He did not see the other car stop, although he expected it to do so. The ambulance struck the other car. Defendant was convicted of violating the statute requiring the vehicles facing a red signal should stop. On appeal, the court confirmed. The court found that under Wis. Stat. &sect; 346.03, the operator of an emergency vehicle was exempted from certain traffic laws. The court concluded that this privilege was qualified by &sect; 346.03(5), which required the operator to drive with due regard for the safety of all persons. The court reviewed the trial court's findings under a clearly erroneous standard. The court accepted the findings and found defendant had violated the ordinance. The court determined that it was for the legislature to determine the public policy implications of allowing emergency vehicle operators to have privileges other drivers did not.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Department of Revenue had issued a decision that denied the taxpayer's petition for a redetermination of the assessment of a sales and use tax. Both the Tax Appeals Commission and the circuit court had affirmed the Department's decision. The taxpayer had filed an appeal, claiming that its printing of shoppers guides for others was not a sale of a service under Wis. Stat. &sect; 77.52(2)(a)11 (1975, 1977). The court disagreed, and found that the printing service sale was taxable as a retail sale of providing a service of a tangible personal property under &sect; 77.52(2)(a)11. The court came to this conclusion by virtue of the general language in the introductory paragraph to Wis. Stat. &sect; 77.51(4), and the specific provision in Wis. Stat. &sect; 77.51(4)(k) had included in a retail sale a transfer without a valuable consideration. Finally, the court rejected the taxpayer's constitutional challenge to &sect; 77.54(15) because the taxpayer had not satisfied its burden in showing any constitutional deficiency. The court affirmed the circuit court's order that affirmed the denial of the request for a redetermination of the tax assessment.</SPAN></P>

The trial court reversed the department's determination. The court reversed the trial court's order. The court determined that neither Wis. Admin. Code &sect;&sect; HSS 107.07(2)(c)2, 107.07(5) created an exception to the blanket exclusion on alveoloplasties contained in Wis. Admin. Code &sect; 107.07(4). The reference to &quot;other covered services&quot; in Wis. Admin. Code &sect; HSS 107.07(2)(c) unambiguously established proof that the provisions of Wis. Admin. Code &sect; HSS 107.07(2)(c)2 extended only to covered services and did not set up an authorization procedure for noncovered services. With respect to Wis. Admin. Code &sect; HSS 107.07(5), reimbursement was required only if the department requested noncovered service in order to substantiate a prior authorization request; however, the department did not request the alveoloplasty and claimant did not need to surgery to substantiate a prior authorization request.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect;346.63(1)(a)).</SPAN></P>

Approaching defendant as he exited a store, the officer noticed that he had difficulty in speaking and in finding his driver's license, his eyes were red and watery, and he was leaning against the car. After defendant failed a field sobriety test, the officer arrested him. Because defendant was unable to perform a breath test for health reasons, officers collected a urine sample. Defendant argued that his warrantless arrest pursuant to Wis. Stat. &sect; 345.22, for violation of a municipal traffic ordinance, infringed his rights under the Fourth Amendment and Wis. Const. art. I, &sect; 11, and that the urinalysis results should have been suppressed because he was not given the opportunity for an alternative test and because they were unreliable as a matter of law. The court affirmed the judgment. It held that the arrest was proper where there was probable cause and the offense was committed in the officer's presence; that defendant waived the evidentiary issue by failing to object to admission or to move to suppress; and that because the chemical test was specified by statute, it could not be deemed unreliable as a matter of law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The service purchased a home in a subdivision for the purpose of operating a group home. The home was to serve as a residence for up to eight elderly persons who needed assistance. The association filed an action seeking a permanent injunction preventing the service from operating the group home on the ground that the property was subject to a restrictive covenant. The service maintained that &sect; 46.03(22) permitted the group home to operate despite the restrictive covenant. The trial court held that the legislature did not intend for the statute to apply retroactively but that the statute was constitutional and that the service could rightfully operate the group home. Upon review, the court affirmed but disagreed with the trial court that the statute was not intended to apply retroactively to covenants created prior to its enactment. In addressing the constitutional challenge as to the retroactive application of &sect; 46.03(22), the court held that, although the statute substantially impaired the contractual obligations of the association, the statute was supported by strong legislative purpose and was properly tailored to fulfill that purpose.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The State challenged the judgment of the Circuit Court for Waukesha County (Wisconsin), which dismissed the following charges against defendant: causing death by operating a boat while under the influence of an intoxicant, causing death by operating a boat while having a blood alcohol concentration of .10% or more, and causing death by a high degree of negligence in operating a boat.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The State argued that a person might be charged, convicted, and punished for both homicide by intoxicated operation of a motorboat and homicide by highly negligent operation arising out of the same incident. The trial court held that even though the intoxication and negligence charges were neither multiplicious nor lesser-included offenses, multiple punishment was inappropriate. The court compared the elements of the statutes involved and found that the negligence statutes required the State to prove operation of a vehicle with a high degree of negligence, while the intoxication statutes required the State to prove operation of a vehicle while under the influence of an intoxicant. The different conduct proscribed and different grounds for the negligence and intoxication statutes along with their distinct factual elements convinced the court that multiple prosecutions, convictions, and punishments were intended by the legislature. Therefore, the court reversed the dismissal of the complaint on multiplicity grounds. The court affirmed the judgment in so far as it found probable cause to support the complaint against defendant.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The order that dismissed the charges against defendant was reversed and that portion of the order that found probable cause supported the State's complaint was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff taxpayers sought review of a judgment of the Circuit Court for Dane County (Wisconsin), which ruled in favor defendant Secretary of the State of Wisconsin Department of Revenue in the taxpayers' action seeking to have Wis. Stat. &sect;&sect; 71.05(1)(a)5, 7 (1979-80), Wis. Stat. &sect; 71.09(6p)(d)1 (1979-80), and Wis. Stat. &sect; 71.53(6) (1979-80) declared unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The taxpayers were two couples who, in each case, sold their principal residence in Wisconsin and, in employment-related moves, moved to another state where they acquired a new principal residence. They brought their action on behalf of themselves and all former residents of the state, similarly situated. In each case the Department sought to impose on them additional income taxes under the challenged statutes. Had either couple relocated in the state in an employment-related move, no additional tax would have been due. The trial court declared the statutes constitutional and the taxpayers sought review. On appeal, the court overturned the judgment as to Wis. Stat. &sect; 71.05(1)(a)5, but upheld the judgment as to the remainder of the challenged statutes. The court ruled that because there was no substantial reason for the different treatment of nonresidents in the taxation of gain realized on the sale of their principal residences and the treatment had no substantial relation to a legitimate state objective, it declared that &sect; 71.05(1)(a)5 violated the privileges and immunities clause. The court held that the rest of the statutes affected interstate commerce only incidentally.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the judgment as to one of the challenged statutes and affirmed the judgment as to the rest of the statutes. The court remanded the cause with directions to enter judgment declaring that former statute was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was charged with various charges that ranged from escape through evincing a depraved mind based upon allegations regarding defendant's alleged commandeering of a pickup truck. Defendant was representing himself. Defendant alleged that he was in a program segregation unit, he was not allowed physical access to the library, that no &quot;satellite&quot; library was available, and the he needed direct access to certain legal books. Defendant stated the he was allowed two books per day and that this was not sufficient access. In reversing the trial court's decision and remanding the cause, the court held that defendant had a special legal need for access to legal materials. Defendant had a constitutional right to represent himself. Defendant also had a fundamental constitutional right of access to the courts. Under Wis. Admin. Code &sect; HSS 309.27(1), special provisions had to be made to provide defendant with access to legal materials. The trial court was directed to hold an evidentiary hearing to determine whether the restrictions placed on defendant's access to legal materials and to the library satisfied Wis. Admin. Code &sect; HSS 309.27(1).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant, the Wisconsin Department of Agriculture, Trade, and Consumer Protection, appealed an order of the Circuit Court for Dane County (Wisconsin), which granted summary judgment to plaintiff manufacturer and declared Wis. Admin. Code &sect; Ag 72.04(10) void insofar as it prohibited the sale of butyl nitrite.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The manufacture alleged that it produced room odorizers that contained butyl nitrite. It brought an action to declare Wis. Admin. Code &sect; Ag 72.04(10)&nbsp;unconstitutional. The manufacturer moved for summary judgment on the ground that the Wisconsin Department of Agriculture, Trade, and Consumer Protection lacked jurisdiction to ban nitrite-based products because butyl nitrite was a drug, and Wis. Stat. &sect; 100.37(1)(c)5 excluded drugs from the definition of &quot;hazardous substances&quot; that Wis. Stat. &sect; 100.37(2)(d) permitted the Department to ban. In support of the motion, the manufacturer submitted certified copies of the rulemaking record, including the Department's findings of fact and statement of need for the rule. The court held that the manufacturer's evidentiary materials failed to show that the Department had found that butyl nitrite was a drug, and that nothing in the materials indicated whether that was a contested issue in the rulemaking proceeding. The court rejected the manufacturer's argument that a drug was anything intended to be inhaled.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant department store challenged the judgment of the Circuit Court for Dane County (Wisconsin) that affirmed a decision and an order of respondent, the Wisconsin Tax Appeals Commission, that affirmed the Department of Revenue's deficiency assessment against the department store for sales and use tax and the imposition of 12 percent interest on the deficiencies.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Prior to July 31, 1981, the interest penalty on sales and use tax deficiencies was nine percent; effective August 1, the rate was 12 percent. In 1982, the Department of Revenue issued a deficiency assessment against the department store and charged interest on the deficiencies at the rate of 12 percent. The department store challenged the assessment, and after the tax appeals commission affirmed, the department store sought judicial review. The circuit court affirmed, and the department store appealed. In affirming, the court concluded that the plain language of Wis. Stat. &sect; 2203(45)(g) (1981) indicated that the new interest rate applied to all determinations made on or after August 1, 1981, regardless of the taxable periods to which those determinations might pertain. Because the deficiency assessments were made after July 31, 1981, the 12 percent interest rate was applicable. Further, the court rejected the department store's equal protection argument. The fact that some taxpayers might be assessed interest at different rates dependent upon when the deficiency was determined and when the assessment was made did not establish the unconstitutionality of the law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The residents of a subdivision near a fair filed a mandamus action to compel the county clerk to establish procedures for the issuance of licenses for transient merchants under Wis.

The trial court held that the statute violated the Commerce, Equal Protection, and Due Process Clauses of the United States Constitution. On appeal, the court concurred that a writ of mandamus did not lie, but upon different grounds than those relied upon by the trial court. The court determined that mandamus did not lie against the county clerk because the clerk had no affirmative duty under &sect; 103.065(2)-(6) to take any action until a merchant requested a license. Likewise, the court held that mandamus was not available to compel the sheriff to act because the sheriff's duty asserted by the residents was discretionary.</SPAN></P>
