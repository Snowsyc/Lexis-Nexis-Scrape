</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parties petitioned for review from the Court of Appeals for the Seventh District of Texas, which ruled that Tex. Loc. Gov't. Code &sect;143.057(d) governed petitioner's civil services but unconstitutionally delegated legislative authority to a private entity and unconstitutionally infringed upon petitioner city's home rule powers.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A police officer was suspended and elected to have his appeal heard by a neutral hearing examiner pursuant to Tex. Loc. Gov't. Code &sect;143.057(d). Petitioner city sought a declaration that it was under no obligation to comply with &sect;143.057(d). Petitioner argued that Lubbock, Tex, Firemen's and Policemen's Civil Service Ordinance 862 governed its civil services. The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of respondents Attorney General and police officer. The appellate court reversed, holding that &sect; 143.057(d)&nbsp;unconstitutionally delegated legislative authority to a private entity and unconstitutionally infringed upon petitioner's home rule power. Petitioner was governed by Tex. Loc. Gov't. Code &sect;&sect; 143.001-.143 as amended, and respondent officer was therefore entitled to have his disciplinary appeal decided before private hearing examiners. Failing to demonstrate that &sect; 143.057(d) would always operate unconstitutionally, petitioner's facial challenge failed. Judgment of appellate court was reversed, and trial court's ruling was reinstated.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment reversed and trial court's judgment reinstated. Petitioner was governed by amendments to the Civil Service Act and respondent had the right to have appeal heard by a neutral hearing examiner. Petitioner's constitutional challenges failed, as petitioner could not show that the statute would always operate unconstitutionally.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs petitioned for review of Court of Appeals of the Seventh District of Texas' decision remanding case for jury trial, and holding plaintiffs barred from recovering fees, in a case to determine whether conditions affected by closing the Sanford Dam should be considered by surveyors in marking gradient boundary.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The differences between the parties' surveys in the boundary dispute were based on conflicting legal theories, and did not present a factual dispute, thus the court could resolve the matter and remand to the trial court was not necessary. The court held that changes brought about or influenced by the dam must be considered in marking the gradient boundary of a river, so long as the riparian owner did not cause or contribute to the artificial influence. They therefore concluded that a survey of the disputed area must account for present, i.e., post-dam, conditions on the Canadian River by gradient boundary methodology. They held that trial court did not err in rendering judgment declaring that plaintiffs' survey marked the gradient boundary of the Canadian River in the disputed area. They agreed with the court of appeals, that the legislative resolution bared the plaintiffs from recovering their attorney's and surveyor's fees.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirm that attorney's and surveyor's fees were not recoverable; reversed the remand to the trial court; and reinstated the trial court's judgment declaring that the plaintiffs' survey correctly marked the boundary between the State's riverbed and the riparian tracts.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court rendered judgment in an action by respondents, an association of used car dealers, declaring that Tex. Transp. Code Ann.  &sect;&sect; 728.001 through 728.004 were unconstitutional and enjoined enforcement of those provisions by state authorities. After having its appeal dismissed, petitioner, the state's motor vehicle board, filed a petition for review of the decision of the Court of Appeals for the Eighth District of Texas.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondents, an association of used car dealers, sued various local officials of the El Paso area to enjoin them from enforcing Tex. Transp. Code Ann.  &sect;&sect; 728.001-728.004, the Blue Law, and to have it declared unconstitutional because it prohibited the sale of cars on consecutive weekend days. The trial court rendered judgment in favor of respondents. The appellate court held that petitioner, the state's motor vehicle board, and the state's attorney general had the right to appeal under the doctrine of virtual representation, but concluded that the attorney general had waived that right by way of a letter in which it stated that it believed the local officials would litigate the matter; the local officials later voluntarily dismissed their appeal. Petitioner's appeal was dismissed. On review, the court noted that the waiver issue rested squarely on the substance of the attorney general's letter. As such, the court held that nothing about the attorney general's letter indicated an intention to &quot;expressly renounce&quot; or otherwise waive any right the attorney general or petitioner had to have the case fully defended or appealed. Thus, the court reversed and remanded the case.</SPAN></P>

The reviewing court affirmed the trial court's judgment that &sect; 71.051 did not violate the Privileges and Immunities Clause, U.S. Const. art.

The court reversed the lower court's judgment regarding &sect;&sect; 71.031(a)(3), 71.052(b), and 71.052(c), and held that they were constitutional with respect to the challenges asserted by plaintiffs.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from the Court of Appeals for the Second District of Texas decision that reversed the judgment that granted defendant's motion for summary judgment and denied plaintiff's motion for summary judgment, in a quo warranto action by plaintiff that sought a declaration that defendant was not the mayor and that another person was.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff sought judicial enforcement, through a quo warranto action, of its decision to remove defendant from the seat as mayor. The court reversed the decision of the court of appeals that reversed the grant of summary judgment in favor of defendant. Pursuant to Tex. Loc. Gov't Code Ann. &sect; 21.002, the proceedings for the removal of defendant as mayor were governed by the state civil procedures and evidence court rules. The aldermen of the city were the judges in this removal proceeding, and violated Tex. R. Civ. Evid. 605 by sitting as judges in the proceeding where they also acted as witnesses. As with Fed. R. Evid. 605, under the Texas rule, a judge could not also act as a witness. As two aldermen-judges also testified as witnesses, they violated defendant's due process rights during the removal proceedings. Due to the defective proceedings, the court entered judgment in favor of defendant, finding that he was still the lawful mayor. Due to the conclusion that defendant negated an element of the plaintiff's quo warranto action, that the aldermen lawfully removed defendant, the court did not need to reach the remaining grounds supporting defendant's motion for summary judgment.</SPAN></P>

The Code of Judicial Conduct furnished sufficient specification of the judicial conduct that warranted disciplinary action. The forgiveness doctrine was not applicable, and the state judicial conduct commission (commission) was not required to publish its annual report.

On review, the court held that petitioner was not entitled to mandamus relief for the denial of its jurisdictional plea because petitioner failed to show that it lacked an adequate remedy by appeal. In conditionally granting mandamus relief with respect to the disclosure orders, the court held that the orders violated petitioner's right to freedom of association under U.S. amend. I. The court held that petitioner made a prima facie showing that the orders burdened its rights under U.S. amend. I. Specifically, petitioner submitted evidence that its supporters had been subject to boycott threats, and that individuals opposed to petitioner's agenda had boycotted the business establishments of persons affiliated with petitioner. The court further held that respondents failed to show a substantial relation between the identity of petitioner's contributors, corporate or individual, and respondent's goal in demanding disclosure thereof.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner discipline commission requested review of a decision by the Texas Court of Appeals reversing an order of discipline imposed by the trial court on respondent attorney. The court of appeals reversed the trial court's judgment and dismissed the case on the sole ground that Tex. R. Disciplinary P. 3.06(d) was void for vagueness.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent attorney had been disciplined for writing an abusive post-judgment letter to jurors who rendered a verdict against respondent's client. Respondent admitted that he wrote the letter to influence the jurors' future conduct. Respondent claimed the disciplinary rule that he violated was unconstitutional under the Federal and Texas Constitutions. The appellate court agreed and found that Tex. R. Disciplinary P. 3.06(d) was void for vagueness and dismissed the action. Respondent appealed, and the supreme court reversed because respondent's letter threatened to damage the jury system, and the rule's prohibition on comments calculated to influence future jury service did not violate the U.S. Const. amend I. The court also decided that the rule was not overbroad and did not violate equal protection. The court did agree that the term &quot;embarrass&quot; contained in the rule was unconstitutionally vague, and the court narrowed the construction of the term &quot;harass&quot; in the rule. The court, noting that the trial court did not specify which provision of rule 3.06(d) respondent violated, remanded the action for trial court to determine how its decision might affect respondent's punishment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the appellate court's decision and remanded for a new punishment hearing. The court concluded that the provision of the lawyer discipline rules prohibiting respondent attorney's attempt to influence jurors' future jury service was constitutional and remanded so that the trial court could confine respondent's punishment to a violation of the correct provision and render punishment accordingly.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant day care center operators sought rehearing of their petition for a writ of error from the Court of Appeals for the Third District of Texas, which had reversed a trial court's summary judgment for defendants and held that a violation of the Tex. Fam. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 261.101(a), 261.109 child abuse reporting requirement was negligence per se in a suit brought by plaintiff parents individually and on behalf of their children.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff parents filed suit individually and as friends of their children, alleging that defendant day care center operators witnessed abuse of the children at a day care center and failed to report it to the police or child welfare officials. The court reversed the lower court's judgment that held defendants negligent per se for failing to report the abuse under Tex. Fam. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 261.101(a), 261.109 and overruled defendants' motion for rehearing. The court found the statute would impose liability without fault and a finding of negligence per se would result in damages disproportionate to the seriousness of the violation, a class B misdemeanor. Further, the decision to impose negligence per se could not be limited to cases charging serious misconduct, but would impose immense potential liability under an ill-defined standard on a broad class of individuals whose relationship to the abuse was extremely indirect. It was not appropriate to adopt the statute as establishing a duty and standard of conduct in tort and therefore plaintiffs could not maintain a claim for negligence per se or gross negligence based on defendants' violation of the child abuse reporting statute.</SPAN></P>

Gov't &sect; 143.057(d) violated the Texas Constitution. Section 143.057(d) provided for the American Arbitration Association (AAA) or the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service (FMCS) to provide a list of arbitrators if the parties could not agree on a hearing examiner to handle an officer's disciplinary appeal. The court held that this did not violate the authority granted to home rule cities because it was clear that the legislature intended to prevent cities from requiring the appeals to be heard only by civil service commissions. The court found the delegation to determine which arbitrators were qualified and neutral and was not overly broad because the process provided the parties with adequate participation. Neither the AAA nor the FMCS were involved in making rules, had authority to impose criminal sanctions, or had a private interest at stake. Further, the legislature did not need to set forth requirements on determining which arbitrators were qualified and neutral if those terms provided AAA and FMCS sufficient guidance.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs filed suits against defendant manufacturer for asbestos-related injuries. Defendant appealed judgments awarding punitive damages and thereafter petitioned for further review, arguing that the trial courts erred in rejecting evidence to mitigate punitive damages and that the awards, when aggregated with prior punitive damages awarded for the same conduct, violated the due process requirements of U.S. Const. amend. XIV. In affirming the lower court decisions, the court concluded that evidence of the profitability of defendant's misconduct and previously paid punitive damages for the same course of conduct was admissible to mitigate punitive damages. While this evidence should have been admitted, any error in excluding it was harmless. Further, defendant failed to establish that aggregate punitive damage awards violated substantive due process rights. Considering defendant's conduct, plaintiffs' injuries, defendant's stable finances, and punitive damages actually for the same conduct, the punitive damages awards at issue, when aggregated with prior awards, were not grossly excessive and beyond the legitimate interests of punishment and deterrence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner tax authorities sought to assess helicopters that belonged to respondent air transporter at full market value. Respondent challenged the assessment, asserting that petitioner did not allocate value as required by Tex. Tax Code Ann. &sect; 21.05. The trial court rendered summary judgment for petitioner, finding the statute to be an unconstitutional tax exemption. The court of appeals reversed and remanded for further proceedings. The supreme court affirmed the court of appeals, finding that &sect; 21.05 could not be an unconstitutional exemption in any case in which the United States Constitution would require fair apportionment. The supreme court found that the United States Constitution limited petitioner's power to tax property which had acquired a tax situs outside the state. The supreme court determined that the facts established that the helicopters had a taxable situs in another state and, therefore, allocation was constitutionally required. Because allocation required under the United States Constitution was not an unauthorized tax exemption, the supreme court held that &sect; 21.05 was not facially unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 106.001(a)(4)-(6). The court reversed. Constitutional challenges to hair length regulations were nonjusticiable, and did not violate any constitutional rights. The court statutorily construed Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem.

The fact that &sect; 106.001 imposed criminal penalties weighed heavily against construing it to prohibit the enforcing of dress and grooming codes. Section 106.001 prohibited discriminatory practices that affected the access of one sex to state benefits, amenities, or opportunities enjoyed by the other sex.

Agric. Code Ann. &sect; 74.101 et seq. (1993), should have prospective application only, such that refunds would not be owed for past assessments.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff farmers brought suit in two courts against defendant foundation to invalidate certain assessments made against them under Tex.

Judgment in both cases was entered for plaintiffs and defendant appealed, but the judgment invalidating the statute and assessments was affirmed. In response to the court's opinion, the legislature amended the statutory scheme at issue. Defendant then moved for a rehearing, asserting that the decision should apply to future assessments only, that is, it should not have retroactive application, such that defendant would have to pay refunds for past assessments. In overruling the motions for rehearing, the court ruled that, despite the general rule that decisions applied retroactively, because the law had been modified, the appropriate forum for any challenge was in the trial courts and not on motion for rehearing.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The lower court determined that the trial court should have sustained respondent state university's plea to the jurisdiction based upon sovereign immunity. Petitioner business challenged the lower court decision, claiming that legislative consent to sue was not necessary because respondent violated state laws, that respondent waived immunity by entering into a contract with a private citizen, and that sovereign immunity from contract claims violated the Texas Constitution's open courts and due course of law provisions. Affirming the lower court's judgment, the court held that petitioner's breach of contract claim for monetary damages required legislative consent, notwithstanding the allegation that there were related state law violations. The court also held that by entering into contracts with private citizens, the state waived only immunity from liability, not from suit, so a private citizen needed to obtain legislative consent to sue the state for breach. Finally, the court held that sovereign immunity did not deny petitioner due process, because relief was available to petitioner by seeking the legislature's consent to sue, and it held that the open courts claim was meritless.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the decision of the lower court dismissing petitioner business' suit against respondent state university, holding that sovereign immunity from suit without legislative consent applied to claims for damages for breach of contract against the state, even if related state law violations were alleged, and this application did not violate either the open courts or the due course of law provisions of the Texas Constitution.</SPAN></P>

The trial courts invalidated the assessments and enjoined their collection. Appellant sought immediate review with the Texas supreme court. The court held that the assessments constituted regulatory fees rather than taxes, and were not taxes on an agricultural pursuit in violation of Tex. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 1(c). The court further held that the Act, on its face and as applied to appellees, did not violate the right to equal protection under Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 13. The court applied an eight-part test and determined that the Act represented an overly broad delegation of legislative authority to a private entity. Thus, the court affirmed the judgments of the trial courts because the legislature made an unconstitutionally broad delegation of authority to appellant, a private entity, thereby violating the separation of power clause, Tex.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, almost eight years after distribution of the estate, asserted the right to inherit from her biological grandmother and, alternatively, to obtain damages or equitable relief for wrongful exclusion from her grandmother's estate.

The trial court rendered summary judgment against plaintiff and she appealed. The court of appeals held that the claims for an interest in the estate were barred by limitations, but concluded that the discovery rule applied to plaintiff's claims of fraud, conspiracy, breach of fiduciary duty, and gross negligence. The court of appeals found that there were fact questions as to when plaintiff should have known who her natural mother was and that she had been excluded from the deceased estate.

The court rejected this argument noting that the Tex. Const. art. XVI, &sect; 17 allows for a period of service for a justice to be extended, but not truncated. The court held that, because the effective date of respondent's resignation is the actual date he would leave office for that term if he did not seek reelection, he would only vacate his office in the constitutional sense on that date.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the voters passed a constitutional amendment to promote the preservation of open-space land, the legislature enacted Tex.

Petitioners, laboratory and the State of Texas, challenged the decision of respondent, the Williamson County Appraisal District, that found Tex. Tax Code &sect; 23.51 (1) was unconstitutional and therefore denied petitioner laboratory's application for taxation as an ecological laboratory in 1990. Respondent had granted the application every year since 1967, as three universities used the land as an ecological laboratory. The trial court ruled that Tex.

The court reversed the discovery order and dismissed the emotional distress claim, but permitted the fraud claim to proceed. The fraud and conspiracy claims based on the relators' failure to read plaintiffs' prayer requests as promised were constitutional because the claims were based on the promise to perform particular acts. The jury was not permitted to determine the truth or falsity of relators' allegedly fraudulent statements of religious belief or doctrine. The intentional infliction of emotional distress and related conspiracy claims required an unconstitutional inquiry into the truth or falsity of relators' religious beliefs.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants state, city, and directors appealed from the judgment of the 38th District Court of Medina County (Texas) that enjoined implementation of the Edwards Aquifer Act (Act), 1993 Tex. Gen. Laws 2353, upon declaring that the Act facially violated several provisions of the Texas Constitution and infringed upon the rights of plaintiff challengers to withdraw water from beneath their own property.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff challengers brought a facial challenge to the validity of the Edwards Aquifer Act (Act), 1993 Tex. Gen. Laws 2353, under various provisions of the Texas Constitution. Plaintiffs claimed the law violated their property rights to obtain underground water from their own property, while defendants state, city, and directors asserted it merely regulated groundwater resources for conservation purposes by imposing caps on well withdrawals and imposing a permit system that gave preference to existing users. The trial court declared the Act unconstitutional and enjoined its implementation. Defendants appealed. In reversing, the court ruled that the Act was presumed to be constitutional and plaintiffs failed to meet their burden of showing that the Act would always operate unconstitutionally. The law was properly enacted pursuant to constitutional notice requirements and it did not permit the taking of private property without adequate compensation. Moreover, the Act did not violate state constitutional provisions pertaining to equal protection, due course of law, retroactive laws, obligation of contracts, separation of powers, open courts, or right to jury trial.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed and ordered that petitioner take nothing. Petitioner could not recover the value of the benefits she would have been entitled to but for the settlement; her sole remedy was rescission of the settlement agreement and reassertion of her claim.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court dismissed respondent's action challenging the assessment of an ad valorem tax due to respondent's failure to tender partial payment under Tex. Tax Code Ann. &sect; 42.08. The statute provided that a taxpayer forfeited the right to judicial review of an assessment unless the taxpayer paid either the amount of taxes due on that portion of the taxable value of the property not in dispute or the amount of taxes imposed on the property for the preceding year. The court of appeals reversed, finding that the statute impeded respondent's right to open courts in violation of Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 13. The court affirmed the reversal. That part of the statute requiring payment of the undisputed portion was constitutional in light of the importance that local governments have a steady revenue stream. However, that part of the statute requiring payment of the preceding year's tax assessment and requiring a taxpayer to pay any portion of the disputed amount, imposed an unreasonable financial barrier to court access.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Relator carrier brought a mandamus proceeding. In underlying workers' compensation action, the trial court appointed an attorney to represent the claimant, ordering the relator to pay opposing counsel's fees. The relator contended the trial court abused its discretion by requiring it to pay the claimant's attorney. The court agreed. Attorney fees could not be recovered from an opposing party unless such recovery was provided for by statute or by contract. The authorization of attorney fees could not be inferred; rather it must be provided for by the express terms of the statute. There was no statute which authorized recovery of attorney fees under the circumstances. Further, the Tex. Gov't. Code Ann. &sect; 24.016 vested judges with discretion to appoint counsel for indigent litigants, but did not authorize judges to shift the fees for appointed counsel to the opposing party. Because the authority for a fee award could not be supplied by implication but must be provided for by express terms of the statute, the court could not construe Tex. Gov't.

If the assault was motivated by an employment-related dispute or directly attributable to the employer, then the Act provided the employee's exclusive remedy under Tex. Lab. Code &sect; 408.001. If the assault was unrelated to the employment, then the employer was not vicariously liable for the supervisor's intentional misconduct. However, the employee's intentional tort claim against the supervisor could be maintained because the Act was not intended to shield the supervisor from liability for his own intentional assault on the employee.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the grant of summary judgment to the employer but reversed the grant of summary judgment to the supervisor. The court remanded the action for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

Petitioner listed both grocery store and video store inventory. Respondent denied petitioner's application as to inventory that petitioner acquired after September 1, 1991 for its new store sites. Petitioner filed a petition for review of respondent's valuation and the court of appeals held that &sect; 23.12(f) was unconstitutional as applied to the inventory. The court reversed and held that &sect; 23.12(f) did not result in an unconstitutional exemption of property simply because the volume and value of petitioner's inventory increased after the September 1 valuation date. The court also held that that &sect; 23.12(f) was not an exemption from taxation, but rather a provision for an alternative valuation date that was not unreasonably arbitrary or capricious.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent district filed suit against petitioner gas companies challenging to the constitutionality of a tax code provision that allowed petitioners to select between two different dates on which to have the market value of its inventory appraised for ad valorem tax purposes. Respondent alleged that petitioners' appraisal date resulted in a loss of tax revenue. Respondent contended that the provision of the tax code violated the Texas Constitution, which required taxation to be equal and uniform. Respondent argued that the statute resulted in unequal treatment among inventory owners, and that the statute exempted property from taxation. The trial court upheld the constitutionality of the tax code provision, and the court of appeals reversed the trial court's judgment. On petitioners' application for a writ of error, the court reversed the judgment of the court of appeals and held that the statute was constitutional. The court concluded that the legislature had the authority to establish a method of valuing property for ad valorem tax purposes, and that the legislature properly exercised its authority.</SPAN></P>

The lower court reversed the trial court and remanded the cause for a new trial. The court reversed the lower court and affirmed the judgment of the trial court because the daughter's action was subject to the two-year statute of limitations which did not begin to run until her eighteenth birthday, but she brought her action more than four months after the limitations period had expired. The court held that the discovery rule, which tolled the statute of limitations until the discovery of the cause of action, was not applicable to the daughter because there was no physical or other evidence to satisfy the element of objective verifiability for application of the discovery rule.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee computer software developer left his position with appellant computer company to work for appellee computer company. The employee took copies of a computer source code from appellant and used them in his new position.

The trial court determined that the discovery rule exception to Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann. &sect; 16.003(a) did not apply and that appellant's action for misappropriation of trade secrets was barred by a two-year statute of limitations. The court of appeals certified to this court two questions: does the discovery rule exception to &sect; 16.003(a) apply; and if not, whether &sect; 16.003(a) violated the &quot;open courts&quot; provision of the Texas Constitution. The court held that the nature of trade secret property rights, which required an owner to vigilantly guard the secret from the world in order to preserve its rights, made application of the two-year statute of limitations reasonable under the circumstances. Thus, the discovery rule exception did not apply and &sect; 16.003(a) was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent mother filed a wrongful death action against petitioner health care providers. On appeal, the court reversed the lower court's decision, finding instead that the statute of limitations barred respondent's wrongful death claim.

Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 4590i, &sect; 10.01. The court held that the tolling provision of &sect; 10.01 applied to claims filed by a minor or on a minor's behalf, but that the tolling provision did not apply to the wrongful death claim filed by respondent, who was an adult. The court found that &sect; 10.01 did not violate the open courts provision of Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 13. The court also held that &sect; 10.01 was not unconstitutional under Tex. Const. art.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Seeking a declaration that the Attorney Occupation Tax, Texas Tax Code &sect;&sect; 191.141-191.145 was unconstitutional, relators filed an original petition with the court. The court held that a request for declaratory relief did not establish jurisdiction in the court. Thus, the court held that it could not consider the merits of relators' request. Relators also brought a writ of mandamus. The court held that mandamus was an extraordinary remedy that was not available from any state court when a party had an adequate legal remedy. The court found that relators had not met their burden of showing that pursuing their claims first in the trial court would cause them to suffer any immediate harm entitling them to mandamus relief. Moreover, the court declared that it would not issue an original writ of mandamus absent a compelling reason. Relators asserted as compelling reasons for the invocation of the court's original jurisdiction the need to protect the court's role as the ultimate supervisory authority over the state bar. The court held that the court's inherent powers, such as the power to regulate the bar, were administrative powers, not jurisdictional powers.</SPAN></P>

The court stated that although minors had constitutional rights, they did not have the same constitutional rights as adults. Consequently, the court held that the state had more control over the conduct of minors than it did over adults. Therefore, the judgment of the appellate court was affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was affirmed because respondent had the authority to impose hair length and earring restrictions upon its male high school students. The court refused to use the state Constitution to micro-manage state high schools.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondents sued petitioner alleging that her negligence in providing diagnosis, prenatal supervision, and treatment of the mother caused their child to be delivered stillborn. The trial court sustained petitioner's special exception and dismissed the case. The appeals court reversed and remanded the case. Although the overwhelming majority of states now permit some form of recovery for the loss of a fetus, the court declined to overrule its prior opinions, and held that there was no wrongful death or survival cause of action for the death of a fetus. However, the court allowed the mother, and not the father, to recover mental anguish damages suffered as a result of her injury that was proximately caused by petitioner's negligence. Finally, respondents were not entitled to damages for their loss of society, companionship, and affection suffered as a result of the loss of the fetus.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Applying for a writ of error, defendant surgeon challenged the appeals court's judgment declaring &sect; 10.01 of the Medical Liability and Insurance Improvement Act (Act), Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 4590i, &sect; 10.01 (1994), unconstitutional as applied to minors suing for personal injuries. When plaintiff was 15 years old, defendant operated on plaintiff's hip, causing bone injuries that required additional surgeries and, after plaintiff turned 18, a total hip replacement. Plaintiff sued for negligence. The trial court dismissed because the Act's two-year statute of limitations had expired. The court of appeals reversed. On appeal, the state's highest court agreed that the Act was unconstitutional as applied to minors under the &quot;open courts&quot; provision in Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 13, because the Act precluded plaintiff from suing after he reached his majority. The two-year statute of limitations for minors' personal injury claims in Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Ann. &sect;&sect; 16.001, 16.003, was tolled until plaintiff reached 18. Because plaintiff brought suit within two years after his 18th birthday, his suit was timely. The court affirmed the decision of the appeals court and remanded for trial.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the court of appeals' decision holding a section of a state medical liability act unconstitutional because its prohibition against minors bringing personal injury suits more than two years after injury impinged on plaintiff's state constitutional right to seek legal redress in the state's courts after he reached his majority.

The court held that &sect;11.433 simply prescribed the time in which a tax exemption must be claimed and did not release or extinguish tax obligations. When an application was no longer allowed, the taxing unit was free to collect its taxes. The court compared the tolling provision in &sect; 11.433 to statutes of limitations, which were permissible under &sect; 55 because they did not release or extinguish a debt but merely affected the remedy when its enforcement was sought. The court also held that &sect; 11.433 was not a retroactive law prohibited by Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 16. The court found that a taxing unit had no vested right to taxes until the exemption was determined and that &sect; 11.433 did not extinguish any tax liability.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted writs of error to resolve a conflict between the Courts of Appeal for the Thirteenth and Fourteenth Districts (Texas) regarding whether Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code &sect; 101.106 barred the simultaneous rendition of judgment against a governmental unit and its employee.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In each of two cases that were consolidated, a governmental employee injured a motorist. In the first case, the trial court rendered judgment against defendant employee and defendant city jointly and severally. The court of appeals held that the judgment against defendant city barred judgment against defendant employee under the Tort Claims Act, Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code &sect; 101.106. In the second case, a different court of appeals held that the Act did not bar a concurrent judgment against a governmental unit and its employee. On review, the court held that a judgment against a governmental unit under the Act barred a simultaneous judgment against the employee whose actions gave rise to the claim. The statutory bar applied if the judgment against the governmental unit occurred at any time before or during the pendency of a suit against an employee. Although a party who pursued the statutory remedy against a governmental unit could lose her common law remedy against the employee, the party could also choose to pursue the common law remedy and forego or postpone any attempt to collect from the government. The Act thus did not unconstitutionally restrict a common law right of action.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that a judgment against a governmental unit under the Tort Claims Act barred a simultaneous judgment against a governmental employee whose actions gave rise to the claim. Because the judgments against defendant cities were rendered during the time in which the trial court had plenary power over the actions against defendant employees, the latter actions were statutorily barred.</SPAN></P>

XVI, &sect; 26 was intended to permit heirs to pursue punitive damages where a statutory cause of action for compensatory damages existed, but did not grant an independent punitive recovery. Respondent also asserted that the Texas Open Courts Provision, Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 13 was violated by &sect; 411.003(a), but the court held that the open courts provision did not apply because respondent's cause of action did not exist at common law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The 250th Judicial District Court of Travis County (Texas), found 1993 Tex. Gen. Laws 1479, the statutory scheme for public school finance, constitutional but found the statute did not provide efficient funding for facilities and enjoined the issuance of bonds. Appellant school districts challenged the judgment that the statute was constitutional. Appellee, State of Texas, challenged the court's finding concerning funding for facilities.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a challenge to the public school finance bill passed by the legislature as 1993 Tex. Gen. Laws 1479, the trial court held the system met the requirements of Tex. Const. art. VII, &sect;1, but found that the legislature failed to provide efficiently for facilities and enjoined the issuance of bonds until the inefficiency was corrected. Appellants, nine groups of school districts, local officials, and parents, perfected direct appeals. Groups of appellants challenged the efficiency of the system, the revenue system, and the distribution of excess county education district funds. Another group complained of the dismissal of their cause of action. Appellee state perfected an appeal complaining of the trial court's ruling on facilities. The court held that efficiency did not require equal access to funding at all levels and the system provided a general diffusion of knowledge under the funding provided. The court affirmed the constitutionality of the public school finance system enacted. The court held that the challenge to the school finance law based on inadequate provision for facilities failed only because of an evidentiary void.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, nine groups of school districts and parent intervenors, challenged a judgment of the 250th Judicial District Court of Travis County, Texas, holding that Senate Bill 7, 1993 Tex. Gen. Laws 1479, was constitutional. Appellee, the State, challenged the district court's order enjoining the issuance of bonds for school districts after September 1, 1995, unless there was efficient funding for educational facilities by then.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the court affirmed the constitutionality of the public school finance system enacted in Senate Bill 7, 1993 Tex. Gen. Laws 1479. The court vacated the district court's injunction on the issuance of bonds after September 1, 1995, ruling in favor of appellee, the State, and affirmed dismissal of appellant parents' petition in intervention. The court held that Senate Bill 7 did not fail to provide an efficient system of public education as required by Tex. Const. art. VII, &sect; 1, simply because it did not have a separate facilities component. The court upheld the $ 280,000-per-student cap on a district's taxable property, allowing appellee, the State, to tap the reservoirs of taxable property situated in property-rich districts. The court found that under the law, children who lived in property-poor districts and property-rich districts had substantially equal access to the funds necessary for a general diffusion of knowledge. The court upheld the options for school districts to voluntarily reconfigure, the power given to the Commissioner of Education to involuntarily reconfigure districts, and the distribution of excess county education district funds.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed and vacated the district court's judgment enjoining the issuance of bonds after September 1, 1995, thereby ruling in favor of appellee, the State. The court affirmed dismissal of appellant parents' petition because it did not assert justiciable claims.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners, state bar and officers, challenged the lower court of appeals' judgment that reversed the dismissal of respondent indigent persons' suit in the trial court. Petitioners sought a writ of error to determine whether the trial court had jurisdiction to hear respondents' suit to compel petitioners to provide services to indigent persons. The court reversed and found that the court possessed the power to regulate the practice of law in the state. The court determined that respondents' case was not justiciable because the dispute between petitioners and respondents would not be resolved by the judicial relief sought. The court's inherent power to regulate the practice of law was not jurisdictional, instead it was administrative supported by the State Bar Act, Tex. Gov't. Code Ann. &sect; 81.011(c). The court noted that the trial court did not have jurisdiction over the dispute and any opinion rendered would have been an advisory opinion prohibited by the Tex. Const. art. II, &sect; 1. The essence of respondents' complaint was that the court failed to establish rules that governed an aspect of attorney conduct, and the trial court had no authority to assume the court's role.</SPAN></P>

The patient, the movant in that action, sought discovery of relator's medical and mental health records on the basis that relator's medical and emotional problems affected the patient's treatment. Relator asserted the physician-patient and mental health information privileges under Tex. R. Civ. Evid. 509 and 510. The trial court, however, ordered production of the records and relator sought a writ of mandamus. The court noted that the &quot;offensive use&quot; exception did not apply to the rules in question. Instead, the court established the test for the exceptions under rules 509 and 510 applied only when the records sought were relevant to the condition at issue and the condition was relied upon as part of a party's claim or defense, meaning that the condition was a fact that carries legal significance. The court noted that this test did not violate relator's rights to privacy and granted a conditional writ, ordering the trial court to conduct an in camera inspection of the requested records and to release only those records that met both prongs of the test identified by the court.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners, hash brown, apple pie, and potato whitener manufacturers appealed a judgment in respondent relatives' products liability action. The victim died after an allergic reaction to sulfites in foods served on a navy base. Respondent relatives brought suit against petitioners, alleging negligence, deceptive trade practices, strict liability, and breach of warranty and against the Navy, alleging negligence and failure to warn of sulfites. The state court granted summary judgment to respondent food company, and the appellate court reversed. The federal court held that the Navy was not liable. The trial court granted summary judgment to petitioners. The appellate court reversed in part and affirmed in part. On appeal, the court affirmed because a fact issue existed and collateral estoppel could not be applied because doing so would not further the doctrine's goals, despite the fact that the issue of whether potato whitener was in the salad had already been fully litigated in the federal action. The doctrine's purposes were not served because it would not conserve judicial resources, and it was unfair to respondent relatives given the procedural peculiarities of the case.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit certified the questions of whether the state of Texas recognized the tort of false light invasion of privacy, and if so, what statute of limitations governed, after appellant inmate brought an action for the tort against appellee publisher.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant inmate filed an action for the tort of false light invasion of privacy against appellee publisher, following appellee's publication of negative references to appellant's character and criminal record. The trial court dismissed the action. The appellate court certified the question of whether Texas recognized the tort of false light invasion of privacy, and if so, what statute of limitations governed the action. The appellate court found that the issues were unsettled under Texas law. The court rejected the false light invasion of privacy tort, citing two reasons. First, the court held that the tort was largely duplicative of other rights of recovery, particularly defamation. The court noted that most of the injuries redressed by the false light tort were also redressed by defamation. Second, the court held that the tort lacked many of the procedural limitations that accompanied actions for defamation, and if the tort were adopted, then the free speech right of citizens under both the Texas and United States Constitutions would be unacceptably derogated. Thus, the court answered the first certified question in the negative, and the second question was rendered moot.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that Texas did not recognize the tort of false light of invasion of privacy because the tort merely duplicated other, more well-established and procedurally limited torts, such as defamation, and that the tort would unnecessarily abridge free speech under both the Texas and United States Constitutions. In view of the court's holding, the issue of the statute of limitations for the tort was not addressed.</SPAN></P>

Respondents brought suit against numerous defendants, including petitioner manufacturer. The trial court granted petitioner's motion for summary judgment agreeing with petitioner that, because said respondent could not introduce evidence that she was in fact wearing her seat belt at the time of the collision, she would be unable to prove causation. The appeals court reversed and remanded to the trial court, holding the statute unconstitutionally restricted said respondent's common-law claim. On further appeal, the court affirmed because it concluded that the legislature did not intend to bar use of evidence regarding seat belt use.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner state agency sought a writ of error regarding the judgment of the Court of Appeals of Texas, Second District, which upheld the trial court's judgment in favor of respondent parents, where petitioner sought review of the district court's construction of private school exemption pursuant to Tex. Educ. Code Ann. &sect; 21.033(a)(1), the propriety of injunctive relief, and respondents' attorney fees award.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After petitioner state agency began prosecuting parents of home schooled children as violators of the compulsory attendance law, under Tex. Educ. Code Ann. &sect; 21.032, respondent parents sought injunctive relief to stop the prosecutions. The trial court issued a declaratory judgment construing &sect; 21.032 to include home schooled children within the statute's exemption, permanently enjoined any further prosecutions, and awarded respondents attorney fees. The court of appeals affirmed, on other grounds, and petitioners sought a writ of error. On hearing, the court affirmed and reversed in part the affirmation of the permanent injunction. The court found that, in view of the record, the trial court's declaration of the meaning of &quot;private school&quot; in &sect; 21.033(a)(1), as it related to home schools, was correct. The award of attorney fees was proper because the award was authorized by statute, which waived governmental immunity where the state was a necessary party to the action. The issuance of a permanent injunction was unnecessary because there was no indication that petitioners would attempt to contravene the court's decision.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent parents sued petitioners, city and police officers, for common law negligence, as well as for civil rights violations under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983, after a high-speed police chase seriously injured respondents' son.

The lower court reversed the grant of summary judgment for petitioners on state law immunity, and it remanded the negligence claim. On appeal, the court affirmed the &sect; 1983 ruling but not on the same grounds as the lower court. The court held with respect to appellees' substantive due process claim of excessive force under &sect;1983 that petitioner officers did not violate any rights, as the high-speed chase was not so brutal and offensive as to shock the conscience. The court established a new standard of good faith to be applied on remand to determine whether petitioner officers had official immunity with respect to the negligence claim involving performance of discretionary functions. Immunity would apply if a reasonably prudent officer, acting under similar circumstances, would have found that the need to immediately apprehend the suspect outweighed the risk of harm to the public.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner workers' compensation carrier filed an application for writ of error, seeking clarification on the gross negligence standard and the imposition of punitive damages in the context of bad faith insurance litigation. The Court of Appeals for the Eighth District of Texas had affirmed the jury's award of actual damages, mental anguish damages, and punitive damages to respondent injured employee for petitioner's bad faith acts.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Under the workers' compensation laws, respondent injured employee's medical costs were to paid by petitioner workers' compensation carrier. Petitioner refused to pay for respondent's medical treatments because the treatment partially involved psychiatric care, even though petitioner had authorized the testing. The trial court awarded punitive damages to respondent for petitioner's bad faith and the appellate court affirmed. After reviewing the record, the court concluded that petitioner's delay or refusal to pay respondent's claim was not gross negligence, it was simply bad faith. The court held that an insurer was liable for punitive damages only if the bad faith tort was accompanied by gross negligence. The existence of mental anguish damages alone did not warrant legal punishment by punitive damages. Here, the evidence did not support a finding that petitioner was actually aware of an extreme risk or a likelihood of serious harm to respondent that was independent and qualitatively different from the inconvenience of an unreasonable delay in payment. The court also instituted procedural standards for punitive damage awards to include bifurcated trials and close scrutiny.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court withdrew its earlier opinion on petitioner workers' compensation carrier's motion for rehearing. The court reversed the judgment of the court of appeals, which had affirmed the jury's award of actual, mental anguish, and punitive damages to respondent injured employee. Respondent did not present legally sufficient evidence of gross negligence and was not entitled to punitive damages.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that Tex. Tax Code Ann. &sect; 23.56(3) violated Tex. Const. art.

The court concluded that the classification drawn by Tex. Tax Code Ann. &sect; 23.56(3) violated equal protection, as it was not rationally related to the promotion and preservation of open-space land. Petitioner &quot;foreign corporation,&quot; a Virginia corporation whose majority interest was owned by a nonresident alien, a Switzerland corporation, had sought review of the denial of its application for open-space land valuation by respondent, the Kaufman County Single Appraisal District.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner sought relief from an assessment for additional sales taxes that resulted from an audit. After an administrative hearing, the petitioner was found to be liable for $ 127,574.46 in taxes. Petitioner sought judicial review, but the trial court dismissed for want of jurisdiction because petitioner had not paid the tax or posted a statutorily required bond under Tex. Tax. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 112.051, 112.101. The court of appeals affirmed. On review, the court held that conditioning a taxpayer's right to initiate judicial review on the payment of taxes or the posting of a bond equal to twice the alleged tax obligation violated the open courts mandate of Tex. Const. Art. I, &sect; 13. The court held that sections 111.022 and 112.101 protected the respondent against delays that might impinge its ability to collect taxes. However, the court held that Tex. Tax Code Ann. &sect; 112.108 was unconstitutional and void because it would preclude a taxpayer from obtaining judicial review of its tax liability by means of a declaratory action.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner, the State of Texas, sought a writ of error to review a judgment from the Court of Appeals for the Third District (Texas). The court of appeals affirmed the judgment of the trial court, which declared that the sodomy statute,&nbsp;Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 21.06 (1989), was unconstitutional and enjoined the statute's enforcement.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondents, who were homosexuals, brought a constitutional challenge to the sodomy statute,&nbsp;Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 21.06, claiming that the statute violated their constitutional right to privacy, the due course of law provision under Tex. Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 13, 19, and the equal protection provision under Tex. Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 3, 3A. The trial court declared that the statute was unconstitutional and enjoined its enforcement; the court of appeals affirmed. The court reversed and remanded with instructions to dismiss. Intervention by an equity court was not proper unless a statute was unconstitutional and there was a threat of irreparable injury to vested property rights. Where there was no actual or threatened enforcement of a statute, a civil court would not enjoin the enforcement of the statute. Moreover, a civil court did not have jurisdiction to render declarations of the legal rights or relationships arising under a statute. If civil courts accepted jurisdiction over such constitutional challenges to criminal statutes, there was a potential for conflicting decisions between the civil and criminal courts of last resort concerning the validity of such statutes.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the declaratory judgment that enjoined the enforcement of the sodomy statute, and the court remanded with instructions to dismiss. A civil court did not have jurisdiction either to enjoin enforcement of a criminal statute where there was no actual or threatened enforcement of the statute or to issue declarations about legal rights arising under the statute.</SPAN></P>

The juvenile court waived exclusive jurisdiction and ordered the case transferred to a criminal district court. The court of appeals affirmed.

The court granted petitioner's application for writ of error, reversed the judgment of the court of appeals, and vacated the order of the juvenile court. The court found that the juvenile court failed to find that probable cause existed to believe that petitioner committed each offense. The court held that before a juvenile court waives its jurisdiction and order a case transferred to criminal court, the juvenile court had to first find that there was probable cause to believe that the juvenile committed each of the offenses that he was charged with.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, Mexican American organizations and individuals, filed a declaratory judgment action against defendants, governor and education officials, and contended that defendants' policies and practices denied Mexican Americans living in Texas' border area participation in higher education programs and access to resources. The trial court found for plaintiffs. Defendants appealed, and the court reversed. The court noted that if the classification complained of was based on geography, then there was not an equal protection violation because defendants had satisfied the rational basis test. The court held that plaintiffs had failed to establish that defendants' system imposed unequal burdens on plaintiffs because there was no direct evidence of defendants' intent to discriminate. Further, there was no showing of a sufficiently high level of disparate impact to raise an inference of intent, and impact evidence did not rise to an adequate level to show discrimination. The court also held that higher education was not a fundamental right, entitled to strict scrutiny review, under the Texas constitution because Tex. Const. art. VII, &sect; 1 applied only to lower levels of education.</SPAN></P>

The trial court specifically deferred the effective date of the injunction until May 1, 1993, to allow time for appeal or for the Texas Legislature to enact corrective legislation. Appellants filed a timely appeal from the trial court's judgment. A ruling on the appeal was pending on May 1, 1993, when the injunctive relief took effect.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Relator contemnors were held in civil contempt and jailed for disregarding restraining orders that limited demonstrations near abortion clinics during a national convention. Relators brought an original habeas corpus proceeding asserting that the restraining orders were unconstitutional restraints of protected expression under Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 8. The court released contemnors on bond after they were denied relief by the court of appeals.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">During a national political convention, relators planned protests at local abortion clinics. The clinics obtained temporary restraining orders to limit the demonstrations so as to protect public access. In disregard of the restraining orders, relators demonstrated within 100 feet of clinic access points, and were held in contempt and committed to county jail. Relators sought habeas relief, asserting that the restraining orders violated Tex. Const. art. I &sect; 8 and were unenforceable. Conceding that the threat of injury to the clinics was both imminent and irreparable, the court noted that the 100-foot zone around each of the clinics encompassed not just clinic property, but public streets and sidewalks as well. In a plurality opinion, the court held that the evidence was insufficient to prove that the 100-foot zone was the least restrictive means for guarding against harassment and intimidation of persons exercising their constitutional right to privacy, or that the unchallenged provisions of the temporary restraining orders provided inadequate protection. The court held that the 100-foot limitation violated Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 8 and was hence unenforceable against relators.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court ordered that relator contemnors, released on bond pending the court's decision, would remain discharged. Without specific findings supported by evidence that the 100-foot zone designated in the temporary restraining orders was the least restrictive means to ensure unimpeded access to abortion clinics and guard against intimidation and harassment, the court held that the limitation unconstitutionally restricted free expression.</SPAN></P>

The court of appeals held that Tex. Fam. Code Ann. &sect; 11.03(a)(7), the legal basis for the trial court's dismissal, violated the due course of law guarantee in Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 19.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee father was the natural father of a child who was conceived and born while appellant mother was married to appellant presumed father. Appellant accepted responsibility as the father of the child by contracting and paying for prenatal care during the mother's pregnancy.

The trial court dismissed in reliance on Tex. Fam. Code Ann. &sect; 11.03(a)(7), which granted standing only to biological fathers of children who have no presumed father. After thoroughly reviewing the history of laws involving illegitimacy, the court affirmed the holding of the court of appeals that statutes denying standing to a putative father who accepts early parental responsibilities for the child violate the due course of law guarantee of Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 19.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the husband filed for divorce, the trial court dissolved the parties' marriage, divided the estate, awarded conservatorship of the children, ordered child support, and awarded the wife damages for emotional distress caused by her husband's deviate sexual acts. The husband appealed, and the court of appeals affirmed the judgment. He then applied for a writ of error. The court reversed the judgment, holding that Texas did not recognize the tort of negligent infliction of emotional distress. However, the court adopted the tort of intentional infliction of emotional distress. Consequently, the court remanded the case for a new trial on intentional infliction of emotional distress because the case had proceeded on the theory of negligence. The court further held that there was no legal impediment to bringing a tort claim in a divorce action based on either negligence or an intentional act. Additionally, the court found that the trial court made a disproportionate property division based on the husband's cruel treatment and adultery and that it appeared that such an award allowed the wife a double recovery based on the same conduct.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted the writ of error and reversed the judgment affirming the award to respondent wife for negligent infliction of emotional distress in a divorce proceeding with petitioner husband because Texas did not recognize the claim of negligent infliction of emotional distress. The court remanded the case for new trial because it adopted the tort of intentional infliction of emotional harm.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged the decision of the 250th District Court, Travis County (Texas), that upheld the Clean Air Act of Texas, 1967 Tex. Gen. Laws 1941, the Solid Waste Disposal Act, 1969 Tex. Gen. Laws 1320, and the Water Quality Act - Revision, 1969 Tex. Gen. Laws 2229, as constitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant brought a declaratory judgment action seeking a ruling that statutes empowering two state administrative agencies to levy civil penalties for violations of their regulations conflicted with the open courts and jury trial provisions of the Texas Constitution. The trial court found the statutes constitutional. On appeal, the court held that the statutes at issue failed to comport with the open courts provision of Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 13. The court held that citizens must have access to courts unimpeded by unreasonable financial barriers. The court found that, under the statutes at issue, the offender must either tender a cash deposit or post a supersedeas bond in the full amount of the penalties assessed, or forfeit the right to judicial review. The court held that this forfeiture provision was an unreasonable restriction on access to the courts. However, the court found that the regulations did not violate the jury trial provisions of the Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 15. The court held that certain judicial functions could be delegated constitutionally by the legislature to administrative agencies in furtherance of the preservation of the state's natural resources.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed that portion of the trial court judgment that declared the Texas Clean Air Act, Water Code, and Solid Waste Disposal Act did not violate the open courts provision of the Texas Constitution, and affirmed that portion declaring that the listed statutes did not violate the jury trial provision. The court held that the requirement of a supersedeas bond or cash deposit as a prerequisite to judicial review was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Two cases that involved that authority of petitioner, Texas General Land Office, to determine contract rights under state mineral lease issues came before the court on application for Writ of Error. In each case, the Texas Court of Appeals affirmed a summary judgment that granted declaratory relief to respondent lessees on the ground that the Texas Natural Resource Code did not authorize the petitioner to adjudicate such contract rights.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed, on grounds other than those articulated by the courts below, summary judgments that granted declaratory relief to respondent lessees in actions to determine contract rights under state mineral leases. The court held that Tex. Nat. Res. Code Ann. &sect; 52.135 authorized the Commissioner of the General Land Office to conduct full-scale audits, encompassing legal as well as factual determinations, and to hold hearings for the redetermination of deficiency assessments. The court held, however, that respondent lessees could not be bound by the determinations made in such hearings. The court stated that a respondent could challenge those determinations in the manner prescribed in Tex. Nat. Res. Code Ann. &sect; 52.137; but that because the prepayment requirement of Tex. Nat. Res. Code Ann. &sect; 52.137(a) offended the open courts provision, Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 13, respondents did not need to make a protest payment before bringing suit.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgments in favor of respondent lessees were affirmed on grounds other than those articulated below, because though the legislature intended petitioner, Texas General Land Office, to interpret and apply contractual provisions in state mineral leases, the relevant code provisions, insofar as they required respondents to prepay disputed amounts before contesting the agency's determinations in court, were unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner chemical corporation sought review of the decision of the Court of Appeals for the Thirteenth District of Texas, which affirmed the trial court's judgment awarding respondents, parents of the deceased, actual damages in their individual capacity, and actual and punitive damages in their capacity as representatives of the decedents' estates in an action brought against petitioner for the wrongful deaths of the deceased.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondents, the parents of the deceased, filed product's liability and wrongful death actions, in their individual capacities as parents and representatives of the decedents' estates, against petitioner chemical manufacturer after their two sons died from using petitioner's chemical while working off the coast of Texas. The trial court entered a judgment in favor of respondents, based upon state law, and awarded them actual damages, individually, and actual and punitive damages in their survival actions as representatives of the estates. The court of appeals affirmed the decision and petitioner sought review. The court affirmed the appellate court's determination that state law applied because, although petitioner properly invoked maritime law, it waived this issue by failing to object to evidence and jury questions regarding damages that were not recoverable under maritime law. The court reversed the appellate court's award of punitive damages because it exceeded the amount permitted under Tex. Const. art. XVI, &sect; 26 and Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code &sect; 41.007, which limited punitive damages to four times the actual damages awarded to respondents in the survival causes of action.</SPAN></P>

At trial, petitioner applicant sought an injunction compelling respondent to hire the most qualified person for that particular position and declaratory relief. The court found that declaratory relief was improper because the action sought to be enjoined was accomplished. Suitable coercive relief became impossible because respondent withdrew from offering adoption services, and the position petitioner applicant wanted was abolished.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner longshoreman was unloading cargo when the truck he was driving flipped backwards and landed in the ship's hold. The truck was leased from respondent port authority, which owned it. Respondent was a navigation district created under Tex. Const. art. XVI, &sect;59 (1927). Petitioner recovered $ 956,781.91 in damages from respondent, and respondent appealed. The lower court reformed the judgment to limit respondent's liability to $ 100,000 as required by the Texas Tort Claim act, Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code &sect;&sect;101.001(2)(B), 101.025, 101.051. Petitioner argued that a limitation on immunity should occur when the governmental entity was involved in activities that a private entity could do. The court held that to waive immunity in this context would virtually vitiate immunity entirely because there were only a few activities that were uniquely governmental. The court found that applying immunity based upon the creation of the governmental unit instead of its function resulted in certain anomalies and inconsistencies. However, the lower court's judgment was affirmed and no error was found because any waiver of immunity needed to occur in the Texas legislature.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A condemnation action was submitted to the jury on the theory that petitioner condemnee was entitled to compensation from respondent condemnor for the cost of purchasing substitute facilities and the lower court reversed the award. The court affirmed the judgment of the lower court and held that the substitute facilities doctrine did not apply to the taking of a private school. The court found that a departure from the market value concept was not justified even though petitioner's situation presented unique and sympathetic facts. The court held that respondent's objection to the charge on the ground that the substitute facilities doctrine did not apply to private schools was sufficient to preserve error regarding the erroneous submission of the case to the jury on the substitute facilities doctrine. The court also held that respondent did not waive the market value measure of compensation. Respondent correctly recognized that the most common method of determining market value could not be successfully utilized in this situation, resorted to additional methods, and argued the applicability of these methods and offered evidence regarding their application.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Relator guardian ad litem sought a writ of mandamus to the 151st Judicial District Court of Harris County, Texas. Relator contended that the court's gag orders violated the guarantee of free expression contained in Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 8.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a suit concerning toxic chemical exposure at a dump site, the trial judge appointed relator, to be guardian ad litem for 213 children who were also plaintiffs. After 18 months, a hearing was held and the trial judge entered a gag and protective order, instructing the guardian ad litem, parties and counsel to cease and desist any discussion of the case outside the court hearing and prohibiting any communications with any other lawyer or discussion at all about the matters that had transpired in the case. The guardian ad litem was subsequently dismissed by the trial judge. Relator then brought this writ of mandamus action challenging the trial court orders. The court held that the gag orders violated Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 8. The orders failed to identify any miscommunication that the trial court may have perceived, did not indicate any specific, imminent harm to the litigation, and offered no explanation of why such harm could not be sufficiently cured by remedial action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted a partial writ of mandamus finding that the trial court gag order's violated the state's constitutional guarantee of free expression. The court invalidated the trial court's unconstitutional prior restraint on speech. Because the trial court did not otherwise abuse its discretion, the remainder of the petition was denied.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner state appealed from a decision of the Court of Appeals for the Fourteenth District (Texas) in a condemnation action involving a partial taking. The court was to determine whether the trial court erred by excluding evidence offered by petitioner state, the condemnor, controverting that offered by respondent landowners as to the appropriate economic unit to be considered by the jury for determining the market value of the part taken.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner state, through its highways department, condemned 2 acres out of a 19-acre tract belonging to respondent landowners to widen an existing highway. A panel of special commissioners determined the award of adequate compensation to be paid by the state. Respondents objected to the award and appealed to the county court. In the county court, respondents filed a motion in limine to exclude evidence of the market value of the 19-acre tract as a whole, contending that use of an averaging method of valuation resulted in unconstitutional compensation. The county court granted the motion in limine. The state was not allowed to present evidence for its position that the market value of the condemned land should be based on an economic unit consisting of the entire tract and the highest and best use of the land, though its expert testified subject to the motion's limitation. The county court rendered a jury verdict affirmed by the appeals court. The state appealed from both judgments. The court reversed the lower courts' judgments, finding reversible error because the lower court jury was not able to consider all competing evidence of valuation, and remanded for a new trial.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the appeals court decision that affirmed the trial court decision to exclude evidence offered by the state controverting that offered by respondent landowners, which had been admitted into evidence regarding the appropriate economic unit the jury was to consider.

The appellate court reversed the trial court and held that there was no evidence that the parking lots were primarily used for religious purposes to justify a tax exemption. The court stated whether a church parking lot was tax-exempt depended upon whether the lots were used primarily for religious purposes. The court noted that testimony indicated that the lots were purchased to ensure adequate parking for church members attending services. The court noted that 40 spaces were reversed for the church at all times and the remaining spaces were reserved for church use at all times except weekdays from 7:30 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. The court held that there was evidence to support the jury's finding that the parking lots were used primarily for religious purposes.

The court of appeals reversed, finding that the trial court had no jurisdiction and dismissed the cause. Although the lawsuit was not within the trial court's express jurisdiction, the court reversed the court of appeals and held that the trial court properly exercised jurisdiction under Tex. Gov't. Code Ann. &sect; 25.0732(t) and that the section was constitutional. However, the court rendered a declaration that the fee was illegal. Because no article of the Code of Criminal Procedure provided that a county commissioners court could have levied a fee against petitioners, and because Tex. Local Gov't.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner enrolled at respondent university after it assured her it would provide her a safe place of residence. Petitioner was raped by an armed intruder in her campus dormitory room. Petitioner sued, claiming damages for her injuries from respondent and alleging that respondent breached its contract with her, breached express and implied warranties to her, was negligent, and violated a state deceptive trade practices-consumer protection act. A divided court of appeals affirmed the district court's grant of summary judgment for respondent on the ground that petitioner's causes of action were barred by governmental immunity because they arose out of an intentional tort. On further appeal, the court reversed, finding error in the lower courts' conclusion that petitioner's claims were barred as a matter of law by the Texas Tort Claims Act, Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann. &sect; 101.057(2). The court found that &sect; 101.057(2) did not specify whether the tortfeasor had to be the governmental employee or could be a third party, but that the more plausible reading of the provision was the tortfeasor had to be the governmental employee whose conduct was the subject of the complaint.</SPAN></P>

The court of appeals affirmed, holding that petitioner engaged in predatory pricing by charging below its average total cost. On review, the court reversed in part, holding that the court of appeals used an incorrect measure of cost. The court found that petitioner did not engage in predatory pricing because respondent failed to introduce any evidence that petitioner charged below its average variable cost. The court remanded to the court of appeals for consideration of respondent's tortious interference with business relations claim. The court ruled that upon respondent's request, the court of appeals would remand to the trial court for a new trial on respondent's antitrust claims.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In this consolidated action, appellants school districts and individual citizens challenged the judgments of three district courts (Texas) in five separate cases, which found the state public school finance system devised by S. 351, 72nd Leg., Reg. Sess. (Tex. 1991) constitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants school districts and individual citizens challenged the constitutionality of the state public school finance system devised by S. 351, 72nd Leg., Reg. Sess. (Tex. 1991) (the bill). In five separate actions, three district courts found the bill constitutional, and appellants challenged. The court held that the bill levied a state ad valorem tax in violation of Tex. Const. art. VIII, &sect;1-e because it created county education districts (CEDs) to levy a uniform tax statewide and the distribution of the proceeds was set by the bill. No CED had any discretion in determining either the tax rate or the distribution. The court further held that the bill violated Tex. Const. art. VII, &sect; 3 because it levied an ad valorem tax without an election. Although appellants claimed that the bill violated Tex. Const. art. III, &sect;&sect; 56 and 64(a), the court found no such violation because it was not a special or local law and no school districts were consolidated. Having concluded that the bill was unconstitutional; the court then applied the Chevron test and held that its decision was prospective in nature. Thus, the CEDs were permitted to collect all 1991 and 1992 taxes under this system.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgments of the district courts and held that the state public school finance system was unconstitutional because it levied a state ad valorem tax and allowed the levy of such taxes without an election. The court, however, applied its decision prospectively and allowed the collection of taxes under this system for prior tax years.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Relators sought a writ of mandamus to respondent judge of the 332nd District Court of Hidalgo County (Texas). Relators sought to direct respondent to vacate two judgments that ordered that all elections for the Texas Senate and House of Representatives be based, not upon reapportionment statutes enacted by the Texas Legislature, but upon districts reconfigured by the district court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In an original proceeding, relators, non-parties in two suits that challenged a reapportionment plan, sought a writ of mandamus vacating the judgments in the suits. The judgments were based on a settlement agreement between plaintiffs in both cases and top state officials. In litigation challenging the accuracy of the 1990 census and the validity of any redistricting based upon it, respondent judge ordered reconfigured senatorial districts based, not upon the reapportionment statute enacted by the state legislature, but upon districts reconfigured by respondent judge. Relators argued that respondent judge, in redistricting the state by merely approving an agreement of some state officials and a few individuals, had encroached upon the legislative power. The court ruled that respondent judge abused his discretion by ordering a reapportionment without a determination that the legislative reapportionment plan was invalid. The court held that relators were entitled to relief by mandamus because the procedural complexities of both cases denied any other effective relief to relators and because request and refusal was not required for mandamus relief in every case.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that relators were entitled to mandamus and directed the lower court to vacate its judgments because the lower court abused its discretion in ordering a reapportionment plan without a determination that the legislative reapportionment plan was invalid. The court held that a district court could not order a reapportionment plan based upon nothing more than an agreement between some state officials and a few citizens.</SPAN></P>

In the underlying suit, defendant challenged plaintiffs' tax assessments against defendant's airplane, arguing that determination of the plane's legal situs was erroneous and that relevant sections of the state tax code were unconstitutional. The court granted defendant a writ of error and reversed that part of the judgment that awarded plaintiffs Rule 84 damages. The court ruled that while defendant failed to exhaust its administrative remedied before filing suit, as mandated by the tax code, defendant had at least an arguable basis for refusing to follow the tax code provisions, including cases holding that a party who availed itself of the benefits of the tax code was barred from challenging constitutionality of that statute.

The trial court overruled plaintiff's request and eventually entered judgment for defendant. Plaintiff contended opposing counsel had discriminatorily exercised a peremptory challenge. On appeal, the court reversed the decision and remanded for a new trial. The prohibition against using peremptory challenges to exclude jurors based on their race was extended to private litigants in civil actions. Previously, the prohibition was only upheld in criminal proceedings. The court reasoned that racial discrimination had no place in the judicial system, so that the use of race to exclude a potential juror was constitutionally prohibited.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner insurer was an English company with its principal place of business in England. Respondent insured corporations were American subsidiaries of an English company insured by petitioner. Pursuant to a policy issued by petitioner to the English company, respondents obtained liability insurance from an American insurer. Later, on behalf of the American insurer, respondents sued petitioner in state court for reimbursement of money paid to settle the wrongful death suits brought by the family of a deceased employee. The trial court granted petitioner's special appearance and dismissed the suit for lack of personal jurisdiction. On appeal, the intermediate appellate court reversed and remanded the case. On further appeal, the trial court's judgment was affirmed. The forum state's interests in adjudicating the dispute were minimal. The negotiation and performance of the policy at issue occurred in England. The real party in interest was the American insurer. Neither the deceased employee's family nor respondents had an interest in the suit. The assertion of personal jurisdiction over petitioner was unreasonable and did not comport with fair play and substantial justice.</SPAN></P>

It was inconsistent with federal constitutional requirements of due process to assert personal jurisdiction over petitioner.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a dispute over a school system financing plan, plaintiffs, school district and others, sought an interpretation of the court's case law that would permit the state-wide recapture of local ad valorem tax revenue. On a motion for rehearing, the court noted that it had held that school districts could be organized along county or other lines and be given the authority to generate local property tax revenue for all of the other school districts within their boundaries. However, the court declined plaintiffs' argument that all school districts were mere creatures of the state, holding instead that Tex. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 1-e, &sect; 3 mandated that local tax revenue was not subject to state-wide recapture. The court then noted that the school funding system at issue was unconstitutional because the state relied on unequalized funding in an attempt to discharge its duty to support an educational system.</SPAN></P>

Respondents, county appraisal districts, denied the applications and petitioners filed notices of protest with respondents, appraisal review boards, which also denied the applications. Petitioners filed suits challenging the denials. Both suits were tried on stipulated facts and resulted in judgments being entered against petitioners and the appeals were consolidated. The court held that only purely public charities were qualified to receive tax exemptions under Tex. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 2. The court held that an organization must first meet applicable constitutional requirements before the organization can be considered for tax exempt status under Tex. Tax Code Ann. &sect; 11.18. Because petitioners were not organized to provide charitable services to the community as a whole but were organized solely for the purpose of selling water to those within the boundaries of the district who could afford to pay the costs assessed, petitioners were not purely public charities entitled to exemption.</SPAN></P>

The trial court concluded that petitioner's action was barred by the four-year statute of limitations of Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann. &sect; 16.051. The court of appeals affirmed. Petitioner challenged the judgment, arguing that the statute of limitations unjustifiably discriminated against her and violated her right to equal protection under U.S. Const. amend. XIV, &sect; 1. The court held that a statutory classification based on illegitimacy violated equal protection unless it was substantially related to an important governmental interest. The court held that the statutes here were not substantially related to the furtherance of the orderly administration of estates and effected a complete bar to petitioner's recovery regardless of her claim's merits.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs sought relief from a judgment of the 250th District Court and for enforcement of mandate on the basis that the district court exceeded its authority by vacating the court's injunction. Defendant state officials cross-appealed on the basis that the district court erred in finding that school finance system continued to violate Tex. Const. art. VII, &sect; 1 after enactment of corrective legislation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court directed the district court to vacate that portion of a judgment that vacated an injunction affirmed by the court in an underlying action. The injunction enjoined defendants, state commissioner of education, state board of education, and state comptroller, from distributing any money under the then current Texas School Financing System, Tex. Educ. Code Ann. &sect;16.01, &sect; et. seq., until the legislature passed a constitutionally sufficient plan. The court held that the district court correctly concluded as a matter of law that corrective legislation enacted in response to the court's injunction continued to violate Tex. Const. art. VII, &sect; 1, as it left essentially intact the same funding system and failed to provide a direct and close correlation between a district's tax effort and the educational resources available to it. The court held that the district court abused its discretion in refusing to enforce the mandate of the court on equitable grounds and to avoid disruption to public education, as only the court could decide that for policy reasons its mandate should have been modified or vacated.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The district court was directed to vacate the portion of its judgment that vacated the injunction affirmed by the court and not to extend the modified deadline or to modify the injunction. The court held that based on the district court's finding that corrective legislation continued an unconstitutional funding system for public education, the district court clearly abused its discretion in refusing to enforce the mandate of the court.</SPAN></P>

Appellee argued that, according to Tex. Const. art. XVI, &sect; 28, appellant county wrongfully garnished his wages. The trial court also held that appellant county's action taken pursuant to Tex. Loc. Gov't Code Ann. &sect; 154.025 were in direct conflict with Tex. Const. art. XVI, &sect; 28. The court held that garnishment had to involve a third party and that appellant and its agents were not collecting amounts owed to a third party. Therefore, the statutory provision for withholding warrants when a party was indebted to a subdivision of the state as a matter of law was not a garnishment. Based on this reasoning, the court vacated the order granting a temporary injunction and rendered judgment denying temporary relief.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 4590i, &sect;&sect; 11.02, 11.03 (1991). Respondent hospital complained of the lower court's reversal of the trial court's j.n.o.v. and rendition.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury awarded damages to petitioner family of decedent, but the trial court rendered judgment notwithstanding the verdict. The lower court reversed, holding that there was some evidence that respondent hospital caused decedent's death and suggested remittiturs to reduce the damages awarded by the jury in accordance with Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 4590i, &sect; 11.02. Petitioners filed remittiturs, but expressly reserved the right to complain of the ruling. On appeal, petitioners argued that the lower court was prohibited by Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 13, and case law from reducing the damages awarded. The court found that petitioner's remedy was conferred by statute, thus the open courts provision did not apply and the legislature was permitted to constitutionally curtail their damages. Respondent contended that the remittitur became fatally defective because petitioners reserved the right to complain of the standard used in arriving at it. The court held that the remittitur was unaffected by a reservation of the right to appeal the standard and the correct standard was applied. The court reversed the judgment below insofar as it remanded for a new trial and otherwise affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner inmate sought review by writ of error of an order of the Twelfth District Court of Appeals of Anderson County (Texas), which affirmed the trial court's dismissal of his pro se suit against respondent prison director as frivolous. The inmate alleged that the prison's disciplinary rules were unconstitutionally vague and that he has been denied the use of an audiotape player in his cell to play tapes as part of his religion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Based on allegations regarding prison disciplinary rules that were unconstitutionally vague and denial of his right to religious freedom, the inmate asserted in his suit against the prison director that his rights under Tex. Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 3, 3a, 6, 13, 19 had been violated. The trial court granted the prison director's motion to dismiss the action with prejudice as frivolous under Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code &sect; 13.001. The inmate challenged the appellate court's order affirming the dismissal with prejudice of his pro se suit. The appellate court likened &sect;13.001 to 28 U.S.C.S. 1915(d), which authorized the dismissal of frivolous or malicious allegations in forma pauperis suits in federal court. On further appeal, the court noted that the trial court did not specify what factors under Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code &sect; 13.001(b) it had considered determinative and that the federal courts had cast some doubt on the appropriateness of dismissal based on certain factors. The court noted, however, that it did not have jurisdiction to consider the inmate's challenges to the validity of &sect; 13.001 because he failed to challenge the statute on direct appeal.</SPAN></P>

The outcome of the election was contested by plaintiff taxing unit in a declaratory judgment action, seeking judgment that &sect; 6.26 was unconstitutional, and that the election was therefore without effect. The trial court held that &sect; 6.26 impermissibly exceeded the authority granted to the legislature by Tex. Const. art. III, &sect; 64(a). On first appeal, the district court concluded that the election was not binding upon plaintiff taxing unit, and affirmed the judgment of the trial court to that extent. However, the court of appeals did not conclude that &sect; 6.26 otherwise conflicted with the state constitution, and held that the election was binding on all of the other taxing units affected. Plaintiff appealed for a judgment on the constitutionality of &sect; 6.26. The court held that &sect; 6.26 was unconstitutional, as it authorized by general statute action which, under Tex.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit granted appellant parent's motion to certify legal questions to the court. The court considered whether the discovery rule applied to the Texas Statute of Limitations, Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann. &sect; 16.003(b) (1986), in appellant's wrongful death action, and if the discovery rule did not apply, did the statute's application violate the open courts provision of Tex. Const. art.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court granted summary judgment for appellee manufacturer in appellant parent's wrongful death suit, because appellant brought the suit more than two years after his infant's date of death. Appellant argued that the discovery rule, an exception to statutes of limitations, should apply to Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann. &sect; 16.003(b) (1986), because he neither knew nor could have known the cause of his injury within the two-year limitation period. The court found that the language used in &sect; 16.003(b) reflected a clear legislative intent to adopt an absolute two-year limitations period for wrongful death actions and that the legislature foreclosed judicial application of the discovery rule. Appellant contended that if &sect; 16.003(b) did not provide for application of the discovery rule, it violated the open courts provision of Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 13. The court found that there was no recognized common law cause of action for wrongful death. The court concluded that appellant's constitutional attack of &sect; 16.003(b) was not premised upon restriction of a common-law cause of action, and, therefore, necessarily failed the first prong of the open courts test.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, the Association of Texas Professional Educators and individual teacher, sought an injunction against appellee State Commissioner of Education to enjoin the enforcement of House Bill 2566, which amended certain provisions of the Texas Education Code relating to the teacher career ladder system. House Bill 2566 was signed by the Governor although the bill as passed by the House of Representatives and the Senate was not the bill signed by the presiding officer of each house, nor was the bill as passed by both houses presented to the Governor for his approval. The trial court held that the &quot;enrolled bill rule&quot; precluded inquiry into the constitutional defects alleged by appellants. The court reversed and remanded holding that an exception to the &quot;enrolled bill rule&quot; applied where legislative journals and testimony showed clerical errors were made in the enrolled bill. The bill could not be severed because the interconnectedness of the provisions made it unclear whether the legislature would have enacted the bill if the section in dispute were left out.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner attorney earned a judgment against respondent client for unpaid legal fees. When the judgment was not satisfied, he sought relief under the turnover statute,&nbsp;Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann. &sect; 31.002 (1986). The lower court determined that the trial court could not order respondent to turn over his wages to a receiver because that would be a garnishment prohibited by Tex. Const. art. XVI, &sect; 28. The reviewing court overturned that ruling. Garnishment necessarily involves a third party who has possession of the debtor's property or owes the debtor money. In this case, no third party was involved. The trial court ordered respondent himself to turn over property he either currently possessed or might possess in the future. Because no third party was involved, there was no garnishment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that petitioner, a candidate for public office, was eligible to run for attorney general because an increase in his retirement benefits as a mid-term state legislator did not constitute an &quot;emolument&quot; in violation of Tex.

The court stated that there was no certainty that petitioner would ever receive the retirement benefits and held that retirement benefits for legislators and other elected officials did not constitute &quot;emoluments&quot; within the meaning of &sect; 18 because this term meant only actual pecuniary gain and not a contingent or remote benefit.</SPAN></P>

Specifically, appellant argued that there was insufficient evidence for the jury to infer future dangerousness and imposed capital punishment. On appeal, the court affirmed his conviction and sentencing. At the trial, a forensic pathologist testified there were four small caliber gunshot wounds and one contact shotgun wound to the victim's head. In addition, evidence indicated that the victim was found lying on the floor in the living room, with his hands tied behind his back with a telephone cord, and his feet tied together with a belt. The court held that there was sufficient evidence for the jury to rationally infer future dangerousness from the brutality of this offense.</SPAN></P>

There was no limitation on the time within which to prosecute someone for murder. Nothing in the record suggested the state intentionally delayed the case to gain a tactical advantage over appellant. The court did not need to reach the issue of whether appellant's consent was tainted because, even assuming that the trial court erred in failing to suppress the complained-of evidence, appellant was not harmed by its admission.

Therefore, the jury's verdict was not against the great weight of the evidence, clearly wrong and unjust, or biased. The court also affirmed the trial court's denial of a jury instruction on the lesser-included offenses of felony murder and manslaughter, because there was no evidence that appellant's culpable mental state did not rise to the level of an intentional and knowing killing.</SPAN></P>

Appellant also argued that the trial court erred in omitting an instruction about the nature of his involvement in the crime, but the court rejected that argument because appellant requested the omission. The court then overruled Powell v. State, 897 S.W.2d 307, 314-19 (Tex. Cr. App. 1994), to the extent that it allowed a defendant to raise as error an action that he or she procured. The court found that there was no burden of proof as to victim impact evidence.</SPAN></P>

The court first noted that the public safety department and the district attorney were not the same parties for collateral estoppel purposes. The court then found that Tex. Transp.

Fourteen years later defendant filed an application for habeas corpus relief and alleged that he suffered ineffective assistance of trial counsel.

The prosecution had the burden to make a particularized showing of prejudice, to show that defendant's late application caused the prejudice, and to show that defendant failed to act with reasonable diligence as a matter of law. After the prosecution made such a showing, defendant was required to show that the prosecution was not prejudiced or that defendant's delay in filing the application was justified.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of a capital murder, in violation of Tex.

Appellant was sentenced to death and therefore obtained an automatic appeal. While appellant raised several points of error, the court overruled each one and affirmed the judgment below. Among appellant's arguments was that he was denied his U.S. Const. amend. VI right to effective assistance of counsel when trial counsel failed to request a jury instruction on the lesser-included offense of felony murder. The court found that there was no evidence that would have permitted a jury to rationally find that appellant had the intent to commit the robbery, but not to cause the death of the victim. Accordingly, appellant was not entitled to a charge on the lesser-included offense of felony murder. Having failed to establish that he was entitled to the instruction, the court held that appellant could not establish that his counsel's performance fell below professional standards.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment below convicting appellant of murder and sentencing him to death was affirmed because the court overruled each of appellant's points of error, including appellant's claim that he was denied ineffective assistance due to his counsel's failure to request an instruction on a lesser-included offense.

Appellant raised numerous points of error, but the court overruled each one and affirmed the judgment below. Among the arguments raised by appellant was that the court erred by refusing to order payment of a polygraph examiner to assist appellant's defense as an indigent. The court rejected this argument and contrasted the use of a polygraph expert in appellant's case against the use of other types of experts, such as psychiatrists, that have been shown to be necessary to the defense in some cases. Here, the court found that appellant made no showing that there was a significant issue of fact which the knowledge of a lay jury would not be expected to encompass. The issue instead was the credibility of two witnesses, appellant and a police officer, who gave different versions of a conversation between them. The court found that this was precisely the kind of issue on which courts routinely turn to lay juries for resolution and thus the use of a polygraph examiner was not required.</SPAN></P>

The court also found appellant was not entitled to a new trial based on the allegation that the record on appeal omitted portions of the trial proceedings because appellant did not take steps to cure the deficiency in the record.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury convicted appellant of capital murder pursuant to Tex. Penal Code &sect; 19.03(a)(7)(A) and the trial judge sentenced appellant to death. Appellant challenged his conviction, contending that the trial court erred in failing to grant his motion to change venue because the State failed to properly controvert his motion to change venue. In support of his motion to change venue, appellant filed two affidavits alleging he could not obtain a fair trial in the county. In response, the State filed two affidavits, which its affiants contradicted on the witness stand. The court held there was no reason to believe that supporting and controverting affidavits necessarily served the same purposes and hence no reason to believe that they must conform to the same requirements. Appellant further contended that the trial court erred in permitting the parties to exercise peremptory challenges at the end of voir dire, a procedure for non-capital cases. The court found that the procedure controlling the order and timing of the exercise of peremptory challenges was not an absolute requirement. Appellant waived any error by requesting the procedure followed in the present case. The court affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant alleged several errors on appeal of a capital murder conviction and imposition of a death sentence under Tex. Penal Code &sect; 19.03(a)(2), Tex. Code Crim. P. Ann. art. 37.071, &sect; 2(g). The court first rejected appellant's argument that the evidence was legally insufficient to support the aggravating elements which elevated the offense to capital murder. The court concluded sufficient evidence of appellant's robbery and kidnapping of the victim prior to shooting him was shown. The court explained a rational trier of fact could have found appellant's kidnapping and robbery beyond a reasonable doubt. The court next found the evidence was factually sufficient because the jury could have found witness testimony credible. The court explained a factual sufficiency challenge was viewed in the light most favorable to the prosecution and a verdict was set aside only if it was so contrary to the overwhelming weight of the evidence as to be clearly unjust and wrong. The court found the jury properly considered relevant future dangerousness factors, and the evidence was legally sufficient to support its finding on future dangerousness finding. The court affirmed the conviction.</SPAN></P>

The court found no error in the admission of a present sense impression hearsay exception and the denial of a juror challenge for cause.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of a judgment from the 2nd Court of Appeals, Tarrant County (Texas), which affirmed appellant's conviction for driving while intoxicated under Tex. Penal Code &sect;&sect;49.04, 49.09(b). Appellant claimed that his conviction resulted from an unlawful search and seizure.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the appellate court affirmed appellant's conviction for driving while intoxicated under Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect;&sect;49.04, 49.09(b), appellant sought review. On appeal, the issue was whether the search and seizure provision of the Texas constitution was violated when an officer went to the aid of a motorist who was unconscious in his vehicle on a public highway. The court affirmed the conviction, concluding that the Tex. Const. art. I &sect; 9 contained no requirement that a seizure or search be authorized by warrant and that a seizure or search that was otherwise reasonable would not be found in violation of that section because it was not authorized by a warrant. Moreover, the court determined that there was no violation of the supremacy clause of U.S. Const. Art. VI. Finally, the court noted that appellant could have invoked the protections of U.S. Const. Amend. IV. Having requested protection only under Article I &sect; 9, however, appellant forfeited any protections he was entitled to under U.S. Const. Amend. IV. The protections were available; appellant simply chose not to avail himself of them.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed appellant's conviction for driving while intoxicated because under the Texas Constitution, there was no requirement that a seizure or search be authorized by warrant, and a seizure or search that was otherwise reasonable was permissible even if not authorized by a warrant.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner applicant was convicted of two counts of delivery of less than five pounds of marijuana and placed on probation for five years. Thereafter, the court revoked his probation, and he was sentenced to 18 months confinement in a state jail felony facility in each cause. On appeal, petitioner contended that he had not received credit for all the time he was confined in these causes before being sentenced. Petitioner was confined for several months before he pled guilty and was placed on community supervision, and was again confined for several months, pending respondent state's motion to revoke his community supervision. Reversing the trial court judgment in part, the court held that credit must be granted for periods of confinement pursuant to motions to revoke community supervision. The court further held that denying credit for such periods of confinement would violate due course of law under Tex. Const. art. 1, &sect; 19, by deterring persons from exercising their constitutional right to a revocation hearing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of capital murder pursuant to Tex. Penal Code &sect; 19.03(a)(2), and he was sentenced to death. His appeal was automatic. The court held that there was sufficient evidence that defendant shot and killed the victims during the course of a planned robbery, that selection of the grand jury foreman did not violate equal protection, that the judge's relationship to an investigating police officer was harmless, that federal peace officers may question a defendant, and that the exclusion of an additional witness's testimony was harmless. The court also concluded that closing remarks directed at defendant's counsel did not cause defendant prejudice. During the penalty phase, the trial court had admitted victim impact testimony, which included victim character evidence; however, defendant did not waive the mitigation issue for the penalty phase. The court held that although some character evidence was admitted, it was intertwined with the impact of the victim's loss on family members, and it served the function of humanizing the victims. Finally, the court rejected 64 points of error as being inadequately briefed and affirmed the conviction and sentence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's capital murder conviction and the death penalty imposed upon him for that crime because there was sufficient evidence to establish that defendant shot and killed four victims during a planned robbery.

The appellate court affirmed defendant's conviction. Defendant filed a petition for discretionary review to determine whether the offense of indecency with a child required a culpable mental state relating to the child's age. The court granted the petition and affirmed the judgment. The court held that in cases involving the sexual assault of a child, such as rape of a child or indecency with a child, the state was not required to show that a defendant knew the victim to be younger than 17 years of age. The court concluded that requiring the state to allege and prove defendant knew the victim to have been under the age of 17 would establish ignorance or mistake as a defense in contravention of the clear legislative intent of Tex.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In his challenge to his capital murder conviction and death sentence, appellant claimed he was erroneously denied the right to voir dire prospective jurors on whether they could consider particular types of mitigation, such as voluntary intoxication. He also contended that the trial court erred in denying him an evidentiary hearing on his claim that the death penalty was administered in a racially discriminatory manner. The court concluded that Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 8.04(b), which permitted a voluntary intoxication defense only if it rose to the level of temporary insanity, was constitutional. Further, appellant was not entitled to an instruction on what evidence was mitigating or on what weight the jury was to give any mitigating evidence presented at trial. Appellant failed to supply evidence showing that racial considerations play a part in imposition of the death sentence in his case. He also failed to show that it was cruel or unusual punishment. The court found no improprieties in the trial court's procedures or application of the laws warranting reversal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of murdering a 12-year-old girl and sentenced to death by a jury. Prior to trial there had been a great deal of publicity surrounding the murder. Newspaper articles referred to a murder charge of which appellant was acquitted and referred to fairly recent murders of two other girls in the county. The court affirmed finding the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying a request for change of venue because the record did not establish appellant's inability to obtain a fair trial. The court held that because appellant did not request an inquiry into a child's competence to testify, he could not complain about the trial court's failure to do so. The court held it was not error for the trial court to refuse to instruct on the minimum eligibility requirements for parole in a capital case nor in instructing the jury not to consider any possible action by the parole board. The court held it did not conduct sufficiency review of the mitigation special issue. The court found that a factual sufficiency review of a jury's determination of a probability of future dangerousness was not required by the Texas Constitution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was affirmed as the trial court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to change venue because of prejudicial pretrial publicity.

The trial court did not err in refusing to instruct on the minimum eligibility requirements for parole in a capital case nor in instructing the jury not to consider any possible action by the parole board.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant applicant was convicted of capital murder and sentenced to death. Defendant sought habeas corpus relief claiming that the special issues required by Tex. Code Crim. Proc.

The court held that the special issues allowed the jury to give mitigating effect to evidence of defendant's youth and his youthful incarceration. The court held that there was no &quot;nexus&quot; between defendant's youthful incarceration and circumstances of the offense that tended to excuse the commission of the offense. The court held that evidence of defendant's low IQ did not, standing alone, establish mental retardation. The court held that there was no evidence that defendant's low IQ rendered him unable to appreciate the wrongfulness of his conduct or diminished his ability to control his impulses or evaluate the consequences of his conduct.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of her conviction of capital murder of an infant under her care under Tex. Penal Code &sect; 19.03(a)(8). The court held that maps drawn by appellant were privileged, but that the attorney-client privilege was required to yield to the strong public policy interest of protecting a child from death or serious bodily injury. The court held that defendant's right against self-incrimination was not violated by counsel's disclosure of privileged information because there was evidence that no disclosure was made and counsel was not an agent of the government. The court held that &sect; 19.03(a)(8) did not violate equal protection because the state had a compelling interest in protecting children and the statute was rationally related to serve this interest. The court held that &sect; 19.03(a)(8) did not violate U.S. Const. amend. VIII because it only applied to a subclass of convicted murderers and the &quot;children under six&quot; category was clear and definite. Appellant's confession was voluntary and not induced by any positive promise. Testimony that appellant admitted that she committed a murder was highly probative of guilt and was offered as an admission of the primary offense.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the evidence was both legally and factually sufficient to support the jury's finding that there was a probability that appellant would commit criminal acts of violence that would constitute a continuing threat to society. The court further held that appellant's confession was admissible because the police's conduct did not rise to level of coercive conduct so as to render appellant's statement involuntary. Moreover, the court held that appellant did not invoke his U.S. Const. amend V right to an attorney when he was being interrogated and therefore his confession was admissible. Finally, the court held that the trial court did not err by allowing victim impact evidence at the punishment phase.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged a trial court decision that convicted defendant, after a jury trial, of capital murder and sentenced defendant to death. Defendant contended, among other things, that there was insufficient evidence to support defendant's conviction and death sentence. The court affirmed defendant's conviction but reversed the imposed death sentence and remanded for resentencing. There was sufficient evidence to support defendant's conviction. Defendant's extrajudicial confession that he killed his victim for her rings was properly admitted because the confession was supported by corroborating evidence, including that the murder scene itself showed signs of robbery. There was sufficient evidence to support the jury's finding that defendant was a continuing danger to society. The trial court error in denying defendant's motion for leave to file for expert assistance ex parte. The prosecution failed to prove that the disclosure that defendant's motion was for a mental health expert did not contribute to the jury's verdict at punishment. The admission of victim and crime scene photographs was proper because such photographs were relevant and not unduly prejudicial.</SPAN></P>

Defendant did not challenge the sufficiency of the evidence on appeal, but he claimed that the trial court made errors in the jury selection and improperly admitted hearsay evidence. He also asserted that the death penalty was unconstitutional and arbitrarily enforced. The court rejected defendant's claims. The court found that defendant did not object to the manner in which the trial court provided notice that the venire panel had been exhausted. Defendant's claim that certain jurors should have been excluded where they had a bias or prejudice against the minimum sentence for murder was rejected because the lesser included offense of murder did not contribute to defendant's conviction or punishment. The court also ruled that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting excited utterances of a witness, a hotel registration card bearing defendant's name, or packets containing information regarding defendant's previous incarcerations in the Texas Department of Criminal Justice. The court further held that the death penalty sentence was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">During jury selection, appellant objected to state's peremptory challenges of seven male veniremembers alleging gender discrimination.

Appellant's objection was overruled, and he was convicted of capital murder. The court of appeals affirmed the conviction, holding that the trial court's findings on the gender discrimination issue were not clearly erroneous. The court held that the Equal Protection Clause of U.S. Const. amend. XIV prohibited discrimination in jury selection on the basis of gender, or on the assumption that an individual would be biased in a particular case for no reason other than the fact that the person happened to be a woman or happened to be a man. The court held that state's explanation that the male veniremembers might have possessed a &quot;potential bias&quot; or &quot;common ground&quot; with appellant was not a neutral explanation.

The court affirmed, holding that a misdemeanor information charging an offense under Tex.

The state contended that the language employed in the statute, when construed in light of other statutes in Tex.

Defendant objected to issues relating to limitations on jury voir dire, being examined by a state-sponsored psychiatrist regarding future dangerousness, and excluding evidence of a witness's drug addiction. The court held that the trial court could limit jury voir dire regarding the meaning of the word probability, and the meaning of probability was not constitutionally vague. The trial court could order defendant to submit to an independent state-sponsored psychiatric exam prior to the presentation of defendant's expert testimony when defendant demonstrated his intent to put on future dangerousness expert testimony. The trial court properly excluded cross-examination regarding a witness's drug addiction when defendant did not show that the witness's perceptual capacity was physically impaired.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a judgment entered in Harris County (Texas), which sentenced defendant to death after defendant was found guilty of capital murder for killing a victim in the course of committing or attempting to commit robbery, kidnapping, and aggravated sexual assault.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's decision, which found defendant guilty of capital murder and sentenced defendant to death. Defendant was the self-appointed leader of a gang that raped and killed two girls; defendant instructed others in the gang to strangle the girls and personally, among other acts, kicked one of the victims in the face knocking out several of her teeth and stepped on the neck of the other victim until she stopped moving. Defendant appealed on forty-five points of error, which included contentions that jury instructions and applied statutory law were improper and unconstitutional, inadmissible evidence was admitted, a victim impact statement was improperly admitted, the state advanced an improper argument, and the death penalty as administered in the state was unconstitutional. The court overruled all points of error and held that, pursuant to common law, a defendant was not entitled to an instruction on parole law in a capital case. The court also held that, though the victim impact statement was improperly admitted, the admission was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. The court held that all other evidence and instructions were proper and constitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's conviction of defendant of capital murder and sentence of death on the grounds that defendant was not entitled to a jury instruction of parole law, and that the applicable statutory law and evidence admitted was constitutional and admissible or resulted in a harmless error.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A grand jury indicted appellant for theft in an indictment which alleged that the name of the property owner was unknown at that time. At the end of the jury trial, appellant's motion for instructed verdict was granted. The state's second indictment which named the property owner was determined to be jeopardy barred by the lower court. The court noted that the state was attempting to prosecute appellant for the same violation of the same penal statute in separate trials with the only difference being the naming of a complainant. The court held that because the evidence relied on by the state at the second trial would be the same as that presented at the first trial, the offenses alleged in each indictment were the same and consequently, the second trial was jeopardy barred. The court affirmed the judgment of the lower court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the determination that the subsequent prosecution of appellant was jeopardy barred because once the state went to trial on an indictment alleging an unknown property owner and jeopardy attached, the state could not retry appellant for the same violation of the same statute by alleging the name of the property owner.</SPAN></P>

Article 11.071, &sect; 5 provided that a court could not consider subsequent applications unless they contained sufficient specific facts establishing various elements. The court held that the provisions did not violate the separation of powers clause or suspend certain rights because it merely provided the methodology for rendering the writ and did not prevent the court from exercising its powers. Because the provisions were procedural and did not disturb substantive rights, the court held they were outside the &quot;retroactive law&quot; prohibition. Because the provisions applied all felons, the court held they did not violate equal protection. The court held the provisions did not violate due process or due course of law merely because the requirements were stringent. The court overruled applicant's grounds of error, dismissed his application as an abuse of writ, and vacated the order granting applicant a stay of execution.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, following his arrest after a robbery, was convicted of murder and sentenced to death in a Harris County court (Texas). Defendant appealed automatically under Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 37.071 &sect; 2(h) and raised 24 points of error including two on insufficient legal evidence, one on his motion to quash indictment, 10 on guilt/innocence, and 11 on punishment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested, tried, and convicted for murder and robbery in a residential apartment and sentenced to death. Following a death penalty sentence, defendant automatically appealed pursuant to Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 37.071 &sect; 2(h), alleging more than 20 points of error at trial, of which nearly all related to either guilt/innocence or punishment. The court found most points lacking adequate legal argument or citing incorrect legal standards and affirmed the conviction and sentencing. Reviewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the verdict the court found it sufficient for a rational jury to answer &quot;yes&quot; to defendant's future dangerousness and also to infer that defendant intended to steal before the murder. The state had to prove the latter in a capital murder prosecution and the former before submitting death penalty appropriateness to the jury. The court rejected the unconstitutionality claim that state had no burden to prove aggravating circumstances and held that Texas required proof of both the death penalty-crime and future dangerousness before submitting the appropriateness question to the jury including consideration of mitigating circumstances.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's murder conviction and death sentence and found that a rational jury could have found defendant formed the intent to rob and that he probably would constitute a continuing threat to society. All of defendant's points on guilt/innocence and punishment were overruled for insufficient or inaccurate legal arguments.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An automatic appeal was pursued by defendant of a judgment from Gregg County Court (Texas), in which he was convicted of murder in the course of robbery under Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 19.03(a)(2), and the death penalty was imposed pursuant to Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 37.071, &sect; 2(b), (e), and (h).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant fired a gun and killed the victim but claimed it was an accident. Defendant was convicted of the offense of capital murder, specifically murder in the course of robbery under Tex. Penal Code &sect; 19.03(a)(2). The jury found defendant guilty and imposed the death penalty pursuant to Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 37.071, &sect; 2(b), (e), and (h). Appeal was automatic and the court affirmed the trial court's judgment. The court held that the evidence showed defendant planned the robbery and brought with him a deadly weapon in order to accomplish the task. The court determined that a rational trier of fact could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant intentionally caused the death of the deceased. Although defendant presented probative evidence showing that he did not intentionally shoot the victim, there existed other probative evidence that he did. The court held that the jury's finding that defendant intentionally killed the victim was not so contrary to the overwhelming weight of the evidence as to be clearly wrong or unjust. Therefore, the court deferred to the jury's conclusion that the evidence was not sufficient to warrant a sentence of life imprisonment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court, which convicted defendant and sentenced him to death because the court found no reversible error. The court held that there was no reason to conclude that the jury's verdict was manifestly unjust, shocked the conscience, or clearly demonstrated bias.</SPAN></P>

The court held that defendant's requested &quot;parole ineligible&quot; instruction was appropriately refused by the trial court since parole is not a proper area of inquiry in Texas capital cases. The court found defendant failed to make a timely objection to jury's note-taking, but the trial judge did not abuse his discretion in allowing the jurors to take individual notes. The court held that Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 37.071 &sect; 2(f)(4) called for the consideration and weighing of mitigating evidence and did not unconstitutionally narrow the jury's discretion to factors concerning only moral blameworthiness. The state's reference to defendant as a sociopath was improper, but not so egregious as to constitute reversible error and the prompt instruction to disregard cured any error. The court held that the capital murder scheme did not amount to cruel and unusual punishment, in violation of U.S. Const. amends. VIII &amp; XIV, because the class of murderers subject to the death penalty is already narrowed before a jury ever reaches the art. 37.071 &sect; 2(e) instruction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury convicted defendant of murder under Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 19.03(a)(3). The trial court sentenced defendant to death pursuant to Tex. Crim. Proc. Code Ann. art. 37.0711 &sect; 3(g) after the jury answered the special issues submitted under Tex. Crim. Proc. Code Ann. art. 37.0711 &sect; 3(b)(1) &amp; (2) and &sect; 3(e). Defendant's appeal was automatic pursuant to Tex. Crim. Proc. Code Ann. art. 37.0711 &sect; 3(j). Defendant raised issues related to his confession, the search warrant, right to counsel, and limitations on jury voir dire. The court held that eliminating the state's duty to refute defendant's exculpatory remarks in his confession did not violate due process. There was no material misrepresentation in the affidavit supporting the search warrant where the identity and the criminal history of the informant was obscured. Defendant's confession, obtained while he was in custody for an unrelated offense, was not a violation of his right to counsel. The trial court's limitation on jury voir dire was harmless because defendant failed to exercise all of his preemptory challenges. The court affirmed the conviction, and held that defendant's numerous other issues were held to be without merit.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction and death sentence. The trial court limitation on jury voir dire was harmless when defendant did not exercise all of his preemptory challenges. In addition, obscuring the identity of an informant was permissible to obtain the search warrant and the resulting evidence was admissible.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged the punishment phase of his conviction for capital murder. The court affirmed the conviction of the lower court and held that while Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 37.071(2)(a) prohibited any mention in a capital murder trial of the effect of a failure of the jury to agree on either of the special issues submitted to it, the jury instruction given on special issues attenuated any harm. The court held that the lower court's refusal to instruct the jury on the parole implications of a life sentence did not violate U.S. Const. amend. VIII or U.S. Const. amend. XIV because parole ineligibility did not tend to demonstrate evidence of future dangerousness and was neither in the jury charge nor a permissible subject of final argument. The court held that sufficiency reviews were made of juries' guilt/innocence and future dangerousness decisions as the decisions were fact bound. However, no appellate review was required of the jury determination whether evidence had mitigating effect and, if so, how much under Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 37.071 &sect; 2(e), as those decisions were normative and therefore not reviewable.</SPAN></P>

The court would not review the jury's answer to the mitigation special issue because it was a practical impossibility. Venue was proper because publicity about the trial did not foster a hostile public attitude against defendant. The court held that including defendant's death threats there was sufficient evidence of his future dangerousness. Defendant did not preserve his confession issue, because he had objected to his illegal arrest but not his confession. Defendant's mental retardation could be considered an aggravating factor. The trial court could allow a witness who violated the sequestration order to testify. The court held that the trial court could require the jury to deliberate further, after a total of nine hours and forty minutes. Affirming the judgment, the court concluded that there was no basis for defendant's constitutional challenges.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state petitioned for discretionary review of an interlocutory appeal of the Houston Court of Appeals, First Supreme Judicial District (Texas), affirming a trial court's judgment granting defendant's motions to suppress evidence in violation of Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 38.23(a), an exclusionary rule. Defendant was charged with capital murder and alleged searches in, and removal of evidence from, his funeral home and hearse were illegal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant and decedent jointly operated and lived in the upstairs of a funeral home where decedent had allegedly been shot. Defendant was charged with capital murder. A trial court granted defendant's motions to suppress evidence in violation of Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 38.23(a), alleging searches in, and removal of evidence from, the funeral home and hearse were illegal. The appellate court affirmed the grant of the motions holding art. 38.23(a) extended to actions of private persons. The evidence decedent's sons turned over to the police from the funeral home, therefore, was suppressed. The court affirmed the appellate court's holdings on discretionary review, holding that the plain language of art. 38.23(a) controlled and supported the contention that the unlawful or unconstitutional actions of all people, governmental and private alike, fell under the state's exclusionary rule. The fruit of illegally obtained evidence on the subsequent search issue was proper, and the good faith exception to the exclusionary could not be addressed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged his robbery murder conviction and death sentence. The court held that the trial court was not in substantial compliance when it failed to admonish appellant under Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 26.13(a)(2)-(4). The error was harmless because the art. 26.13(a)(2) and (3) admonishments did not apply to a capital murder case in which death was sought, and the art. 26.13(a)(4) admonishment did not apply because appellant was a United States citizen. Appellant's plea in open court and on the record outside the presence of the jury satisfied Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 27.13. Appellant received a jury trial because the jury entered a verdict as to guilt and answered the special issues under Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 37.071. The trial court did not violate the separation of powers but merely assured that appellant was sentenced to death in accordance with law. The capital punishment scheme was not unconstitutional. The mitigating evidence instruction did not need to assign a burden of proof. Sufficient evidence supported the finding that appellant was a continuing threat to society because evidence showed a dangerous aberration of character.</SPAN></P>

The jury instruction concerning the mitigating evidence special issue was proper. Sufficient evidence supported the finding that appellant was a continuing threat to society.</SPAN></P>

The court also found that defendant's confession to a prior murder was admissible pursuant to Tex. Code Crim. Proc.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant received automatic review under Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art 37.071, &sect; 2(h) of his conviction for capital murder under Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 19.03(a)(7)(A). The court affirmed his conviction because defendant did not show that any alleged omissions in the affidavit used to secure a search warrant were made intentionally or for the purpose of misleading the magistrate. The court held that when looking at the four corners of the affidavit, it alleged facts sufficient to justify a conclusion that the property that was the object of the search probably was in defendant's residence or car. The court also held that the trial court did not commit an error in overruling defendant's challenges for cause to veniremembers who stated that they would not consider certain evidence as mitigating because only the individual juror could decide what mitigating weight, if any, would be given to particular evidence. The court held that a psychiatrist who testified at the punishment phase on the issue of future dangerousness could derive his expert opinion from the study of technical works, specialized education, practical experience, or a combination thereof.</SPAN></P>

Appellant was indicted for the offense of capital murder pursuant to Tex.

In a trial by jury, appellant was found guilty of capital murder and sentenced to death. Appeal was automatic pursuant to Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 37.071 &sect; 2(h). The court affirmed the trial court's judgment and held that appellant offered no evidence that the jury selection process operated in any way to systematically exclude African-Americans from the panel. Appellant failed to meet his burden of rebutting the race-neutral reasons articulated by the state. The court held that the trial court did not err in failing to require the prosecution to turn over his notes because appellant did not make a request to the court to include the notes as part of the record. The court found that the trial court's error in admitting evidence of appellant's gang affiliations made no contribution to the guilty verdict or punishment and was therefore harmless error.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed the lower court and held that the forfeiture proceeding was in rem, and it was the property that was proceeded against and not the person, which made the Double Jeopardy Clause of the U.S. Const. amend V not applicable. The court held that the forfeiture of defendant's property was a civil in rem proceeding that was neither punitive nor criminal in nature.

Penal Code Ann. &sect; 39.02.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee former policeman was indicted for official oppression under Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 39.02. The indictment contained four paragraphs, each alleging an alternative means of committing the offense. The court of appeals affirmed the trial court's order that quashed all four paragraphs of the indictment. Discretionary review was granted to determine whether the court of appeals erred when it held that an indictment for official oppression must specify appellee's alleged act of &quot;mistreatment&quot; and must describe or define &quot;unwelcome sexual advances.&quot; The state argued that the best interpretation of &sect; 39.02(a)(1) was that &quot;knowledge of illegality&quot; did not modify &quot;mistreatment.&quot; The court disagreed and affirmed the judgment as to paragraph two because the correct way to interpret the official oppression statute was that &quot;knowledge of illegality&quot; modified &quot;mistreatment.&quot; The court reversed the quashing of paragraph four of the indictment because the holding that the indictment must describe &quot;unwelcome sexual advances&quot; and &quot;request for sexual favors&quot; was in error. It was sufficient that the state elect among the alternative methods of harassment that it planned to prove at trial.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment that quashed the state's indictment as to paragraph two of the official oppression indictment because the lower courts correctly interpreted the statute as to the correct usage of &quot;knowledge of illegality&quot; and &quot;mistreatment.&quot; The court reversed the quashing of paragraph four of the indictment because the lower courts erred in holding that the indictment improperly failed to define &quot;unwelcome sexual advances.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted for capital murder. Appellant sought review of the conviction on 18 grounds. Appellant contended that his Sixth Amendment right to counsel was impinged when the trial court precluded him from discussing, with veniremembers, the statutory 35-year minimum for individuals convicted of capital murder that are given a life sentence. The court overruled this error as it was inadequately briefed. Appellant claimed the trial court erred by providing false and misleading information about parole eligibility, during jury selection. Error was waived since appellant raised the argument for the first time on appeal. Appellant contended the trial court erred when it refused to admit childhood photographs that depicted him as a normal, happy child. Appellant argued that the trial court's preclusive ruling denied him the opportunity to present relevant, mitigating evidence in his defense. The court held the photographs were irrelevant to appellant's moral blameworthiness for the commission of the double-murder. The court affirmed the conviction. Other assignments of error lacked merit, were not preserved for review, or were inadequately briefed.</SPAN></P>

The court looked at the conduct of the attorneys at trial and found there to be no reversible error in the prosecutor's conduct. The court also found that appellant's failure to object to a jury argument forfeited his right to complain about the argument on appeal.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant filed a petition for discretionary review from the Third Court of Appeals, County Court at Law No. 3 of Travis County (Texas), where appellant was convicted under the &quot;stalking&quot; provision of the 1993 harassment statute pursuant to Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 42.07(a)(7) (1993). Appellant asserted that the stalking provision was unconstitutionally vague on its face and as applied to his conduct.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted under the &quot;stalking&quot; provision of the harassment statute,&nbsp;Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 42.07(a)(7) (1993). Thereafter, appellant filed a petition for discretionary review contending that the stalking provision was unconstitutionally vague on its face and as applied to his conduct. On review, the court noted that criminal laws were to sufficiently clear in order to be upheld and, if a statute was capable of reaching U.S. Const. amend. I freedoms, the doctrine of vagueness demanded a greater degree of specificity than in other contexts. The court examined the statute in detail and the wording &quot;intent to harass, annoy, alarm, abuse, torment, or embarrass&quot; as applied to appellant's situation. The court noted that the statute did not limit the vagueness of the conduct by linking it to more specific conduct through a continuity of purpose requirement. The court found that a savings clause as to affirmative defense or constitutionally protected activity was not sufficient. The court concluded that the statute was vague and this rendered the entire statute unconstitutional. Therefore, the judgment was reversed and the case was remanded to the trial court for dismissal.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant's conviction for violation of the stalking statute was reversed and the case was remanded to the trial court to enter an order dismissing the prosecution because the statute was vague and this rendered the entire statute unconstitutional. The court found that the implicit U.S. Const. amend. I freedoms and the statutory language could not be reconciled without further clarification of the statute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of the felony offense of aggravated assault. After the jury found defendant guilty, it assessed her punishment at a six-year term, probated, and a fine. Defendant challenged the conviction to the court of appeals on grounds that she was denied her right to reasonably effective assistance of counsel at the punishment phase of trial under Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 10. The court of appeals affirmed the conviction. Defendant filed a petition for discretionary review. Defendant argued that her trial counsel was ineffective for not objecting to questions posed to her at the sentencing phase of the trial regarding her guilt or innocence. The court affirmed, holding that there was no caselaw dispositive of, or even addressing, the issue. That defendant was put in a position where she potentially was exposed to answer perjury charges if she admitted her guilt did not clearly violate due process or her right against self-incrimination. The court held that defendant's predicament was a logical and constitutional result of a series of choices made in her defense.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged a conviction for capital murder under Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 19.03(a)(2) in the trial court (Texas). He disputed the state's striking of a black juror, the exclusion from the jury of issues as to parole, the exclusion of mitigating evidence of comparative sentencing and the sufficiency of the evidence on mitigation, and the constitutionality of various aspects of the trial, including the application of the death penalty.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of capital murder, and he appealed on many grounds. The court held that the trial judge's approval of the state's exclusion of a black juror during voir dire was not clearly erroneous. Defendant could not put issues of parole before the jury, whether or not the issues bore on his future dangerousness, because parole was not an issue for the jury's consideration in a capital murder case. Its exclusion was not unconstitutional. Evidence of sentences received by other defendants in similar circumstances was not admissible as mitigating evidence. The court would not review the mitigating evidence for sufficiency, because the weighing of that evidence was a matter for subjective determination by each juror. The mitigation issues, issues concerning the burdens of proof, and the death penalty were constitutional under U.S. Const. amend. VIII and XIV. A United States Supreme Court decision in a civil case did not constitutionally require a &quot;proportionality review&quot; of the defendant's sentence. There was no authority for defendant's argument that the state constitution should be interpreted more broadly than the United States constitution. The court affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed. The trial court's decision on the juror was not clearly erroneous. Parole was not an issue for the jury in a capital murder case, and its exclusion was not unconstitutional. Evidence of other defendants' sentences was not a mitigating circumstance. The issue of the sufficiency of mitigating evidence was not reviewable by the court. None of the defendant's many claims of unconstitutionality had merit.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

IV only if, in view of all the circumstances surrounding the incident, a reasonable person would have believed that he was not free to leave. The court has held that a person who voluntarily accompanied investigating police officers to a certain location knowing that he was a suspect had not been seized for U. S. Const. amend. IV purposes. The judgment was affirmed because although the officer would have detained appellant if he had refused to return to the witness' location, the office never communicated this intent.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee state filed a petition for discretionary review of a judgment from the Second Court of Appeals (Texas) which declined to recognize the inevitable discovery doctrine to the statutory exclusionary rule, Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 38.23(a). Appellee argued that the doctrine should be adopted when the causal connection between illegal conduct and evidence was broken and when the U.S. Supreme Court had approved the doctrine.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the holding of a judgment that the inevitable discovery doctrine did not apply to Texas's exclusionary rule, Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 38.23(a), but vacated and remanded for a analysis under Tex. R. App. P. 81(b)(2). The court rejected the reasoning of the dissent that the inevitable discovery doctrine, like the attenuation of taint doctrine, served to legally break the causal connection between the illegal conduct and the acquisition of evidence. The court held that the plain language of the statute did not accommodate the inevitable discovery doctrine because once the illegality, and its causal connection, were established, the evidence must be excluded. The court explained that the inevitable discovery doctrine was a court-created doctrine to the federal exclusionary rule, not an exception to U.S Const. amend. IV, and that the court was obligated to determine the Texas legislature's intent. The court did find, however, that once the appellate court determined that the evidence should have been suppressed, it should have conducted a harmless error analysis, pursuant to Tex. R. App. P. 81(b)(2). The court remanded for that analysis.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Criminal appellant complained that law enforcement officials illegally obtained evidence. A search warrant, based upon affidavit, was issued to search appellant's home.

On appeal, the court found that the magistrate had sufficient evidence of the alleged crimes to issue the warrant. It found any error relating to items seized (to the extent that any were admitted into evidence) to be harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. The court also held that the term &quot;persons&quot; in Tex. Const. art. 18.02(11) referred to both the living and the dead. Hence, the second search warrant was valid insofar as it authorized a search for the victims' bodies.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of capital murder of a state trooper. The jury found defendant to be a future danger and declined to find mitigating circumstances under Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. arts. 37.071, &sect; 2(b) and 37.071, &sect; 2(e). Accordingly, the trial court sentenced defendant to death. On appeal, defendant argued 34 points of error including errors involving jury selection, an Allen charge, and the refusal to terminate the punishment phase pursuant to jury deadlock to impose a life sentence. The reviewing court found no error. The properly disqualified jurors indicated either that they would add legal elements to the state's burden at trial or that they would never impose a death penalty. There was no abuse of discretion in denying termination of the punishment phase in light of the appearance of deliberative breakthrough. The Allen charge was not coercive because the trial court did not attempt to identify the minority jurors. The mere presence of twenty uniformed officers at the back of the courtroom during the punishment phase, without more, did not provide a basis for a finding of inherent prejudice resulting in a lack of due process. Therefore, the judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted by a jury in the court below of the offense of capital murder, namely murder in the course of kidnapping or burglary under Tex.

The trial court's judgment was affirmed on appeal despite 23 points of error raised by defendant on appeal. Contrary to defendant's contention, the trial court was not found to have erred in submitting an instruction on the law of parties in the guilt/innocence charge because there was evidence to support the inference that defendant acted as a party to the offense. Moreover, the court found that the State had not impermissibly commented on defendant's failure to testify because the comments at issue merely constituted a proper summation of the evidence. Finally, the trial court did not commit error when it refused to admit evidence concerning the victim's homosexuality at punishment because the victim's homosexuality was not relevant as a mitigating circumstance to defendant's background, character, or the circumstances of the crime.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of his death sentence for capital murder from 347th District Court of Nueces County (Texas). Appellant asserted there was insufficient evidence to support the jury's affirmative answer to special issue on future dangerousness, pursuant to Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 37.071 &sect; 2(b) and that trial court erred in refusing to give a Simmons instruction on parole eligibility or define the word &quot;militates.&quot;</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed appellant's conviction for capital murder and his death sentence. Appellant was drinking with friends and decided to rob a convenience store using a knife. Appellant threatened the clerk, forced him to lie on the ground, then stabbed him several times in the back and the neck. Appellee state did not put on any additional evidence at sentencing and appellant put on one character witness. The court held that the evidence was sufficient for the jury to affirmatively answer the special issue on future dangerousness, pursuant to Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 37.071 &sect; 2(b). The court held that the brutal facts of the stabbing itself, including that the majority of the knife thrusts were into the back of an already fallen victim; the conflicting testimony as to why appellant decided to commit a robbery; the number of lies that he told the police; and his apparent disregard for the law and authority supported the finding. The court held the trial court did not err in refusing to give a Simmons instruction on appellant's parole eligibility and in refusing to define the word &quot;militates&quot; in the punishment charge.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed appellant's death sentence. The court held that the finding of future dangerousness was supported by the brutal facts of the stabbing alone, in which blows were inflicted on fallen victim, and when appellant lied to police, gave no reason for his conduct, and had a history of disregard for authority. The court held that trial court did not err in refusing parole eligibility instruction or to define the word &quot;militates.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">State sought review of the decision of the First Court of Appeals (Texas), that found that it did not have authority to interfere with an abatement order issued by a court of appeals with equal jurisdiction when state filed a motion to compel trial court to vacate its order granting appellants' motions for new trials after their convictions for engaging in organized criminal activity.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants were convicted of engaging in organized crime. After the trial court denied their motions for new trials, they filed notices of appeal with the appellate court. While those appeals were pending, they filed amended motions for new trials with the trial court. The state objected arguing that the trial court no longer had jurisdiction. The appellate court concluded that the trial court did not have jurisdiction, but vacated the orders and abated the appeals, thereby creating jurisdiction for the trial court. The trial court granted the motions for new trials, and the state properly sought review with a different appellate court. That appellate court found that it did not have authority to interfere with the abatement order of the first appellate court because it had equal jurisdiction with that court. The state brought a petition for review. The court found that the state's argument was that the trial court did not have jurisdiction to hear the motions for new trials, not whether or not the abatement order was proper. The court found that the second appellate court had the authority to address this issue and that it erred in failing to do so. It reversed and remanded.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed and remanded the cause finding that the appellate court, in concluding that it did not have authority to interfere with an abatement order, failed to address to issue presented by the state which was whether the trial court had lawful jurisdiction to hear an out-of-time motion for a new trial.</SPAN></P>

On his automatic appeal, the court reversed the judgment of the trial court and remanded the cause for a new trial. On rehearing the court considered appellant's 70 points of error in which he alleged that his written confession did not meet the requirements of Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 38.22 &sect; 2, indicating that he knowingly, voluntarily, and intelligently waived the protections stated on the form. Appellant also alleged that his confession was not voluntary because he was under the influence of alcohol or hypnosis. The majority of appellant's remaining errors for review alleged errors in jury selection. The court affirmed the trial court's decision and held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it found that the evidence showed that appellant understood his rights and waived them by initialing each of the warnings on the confession. The court also found that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in finding that appellant was not intoxicated or hypnotized, making his confession involuntary.

Likewise, the trial did not abuse its discretion in ruling on appellant's objections to jury selection procedures.</SPAN></P>

Appellant urged denial of right to counsel at the lineup, which the court denied because such right under U.S. Const. amend. VI did not attach until the State began adversarial proceedings. Appellant argued the unconstitutionality of no review of mitigating evidence in the punishment stage, which the court overruled because it would invade the jury's province and was not constitutionally required.

The court held that aggravated robbery and murder was a lesser included offense, but intent to kill following the robbery was supported by evidence of death by contact wound and the heavy pull of the gun's trigger; also, a guilty finding only as to murder required no evidence of relationship to robbery, which was impossible. The court held that the trial court erred in admitting victim impact evidence regarding the victim's good works because it was irrelevant and unnecessary for rebuttal, but found the error harmless in the face of other adverse evidence. The court found no error in the denial of appellant's motion for mistrial because the state referred to something &quot;only appellant knows,&quot; as it was cured by instruction to disregard.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant and an accomplice forced their way into the home of a mother with three children, robbed them, and shot them. Appellant was convicted of three counts of capital murder and three counts of attempted capital murder and was sentenced to death. Appellant contended that the victim impact evidence during the punishment phase was insufficient to support the jury's answers. The court determined that evidence of appellant's lack of remorse, refusal to accept responsibility for his actions, and attempt to blame others were sufficient for the jury to rationally determine that there was a probability of appellant's future dangerousness. Although victim impact evidence did not appear in rules of evidence, the court held that the state was allowed to admit evidence about the victim and the impact of the murder on the victim's family as being relevant to whether or not death should be imposed. The court held that the lower court did not abuse its discretion in allowing victim impact evidence because its probative value was not substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice towards appellant.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted rehearing of its prior opinion that reversed and remanded the case for a new trial. After rehearing, the court affirmed the conviction, but vacated the sentence and remanded the matter for a new sentencing hearing because errors affecting punishment only required a new hearing on punishment and defendant produced no evidence which showed the error produced a jury biased against him on the issue of guilt. The court held it was not necessary to change venue based on prejudicial publicity because the jury had been selected and instructed to avoid media coverage when it occurred, and the juror who was exposed was excused. The court held that evidence of defendant's attack on the attorneys was admissible during the guilt phases to show consciousness of guilt, and evidence of the extraneous offense of stealing the gun was admissible to connect defendant to the murder. It also held that failure to notify of prosecution deal with accomplice prior to trial did not require exclusion of testimony because the deal was made on the day the accomplice testified, the details were presented to the jury, and defense attorney cross-examined him regarding the deal.</SPAN></P>

At issue was the proper standard of review for factual sufficiency of the elements of the offense in the courts of appeals. The court held that the standard for legal sufficiency was whether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. As the standard of review of factual sufficiency the court held that the appellate court must view all the evidence without the prism of in the light most favorable to the prosecution and set aside the verdict only if it is so contrary to the overwhelming weight of the evidence as to be clearly wrong and unjust.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, husband and wife, were charged by separate indictments with the offense of injury to a child. Appellee state filed notice of its intent to seek an affirmative finding that a deadly weapon was used in a manner that caused their child's death. The chains, belts, and locks that were used to prevent their child from obtaining food, resulting in the child dying of starvation, were identified by appellee as the deadly weapons. Testimony at trial showed the child was chained for approximately 18 months prior to his death. The jury found appellants guilty of injury to a child by omission and also found that appellants used a deadly weapon in the commission of the offense. Appellant argued that that chains, belts, and locks were not deadly weapons per se as defined under Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 1.07(a)(17)(A). On review, the court affirmed the convictions. The court held that items that are not deadly weapons per se under &sect; 1.07(a)(17)(A) could be found to be deadly weapons by nature of their use or intended use, and that appellee introduced evidence that the restraints were used to cause serious bodily injury or death.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Criminal appellant was convicted of capital murder. He contended that the trial court erred in admitting evidence and the fruits of an illegal search of his residence, in ordering a transfer of venue, in failing to suppress the confession, in allowing prejudicial opinion testimony, and in instructing the jury. The court concluded that the evidence seized from appellant's residence during the search for complainant or potential additional victims was lawfully seized under the &quot;emergency doctrine,&quot; so the trial court did not abuse its discretion in ruling the evidence was admissible at trial. Appellant failed to show any abuse of discretion by the trial court, and the record amply supported its findings. Appellant failed to show he was prejudiced by not being brought before a magistrate prior to being interviewed by investigator. Appellant also failed to present evidence of any police misconduct or coercion relating to his confession that supported his claim of involuntariness. The trial court did not err in allowing the opinion testimony and in charging the jury. Therefore, the trial court's judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of aggravated sexual battery. He appealed, arguing the equal protection rule forbid peremptory challenged motivated by religious prejudice. The conviction was affirmed and appellant sought discretionary review. The court distinguished between unlawful peremptory challenges based on sex or race and those based on religion. The exercise of peremptory challenges against individual veniremembers was a government practice subject to equal protection rules. Thus, a prospective juror could not be excluded on a basis offensive to the Constitution. However, the court held that discrimination on the basis of personal belief was a proper consideration in jury selection in determining suitability for jury service. The court held that the interest served by the system of peremptory challenges were sufficiently great to justify state implementation of choices made by litigants to exclude persons from service on juries in individual cases on the basis of their religious affiliation.</SPAN></P>

The child had been stabbed, while the woman had been stabbed, strangled, and beaten with a hammer. Defendant was seen walking nearby with a bloody towel and his abandoned clothes were later found with blood on them, together with a bloody cord. Blood and DNA testing were mostly inconclusive, except that one of his socks contained blood matching the dead woman's blood. Defendant was charged with and convicted of capital murder. The jury found he was a continuing threat to society, pursuant to Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 37.071, &sect; 2, and he was sentenced to death. Defendant appealed. In affirming, the court ruled that, although entirely circumstantial, there was sufficient evidence to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant committed the murders and to support the finding that he remained a continuing threat, given the needless and vicious brutality of the murders. Also, crime scene photographs and videotape were admissible to show the reality of the brutal crime.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of capital murder after shooting a convenience store clerk during a robbery. Appellant sought review of his conviction, and the court affirmed. Appellant alleged several errors on appeal. One error asserted was that the trial court erred in overruling appellant's challenge for cause to one venire member who had expressed an opinion as to appellant's guilt. In order for a challenge for cause to be sustained under Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 35.16(a)(10), appellant had to show that the venire member had established in his mind a conclusion as to his guilt or innocence and that this conclusion would influence his verdict. Though the venire member here had expressed an opinion as to appellant's guilt, there was no indication that his opinion would affect his decision during deliberations. Another error alleged was the failure of the trial court to grant a mistrial based upon the state's failure to disclose that a third person had confessed to the murder. The state only had to disclose material evidence, which was evidence that had a reasonable probability of effecting the outcome. The trial court found no probability here because the statement was recanted.</SPAN></P>

The trial court did not err in overruling appellant's challenge for cause to a venire member who had expressed an opinion as to appellant's guilt because there was no indication that the venireperson's opinion would affect his deliberations. No mistrial was warranted on the basis of the state's failure to disclose a recanted confession by a third person.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged a ruling from the Fifth Court of Appeals, 363rd District Court, Dallas County (Texas), which affirmed his convictions for aggravated sexual assault. The indictment charged a version of the offense that was not in effect at the time of the alleged crime, but appellant had not raised his objection of ex post facto violation under U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 10, and Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 16, at the trial court level.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of aggravated sexual assault in four cases consolidated for prosecution. On appeal, he claimed that these convictions were barred by the ex post facto clauses of U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 10, and Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 16 because the statute under which he was prosecuted, Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 22.021, had not yet been enacted at the time of his allegedly criminal conduct. At the first level of appellate review, the lower court did not reach the merits of this claim, however, holding instead that appellant forfeited the right to complain of it on appeal because he did not first raise it in the trial court. On further discretionary review, the court agreed with appellant and held that prosecution for conduct which was not illegal when committed was not a forfeitable irregularity of the trial process. Consequently, the court reversed the convictions and remanded for reconsideration based on the ex post facto prohibition.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed appellant's convictions for aggravated sexual assault, finding that the indictment charged an offense that was not in existence at the time of the alleged criminal conduct, and that this ex post facto violation was not waived by appellant even though he did not object at trial.</SPAN></P>
