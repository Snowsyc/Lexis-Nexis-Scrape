</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant violated his parole by stealing and was returned to custody. Thereafter he was sentenced for the theft and sentenced to a term concurrent with his earlier sentence. The department of corrections refused to credit him for time served, pursuant to Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 558.031, from time of the parole violation to the time of his conviction. Defendant's action challenging the refusal of credit was denied. On appeal, the court reversed, holding that defendant was entitled to credit because the statute plainly allowed credit for time spent in custody after an offense and before commencement of the sentence, when time in custody was related to the offense. Because his custody and his subsequent conviction were related to the theft, the statute applied. Although he was also in custody for parole violation, the statutory language allowed custody to be &quot;related to&quot; several offenses, and the credit would nevertheless apply.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was sentenced to death for first degree murder, 30 years for first degree burglary, and life imprisonment for forcible rape. The court found that the record supported the two statutory aggravating circumstances found by the trial judge: 1) murder for monetary gain, and 2) murder in perpetration of forcible rape. No manifest injustice occurred in allowing the victim impact evidence. Absent objection, there was no basis under a plain error analysis for concluding that the admission of non-conviction misconduct evidence was prejudicial. Defendant failed to demonstrate manifest injustice or a miscarriage of justice by the admission of a psychologist's testimony. Since defendant initiated the examination, he was not compelled to testify against himself, nor was his right to counsel violated. The record did not support defendant's contention that he was uninformed or that his guilty plea was involuntary. The trial judge's choice of the death penalty was neither improper nor inappropriate under the law.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment affirmed; the trial judge's choice of the death penalty was neither improper nor inappropriate under the law, the admission of non-conviction misconduct evidence was not prejudicial, no manifest injustice occurred in allowing the victim impact evidence or the psychologist's testimony, and the record supported the finding of aggravating circumstances.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged his second-degree drug trafficking conviction alleging that the drug court commissioner who presided over his jury trial, appointed pursuant to Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 478.466 (Supp. 1996), lacked the jurisdiction to do so. The court reversed the conviction and remanded for trial, holding that &sect; 478.466 violated Mo. Const. art. I, &sect; 22(a) to the extent that it allowed an individual other than a person selected in accordance with and authorized to exercise judicial power by Mo. Const. art. V to preside over a jury trial to determine an individual's guilt or innocence of a felony charge. Although many functions may be delegated to a drug court commissioner subject to the review of a judge appointed pursuant to Mo. Const. art.

Following the agreement, Mo. Rev.

Appellant received such notice, but he did not appeal. After learning appellant was treating females, the board revoked his license following a hearing. Appellant sought review of the circuit court, which affirmed the board. Appellant sought review of the judgment complaining that retrospective enactment of the law was unconstitutional. The court affirmed finding that enactment of the statute did not violate the constitutional protection against retrospective laws because it was procedural, and the settlement was in full force and effect when his license was revoked.</SPAN></P>

State supreme court reversed and remanded, noting that mandamus was inappropriate here, since a court may only compel a government agency to do that which it is obliged to do, not that which it has the discretion to do or refrain from doing. Since state law expressly granted respondent the discretion to withdrawal proposed rule changes as well as to file them, respondent could not be compelled via mandamus to file them.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An order requiring a divorced parent to pay a portion of college expenses pursuant to Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 452.340.5 (1998) for his daughter was affirmed as a reasonable requirement that did not violate appellant's equal protection rights. On appeal, the court ruled the statute constitutional because divorced parents were not a suspect class such as to require strict scrutiny, avoiding payment of college expenses was not a fundamental right, and the statute rationally advanced a legitimate state interest in protecting children from broken homes. The percentage of expenses assessed against appellant was properly calculated on an average of past income. An award of attorney fees was not an abuse of discretion because the claim for college expenses was legitimate. The court modified the order to reduce the amount of college expenses to be paid by appellant because he was not liable for such expenses for one term when the daughter did not promptly provide a transcript to him.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant death row inmate challenged the denial of his motion for post-conviction relief after a conviction of first degree murder and the subsequent rejection of his gender-Batson challenge in the Circuit Court of the City of St. Louis (Missouri).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to death. The conviction was based on testimony from appellant's wife and others who knew appellant and the victim. Although appellant first maintained that the victim accidentally stabbed herself twice, he eventually confessed; litigation over the validity and admission of the confession was not at issue. The court did find that the record supported that appellant made a knowing, intelligent waiver of his right to remain silent. Batson challenges to the respondent state's use of peremptory challenges to exclude potential jurors based upon race were made and ruled upon at the original trial. Batson was extended to include gender at a hearing on remand, and the trial judge found no discrimination. The findings as to race, ruled upon at trial, and gender, heard and ruled upon at the remand hearing, were reviewed here. The court found no error in the lower court's findings. Therefore, denial of the motion for post-conviction relief and the rejection of appellant's Batson challenges were affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgments of the lower court were affirmed because the court found no race or gender bias in respondent state's peremptory challenges and because there was no error or abuse of the trial court's discretion. In light of appellant's confession and the witness testimony, evidence of appellant's guilt was very strong.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent owned and operated a nightclub where women performed semi-nude dancing and strip tease. It was licensed by the state to serve retail liquor. Policemen acting undercover visited the club. Two dancers performed dances for the officers, and as the dances progressed, used their mouths to remove bills that had been inserted in the officers' pants' flies. The dancers held the bills up with one hand, then placed their mouths over the bills and slowly moved their heads up and down. A decision that respondent was not subject to discipline under Mo. Code Regs. Ann. tit. 11, &sect; 70-2.130(14) for the performance of acts or simulated acts of &quot;oral copulation&quot; on a liquor licensee's premises was reversed and remanded. The term &quot;oral copulation,&quot; as used in the regulation, was not void for vagueness because it adequately described the proscribed conduct. The regulation governing lewdness, when taken as a whole, also supported that conclusion. In addition, the court had used the very same term without providing the reader with a more specific definition.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant individual alleged multiple grounds as error in his first-degree murder conviction and death sentence. The court affirmed the judgment, holding that a witness identification made in a courthouse hallway while appellant was wearing handcuffs was not unreliable, if suggestive, because the witness had observed appellant twice on the day of the murder, and had previously picked appellant in a photo identification. The court held that inferences made by respondent state in closing argument regarding the victim's association with defendant and the commission of the crime were not improper, and did not result in manifest injustice. The court held that the plain view and automobile exceptions validated the warrantless seizure of certain evidence. The court held that explicit crime scene photos, bone and teeth fragments, and victim impact testimony were not unduly prejudicial. The court held that the death penalty was not disproportionate where the evidence showed that appellant compiled a &quot;hit list&quot; of &quot;snitches,&quot; murdered the victim and two others to protect his methamphetamine business, and dispatched the wounded and helpless victim with a shotgun blast to the face.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of conviction and the imposition of the death penalty, because the evidence supported the conclusion that appellant individual acted in a &quot;depraved&quot; manner, the state's system for review of proportionality was not meaningless, and none of appellant's points of error contained any merit.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiff challenged the sections, asserting they violated Mo. Const., art. III, &sect; 40(30), prohibiting special legislation, and Mo. Const., art. VI, &sect; 8, relating to classifications of counties. The trial court granted summary judgment for state of Missouri, and the Missouri Supreme Court affirmed. Although the statutes were written so that they pertained only to St. Louis, the classifications contained in the statutes were based on population. The court held that classifications based upon factors subject to change, like population, are open ended and thus constitutional. The court concluded that Mo. Const., art.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant medical board sought review of a judgment from the Circuit Court of Cole County (Missouri), in which the lower court reversed the decision to deny respondent's application for a license to practice veterinary medicine pursuant to Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 340.240.6 (1994).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After failing the admissions examination in Missouri three times, respondent passed the Illinois exam. Appellant medical board, however, denied respondent's application for a license to practice veterinary medicine in Missouri. Petitioner relied upon Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 340.240.6 (1994), which permitted applicants to take the examination no more than three times. Upon judicial review, the lower court reversed, holding that the decision was arbitrary and capricious and that the statute and regulation violated respondent's right to equal protection. The court reversed the lower court and affirmed petitioner's decision. Rejecting the equal protection claim, the court held that the three-examination limitation was rationally related to the legitimate state interest of establishing a high level of competence for veterinarians in Missouri. The fact that Missouri decided to hold its veterinarians to a higher standard than most states did not show an absence of a reasonable connection between competence and passing the examination in at least three attempts. Thus, respondent failed to meet her burden of showing that the legislatively created classification did not have a rational basis.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the lower court's judgment, holding that appellant medical board properly denied respondent's application for a license to practice veterinary medicine based on its holding that the statutory three-examination limitation was rationally related to the legitimate state interest of establishing a high level of competence for veterinarians in Missouri.</SPAN></P>

Fifteen months later, respondent moved to vacate the new child support order. The appeals court affirmed the trial court decision to set aside the order as it was not signed. In reversing the decision, the court held that respondent had waived his constitutional right to challenge the order by waiting 15 months before taking any action and by accepting its burden.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant driver was stopped by a trooper for crossing the fog line.

Appellant challenged that statute as unconstitutional. The circuit court rejected the challenge and upheld the suspension. On appeal, the court affirmed. The circuit court was not required to apply the exclusionary rule to exclude evidence of intoxication gathered after the initial stop. There was no violation of federal and Missouri constitutional provisions prohibiting unlawful searches and seizures, U.S. Const. amends. IV, XIV; Mo. Const. art. I, &sect; 15. There was no violation of appellant's equal protection rights under U.S. Const. amend. XIV, Mo. Const. art. I, &sect; 2. Mo. Rev.

Appellant challenged his conviction, claiming error relating to the admission of evidence, and selection of the jury. The court determined that appellant's confession to the crime was admissible, only if his Miranda rights were voluntarily, knowingly, and intelligently waived. The court held that appellant failed to prove that his confession was coerced, or in anyway not intelligently waived, and thus was properly admitted. The court also stated that the admission of gruesome photos of the victim was not reversible, because it demonstrated the nature and location of the wounds. Finally the court concluded that appellant's own error in discriminatingly selecting a jury on the basis of gender was not reversible, because he caused the error.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent Director of Revenue concluded that appellants, Delaware corporation and subsidiaries, were not entitled, under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 143.431.3(1), to file Missouri consolidated income tax returns for 1990-92, denied them 90-91 refunds, and issued a 92 deficiency. The Missouri Administrative Hearing Commission held the corporate group not liable for 92 tax and otherwise affirmed. The group appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In each of the years from 1990-92, the group, domiciled in Michigan, had $ 2.3 billion gross receipts in Missouri which constituted less than two percent of its total income for each year. It filed federal consolidated income tax returns for those years. On Missouri consolidated forms it reported zero income. The Missouri Supreme Court held that &sect; 143.431.3(1)'s requirement for such a group to file a Missouri consolidated return, that 50 percent or more of its income had to come from sources within Missouri, violated the Commerce Clause. That part of the statute expressly distinguished between affiliated groups that performed the majority of their business activities in Missouri and groups that performed the majority out of state. Williams Co. v. Director of Revenue, 799 S.W. 2d 602 (Mo. banc 1990), was overruled to the extent it held that the statute's 50 percent threshold requirement was constitutionally valid. Under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 1.140 (1994), that part of the statute was ordered severed from the rest of the statute which validly required the filing of a federal consolidated return in order to file a Missouri one.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decision was reversed and remanded for further proceedings.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of two counts of first degree murder, one count of first degree robbery, and two counts of armed criminal action. Defendant was sentenced to death for each of the two murder counts and consecutive life sentences for the robbery and armed criminal action counts. Defendant appealed his conviction and sentence on various grounds. Defendant argues that the trial court erred in overruling his objections to the state's peremptory removal of three female venirepersons. The court held that the state provided a legitimate, gender-neutral explanation for the strikes and that defendant failed to show that the state's explanation was pretextual. Defendant also contended that the trial court erred in denying his request to admit hearsay evidence in the penalty phase. The court determined that the hearsay statement may have been admissible, but that defendant suffered no prejudice from its exclusion. On independent review, the court found that there was no evidence suggesting that the punishment was a product of passion, prejudice, or any other arbitrary factor.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant raised numerous points of error on appeal of the penalty phase of his conviction.

He also alleged that his pleadings contained claims of ineffective assistance of counsel because his attorney failed to present cumulative mitigating evidence; adequately assert that jurors did not understand Missouri Annotated Instructions; adequately question defense penalty phase witnesses; take sufficient efforts to disqualify the trial judge; and failure to object to the judge's hostile behavior. He alleged that the decision to seek the death penalty was based on arbitrary and capricious factors. The supreme court affirmed the decision of the lower court, holding that (1) the evidence sufficiently supported the defendant's guilt and the jury's findings of aggravated circumstances. (2) The sentence was not excessive or disproportionate to the penalty based on the crime, the strength of the evidence, and the defendant.</SPAN></P>

Appellant challenged the constitutionality of Mo. Ann. Stat. &sect; 566.025 (1994), under which evidence of his prior uncharged misconduct was mandatorily admitted. The court reversed and held that &sect; 566.025 violated Mo. Const. art.

The court held that evidence of uncharged crimes, when not properly related to the cause on trial, violated appellant's right to be tried for the offense for which he was indicted. When evidence of uncharged misconduct was introduced for no purpose other than to show appellant's propensity to commit such crimes, appellant was forced to defend against the uncharged conduct in addition to the charged crime. The plain language of &sect; 566.025 that evidence of other charged and uncharged crimes &quot;shall be admissible&quot; to show the propensity of the defendant to commit a crime provided for the mandatory admission of propensity evidence and was thus unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a decision from the Circuit Court of Jackson County (Missouri) that convicted him by a jury of forcible rape and false imprisonment. The court found that defendant was a predatory sexual offender pursuant to Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 558.018.5(2), and defendant was sentenced to one year for the false imprisonment conviction and life imprisonment for the forcible rape conviction with eligibility for parole after serving 15 years.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that &sect; 558.018 was unconstitutional. The court found that &sect; 558.018.6 stated that a person found to be a predatory sexual offender had to be sentenced to life in prison. A predatory sexual offender was eligible for parole and was not subject to the minimum prison term requirements of &sect; 558.019.4. However, a person could be sentenced as a predatory sexual offender even if that person had not had any previous convictions. A court could find an offender to be a predatory sexual offender if that offender had previously committed an act that would have constituted a prescribed sexual offense whether or not the act resulted in a conviction. Defendant contended that he was being punished for a specific assault. The court did not agree. Defendant was not entitled to the right to a jury on that offense. The court held that sentencing under &sect; 558.018.4-.6 did not violate defendant's rights to due process or equal protection. Defendant also contended that the trial court erred in admitted evidence of prior conduct. The court held there was no error in the admission of the evidence because it showed a pattern of sexual behavior that was relevant to prove a material fact.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's forcible rape and false imprisonment convictions against defendant.</SPAN></P>

The friend confided in defendant and refused. She asked defendant. After the killing, police pursued a car with sparks beneath it, found ammunition nearby where the car was abandoned matching that at the crime scene, and eventually found defendant hiding. The supreme court found that certain of the woman's statements were admissible under the co-conspirator hearsay exception, which did not require as a prerequisite establishing conspiracy by a preponderance of the evidence. Prosecution statements that prosecutors and witnesses were from the town of the crime did not personalize the case to the jury, and reference to the O.J. trial was not prejudicial. The prosecutor could refer to arguably admissible evidence the State intended to introduce even if it was later excluded. Defendant's flight showed guilt. Counsel could have reasonably decided not to object to certain prosecution statements to avoid highlighting them. Evidence that defendant went to the woman's house the night of the killing to get drugs was not a viable defense; thus, witnesses to that effect were unnecessary.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff patient brought a medical malpractice action against defendant doctor. The Circuit Court of St. Louis County (Missouri) granted summary judgment in favor of the doctor on the ground that the action was barred by Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 516.105 (1994). The Court of Appeals affirmed, then transferred the case to the court, finding the case to be one of general interest and importance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a routine gynecological examination, the doctor told the patient that she would contact her if the results of the Pap test were abnormal. The doctor also told the patient to return to the office in three months. Although the results of the Pap test were abnormal, the doctor did not contact the patient, and the patient did not return to the office. Subsequently, the patient learned that she had developed Stage IIb cancer of the endocervix. The court held that &sect; 516.105 unequivocally provided that the limitation period for malpractice actions began to run upon the date of the act of neglect. As such, the limitation period did not begin when damages were sustained, as contended by the patient. Further, plaintiff's claim was not saved by the continuing treatment theory, because the doctor-patient relationship terminated when the patient failed to return for a follow-up visit. Further, the doctor was not estopped from relying upon the statute of limitations as a defense because her failure to notify the patient, although a negligent act of omission, could not be transformed into an affirmative act to induce the patient to delay bringing suit.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee asbestos remover petitioned for relief from appellant Commission's regulation governing asbestos removal. The Cole County Circuit Court (Missouri) found the regulation violated Mo. Const. art. I, &sect; 13, barring retrospective laws, and art. II, &sect; 1, regarding separation of powers, and conflicted with Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 643.055.1 (1994) limiting the Commission's rulemaking powers. Both parties appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the state supreme court found the trial court erred in holding the regulation violated Mo. Const. art. I, &sect; 13. It noted that the parties had stipulated that the Commission failed to file proper fiscal notes required with the regulation, making the fiscal notes void. However, it also found that the statutory amendments permitting the filing of valid fiscal notes allowed the Commission to revisit the regulation. It next found that the regulation was not applied retroactively because the new regulation applied only from the date of implementation. It further found the regulation did not usurp the judiciary's power in violation of the Mo. Const. art. II, &sect; 1, as the statutory amendments only gave the Commission the limited power to correct the regulation and reimplement it. Finally, it found that the Commission under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 643.055.1 (1994), barring regulations from enactment &quot;stricter than&quot; federal regulations enacted under the Federal Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 7401 et seq., could not promulgate such regulations, which meant that a remand of the case was needed to determine if any of the regulation's provisions were void.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state supreme court reversed the trial court's judgment to the extent it found the regulation violated the Missouri Constitution. Also, it remanded the case to the trial court for a finding about whether any regulation provision was invalid because it was &quot;stricter than&quot; the corresponding federal regulation promulgated under the Federal Clean Air Act. Otherwise, it affirmed the trial court's judgment.</SPAN></P>

At the counseling sessions, defendants were educated as to the risks of spreading HIV and were informed of the possible criminal penalties for ignoring those risks. Defendants were found to have infected other persons with HIV after failing to inform their partners of their HIV status and engaging in unprotected sex. Both were convicted of violating Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 191.677.1(2) (1994), creating a grave and unjustifiable risk of infecting another with HIV. On appeal, both defendants argued that the statute was unconstitutionally broad and one defendant argued that it was void for vagueness. The court ruled that neither defendant had standing to challenge the statute on the overbreadth ground because, as applied to them, the statute was constitutional. The court also ruled that &quot;grave and unjustifiable risk&quot; was not unconstitutionally vague because it was clear, given the facts, that defendant subjected his partner to a &quot;grave and unjustifiable risk&quot; by fully knowing the risk, failing to inform his partner, and failing to use protection. HIV test results were properly disclosed to the jury.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 487.030 (Supp. 1997) purporting to dissolve the marriage of the former spouses. The spouses did not seek review under &sect; 487.030.2 of the commissioner's findings. In an unrelated case, the court sua sponte determined that &sect; 487.030 was unconstitutional. The circuit judge then entered a &quot;final judgment&quot; in the spouses' dissolution of marriage action, confirming and adopting the commissioner's findings and recommendations. The spouses sought an order in prohibition or mandamus, ordering the circuit judge to set aside the &quot;final judgment.&quot; The court granted a preliminary writ and subsequently quashed the writ. The court found that the portion of the statute authorizing review of the commissioner's findings was not declared unconstitutional, that the spouses' failure to seek a timely review resulted in a waiver of any objection to the commissioner's authority, and that the commissioner's findings were conclusive as to the spouses.

The court held that the conduct of defendant's counsel during the penalty phase did not measure up to an objective standard of reasonableness. The court noted that the counsel failed to solidify arrangements with the scheduled key witness in the penalty phase of the capital trial as to when he would testify even though the a witness' office was located approximately a two-hour drive from the courthouse. The court further noted that after she was notified that the key witness would not appear without first speaking to her personally, instead of moving for a continuance or making tactical changes in her theory of defense, she gambled on the chance that she could reproduce the evidence of a licensed psychiatrist through hypotheticals by a doctor of pharmacy.</SPAN></P>

The use of an alternate juror in the sentencing phase was consistent with statutory intent. Defendant argued that imposition of the death penalty was not justified.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The defendant confessed to stealing two cars, robbing three people, and murdering two people.

On appeal of his sentence of death for murder and 170 years plus life imprisonment for the other charges, the court held that the evidence, including the defendant's own statements, supported the jury's inference of deliberation. The court held that (1) evidence of uncharged crimes was admissible to present a complete and coherent picture of the charged crimes and to rebut the defendant's assertion that he could not deliberate, (2) the trial court did not err in joining the offenses, as they were all connected in time, (3) the trial court did not err during voir dire, admission of evidence, closing arguments, or in its jury instructions, and (4) the death penalty was not disproportionate based on the defendant's admitted behavior and the uncontested evidence against him.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted and sentenced for killing his stepdaughter's friend. On appeal, defendant challenged the sufficiency of the evidence and argued, inter alia, that the trial court: (1) erred in precluding evidence concerning a known pedophile who lived near the victim; (2) allowed the prosecution to ask him improper questions on cross-examination; (3) erred in overruling defense counsel's objection to the endorsement of the state's DNA expert; (4) erred during death qualification of the jury panel by prohibiting defense counsel from asking the prospective jurors a question; (5) erred in allowing the state to elicit testimony regarding his prior bad acts during the penalty phase; and (6) erred by allowing the prosecutor to make numerous improper statements during the state's closing argument in the penalty phase. The appellate court rejected defendant's contentions and affirmed his conviction. Upon the evidence adduced in the case, however, the appellate court concluded that the sentence of death was disproportionate and resentenced defendant to life imprisonment without eligibility for probation, parole, or release.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Circuit Court of Cole County (Missouri) granted summary judgment to respondent taxpayer and others in the suit they brought against appellant Director of the Department of Natural Resources (Missouri) (director), challenging the constitutionality, pursuant to Mo. Const. art. III, &sect;&sect; 21 and 23, of the bill which became Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 260.003 (1996). The director appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Rejecting the director's claim that those bringing suit had no standing, the court ruled that the circuit court correctly concluded that enforcement of the statute had and would impose costs on the state for salaries, expenses, and other costs that would not otherwise be made, and therefore, the taxpayer had standing. The title of the bill included only &quot;solid waste,&quot; even though it also regulated &quot;hazardous waste.&quot; Mo. Const. art. III, &sect; 21 mandated that no bill shall be so amended in its passage through either house as to change its original purpose. Mo. Const. art. III, &sect; 23 required that no bill shall contain more than one subject which shall be clearly expressed in its title. The court explained that these constitutional limitations functioned in the legislative process to facilitate orderly procedure, avoid surprise, and prevent &quot;logrolling.&quot; Affirming the summary judgment, the court found the title affirmatively misleading because it gave the reader the mistaken impression that the bill pertained to solid waste management only, rather than to hazardous waste also. Consistent with legislative intent, the court declined to sever Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 260.003 (1996) in its entirety.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the decision of the circuit court and ruled that the director was enjoined from enforcing the hazardous waste management application of the bill pursuant to the suit brought by the taxpayer and others challenging the constitutionality of the bill because of amendments that changed its original purpose and the failure to clearly express the subject in the title.</SPAN></P>

Because the construction projects at issue involved tax exempt entities such as schools, churches, and municipalities, the corporation did not collect, report, or remit use taxes on its purchases of materials for those projects. The director assessed $ 41,228.32 in use tax, interest, and additions. The trial court upheld the director's assessment. On appeal, the court found that pursuant to Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 144.610 (1994), a tax was imposed for the privilege of storing, using or consuming within the state any article of tangible personal property in an amount equivalent to the percentage imposed on the sales price in the sales tax law. However, it was uncontested that the materials for each construction project were ultimately billed to the exempt entity and the exempt entity paid the bills. Therefore, Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 144.062 was applicable which exempted from sales tax the sales of construction materials to exempt entities.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant counties sought review of a judgment of the Circuit Court of Cole County (Missouri), which granted judgment in favor of respondents, Director of Revenue and taxpayers, and held that the local use tax statute,&nbsp;Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 144.748 was unconstitutional in its entirety.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayers sought relief from the Director and contended that they were entitled to refunds from the counties because the local use tax statute,&nbsp;Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 144.748 was unconstitutional in its entirety. The court found that Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 144.749 implicitly allowed refunds while Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 143.903 expressly forbid such refunds. The court held that, when two statutory provisions were repugnant, the later act operated to the extent of the repugnancy to repeal the first. The court determined that, because Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 143.903 had been superseded by Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 144.749, Mo. Rev. Stat.&nbsp;&sect; 143.903 did not limit the availability of refunds requested by the taxpayers. The court found that Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 144.749 applied only to the Director and further found that it did not require the counties to take any action or to require them to take any new or increased activity or service. The court held that the Director's decision to withhold funds fell outside the scope of restrictions imposed by Mo. Const. art. X, &sect; 22. The court affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded in part the judgment of the trial court.</SPAN></P>

He challenged his murder conviction, his sentence, and the denial of his post-conviction motion. The court affirmed these judgments. It held that defendant presented no proof that the transfer of venue resulted in the systematic exclusion of African-Americans on the jury venires and failed to show that the state's reasons for striking African-American venire persons were pretextual. It held that any prejudicial effect of the emotional outburst of victim's mother or defendant being shackled in the presence of the jury after the return of the verdicts did not require mistrial. Further, it was not error for the state to use defendant's prison record on cross-examination of defendant's expert witness in the penalty phase as it was not admitted into evidence, its use was limited, and the state used it in good faith. Finally, the sentence of death was not excessive or disproportionate to the penalty imposed in similar cases considering the crime, the strength of the evidence, and the defendant.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. &sect; 210.817 et seq. (1994), that respondent, the mother's ex-husband, was not the father of the daughter, although the daughter was born while the mother and her ex-husband were married.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The issue was whether the husband, the mother, and the daughter could maintain a suit to declare the nonexistence of a parent-child relationship between the ex-husband and the daughter. When the daughter was nine, the legislature removed the bar under the Uniform Parentage Act requiring that an action to establish the nonexistence of a paternal relationship presumed under the act be brought before the child's fifth birthday. The appellate court held that on the child's fifth birthday the ex-husband acquired a vested right to be free from a suit to challenge his paternity of the daughter. Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 210.826.1 (1994), as applied to the ex-husband, was unconstitutionally retroactive. The husband, a putative biological father, did not have a protectable liberty interest in the legal recognition of paternity. The dismissal of the action did not violate the husband's due process rights, equal protection rights, or right under the Missouri Constitution to open courts. The daughter's rights to due process, equal protection, and open courts under the Missouri Constitution were also not violated by limiting her right to challenge the presumed paternity of the ex-husband.</SPAN></P>

The taxpayers challenged a decision of the Circuit Court of Cole County (Missouri), which dismissed their petition.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayers sought to prevent the licensing of facilities in artificial spaces filled with water from the Missouri River, not contiguous to the river, but within 1,000 feet of the main channel. The trial court dismissed the action, but the court reversed and remanded on appeal. The court considered the language of a constitutional amendment found in Mo. Const. art. III, &sect; 39(e), and concluded that it authorized games of change to be conducted on excursion gambling boats and floating facilities solely over and in contact with the surface of the Mississippi and Missouri Rivers. This gambling could occur in artificial spaces that were contiguous to the surface stream and river-based, but not in other artificial spaces that were not contiguous to the surface stream of the river that was land-based. The court rejected reliance on Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 313.800(16) (1994), and held that to the extent it conflicted with the state constitution, it was invalid. The court held that the mere presence of river water in artificial spaces within 1,000 feet of the channel did not make the gambling only upon the Mississippi and Missouri Rivers.</SPAN></P>

The trial court held that MEM was a public corporation and granted MEM's motion for summary judgment. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that MEM was a public corporation because it was created by the government for a public purpose and was controlled by the state. The court held that the constitutional prohibitions against creating corporations by special law and against granting corporations special or exclusive privileges and exemptions where a general law could be made applicable did not apply to public corporations. The court rejected appellant's equal protection and due process claims because a private insurance company was not a suspect class and the right to participate in the insurance business was not a fundamental right.</SPAN></P>

The motion had to allege facts, not conclusions, warranting relief, the facts alleged had to raise matters not refuted by the records in the case, and the matters complained of had to have resulted in prejudice to defendant. The court held that for defendant to obtain an evidentiary hearing on claims of ineffective assistance of counsel, he must have alleged facts, not refuted by the record, showing that his counsel's performance did not conform to the degree of skill, care, and diligence of a reasonably competent attorney, and that he was thereby prejudiced. The court held that defendant failed to satisfy this standard, and his motion was properly overruled without an evidentiary hearing.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of first degree murder. He had pushed the driver of a car over the side of a bridge after hijacking her vehicle. Defendant did not have an absolute right to a plea bargain. His second confession, the base of his alleged plea bargain, was not used by the prosecutor and there was no abuse in refusing to accept it. Jurors who would not follow the law and impose the death penalty were properly excluded from the jury. The results of defendant's polygraph test could not be introduced as a mitigating factor nor could his offer to plead guilty. It was not reversible error for the prosecutor to state in closing argument that it was a difficult decision to seek the death penalty. Considering the crime, the strength of the evidence, and the defendant, the court found that the sentence was proportionate to cases where the sentencer found beyond a reasonable doubt any one of the six aggravating circumstances.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Police had been asked to watch a house while its owners were out of the country. A police officer observed a pickup truck parked at the house and saw the driver get in and start to pull out. The officer noticed that the driver's eyes were bloodshot and his speech was slurred, and the driver failed field sobriety tests. After being arrested, a breath analysis examination revealed legal intoxication, and the driver's license was suspended under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 302.505 (1994). The trial court rescinded the suspension. The court reversed. The officer had probable cause to believe that the driver was intoxicated. Whether the truck was moving when the officer observed the driver was immaterial because the driver admitted that he was in control of the truck, which was all that was required. Any error stemming from the Department's failure to prove that the analyzer had been checked within the previous 35 days under Mo. Code Regs. Ann. tit. 19 &sect; 25-30.031(3) was not preserved for review because the objection encompassed a broad range of situations that were not readily apparent.</SPAN></P>

The court further held that the trial court properly denied defendant's motion to suppress. The court determined that defendant had not shown any expectation of privacy in the proffered evidence. The court went on to hold that comments made by the State at voir dire did not result in manifest injustice. The court also determined that the admission of photographs and physical evidence during the trial was not error and defendant failed to show that he was harmed by the admissions. The court decided that testimony heard was admissible, there was no instructional error, and closing arguments were valid. The court held that the evidence was sufficient, the statements made during the penalty phase were allowable, the jury instructions were not erroneous, and there was no ineffective assistance of counsel.</SPAN></P>

The controversy was ripe for judicial determination as the resolution of the constitutional issue depends entirely on facts that occurred before the bill was passed. The court held that CCSHB was unconstitutional as it violated a single subject restriction of Mo. Const. art.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent Missouri Gaming Commission filed a petition in interpleader requesting an order that respondent Missouri Veterans' Commission and the St. Louis City School Fund (Missouri) interplead and state a claim to penalty proceeds. Appellant Board of Education of the City of St. Louis challenged a judgment of the Circuit Court of Cole County ordering the penalties distributed as directed in Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 313.385 (1994).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Gaming Commission had assessed an administrative penalty against a casino company for employing unlicensed persons and for failing to report regulatory violations. The trial court found that the Gaming Commission imposed the penalty for a violation of the Gaming Commission's regulations, not for a violation of a penal law. Exercising its jurisdiction under Mo. Const. art. V, &sect; 3, the court held that any penalties, forfeitures, or fines collected pursuant to Mo. Rev. Stat. 313.805(6) (statute) had to be distributed as required by Mo. Const. art. IX, &sect; 7. The parties agreed that the casino paid the penalty for a violation of Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 313.812.14(2). It was clear that the Gaming Commission penalized the casino under the statute's authority, which provided for penalties and for their assessment and collection. The penalty was for violation of a public right and recoverable by public authority. Thus, the court concluded that the statute was a penal law within the plain meaning of Mo. Const. art. IX, &sect; 7. To the extent that the statute allowed disbursement of proceeds from penalties, forfeitures, and fines to entities other than the public schools, it was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment of the trial court and remanded the cause with directions to enter an order transferring the disputed funds to the appropriate school district or districts.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, defendant argued that the prosecutor made improper comments during the trial. Defendant asserted that the prosecution had improperly indicated that the jurors would make a punishment recommendation to the judge. The court rejected this argument, holding that no manifest injustice or miscarriage of justice resulted from the comments even if they were improper. Defendant also argued that the prosecution had improperly used its preemptory strike to remove an African-American woman from the jury. The court rejected this argument because the prosecution offered several race neutral reasons for striking the juror. The court also rejected defendant's argument that his motion to disqualify the trial judge was improperly denied. The court reasoned that there was no bias present that would cause a reasonable onlooker to question the judge's ability to act impartially or find an appearance of impropriety and doubt the impartiality of the court. Finally, the court held that defendant's sentence was proportional to the crime. The facts indicated that the victim was beaten and was strangled to death.</SPAN></P>

Appellant contended that the motion court erred in adopting in whole the prosecutor's proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law, and that trial counsel was ineffective.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of a death sentence and the denial of his Mo. R. Crim. P. 29.15 motion after he was convicted of capital murder. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgments. The court found that because appellant did not timely object, any issue regarding the motion court's adoption of the prosecutor's proposed finding of fact and conclusions of law was not preserved for review. The motion court did not err in failing to find that appellant's counsel was ineffective. Appellant asserted no impropriety in the initial selection of the state's medical expert and defense counsel was not obligated to shop for an expert who might have provided more favorable testimony. Additionally, appellant did not prove prejudice. In light of the overwhelming aggravating circumstances there was not a reasonable probability that the potentially mitigating evidence offered by appellant would have caused the jury to give a different sentence. Allowing the prosecutor rebuttal during closing argument did not impinge on defense counsel's opportunity to argue the case. The motion court did not err in overruling appellant's Rule 29.15 motion because defense counsel was not ineffective.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgments sentencing appellant to death and denying his motion for post-conviction relief. The court found that the state's proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law adopted by the trial court were correct. The procedure of allowing the prosecutor to close argument did not violate due process. The sentence of death was not imposed under the influence of passion, prejudice, or any other arbitrary factor.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff public school districts filed a class action lawsuit against defendant retirement system seeking a refund of overpayments to the retirement system and a declaration that an amendment to Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 169.030.3, the statute on which the contributions were based, was unconstitutional. The Circuit Court of Cole County (Missouri) determined that the amendment was constitutional and dismissed the action. The school districts appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Under the amendment, prior contributions to the retirement system were deemed in compliance with the law whether based on salary rates that included or excluded medical benefits. The school districts, which had contributed based on a salary rate that included medical benefits, argued that the amendment violated state constitutional provisions concerning retrospective laws, impairment of contract, separation of powers, and enactment of special laws. The court held that the legislature could waive or impair the vested rights of school districts, as creatures of the legislature, without violating the retrospective law prohibition. There was no impairment of contract because there was no contractual relationship between the retirement system and the school districts; the obligation was statutory. The separation of powers doctrine did not prohibit the statutory amendment, which was designed to resolve a legal dispute between two statutory instrumentalities of government. The classification of school districts in the amendment was rationally related to several legitimate governmental objectives. As such, the amendment was not special legislation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of first-degree murder and was sentenced to death after he beat a 56 year old woman to death with a hammer. He appealed the conviction and the sentence claiming, among other things, that the trial court erred in failing to submit a cautionary instruction required by Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 552.030.5 and by permitting the jury to hear evidence of unrelated prior crimes. The court affirmed. The court found, among other things, that lower court's failure to give the jury instruction regarding insanity in this case was not error. By conceding that he killed the victim, defendant could not have been harmed by the failure of the trial court to give the limiting instructions. This was because the only issue before the jury after the admission was whether defendant deliberated prior to doing what he admitted he did. Next, the court found that the trial court erred in not excising evidence of other crimes. However, the error resulted in evidence-specific prejudice, as the evidence of defendant's guilt was essentially uncontroverted and overwhelming. Additionally, the court found no evidence of harm to defendant through the ineffective assistance of counsel.</SPAN></P>

Section 537.675 provided that 50 percent of any punitive damages judgment was deemed rendered in favor of the State of Missouri.

The husband and the wife argued that the bill that resulted in &sect; 537.675 violated the single subject rule, and that the subject was so restrictive that punitive damages fell outside the scope of the subject. The court held that although multiple subjects were raised, they purported to do the same thing. Therefore, the husband and the wife failed to sustain their burden of proving the unconstitutionality of the statute on the basis that it contained more than one subject.

Rev. Stat. &sect; 94.800 et seq. (1994), in the taxpayers' action seeking declaratory relief and to prevent issuance of bonds backed by its revenues.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1993, the general assembly established the Municipal Tourism Tax, Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 94.800 et seq. (1994), which could be imposed by any municipality within a certain population range and which was located in a county that borders the state of Arkansas. This description applied only to one city. Taxpayers subject to the tax challenged the validity of the enabling legislation. The trial court granted the city's motion for partial summary judgment in the taxpayers' declaratory judgment action and, following a short trial, entered judgment authorizing issuance of the bonds. On appeal, the court found that the tourism tax was an unconstitutional special law under Mo. Const. art. III, &sect; 40(30), rejecting the city's argument that the classification was not so narrowly drawn as to permanently exclude all other cities. Rather, the court held that the standard was not on the size of the class comprehended by the legislation but rather, focused on the nature of the factors used in arriving at that class and because the requirement that a city be in a county bordering Arkansas was a close-ended classification, the statute was presumed unconstitutional as a facially special law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment of the circuit court and remanded with directions to the trial court to declare the tourism tax unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant automobile dealership challenged the judgment of the Circuit Court of Cole County, which ruled on behalf of respondent Missouri Motor Vehicle Commission in the dealership's action for declaratory judgment and injunctive relief. The action was consolidated with the dealership's challenge to the Commission's administrative disciplinary action in the circuit court. The court had jurisdiction pursuant to Mo. Const. art. V, &sect; 10.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The dealership was charged with violating the Commission's advertising regulations. The dealer lost both in the administrative disciplinary action and in his action for declaratory judgment and injunctive relief. The dealership claimed that the regulations violated his rights of commercial free speech, equal protection, and his privileges and immunities under the Fourteenth Amendment. The court held that regulating the state's automobile dealerships as a class did not violate equal protection and that corporations had no standing to seek protection under the privileges and immunities clause of the U.S. Constitution. In addition, the court held that advertising automobiles by their &quot;invoice price&quot; was inherently misleading and deceptive, as was advertising that claimed to match or beat the competitors' prices without disclosing the competitors' prices. Therefore, the regulations that prohibited such practices advanced a legitimate state interest of consumer protection in a manner that was not unduly restrictive of the dealership's right to commercial free speech. Finally, the Commission had every statutory authority to prohibit such advertising.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed both the results of the Commission's administrative disciplinary action against the automobile dealership and the judgment of the circuit court that denied the dealership's complaint for declaratory judgment and injunctive relief.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to death. Defendant sought review of the conviction and sentence, arguing that his confession was involuntary and coerced, that his U.S. Const. amend. V rights were violated because he was subjected to interrogation by police despite his announcement of his intent to remain silent, that the prosecutor made improper remarks during closing, and that he received ineffective counsel during trial and during sentencing. The court affirmed the conviction and the death sentence, holding that a suspect in custody was required to give a clear, consistent expression of a desire to remain silent in order to invoke his Miranda rights adequately and cut off questioning. The court stated that there was no testimony that indicated that defendant invoked his right to remain silent. Because defendant received and understood his Miranda warnings, he was aware of the right to stop questioning at any time. The court further held that defendant's confession was admissible. Officers' statements to a suspect that cooperating was in his best interests were not coercive and did not render a confession involuntary.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In the Circuit Court of Jackson County (Missouri), defendant was found guilty by a jury of two counts of first-degree murder. The court sentenced defendant to life imprisonment without parole for one killing and to death by lethal injection for the other. Defendant's Mo. R. Crim. P. 29.15 motions for post-conviction relief were denied without a hearing. Defendant appealed the convictions, sentences, and denial of post-conviction relief.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The videotape of defendant's confession showed his statement was not the result of threats or promises, despite his claim he was delusional from drugs and that he had been promised he would not receive the death penalty. The state's peremptory challenges, based on hunches, were racially-neutral and did not violate Batson. The testimony of a pathologist who did not perform the autopsies was not hearsay, and the parties had stipulated to the autopsy report. From defendant's confession and the pathologist's testimony, the jury could have found defendant deliberated before each killing. The jury could have found defendant caused the deaths in the manner described in jury instructions. Incorrect wording in the indictment caused no prejudice. Because the jury did not impose a life sentence for one killing, the court assumed jurors unanimously found at least one aggravating factor. Thus it was appropriate for the trial court to sentence defendant to death. The double jeopardy clause did not bar the trial court from considering all aggravating circumstances, and there was evidence to support each. Defendant's allegations of juror misconduct were properly denied without evidence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the convictions for first-degree murder, the sentences of life imprisonment and death by lethal injection, and the denial of post-conviction relief.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from his convictions and sentence of death in the Circuit Court of Jackson County, Missouri. Defendant was convicted of first degree murder, first degree robbery, first degree assault, and three counts of armed criminal action. He was sentenced to death by the judge after the jury deadlocked on punishment. He claimed numerous errors in the trial court's rulings on discovery, jury selection, handling of trial, and sentencing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant killed an attendant while robbing a gas station. He aimed at the attendant's daughter, but his gun jammed. The court held that the trial court did not err in failing to make Brady disclosures to defendant because, after in camera inspection, it found no evidence favorable to defendant. The court found no prejudice in the victim's relatives talking to prospective jurors who never served. The court rejected defendant's Batson challenges because defendant never attempted to show that the prosecution's explanations were pretextual. During the penalty phase, the prosecutor urged the jurors to get mad and to use their emotions. The trial court overruled defendant's objection to this argument. The court held that the argument was impermissible and that the trial court's ruling gave the jury the impression that the appeal to emotion had the court's stamp of approval. The court found a reasonable probability that the jury would have assessed life imprisonment instead of death without the improper argument. The court reviewed defendant's motion for post-conviction relief and found no ineffective assistance of counsel and no error in the trial judge's failure to recuse.</SPAN></P>

The court said that if the estate's personal representative either knew or, in the exercise of reasonable diligence, could have discovered the claimants' identity, then she was under a duty to give them actual notice.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner purchaser filed an action against respondents, a lienholder and trustee, to obtain confirmation of petitioner's tax deed, to quiet title, and for other relief. The trial court granted partial summary judgment to respondents and dismissed the remainder of the action. The court affirmed the judgment and held that respondent lienholder's deed of trust was not extinguished by the third tax sale, but was in full force and effect. The court found that Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 140.250, 140.405, expressly stated that there was no period of redemption from a third tax sale. The court held that respondent lienholder was entitled to notice mailed to its last known available address or by personal service. The court held that petitioner had a fee simple absolute interest in the property subject to respondent lienholder's deed of trust. The court held that it was unnecessary to declare that &sect; 140.405, the tax sale notice statute, was unconstitutional. The court held that there was simply a failure to provide the due process notice necessary for the tax sale to extinguish respondent lienholder's security interest in the property. The court found that the interest rate was not usurious.</SPAN></P>

The court held that to interpret the tax sale statutes to provide for a period of redemption after a third tax sale would be judicial rewriting of such statutes.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Circuit Court of Boone County (Missouri) convicted defendant of three counts of first degree murder, three counts of armed criminal action, and one count of robbery following his guilty plea. His post-conviction motion under Mo. R. Crim. P. 24.035 was denied. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's convictions resulted from his involvement along with two other men in what began as a robbery of a drug dealer and ended in the murder of the drug dealer, his mother, and his brother. Defendant received three death sentences. The court held that the trial court committed no plain error in sentencing because substantial evidence existed that defendant's drug use was not a mitigating factor and sufficient evidence existed to prove all three statutory aggravating factors beyond a reasonable doubt. Regarding allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel, the court held that the trial court's findings on the post-conviction motion were not clearly erroneous. The court found that counsel did not coerce or pressure defendant to plead guilty, counsel did investigate the defense of diminished capacity before rejecting it, and counsel decided not to hire a mental health expert for reasons other than a lack of funds. Although family members' requests that defendant be sentenced to death should not have been admitted, the evidence was not prejudicial because a judge sentenced defendant. The court found the sentences to be proportional to the crimes.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found that mentally incapacitated persons, unlike minors, were not legally prohibited from filing suit. They have the right to pursue in the courts any cause of action the substantive law recognizes. Instead, their own disability prevents, as a practical matter, meaningful access to the courts by mentally incapacitated individuals. The legislature, in recognition of this practical inability to bring suit, included mentally incapacitated persons in the tolling provisions of Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 516.170, but then excepted those persons from the tolling benefit in medical malpractice cases. Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 516.170 did not procedurally bar access to the mentally incapacitated. The exception may, in some cases, yield harsh results, but it was, nevertheless, a legitimate legislative prerogative. Therefore, the court held that &sect; 516.170 did not impede a mentally incapacitated person's access to the courts and that the trial court committed no error in sustaining the health care providers' motions to dismiss and for summary judgment and in overruling the conservator's motion for summary judgment.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the terms &quot;benefit&quot; and &quot;statement&quot; were terms of plain meaning. The court held that &quot;knowingly&quot; was defined in Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 562.016.3 (1994). The court held that the argument that the term &quot;false&quot; was vague, was patently frivolous. Defendant also argued that the trial lacked jurisdiction over the workers' compensation offense because none of the elements of the crime occurred in Missouri.

Stat. &sect; 386.800 (1994) protected electricity providers from encroachment by municipally-owned power companies. The court held that the statutory language that allowed the City to annex areas along a road or highway up to two miles from its existing boundaries was an exception to the provision that tracts of land touching the city only by a strip of property within the city which was less than a quarter mile wide were not removed from the definition of compact and contiguous if that strip was a road.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of murder. He filed a pro se motion to vacate the judgment and his attorneys filed two amended motions. In a previous appeal, the court ruled that defendant's signature on the pro se motion was sufficient verification; however, the amended motions were untimely as the lower court lacked jurisdiction to grant more than the prescribed extension. Nonetheless, the first amended motion was reinstated because counsel's failure to file a timely amended motion constituted abandonment. On remand, the lower court denied defendant's motion without a hearing. The court affirmed. Defendant's pleadings were fatally inadequate because he failed to allege facts that would entitle him to relief and because his claims were refuted by the record. In addition, the purpose of an evidentiary hearing was not to provide defendant with an opportunity to produce facts not alleged in the motion but to determine if the facts alleged in the motion were true. Finally, while the lower court failed to enter a conclusion of law on one matter, remanding the case to supply the missing legal conclusion would only serve to delay finality and burden the judicial system with a meritless claim.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city enterprises had natural gas shipped from outside of the city for consumption within the city. The city then passed City of St. Louis, Mo., Rev. Code &sect;&sect; 23.41.010-.060 (1994). Those sections required that the enterprises pay a natural gas transportation license fee for the privilege of purchasing natural gas outside of the city and consuming that gas within the city. The enterprises challenged the constitutionality of the ordinance. On appeal, the Court, sua sponte, considered its jurisdiction. The Court determined that in order for it to have jurisdiction the city ordinance in question had to be revenue law of the state. Although the ordinance adopted by the city was a revenue law, it was not a revenue law of the state. As a result, the Court did not have the exclusive appellate jurisdiction over the issues presented in the case as required by Mo. Const. art. V, &sect; 3.</SPAN></P>

The residents sought an order in mandamus requiring the secretary of state to publish a rule, a declaratory judgment holding legislative veto power unconstitutional, and an injunction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The secretary of state refused to publish the regulation at issue because the DNR had not first submitted the proposed regulation to the JCAR, a committee empowered by the legislature to veto the proposed rule. The court found that Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 260.225 (Supp. 1990) was unconstitutional, because the legislature could not grant itself power that unconstitutionally impinged upon the executive branch of the state's tripartite government. The court found that &sect; 260.225 violated the separation of powers provisions of Mo. Const. art. II, &sect; 1 by permitting the legislature to suspend publication and promulgation of the DNR's final orders of rulemaking for up to 20 days while the legislature reviewed the rules. The court concluded that the statute violated both the separation of powers provisions of Mo. Const. art. II, &sect; 1 and the passage and presentment requirements of Mo. Const. art. III, &sect;&sect; 21, 31 by permitting the legislature to prevent promulgation and enforcement of DNR rules it disapproved and to suspend and withdraw rules already promulgated by the DNR.</SPAN></P>

The trial court granted defendant's motion to dismiss. Defendant contended that the prevailing wage law was unconstitutionally vague. Defendant presented evidence that a work description rule was passed to remedy the deficiencies in the statute. The court determined that wilfully as used in the Mo. Rev.

The court stated that in order to convict the contractor, the fact finder had to be convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant engaged in the conduct when it was aware of the nature of its conduct. The court determined that the scienter element adequately cured any uncertainty as to the meaning of the terms prevailing hourly rate of wages and work of a similar character.

The school district was a taxing authority that contained the redevelopment plan area. The school district argued that if the replacement tax revenues were included in the TIF plan the replacement tax based upon any increase in the value of the property would be diverted from the school district to pay for the development of the depressed property. On review the court found no constitutional violation. The court found that Mo. Const. art. X, &sect; 6.2 imposed a tax on real estate, and under Mo. Const. art. X, &sect; 7, the general assembly could provide for such partial relief from taxation of the lands devoted to rehabilitation of blighted areas. Nothing in &sect; 6.2 suggested that the tax imposed was different from any other tax authorized by the constitution. Mo. Const. art. X, &sect; 7 was a specific grant of power to abate taxes on land. The court held that replacement tax revenues were includable in a TIF plan and the adoption of such a plan did not violate the constitution.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayers filed a declaratory judgment action claiming that a newly enacted Missouri law was unconstitutional because it had a referendum clause contingent on a future event and contained more than one subject.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant Missouri Department of Social Services, Division of Child Support Enforcement sought review of an order of the Circuit Court of LaClede County (Missouri) finding that Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 454.496 was unconstitutional. Respondent father had challenged an administrative order of the Division increasing his child support obligation, seeking judicial review and challenging the constitutionality of the statute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In reviewing the constitutionality of the child support modification provisions, the court noted that Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 454.496 did not place exclusive judicial functions in the executive department. Section 454.496 does not permit the Division of Child Support to review the trial court's order. Instead, it permitted the Division to initiate the process that would result in modification of the original child support order only if there was a material change in the factual circumstances that formed the basis for the trial court's order. This was not judicial review, but an initial assessment of the current compliance of the child support payment levels with Mo. R. Civ. P. 88.01. In holding that the default judicial approval provisions of &sect; 454.496.6 violated Mo. Const. art. V, &sect; 18, the court held that judicial review could not be conducted by default or assumption. Where a statute made judicial review mandatory, it could not also erect a default procedure that assumed judicial approval by the mere passage of time. The court further held that the default review provisions of &sect; 495.496.6, while unconstitutional, were severable and the remaining portions of the statute could stand.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed that portion of the judgment which found that the default review provisions of the child support modification statute was unconstitutional, but reversed that portion of the judgment which found the entire statute unconstitutional. The case was remanded for a determination of the merits of the remaining issues raised in the father's petition for judicial review and the conformity of the modification order to guidelines.</SPAN></P>

The mother then filed an application with the Division requesting an administrative review and modification of the trial court's order modifying the child support order. The father responded by filing his own motion to modify in the trial court, seeking either custody of the children or a reduction in child support. A hearing officer entered an administrative order increasing the father's child support obligation. As required by Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 454.496, the Division filed a motion to modify following the hearing officer's decision. The court held that the authority placed in the Division to initiate a process to modify judicial child support orders by Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 454.496 did not offend the constitution. The court also held that the constitution did not permit the General Assembly to require, then pretermit, judicial review of an administrative modification of a child support order if a court failed to approve the administrative order within 45 days.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed in part and reversed in part the judgment of the trial court. Where the trial court determined that the complete statute was unconstitutional, the court found only the default review provisions unconstitutional and severable. The court remanded for a determination of the merits of the remaining issues.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After drinking 12 beers, the driver caused a collision between his pickup truck and the victims' vehicle, killing 3 of them and injuring the others. The driver was convicted of manslaughter and incarcerated during the action. On appeal of the $ 19 million judgment, the driver argued that Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 491.230.2 (1994), which prohibited his appearance at trial, was unconstitutional, that the trial court erred in denying a continuance to secure his deposition, that the punitive damage award violated the requirements of due process, that one of the victims lacked authority to sue for the deaths of her siblings, and that prejudgment interest awarded was error. The court held that 1) the statute was valid because there were alternatives to the driver's personal appearance at trial, 2) no continuance was required because the driver had ample time to be deposed, 3) the punitive damages determination procedure satisfied due process requirements, 4) the damage award to one of the victims was partially improper because it included damages for her sibling, which she lacked authority to receive, and 5) the award of interest was proper because the victims requested open-ended relief.</SPAN></P>

The city also enacted an ordinance authorizing a special assessment against the district property and, if needed, a city-wide ad valorem tax. The trial court found that the proposed golf course was a neighborhood under Mo. Const. art. III, &sect; 38(c), but that the issuance of district bonds without prior voter approval violated Mo.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In separate transactions, defendants sold controlled substances within 1,000 feet of houses and a duplex owned and maintained by the city. Defendants claimed that the convictions were unconstitutional because &quot;public housing&quot; was not defined. The court held that the convictions were proper because &quot;public housing&quot; had a commonly understood meaning. Thus, property owned by the city for housing low-income persons and families was clearly public housing, regardless of whether the term could have been vague in other contexts. Because &sect; 195.218 was a punishment enhancement statute, scienter was not required to prove defendants violated it. Instead, the State only had to prove defendants violated Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 195.211 (1994) within 1,000 feet of public housing and defendants had the burden to ensure that they did not violate &sect; 195.211 within 1,000 feet of public housing. Although Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 195.218 disproportionately affected blacks, there was no violation of the Equal Protection Clause because &sect; 195.218 was neutral on its face and had no discriminatory purpose. Because one defendant admitted to selling crack cocaine, any improper waiver of a jury trial was harmless error.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the trial court did not err by not ordering a competency hearing before proceeding to trial. Defense counsel did not request a competency hearing under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 552.020. The evidence was inconsistent with an incompetency defense. Defendant's trial counsel was not ineffective for inadequately presenting defendant's mental state to the jury during the penalty phase, for failing to move to suppress identification evidence, for failing to object to prejudicial statements by the prosecutor during the opening statement; or for failing to object to the prosecutor's comment during the penalty phase that defendant showed no remorse. These matters were either supported by the evidence or were considered trial strategy. There was no error in introducing testimony about defendant's AIDS. It was introduced to rebut defendant's claim that alcohol &quot;fueled&quot; his crimes. There was no error in the order of submission of the penalty phase questions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, three heirs of a decedent, challenged a judgment of the Circuit Court of Miller County (Missouri) that sustained a motion to dismiss the heirs' will contest action filed by respondents, the devisees and the executor of the decedent's will. The circuit court held that the will contest was not brought within six months of the first publication of notice of the estate's administration, as required by Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 473.083.1 (1994).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The application for letters testamentary listed only the devisees' names and addresses. Before the estate closed, one of the heirs filed a petition to contest the will before the closing of the estate, alleging that he was not provided with the notice required by Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 473.017.1 (1994). The other two heirs intervened. On appeal from the dismissal of the petition, the court reversed as to two heirs who pled that they did not know of the proceedings within six months of the first publication of notice and affirmed as to the third heir, who did not so plead. The court refused to address the constitutionality of Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 473.083 (1994). Overruling Haas v. Haas, 504 S.W.2d 44 (Mo. 1973) and cases following it, the court held that the time limitation of &sect; 473.083 was precluded by failure to provide the information required by Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 473.017.1(2) that resulted in faulty notice under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 473.033 (1994), as to any heir without knowledge of the administration of the estate while the estate is open. As to the heirs who were without notice, the court overruled the motion to dismiss, reinstated the will contest, and remanded the case for trial.</SPAN></P>

In prior proceedings in this case, the trial court and the court denied appellants relief but The United States Supreme Court ruled that &sect; 144.748 tax discriminated against interstate commerce and was unconstitutional as applied in those localities where the aggregate use tax exceeded the aggregate sales tax. On remand, appellants sought to have &sect; 144.748 declared invalid under state law. Again, the trial court ruled against appellants. The court reversed the decision of the trial court and found that the trial court was not limited to the issue of refunds on remand and could have considered the continuing validity of the tax because mandate of the United States Supreme Court was a general remand for &quot;further proceedings.&quot; The court also found that the tax was invalid in its entirety because the legislative intent had been to create a uniform use tax across the state and the statute, as modified by the Supreme Court, violated that intent.</SPAN></P>

Therefore, the court determined that the city was not required to comply with the statute until the State reimbursed the city for its increased cost.

The court held that (1) as to first class charter counties, Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 138.060.1 (1993) was &quot;open-ended&quot; in that other counties could join the class upon becoming first class counties and adopting a home rule charter, and an open-ended law was not a special law; (2) adding St. Louis City to an otherwise open-ended law did not render it a special law because St. Louis City was sui generis; (3) &sect; 138.060.1 was therefore a general law and required only a rational relation to a legitimate legislative purpose; and (4) the legislature rationally could relate the method of choosing an assessor to the valuation advocated or the evidence presented in tax appeals, and charter counties and St. Louis City could appoint their assessor, while other counties were required to elect their assessor.</SPAN></P>

On review, the doctor argued that the board's procedures denied him due process of law. The court found that the doctor was not entitled to the full protections of procedural due process at the probable cause hearing. The court reasoned that the board did not adjudicate or make binding determinations about the doctor at the hearing and that the hearing was investigative in nature. Therefore, because the board gave the doctor notice of the hearing and allowed him to have his attorney present, the subsequent withholding of information did not violate the due process clause. Finally, the statute authorizing the board to investigate doctors was constitutional because the state had a legitimate interest in protecting its citizens from incompetent doctors.

The sewer district sought review of the order. On appeal, the court reversed in part and affirmed in part the judgment from the trial court. The court held that the plaintiffs did not establish either that the case was a proper case for class certification or that they were proper class representatives pursuant to Mo. R. Civ. P. 52.08.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The former Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 137.016 (1994) was repealed, and a new provision, Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 137.016 (1995), was enacted which broadened the definition of &quot;residential property&quot; for tax purposes. All residential property was taxed as residential, not commercial property, regardless of the number of apartment units. Section 137.016 also authorized taxing districts to adjust their levy to recoup revenue lost as a result of the reclassification. Certain property owners and the condominium corporation that had profited from establishing condominium units for other property owners to lower their tax bracket from commercial to residential challenged the constitutionality of Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 137.016 (1995). The court affirmed the trial court's ruling that the statute was constitutional. The court concluded that &sect; 137.016, which was enacted to be effective August 28, 1995, with the new definition going into effect on January 1, 1995 did not operate retrospectively because neither the corporation nor the property owners had a vested right in paying a certain amount of taxes until September 1995, after the property taxes were assessed and levied.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. &sect; 66.620 (Supp. 1993). The cities filed an action against respondent State of Missouri alleging that the distribution formula was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">County voters approved a ballot proposition authorizing a one percent countywide sales tax for the benefit of incorporated and unincorporated areas of the county. The imposition of the levy voided the sales taxes of all municipalities in the county for the life of the county sales tax under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 66.600 (1978). Prior to the advent of the county sales tax, most Group A municipalities had a city sales tax and most Group B municipalities did not. Group B also included the unincorporated areas of the county. The legislature revised the existing distribution formula by passing a bill that shifted a larger portion of sales tax revenue from Group A to Group B municipalities and to the county. The cities filed an action against the state seeking to declare the distribution formula unconstitutional. The cities appealed the trial court's subsequent decision to uphold the bill. The trial court's judgment was affirmed on appeal. The court noted that the bill did not violate Mo. Const. art. VI, &sect; 8. The court further noted that it was precluded from addressing assertions made for the first time in the cities' reply brief because the State had no opportunity to address the arguments.</SPAN></P>

Because the petition mixed constitutional claims with claims involving construction of the statutes and factual issues and disposition of those questions could make the constitutional issues moot, resort to administrative proceedings was not excused. Appellant did not show irreparable harm meriting injunctive relief and the court held that 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 could not be relied on to impede the administrative proceeding.

The pledge suffered broken ribs, a lacerated kidney, a lacerated liver, and bruises over his upper body, but died of a subdural hematoma to the brain. The court rejected defendant's claim that the hazing statute was vague, holding that &sect; 578.360, which defined hazing to include beating, clearly delineated its reach in words of common understanding. The statute was not overbroad because it did not deter the right of association and the prohibited conduct, the reckless endangerment of the mental or physical health or safety of prospective fraternity members, was not constitutionally protected behavior. Because a rational basis existed for the legislature's failure to include secondary education within its prohibition against hazing, the statute was not impermissibly underinclusive. Finally, the court held that the language of the information against defendant, which tracked the statutory language of &sect; 578.365, was not vague and contained sufficient information to allow defendant to properly prepare for trial.</SPAN></P>

The injured officer was taken to a hospital and received 14 stitches in his forehead. Defendant admitted that he had been drinking beer from 6:00 p.m. to 1:00 a.m., and officers arrested him.

Although notice of the sale was published in a local legal newspaper and written notice was sent to the purchaser, no written notice of the sale was ever sent to the credit union. The trial court granted the credit union's motion for partial summary judgment, holding that the failure to provided written notice of the sale to the credit union was unconstitutional under Mo. Rev.

The purchaser had the full opportunity to contest the constitutional issue at the summary judgment stage, and the trial court had the constitutional issue squarely presented and argued before granting summary judgment. The constitutional issue was not waived. The credit union, as a holder of a publicly recorded deed of trust, was entitled to notice mailed to its last known available address or by personal service.

The motion court overruled defendant's Mo. R. Crim. P. 29.15 motion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found that defendant erroneously assigned error to the motion court's refusal to order relief for acts or omissions which, if erroneous, would constitute simple trial errors subject to review on direct appeal. The court would not address claims of motion court error founded on alleged trial court errors which appellant should have preserved for direct appeal. The court found no merit to defendant's claims of ineffective assistance of counsel. The court additionally determined that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in declining to strike a juror for cause. It was not an abuse of discretion for the trial court to find that defendant's stepsons were competent to testify against him, or to admit into evidence the fact that defendant had sodomized them. The jury found four statutory aggravating circumstances, only one of which was necessary to support the death penalty. Even removing all of the sodomy evidence, there remained an overwhelmingly sufficient legal and factual predicate for the imposition of the death penalty. The court held that the imposition of the death penalty in the case was not excessive or disproportionate.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgments convicting defendant, imposing the death penalty, and denying defendant's motion, were affirmed.</SPAN></P>

The court held that defendant's counsel was ineffective for failing to object to certain aspects of the prosecutor's argument during the sentencing phase. The court further held that the failure to object was prejudicial because there was a reasonable probability that the improper arguments affected the outcome of the penalty phase. The court held that the prosecutor improperly referred to opinion or belief not drawn from the evidence, that he improperly personalized his argument to the jury asking them to put themselves in the victim's place, that he equated the sentencing with self-defense, and that he misstated the law regarding sentencing of murderers.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court held that the city charter allowed review and approval of initiative petitions prior to their circulation only as to form. Furthermore, the determination that a second vote was prohibited was beyond the scope of the review granted to the city clerk and the city counselor by the city charter. In addition, Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 313.812.10 did not preclude a second local option election following a prior affirmative election. Finally, the court determined that the only problem with one of the petitions was that it was not notarized. Because the city could not validly refuse the petition on the proposed substantive issue, only the correctable lack of notarization remained. Accordingly, the petition should have been approved subject to the correction of the minor defect.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant refueling company filed a petition for review of an order of the Administrative Hearing Commission (Missouri) that denied its request for a refund of surcharges paid into an underground storage tank insurance fund under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 319.132.1 (1994).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The refueling company received diesel fuel from barges, pumped the fuel to an aboveground storage tank, and later refueled barges through the same pipelines. The refueling company remitted surcharges to the Department of Revenue pursuant to &sect; 319.132.1 because it was an entity that first received petroleum products. The surcharges were deposited into an underground storage tank insurance fund, which was used to provide money for cleanup of contamination caused by releases from underground storage tanks. Because the refueling company did not have an underground storage tank, it was ineligible to receive benefits from the insurance fund. The court determined that the refueling company was subject to the statute even though it could not participate in the fund because it was an entity that first received petroleum products in the state. However, as applied to the refueling company, the surcharge violated the commerce clause, U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 8. The surcharge was a fee, not a tax. As the refueling company received no benefit from the fund into which the surcharge was deposited, the surcharge was not a fair approximation of the benefit conferred on the refueling company.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The portion of the Commission's order that determined that the refueling company was subject to the statutory surcharge and that respondent Department of Revenue had authority to refund sums improperly paid into the underground storage tank insurance fund was affirmed. The court determined that application of the surcharge to the refueling company was unconstitutional and remanded the case for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The manner of awarding punitive damages based upon aggravating circumstances was challenged. The court found that the trial court's failure to give an instruction to give the necessary guidance to the jury was error and that the error was sufficiently preserved. The employer also argued that it was denied the right to present evidence of its financial status to the jury on the issue of aggravating circumstances. The court found that evidence of financial condition was relevant in a wrongful death action involving damages for aggravating circumstances. The employer also complained that the verdict form was in error and that common sense dictated that the verdict form include a separate line for mitigating circumstances in order to avoid unduly emphasizing consideration of aggravating circumstance damages. However, the court found that the statutory procedure and form instructions relating to punitive damages should be followed whenever a plaintiff desires to submit a claim for aggravating circumstance damages in a wrongful death case.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment for actual damages was affirmed. The judgment as to damages for aggravating circumstances was reversed and the cause remanded for a new trial on that aspect of the case.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that the trial judge abused his discretion in allowing the placement and demonstration of a knife in front of the jury, which knife was not used in the commission of the offense and was unrelated to defendant. In rejecting this argument, the court held that the use of such demonstrative evidence was permissible at trial because it was relevant and probative of a material issue in the case, namely, whether the victim's delay in reporting the offense was related to a perceived threat of harm from defendant. The court further found no constitutional violation in permitting the victim, a minor child, to testify as a competent witness. The court then rejected as meritless defendant's various challenges to the jury instructions, the refusal to grant a mistrial, the trial judge's control over the mode of cross-examination. Finally, the court rejected defendant's challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence. The court found that the victim's testimony, though uncorroborated, was sufficient to sustain defendant's convictions and that the jury, in determining the victim's credibility, properly assessed any contradictions and inconsistencies in her testimony.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant lienholder challenged the judgment of the Circuit Court of Jackson County (Missouri), which denied his claim against the estate of a decedent. The claim, based on a pre-death judgment entered in the lienholder's favor against the decedent, was denied because it was not timely filed in the probate division of the circuit court as required by Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 473.444 (1994).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The lienholder asserted that his claim was not a claim in the ordinary sense because it was based on a judgment and that, as a result, &sect; 473.444 was inapplicable. In affirming, the court held that judgment claims, like that of the lienholder's, entered against a decedent before death were subject to time limitation provisions. Failure to timely file a judgment claim resulted in such claim being barred. The court found that the lienholder's claim that he was delayed in filing his claim by the failure to timely appoint a personal representative was meritless and that the trial court did not err in finding that the statute of limitation in &sect; 473.444 had expired and was not waived by acknowledgment. The court held that the one-year limitation provided for in &sect; 473.444 was neither imprecise nor uncertain and, thus, the void for vagueness doctrine was inapplicable. The court concluded that the lienholder was not denied a reasonable opportunity to present material pertinent to his claim, as the circuit court was under no obligation to permit an amendment of the lienholder's pleading after submission of the case to include new constitutional claims or claims of fraud against new parties.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the circuit court's judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1975, the husband retired as a public school teacher in Illinois, and began receiving a pension from the State of Illinois. Appellants moved to Missouri and included the pension as adjusted gross income on their 1989 joint federal and state tax returns. In 1993, they filed an amended 1989 Missouri income tax return that showed a reduction in adjusted gross income for the pension income. The Director denied their request for a refund of the tax paid. Appellants argued that prior to July 1, 1989, Missouri's taxation scheme discriminated against Missouri residents whose pension income was from another state, in violation of the intergovernmental tax immunity doctrine. The AHC denied the claim, finding that Missouri law provided no applicable exemption or deduction, and concluding that it had no authority to pass on the validity of Missouri's revenue laws. On judicial review, the court affirmed, concluding that the intergovernmental tax immunity doctrine applied only to federal-state relationships, reasoning that because states did not have the ability to affect governmental functions by imposing taxes on other states or citizens, there was no basis to extend the doctrine.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that a mistrial was properly denied by the trial court; the State was unaware until trial of defendant's good-bye letter to the victim's father. On appeal, the court also ruled that defendant's statement to police after probation revocation did not violate the Sixth Amendment; proceedings on the murder charge against him had not begun. Defendant did not unambiguously request a lawyer and he volunteered a statement. The court held that testimony that defendant needed a ride to court was not evidence of other crimes. A judicial ban on a jury instruction that voluntary intoxication was not a defense was prospective and did not apply to defendant's trial. At the penalty phase, evidence that defendant threatened the victim and she was afraid of him was admissible to show the victim's state of mind. Because defendant offered expert evidence about his sexual assaults as a mitigating factor, it was proper for the State to test the validity of the expert's opinion. The decision to present no defense was a strategic one and not the basis for an ineffective assistance claim.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners, a city, its treasurer, revenue commissioner, and finance director, sought review by direct appeal of a decision by the Circuit Court of Jackson County (Missouri), which entered judgment in favor of respondents, various businesses against whom the city imposed a license fee on purchases of natural gas from sources other than the city's exclusive franchisee. The trial court declared the fee invalid and ordered refunds.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Although respondents did not purchase natural gas from the city's franchisee, they contracted with it for the transportation of natural gas to their facilities in the city. The city council passed an ordinance that required the licensing of all commercial users of natural gas who purchased from suppliers other than the city's franchisee and imposed a 10 percent license fee on those commercial users. Respondents paid the license fees under protest prior to filing the suit. Both parties conceded that the license fee was not a sales or use tax. The court held that: (1) because the case involved the construction of revenue laws, the court had exclusive jurisdiction under Mo. Const. art. V, &sect; 3; (2) the ordinance imposed a license fee, not a user fee; (3) because &quot;natural gas consumer&quot; was not &quot;specially named&quot; in the ordinance as taxable in the city's charter, the ordinance violated Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 71.610 (1986); (4) because the exception provided in Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 92.045 (1992) did not exist when the ordinance was enacted, &sect; 92.045 was inapplicable; and (5) taxes imposed by a municipal corporation were not exempt from the tax protest provisions of Mo.

Thus, he did not have standing to assert any Fourth Amendment violation in the police's warrantless entrance into that apartment to arrest him. The court found that all of the evidence was seized under various exceptions to the warrant requirement. In order to ensure their safety, the police had followed defendant's stepson into the upstairs apartment as the stepson got defendant's shoes, coat, and cigarettes. Once legally in the upstairs apartment, the police properly seized the victim's car keys in plain view and the victim's jewelry after the stepson handed it to them. The court found that the police were entitled to ensure their own safety by searching the coat before giving it to defendant; thus, the victim's credit cards were also properly seized.

The board was the recipient of the tax proceeds that would have been collected on the corporation's property. The board contended that the city was collaterally estopped from granting tax relief on the hotel property due to a circuit court decree. The court determined that the board's use of collateral estoppel was nonmutual and offensive because it was not a party or in privity with a party to the prior suit and it was being invoked by a plaintiff rather than a defendant. The court stated that estoppel should not be applied to a government entity. The court held that the board as a stranger to the original suit could not assert collateral estoppel against the city. The board challenged the grant of tax relief because it exceeded a constitutionally mandated 25-year limitation. The court concluded that tax relief was not limited to 25 years where the property had become reblighted.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, who pleaded guilty to transportation of marijuana and was sentenced to imprisonment for 10 years, appealed a decision of the Missouri Court of Appeals, which affirmed the trial court's denial of his motion to reduce his sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At trial, defendant filed a motion to reduce his sentence, arguing that his sentence was contrary to state laws in effect at the time. The trial court denied the motion. On appeal, defendant argued for nunc pro tunc relief under Mo. Sup. Ct. R. 29.12(c). The lower court affirmed the denial of defendant's motion but transferred the case to the court. The court adopted the lower court's opinion and affirmed the denial of defendant's motion. The court noted that defendant correctly pointed out that at the time he was sentenced, the maximum penalty for transporting marijuana was a term of imprisonment for not more than five years. However, the court rejected his argument that his sentence was a clerical error and could be corrected by nunc pro tunc relief, holding that there was no evidence of record that the judgment entered was not in fact the trial court's judgment. The court concluded that, therefore, the trial court did not have the jurisdiction to grant the relief sought under the guise of Rule 29.12. The court further held that defendant's exclusive remedy was post-conviction relief under Mo. Sup. Ct. R. 24.035 but that defendant had failed to avail himself of that remedy.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent was committed to the care, custody, and treatment of the department of mental health after he was found not guilty by reason of mental disease of sodomy, kidnapping, and armed criminal action. The trial court sustained respondent's request for conditional release on the basis that Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 552.040.11 (Supp. 1992) was unconstitutional in light of a recent decision by the U.S. Supreme Court and that respondent was not suffering from a mental disease and would not likely commit another violent crime. The State argued that the trial court erred by finding that &sect; 552.040.11 was unconstitutional because it placed the burden of persuasion upon the person seeking release. The court reversed and remanded, holding that an individual seeking release could constitutionally be required to prove that he was no longer suffering from a mental disease or no longer dangerous to the safety of others. Because the State did not concede that respondent was no longer dangerous, the federal precedent was not applicable.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a portion of the boundary commission law was determined unconstitutional, the city filed new annexation proposals with a county council and respondent election board, bypassing the boundary commission.

The committee, which sought incorporation of a city, a county, and other parties intervened. The court reversed the trial court's judgment declaring portions of the boundary commission law unconstitutional and severing those sections from the remainder of the law. Mo. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The patient contended that Mo. Rev.

Specifically, the patient cited case law, which he alleged was dispositive as to the position that &sect; 552.040.6(6) was unconstitutional. The court held that it was constitutionally permissible for &sect; 552.040.6(6) to place the burden of proof upon the patient. The case that the patient cited was not applicable because, in the case that was cited, the state had already acknowledged that the mental patient at issue no longer suffered from mental disease or defect. Therefore, the presumption of continuing mental illness no longer existed. However, in the patient's case, the state had never acknowledged that the patient was no longer mentally ill. In fact, the state presented evidence and argued to the contrary. Thus, so long as the presumption of continuing mental illness had not been broken following the acquittal by reason of insanity, the burden of proof did not need to shift to the state.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court found defendant to be a persistent DWI offender because the state proved two prior intoxication-related offenses committed within a 10-year period. However, while defendant's appeal was pending, the state supreme court determined that Missouri's persistent DWI offender statute,&nbsp;&sect; 577.023, could only be invoked by proof of three prior convictions committed within a 10-year period. The court affirmed defendant's conviction, but reversed and remanded for resentencing in accordance with the above rule. On remand, the state could attempt to prove a third prior conviction because this would not violate defendant's Fifth Amendment right to be free from double jeopardy. The court reasoned that the Double Jeopardy Clause imposed no absolute prohibition against a harsher sentence on retrial after a defendant had succeeded in having an original conviction set aside. In other words, double jeopardy did not attach to Missouri's noncapital persistent offender sentencing. Moreover, under plain error review, the court held that the state could legitimately argue that the jury should &quot;send a message&quot; that criminal conduct will not be tolerated or should be severely punished.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant state sought review of the decision of the Circuit Court of Wright County (Missouri) that dismissed the charge against defendant of ethnic intimidation in the second degree for the damage to a church by means of burning a wooden cross next to the church's porch, which constituted a class D felony under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 574.093 (1992), on grounds of its unconstitutionality.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court upheld defendant's claim that &sect; 574.093 violated his right to freedom of speech under U.S. Const. amend. I and Mo. Const. art. I, &sect; 8. On appeal, the state contended that a recent United States Supreme Court decision controlled the issue of &sect; 574.093's constitutionality instead of the case upon which defendant relied for dismissal. In reversing the trial court's dismissal, the court concluded that the case cited by the State involved a statute that was more analogous to &sect; 574.093 than the statute that was the subject of the case cited by defendant. Whereas defendant's cited case concerned a Minnesota statute that prohibited expressions, the case cited by the state concerned a Wisconsin statute that enhanced the penalty for certain specified crimes when a defendant intentionally selected the victim based on race, creed, or gender. The Supreme Court noted the difference as the prohibition of content based speech regulation versus laws that considered the actor's motive in determining his punishment, and it approved statutes allowing courts to consider a defendant's racial animosity toward his victim as an aggravating factor for sentencing purposes.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant taxpayer challenged a judgment of the Circuit Court of Cole County (Missouri) which determined that he was not entitled to declaratory judgment against appellees, the state legislature and gaming commission, that Mo. S.B. 10, 11 (1993), which related to the regulation of certain gaming activities, was unconstitutional in violation of Mo. Const. art. III, &sect;&sect; 39(9), 40(28), 40(30).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A taxpayer filed an action for declaratory judgment against the state legislature and gaming commission by which he sought a declaration that Mo. S.B. 10, 11 (1993) (Act), which created a gaming commission to regulate riverboat gambling, was unconstitutional as a violation of Mo. Const. art. III, &sect;&sect; 39(9), 40(28), 40(30). The Act continued special exemptions from licensing requirements for certain stretches of the riverbank and for certain boats, while essentially maintaining a previous act's definition of riverboat gambling games. The circuit court held that the taxpayer was not entitled to declaratory judgment. The court held that certain games that were authorized by the Act were lotteries because they were a form of gambling in which consideration was paid for an opportunity at a prize, where skill was absent or only nominally present; those games were thus prohibited by Mo. Const. art. III, &sect; 39(9). The court held that the Act was a facially special law under Mo. Const. art. III, &sect; 40(30) and that the state legislature should be given an opportunity to demonstrate a substantial justification for the special treatment of certain boats.</SPAN></P>

Defendant pleaded guilty to the two charges and was sentenced to two five-year prison terms, to be served concurrently.

After consulting with his attorney, defendant again pleaded guilty, and the trial court entered the same sentence. The court held that the initial conviction and sentencing remained in effect, that the subsequent proceedings were a nullity, and that defendant did not suffer double jeopardy. Defendant's failure to raise his points on appeal or pursuant to Mo. R. Crim. P. 24.035 precluded review by habeas corpus, as they did not raise a jurisdictional issue or an issue of manifest injustice resulting from rare and extraordinary circumstances and warranting the relief requested. The court did not reach the double jeopardy issues raised because everything that occurred after the first sentencing was a nullity.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Because of an error in reporting the mother's Rh factor blood test, she was not given the necessary medicine after her first pregnancy to prevent multiple irreversible and profound disabilities in plaintiff, her second child. The trial court concluded that there was no cause of action for pre-conception torts in the state. Defendants argued that they had no duty to plaintiff because, among other things, Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 516.105 (1986) established a two-year statute of limitations for negligence and a minor had to be in existence at the time of the negligent act to take advantage of any exceptions. The court held that: (1) it was unjust and arbitrary to deny recovery to plaintiff simply because he had not been conceived at the time of the nurse's negligence; (2) &sect; 516.105 did not begin to run until after a minor became 10 years old; (3) plaintiff was less than 10 years old when the action was filed; and (4) defendants' other issues were not decided by the court because they had not been considered by the trial court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant and his companions decided to rob an elderly couple inside of their home. During the robbery, defendant shot both of the victims. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that given the brutality of the crime and defendant's propensity for violent crime, the sentence was not disproportionate. Prior consistent statements of a witness were properly admitted to rehabilitate the witness's credibility. The court ruled that defendant's arrest was pursuant to a valid arrest warrant and was not pretextual. His waiver of his Miranda rights was proper under the circumstances, so the admission of his statements was not error. The court also determined that the prosecutor's comments were not so inflammatory as to cause prejudice. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in its control of the voir dire of the jury and in its dismissals of jurors for cause. The denial of defendant's motion for continuance was not error. Counsel was not ineffective. Counsel's decision not to call an expert witness did not prejudice defendant, and his failure to raise claims about errors at voir dire and during the prosecutor's closing argument did not cause reversible error.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. &sect; 260.300 et seq. (Supp. 1992) that amended the State's solid waste management requirements.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants sought relief from the trial court's decision granting respondents' summary judgment motion. The court affirmed except concerning one issue, which it reversed and remanded. It found that the statute did not mandate that any city within the State of Missouri become a member of a solid waste management district. Rather, the statute was permissive and allowed cities to join the districts if they chose to do so. Appellants were not impermissibly forced to join in any specific solid waste management program, nor was the fee charged to operate the program an impermissible tax, nor were the charter cities impermissibly denied their powers. While the court did not presume increased costs from mandated activity, appellants did establish a genuine issue of fact that they faced unconstitutionally imposed increased costs in meeting the statutory mandates. Respondents failed to negate the assertion by proof of a grant program that failed to create a statutory obligation to reimburse all of a political subdivision's increased costs in meeting a mandate as required. On this point, the trial court erred in granting summary judgment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The victim brought an action against respondent church under the childhood sexual abuse statute,&nbsp;Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 537.046, and sought recovery for alleged battery, clergy malpractice, and breach of fiduciary duty. The trial court found that the statute violated the Missouri Constitution art. I, &sect; 13, as it attempted to revive causes of action that had lapsed. On review, the court found that the statute could not be interpreted in such a manner that it did not clearly contravene the state constitution. The court noted that Missouri Constitution art. I, &sect; 13, prohibited the enactment of any law that was retrospective in its operation. Once the original statute of limitation expired and barred the plaintiff's action, the defendant acquired a vested right to be free from suit, a right that was substantive in nature. Therefore, Mo.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent state attorney general filed an action against appellants under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 407.100.1, 407.100.6 (1986), seeking an injunction and civil penalties in connection with alleged deceptive solicitations issued by appellants. The trial court imposed fines and enjoined appellants from using certain words in the solicitations. The Circuit Court of Cole County transferred an appeal from that decision to the highest court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants sold business directories. They sent solicitations to potential Missouri customers that appeared to be invoices. The customers eventually realized the solicitations were not invoices and did not purchase the directories. The trial court found that &quot;deception&quot; in advertising existed under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 407.020.1 (1986) because the solicitations had the &quot;capacity to deceive.&quot; The court overturned the trial court. First, a statute pertaining to economic regulation is unconstitutionally vague only if a businessperson of reasonable intelligence would fail to understand the broad nature of the acts the statute prohibits. A statute meets this test if the words used to describe prohibited acts possess a commonly understood meaning. Here, &quot;deception&quot; has a commonly understood meaning to persons of reasonable intelligence. The court held that its use in &sect; 407.020.1 did not violate due process. Nevertheless, it was error to base liability on the solicitations' &quot;capacity to deceive.&quot; When the solicitations were sent, the statute did not incorporate by reference federal law that included acts that had the capacity to deceive. Here, proof of actual deception was required.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court's judgment and remanded the matter for further proceedings. Because the trial court employed an incorrect legal standard in holding as it did, the attorney general would be permitted to put on evidence of actual deception on remand to the extent that such evidence was available.</SPAN></P>

The trial court held that there had been a change of circumstances so substantial and continuing as to make the trial court's prior orders as to child support unreasonable, and ordered the ex-husband to pay for 92 percent of the child's support, which included college expenses.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The ex-husband asserted that the in camera, off-the-record meeting between himself and the trial judge violated Mo. Code Jud. Conduct R. 2, Canons 3A(4) and 3C(1)(a). The court found no merit in his contention. The conference did not violate either of the foregoing rules, and, in any event, it would be for the ex-wife, not the ex-husband, an active party to the conference, to object. The ex-husband contended that the trial court's order of child support modification must be set aside. The court held that while it was true that the child support awarded did exceed the amount set out in the guidelines, that fact alone did not require the trial court's order be set aside. The trial court's finding that the child's reasonable needs were $ 2,260 per month was in substance a specific finding after consideration of all relevant factors that the amount calculated under Form 14 was unjust or inappropriate. Because there was substantial evidence supporting increased child support, and it was not against the weight of the evidence, the court deferred to the decision of the trial court. The evidence pertaining to college expenses was properly admitted and considered.</SPAN></P>

The ex-husband contended that the trial judge had erred in conducting an in camera, off-the-record meeting alone with the ex-husband, in awarding child support greater than the guideline amount, and in awarding attorney fees to the ex-wife.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Challenging child support modification, an ex-husband alleged that his ex-parte communication with the trial judge violated Mo. Code Jud. Conduct R. 2, Canons 3A(4) and 3C(1)(a). The court found no violation and held that only the ex-wife or her attorney could complain of the ex-parte communication. The court held that the trial court had properly determined that there had been a substantial change in circumstances. The parties' child would be attending college. The court held that while it was true that the child support awarded did exceed the amount set out in the guidelines, that fact alone did not require that the trial court's order be set aside. The trial court made specific findings of the child's reasonable needs for a college education. The court held that it was proper for the trial court to defer to the ex-wife's choice of a private school for the child, rather than a less expensive school. The court held that the child support award was not vague for failing to set a termination date because Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 452.340.5 provided the termination date. The court held that the award of attorney fees to the ex-wife was proper because of the ex-husband's discovery misconduct.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The grandparents brought an action against the parents to compel visitation with their grandson. The parents contended that they had a basic constitutional right to raise their children as they saw fit, free from state intrusion absent a showing of harm to the child. The court held that the applicable statutes allowing for grandparent visitation, Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 452.402.1(3), 452.402.2, were constitutional. The court held that even though the parents had a constitutional right to make decisions affecting the family, the magnitude of the infringement by the state was a significant consideration in determining whether a statute would be struck down as unconstitutional. In this case, the statute allowed courts to grant visitation to a grandparent who had been unreasonably denied visitation for more than 90 days if visitation was in the child's best interest. The court held that the statute did not unreasonably intrude on the parents' rights. However, in this case, the visitation ordered was excessive.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the lower court's decision to order grandparent visitation but reversed in part and remanded for a reassessment of visitation as the visitation granted was excessive.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, non-profit corporation and foil corporation, sought a declaratory judgment to find that the flat tax imposed on certain property by Mo. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 144.748 (Supp. 1991) was unconstitutional and sought injunctive relief to enjoin enforcement of the statute. The Circuit Court of Cole County (Missouri) denied both declaratory and injunctive relief. The non-profit corporation and foil corporation sought review of the denial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the court considered whether a state use tax could impose a greater burden than the various sales taxes in specific localities, if on a statewide basis the use tax imposed a lesser overall burden than did all the various sales taxes. The court held that the state use tax at issue was not unconstitutional because the state displayed no purpose to discriminate against interstate commerce and has substantially avoided doing so. In so holding the court applied a &quot;practical analysis&quot; or &quot;practical effect&quot; test to determine that (1) &sect; 144.748 passed scrutiny; (2) the Missouri legislature prudently set the use tax rate at a level that taxed most transactions at a lower rate than the sales tax rate; and (3) on a statewide basis &quot;interstate commerce&quot; was not discriminated against. The court observed that, while the commerce clause protects &quot;interstate commerce,&quot; it did not require identical treatment of all taxpayers. Accordingly, the court did not find any proof of discrimination that could have produced the type of &quot;real injury&quot; required to invalidate a tax.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the judgment denying the City's petition. The court held that the nine officers met the minimal training requirements for their jurisdiction because &sect; 590.115.6 mandated that the Director certify the officers and the Director did not have discretion in deciding whether the officers were certified. However, the court decided that the Director did not have a duty to certify the officers because &sect; 590.115.2 was unconstitutional. The court held that &sect; 590.115.2 was a special law because it relied on the population at a specific time before enactment of the clause.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with one count of assault and one count of armed criminal action.

The court found that the trial court acted properly in sending the matter back to the jury for further consideration, and in so doing did not subject defendant to double jeopardy. The court noted that a verdict was a communication from the jury to the judge. Because the first two verdicts were ambiguous, the court held that the only sure way of determining which verdict was accurate was by allowing the jury to resolve the inconsistency. In so holding, the court overruled State v. Watson, 816 S.W.2d 683 (Mo. App. 1991) and State ex rel. Pruitt v. Adams, 500 S.W.2d 742 (Mo.

The court found that the employee failed to meet her burden, under &sect; 288.050.1, of establishing &quot;good cause&quot; for voluntarily terminating her employment. In so ruling, the court observed that the employee failed to advise the employer of her health concerns, and failed to provide the employer with an opportunity to accommodate her needs. Because the employee failed to establish that the employer's actions generated the need for her to quit, she was not entitled to immediate unemployment compensation benefits. The court also refused to reach the employee's argument that Mo. Rev.

Appellants contended that the St. Louis County Boundary Commission Act, Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 72.400-72.420 (Supp. 1991), was an unconstitutional &quot;special law.&quot;</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondents contended that the taxpayers were procedurally barred from attacking the annexation. Furthermore, respondents asserted that the election was valid under other general annexation laws. The parties agreed that the Act applied only to St. Louis County. Respondents introduced evidence that St. Louis County reasonably needed a boundary commission to administer municipal annexations. The judgment was reversed, the annexation was declared void, and the Act declared unconstitutional. The court rejected respondents' procedural bar arguments. The court found that the Act was not open-ended, and respondents failed to demonstrate a substantial justification for excluding other counties from choosing to have a boundary commission. Thus, there was no substantial justification for the Act and it was unconstitutional. Moreover, the annexation was not valid under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 71.015 or &sect;&sect; 71.860-71.920 (1986 &amp; Supp. 1991) because the sections required a valid election and a declaratory judgment action on the annexation issue. As the acts of the boundary commission were void, the board of elections was without authority to place the issue on the ballot; and the election was void.</SPAN></P>

The circuit court granted the State's motion to dismiss. The memorandum of decision summarily disposed of the motion without stating any findings of fact or conclusions of law, as required by Rule 24.035(i). On appeal, the court reversed the circuit court's decision. Findings and conclusions were not supplied by implication from the circuit court's ruling, which did not adopt the State's motion to dismiss as its findings and conclusions.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants owned mobile home parks, improved with concrete pads to serve as foundations for mobile homes. The parks were assessed as commercial property. The county equalization board, respondent State Tax Commission of Missouri, and the Circuit Court of Jefferson County (Missouri) affirmed the assessment. The issue was whether the properties qualified as residential under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 137.016.1(1) for ad valorem taxation purposes.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owners claimed that Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 137.016.1(1) required classification of its concrete pads as residential, that classification of the parks as commercial violated its right to equal protection, and that classification of the parks as commercial created a subclass of property that violated Mo. Const. art. X, &sect; 4(b). Section 137.016.1(1) defined &quot;residential property&quot; as property improved by a structure that was used for residential living. The court held that the &quot;which&quot; phrase modified &quot;structure.&quot; Real property was, thus, residential only to the extent that it contained a structure. Through its classification, the legislature granted lower taxes to those who constructed residential improvements that were completely ready for dwelling. It was rational to award those who invested in ownership of ready-to-occupy dwellings by permitting a quicker recoupment of investment through a lower ad valorem tax rate. Rental housing had residential and commercial aspects. The legislature had not created an unconstitutional subclass of residential property, but rather determined that the owner's property was commercial and, thus, fell into another constitutionally approved category.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the court found that the trial court committed prejudicial error in allowing the jury to view during its deliberations an exhibit detailing the mother and daughter's assessment of the daughter's damages when the exhibit had not been entered into evidence. The calculations on the chart were not evidence; they were nothing more than the opinions and argument of counsel. However, when the chart was marked as an exhibit and sent to the jury, it carried the imprimatur of the trial court, and the implication that its contents were not mere opinion, but authoritative evidence. Therefore, submission of the exhibit was error. Further, the court found that the trial court erred in denying the employer and the employee leave to amend their answer to allege the comparative fault of the daughter and also erred in refusing to submit a comparative fault instruction on that issue. Because both the damages and the liability components of the daughter's verdict were the result of reversible error, her claims were remanded for new trial. There was no reversible error, however, in the proceedings brought by the mother.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Accordingly, the judgment in favor of the daughter was reversed and the case was remanded for a new trial. The judgment in favor of the mother was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After engaging in fraudulent business acts, defendant was convicted of unlawful merchandising practices in violation of Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 407.020. On appeal, the court affirmed the conviction holding, against defendant's contention, that &sect; 407.020 had not been arbitrarily and discriminatorily enforced against him. The court also held that the settled state of the law concerning fraud provided defendant with notice of the types of fraudulent acts that were punishable under &sect; 407.020. Next, the court held that the term &quot;unfair practices&quot; contained in &sect; 407.020, when read in isolation, was constitutionally insufficient. However, the court held that because it construed the statute as a whole, and in light of the fact that &sect; 407.020 required plaintiff to prove defendant's specific intent, defendant also had notice of the prohibited acts, which constituted unfair practices. Finally, the court held that the lower court had not erred in admitting evidence of defendant's subsequent bad acts for the purpose of proving intent because the other bad acts were similar to and were not too remote in time from the charged acts.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The hospital obtained a variance to erect an outdoor advertising sign in an area that was zoned residential.

The court held that &sect; 226.520(3) did not permit a municipality to authorize a sign in a residential area and to allow the hospital's sign to stand would have been to allow a municipality to permit what state law expressly forbade.

In the alternative the court determined that if read more liberally, a party could elect to proceed before the AHC as an intermediate or additional level of administrative review prior to judicial review and this construction would constitute a violation of Mo.

The assessor contended the tax situs of the aircraft was St. Louis County and, therefore, Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 137.075, 137.095 (1986) allowed property taxes on the aircraft. The court held that the taxpayers' burden was not met. The aircraft made only 13 stops in New Hampshire during the relevant period and the aircraft was present in New Hampshire overnight on only three occasions.

The court affirmed the conviction holding that causing the death of an unborn child was causing the death of a person. Pursuant to Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 1.205 (1986), unborn children had protectable interests in life, health, and well being, and enjoyed all the rights of other persons. Section 1.205 clearly applied to the involuntary manslaughter statute because both statutes were passed in the same legislative session, on the same day, and as part of the same act. Moreover, the two statutes were related because one defined the term &quot;persons&quot; for the other. From the express language of &sect; 1.205.2 and by the fact that the two statutes were enacted in conjunction, defendant was given ample notice that causing the death of an unborn child was proscribed conduct.</SPAN></P>

Honorable David P. Anderson, Judge <BR>Burns v. Labor &amp; Industrial Relations Com., 1992 Mo. App. LEXIS 556 (Mo. Ct. App., Mar. 31, 1992)</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After pleading guilty to six counts of selling amphetamines, defendant filed a pro se motion to vacate the convictions in the Circuit Court of Greene County (Missouri) pursuant to Mo. R. Crim. P. 24.035. The circuit court appointed counsel who filed an amended motion late. The State moved to dismiss both motions. The circuit court dismissed the amended motion, and denied the pro se motion without an evidentiary hearing. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant claimed motion counsel abandoned him by failing to file the amended motion on time, two prior offenses did not support an offender enhancement under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 558.019 (1989), and a fact hearing was required on points raised in his pro se motion. The court affirmed in part and reversed in part. The record clearly showed defendant was not prejudiced by the failure to file the amended motion on time because it did not raise anything beyond the pro se motion except for claims clearly refuted in the record. Defendant alleged that 1960 convictions, on which the enhancement was based, were invalid due to the absence of counsel. Generally, invalid convictions could not be used to enhance punishment and the trial court should have held an evidentiary hearing on that issue. The court did find that the plain language of &sect; 558.019 used the terms &quot;prior offender,&quot; &quot;persistent offender,&quot; and &quot;class X offender&quot; as terms of art and overruled State v. Lucas, 809 S.W.2d 54 (Mo. App. 1991) to the extent its definitions were inconsistent. The other issues raised by defendant in his pro se motion were found to be either not cognizable under a Rule 24.035 motion or unsupported.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the trial court was reversed as to the offender enhancements and remanded to hold an evidentiary hearing on the issue of allegedly invalid prior convictions and was affirmed in all other respects.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The prosecution appealed from a judgment of the Circuit Court of Phelps County (Missouri), which had dismissed all of the counts of an information charging defendant with a conflict of interest under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 105.454, 105.478 (1986) based on defendant's receipt of compensation not covered by any contract covering defendant's work as the school district superintendent.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant had moved to dismiss the information based on arguments that the school district was not a political subdivision under Mo.

Stat. &sect; 105.472 (Supp. 1991). The court found that: (1) it had exclusive jurisdiction because defendant had challenged the validity of the statute; (2) the key question was whether the conflict of interest provisions of Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 105.450 et seq. (1986) applied to school district officials; (3) in fact, the statutes on such districts, Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 162.461, .571, .875 (1986), did not uniformly define such districts as political subdivisions and the implication of the statutes was that unless specifically provided such districts were not political subdivisions; (4) Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 105.454 (1986) had to be strictly construed against the prosecution because the case involved a penal statute; and (5) dismissal on the first ground rendered the arguments about constitutionality and proper procedure moot.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of statutory rape after he had consensual sexual intercourse with a 13 year-old girl. On appeal he contended that &sect; 556.030.3 violated the Equal Protection Clause, the Due Process Clause, and his right to confront a witness against him as guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment. The court affirmed the judgment and held that &sect; 556.030.3 did not violate equal protection because the statute applied to both men and woman and defendant failed to show discriminatory prosecution. The court further determined that the statute was not unconstitutionally vague because it was not so unclear that people of common intelligence had to guess at its meaning and the statute provided sufficient guidance so as to have avoided arbitrary and discriminatory applications. Finally, the court found that the statute did not violate defendant's right to confrontation and cross-examination because the evidence he sought to introduce, the fact that the victim told him that she was over the age of 14 and that she consented, was not relevant.</SPAN></P>

The court held that attorneys for settlement service providers could not represent or furnish legal services to the provider's customers because it was a conflict of interest, although the attorneys could continue to render services to the provider, such as reviewing the legal sufficiency of blank or completed forms for the protection of the provider.</SPAN></P>

A jury found defendant guilty, and the trial court sentenced him to death. defendant's allegations of error attacked every phase of the proceedings in the trial court, and he sought plain error review where the charge of error was not preserved for appellate review. In affirming defendant's conviction, the court held that none of the alleged errors rose to the level of manifest injustice or a miscarriage of justice.

The Missouri Court of Appeals, Eastern District, transferred the case for reexamination of the State of Missouri's exercise of peremptory challenges.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant claimed that he established a prima facie case under Batson and that the trial court failed to require the State to explain its peremptory strikes. Defendant's challenge prior to the venire's being excused was timely. The court remanded to the trial court for a hearing and discussed the development of the law affecting equal protection and peremptory strikes and the confusion over the three-step Batson process. To clarify confusion, the court enunciated anew the procedure to be followed when confronted with a timely Batson objection. Under the procedure, defendant raised a Batson challenge to a specific venireperson struck by the State and identified the cognizable racial group to which the venireperson belonged. Next, the State came forward with a race-neutral explanation. Defendant was then required to show that the State's reasons were merely pretextual. The court found that Missouri's unitary procedure for the vindication of Batson claims was superior to Batson's bifurcated procedure. A prima facie showing requirement was not required under Missouri's procedure. Trial courts were directed to conduct an evidentiary hearing once a Batson challenge was properly raised.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his conviction for first degree murder and death sentence in the Circuit Court of St. Louis City (Missouri) alleging that the state engaged in discovery misconduct when it failed to notify him until the morning of trial of its intention to use two additional witnesses and a piece of evidence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of first degree murder and sentenced to death. The court reversed the conviction finding that defendant was prejudiced by the state's failure to notify him until the morning of trial of two additional witnesses and a piece of evidence. The court found that the state's firearms expert was a key witness whose testimony surprised defendant because he did not have the opportunity to depose him, the eyewitness's coat was material and not newly discovered, and the state's failure to gain possession of it earlier did not justify the failure to inform defendant of the intent to use it at trial. The discovery misconduct should have been sanctioned by granting defendant a continuance or excluding the evidence. Although the court did not determine whether inflammatory statements made by the prosecutor during the penalty phase, referring to defendant as a &quot;serial killer&quot; and a &quot;mass murderer&quot; were prejudicial, it held that the references were error and required the state to avoid them on retrial. The remaining points of error, including challenges to the lack of childcare for venirepersons and the constitutionality of the death penalty, were denied.</SPAN></P>

On retrial the state was not to refer to defendant as a &quot;serial killer.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer constructed two new stores.

The Department calculated the credits based on the amount of the taxpayer's income that was attributed to the two new stores. The taxpayer sought recalculation. The trial court granted the Department's motion for summary judgment. On appeal, the court agreed with the taxpayer that the trial court had misinterpreted Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 135.225(8) (1986). The court stated that &sect; 135.225(8) did not contain the key language &quot;on such taxpayer's new business facility income&quot; which was included in other parts of the statute. The court stated that that absence compelled it to conclude that the credits were not limited to the portion of income tax attributed to the new stores.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff family members filed wrongful death actions against defendants, medical center and nurse. A jury returned verdicts in favor of the nurse and against the medical center. The trial court granted the medical center's motion for JNOV based on a finding of sovereign immunity under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 537.600 (Supp. 1991). The Missouri Court of Appeals, Western District, reversed. The court granted the medical center's application for transfer.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The family members contended that the medical center's negligence in allowing smoking in patient rooms without an approved ashtray resulted in a fire that killed the family members' relatives while the relatives were patients at the medical center. The court held that the medical center was not entitled to sovereign immunity because (1) it was not a municipal corporation; (2) it was incorporated under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 355 (1986) as a private, not-for-profit corporation, and was not clearly a public entity, but was a hybrid entity; and (3) although the medical center's provision of care to indigent residents met the requirement of performing a service traditionally performed by the government, it failed to show that it was controlled by and directly answerable to public officials, public entities, or the public itself. The court also held that the public duty doctrine was inapplicable; there was sufficient evidence to submit the issue of causation to the jury; the trial court did not abuse its discretion with respect to certain evidentiary rulings, including the admission of evidence of a prior smoking-related fire; and interest accrued as of the date the verdict was rendered.</SPAN></P>

The hospital settled prior to completion of the trial and all parties agreed that rather then let the jury apportion the fault the appropriate reduction could be made from the judgment. Both parties appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The child and her parents argued that the provisions of Mo. Rev. Stat. ch. 538 were unconstitutional, that the verdict was erroneous in not finding any past economic losses or any future, pre-age-18 medical expenses, and that the trial court erred in applying the entire settlement with the hospital to reduce the judgment against the doctor. The doctor argued that the verdict was erroneous for finding more future damages then the evidence showed. The court held that (1) chapter 538 was constitutional; (2) because the settlement exceeded the proven damages, any error by the trial court in refusing to order an additur was harmless; (3) the settlement with the parents should not have been credited against the verdict for the child because the parents had a duty to support the child; (4) because the issue of the amount of the settlement attributable to proven past and future pre-age-18 medical expenses was not determined, remand for determination of those amounts was proper; (5) the issue of damages was an issue for the jury to decide; and (6) neither award was sufficiently erroneous to indicate bias on the part of the jury from the admission of wrongfully admitted testimony.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the verdict as to all parties and affirmed the judgment for the parents. The court affirmed in part and reversed in part the judgment awarded to the child.</SPAN></P>

The court held that 1) the challenged provisions did not deny equal protection of law because victims of medical malpractice were not a suspect class, 2) even if the rights to trial by jury, open courts, and certain remedies were fundamental rights, they were not violated because the legislature rationally could have believed that the challenged provisions were related to the goal of preserving adequate, affordable health care for all Missourians, 3) the &quot;open courts&quot; and &quot;certain remedy&quot; provisions of the Missouri Constitution were not violated because Chapter 538 simply modified the common law by limiting the amount of noneconomic damages plaintiffs could recover, which was not a barrier to access to the courts, and 4) the right to trial by jury was not violated because the damage modification was done after the jury had performed its duty.</SPAN></P>

The court held that an exculpatory extrajudicial statement of a witness who had invoked his U.S. Const. amend. V privilege lacked the indicia of reliability for admission and was properly excluded. The court found that extrajudicial statements of defense witnesses were properly admitted as prior inconsistent statements and could be used as substantive evidence without violating defendant's U.S. Const. amend.

The court held that the taxpayers failed to overcome the presumption of constitutionality of Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 143.141.

The court held that &sect; 143.141 and its application to the taxpayers did not offend the underlying rationale of the intergovernmental tax immunity doctrine.

Stat. &sect; 287 (1986), the Commission's jurisdiction to determine whether the injuries were the result of an &quot;accident&quot; was proper because (1) there was no violation of the constitution's open courts provision because judicial review was available, (2) there was no violation of the parents' equal rights because they were not members of a suspect class, and the rule was tailored for efficient administration, (3) the parents had no right to a jury trial while the jurisdiction laid with the Commission, (4) Mo.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The claimant was injured on a flight of stairs and brought a negligence action against multiple defendants, including the builder. While it was alleged that the builder was primarily responsible for the design and construction of the building, the building was completed over 10 years before the injury at issue, and the builder's interest in the company, which built the building, ceased to exist several years before the claimant's injury. Based on the time limitations set forth under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 516.097.1, the trial court dismissed the action against the builder. The claimant challenged that ruling and alleged that &sect; 516.097.1 was unconstitutional. The court found that even after the claimant's injury, the action against the builder could have been timely brought. The fact that the claimant delayed in bringing the action until after the limitation period expired did not make the statute unconstitutional. Certainly dismissal was proper where the claimant, by her suit against the builder, sought to impose liability on a person who had not been associated with the construction company which built the building or with the building itself for over 10 years.</SPAN></P>

In affirming, the court held &sect; 516.097 had neither violated equal protection under Mo. Const. art. I, &sect; 2 nor had it been special legislation under Mo. Const. art.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The district brought an action challenging the validity of &sect; 137.115.1(2), which treated political subdivisions in the City of St. Louis and St. Louis County differently than political subdivisions in other counties of the state for purposes of adjusting an ad valorem tax rate following reassessment. The district asserted that this violated Mo. Const. art. III, &sect; 40(30), prohibiting the General Assembly from passing local or special laws where a general law could be made applicable. The trial court upheld the statute, and the district appealed. The court reversed and held that those portions of Mo. Rev.

The court stated that the exceptions created in &sect; 137.115.1(2) constituted special legislation and that there was no rational basis for the disparate treatment accorded to St. Louis County and the City of St. Louis. The constitutional prohibition of Mo. Const. art. III, &sect; 40(30) was violated by the legislative adoption of a special law where a general law could be applicable.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff taxpayer appealed the decision of the Circuit Court of the City of St. Louis (Missouri), which rendered summary judgment against the taxpayer in his action against defendant, the Collector of Revenue of the City of St. Louis. The taxpayer's action sought a refund under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 139.031.5 of a portion of his 1989 taxes that resulted from a valuation in excess of $ 19,600.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer asserted that the portion of the taxes at issue was mistakenly or erroneously paid within the meaning of &sect; 139.031.5. In affirming, the court held that the Collector properly denied the taxpayer's claim for a refund. The court found that: (1) the laws of the state required a taxpayer to appeal an incorrect assessment and to protest the taxes paid pursuant to a bill based on said incorrect assessment, to preserve the right of the taxpayer to recover the overpayment; (2) an assessment in the subsequent year did not evidence that the assessor incorrectly assessed the property in the previous year; (3) a refund should not issue to the taxpayer. The court concluded that the taxpayer was charged with notice of the increased valuation before the taxes were paid. He had alternative remedies available and chose neither. No portion of the tax paid upon the basis of an alleged overassessment was an illegal tax.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The settlor was a Missouri domiciliary. His will was probated and his estate was administered in Missouri. Aside from the rental of real estate in Missouri, no other business contacts in Missouri occurred. The trustee treated the trust as a resident trust. He filed refund claims and sought to treat the trust as a nonresident trust and to pay taxes limited to income derived from Missouri sources. The trustee argued that, by failing to treat the trust as a nonresident trust, the AHC denied the settlor due process of law. The court affirmed the taxing decision. The court explained that a sufficient connection between the trust and the state was required as a basis for the state's authority to tax. The six points of contact for review were: (1) the domicile of the settlor; (2) the state in which the trust was created; (3) the location of trust property; (4) the domicile of the beneficiaries; (5) the domicile of the trustees; and (6) the location of the administration of the trust. Finding that the first three points were satisfied, the third by the ownership of real estate in Missouri, a sufficient nexus to support the imposition of an income tax on the trust's income was shown.</SPAN></P>

The trial judge ordered the parties to the criminal matter to comply with the discovery requirements of Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 565.005. The prosecuting attorney asserted aggravated circumstances under Mo. Rev.

The trial judge sustained the individual's motion to strike the aggravating factor as unconstitutionally vague. The court made absolute the preliminary rule in prohibition. The court found that the aggravating factor was not unconstitutionally vague. It also found no support for the trial judge's assertion that the pretrial discovery violated due process.

The father was ordered to pay support of the son, but the modified decree was silent as to child support for the daughter. The daughter took up residence with the mother without modification of the decree. The State paid aid to the mother for the support of the daughter and issued a notice and finding of financial responsibility to the father, who requested an administrative hearing. After a telephone hearing, the father challenged the entire scheme of administrative adjudication as contrary to the principles of due process, suggesting that the hearing officer was a subordinate of the executive authority and incapable of acting impartially. The court reversed the trial court. It was unwilling to find that the hearing officer was unable to perform her duties impartially, especially because the father had a right of review. The action was remanded for a determination of whether the State's assessment was proper. However, the failure of the parents to modify the dissolution decree to provide for the actual custody situation did not preclude the division from enforcing its right of recovery.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A victim made a statement to a psychologist documenting defendant's molestation, which was videotaped. The videotape was played at the trial. On appeal, the court agreed with the trial court. Defendant's right to confrontation was not violated by the use of the tape. The fact that the statute required that the child witness be available at trial and the fact that attorneys could not be present during the statement to ask leading questions protected the right to cross-examine a witness. Section 492.304 did not violate defendant's due process rights either. The statute as applied was not unconstitutional, including the fact that the quality of the tape was poor and the fact that the child made statements about a prior molestation and the molestation of her sister. This testimony showed motive of a desire for the victim as well as a common scheme or plan. Due to the number of continuances already granted, it was not an abuse of discretion to deny another. The evidence was sufficient to convict. Counsel was not ineffective since defendant failed to show that counsel's tactics prejudiced him.

The patients challenged the constitutional validity of the &sect; 538.225 on various state constitutional grounds.

The court held that the affidavit provisions did not infringe on the patients' constitutional right to a trial by jury or access to the courts, nor did it violate the principles of separation of power, or deny the patients equal protection because the state in enacting the statute was engaged in a legitimate exercise of its police power that was rationally related to the end sought, which was to ensure the continued integrity of the health care system.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city asserted that the issue was whether the legislature could give the license collector exclusive authority to issue municipal licenses and collect municipal license taxes without violating Mo.

The Constitution contained no prohibition against the legislature assigning a state or county official the responsibility to issue licenses and collect license taxes for a municipality. The office had been determined to be a county office. So long as the license collector performed functions, which were those identified with a county office, and so long as that office was elected in the state election as were other county offices, it remained a county office and subject to legislative control. The conflict between the Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 82.340, &sect; 82.410, and the ordinance adopted June 23, 1989, had to be resolved in favor of the statutes.&nbsp;Mo. Rev.

The court found that the parking company made no claim that it was surprised by the trial court's award of the statutory interest at the six percent rate and gave no explanation why it could not have given some notice, either formal or informal, that it considered the interest rate provided by the statute to be insufficient to provide just compensation, or that it considered the six percent rate to be a denial of equal protection.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayers sought to exclude from their state taxable income the amount received in federal Social Security benefits, but included those benefits in their adjusted gross income for federal income tax purposes. On review, the court affirmed. The court found that the federal constitution permitted the states to maximize income tax revenues so long as its tax levies did not run afoul of federal prohibitions. The court determined that taxation of Social Security benefits by Missouri was permissible because it was not prohibited by federal law. The court determined that the prohibition in 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 407(a) regarding levies did not apply to Missouri's authority to tax Social Security benefits. The court also found that Mo. Const. art X, &sect; 4(d) expressly permitted incorporation of federal law for purposes of Missouri income taxation. The court concluded that Mo. Const. art. X, &sect; 18 was offended only to the extent that total state revenues exceeded the revenue limit imposed by Mo. Const. art. X, &sect; 18(a) and the taxpayers made no such showing.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiffs required that any attorneys' fees defendant received while so employed would be handed over to the organization. Subsequently, defendant won a federal civil rights action and was awarded attorneys' fees. When defendant refused to hand over the fees to plaintiffs, they brought action against him. Both parties filed motions for summary judgment. The trial court denied defendant's motion for summary judgment and granted plaintiffs' motion. On appeal, defendant asserted that he would violate both the ethical prohibition against fee-sharing and Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 484.150.1 (1986) if he handed over the fees at issue. The court found no constitutional authority to strike down the firm policy of the state against fee-splitting. The court also rejected plaintiffs' argument that defendant was contractually bound to return the fees, holding that such an agreement was unenforceable.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed an order of the Court of Jackson County (Missouri), which upon a jury verdict convicted him of the class B felony of sodomy. Defendant specifically challenged the admission into evidence of out-of-court statements of the child-victim pursuant to Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 491.075 (1986), claiming that the statute was facially unconstitutional. The cause was transferred to the court to determine the constitutionality of the statute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court had admitted testimony of a detective regarding statements made by the victim describing the act of sodomy. At trial, the victim testified as to his name and his age, but when questioned further, he cried and covered his eyes with his fists. The trial court excused the victim without any further testimony, and defense counsel did not attempt to cross-examine the child. The court rejected defendant's contention that Mo. Rev. Stat. 491.075 (1986) violated defendant's rights to confrontation, due process, and a fair trial by allowing the testimony of the detective. Although defendant conceded that &sect; 491.075 had been held constitutional on its face, he sought to distinguish that holding because the child in that case testified at trial and was subject to cross-examination, noting that the court in that case had specifically declined to rule on the question of whether the Confrontation Clause might be violated if a child was unavailable as a witness. The court held that the initial inquiry was whether the child was unavailable, and concluded that being reluctant to testify did not meet the definition and was not the equivalent of being unavailable to testify.</SPAN></P>

Prior to the beating, the victims refused to buy alcohol for defendant, who was then 18 years old. The victims, who were still alive after the beatings, died as a result of stab wounds inflicted by defendant. Defendant was arrested, was convicted, and sought review. On appeal, the court upheld the conviction and death sentences. The court rejected defendant's argument that his tape-recorded statement confessing to the murders was improperly admitted into evidence because it was not made after a voluntary, knowing, and intelligent waiver of his constitutional rights as required by Miranda. The court held that the trial court's determination that defendant waived his rights knowingly and intelligently under the totality of the circumstances surrounding his confession was supported by substantial evidence and was not clearly erroneous. The court concluded that that in view of the cruel and brutal nature of the crime, and the fact that the two victims were stabbed repeatedly despite a plea for life by one of them, the punishment imposed was not excessive or disproportionate despite defendant's age and intelligence.</SPAN></P>

The jury convicted defendants. The court affirmed. Section 568.050.1(1) was not unconstitutionally vague. It gave fair notice of the conduct it proscribed. Defendants had failed to demonstrate prejudice that required severance under Mo. R. Crim. P. 24.06. The decision to grant a motion to sever was a matter within the trial court's discretion. Defendants had no absolute right to waive a jury trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant school district sought review of a judgment from the Circuit Court of Lafayette County (Missouri), which found in favor of respondent County commissioners in the school district's action that claimed the proceeds distributed pursuant to the Criminal Forfeiture Act, Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 513.607.1 and .2.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The commissioners distributed the proceeds of money forfeited from vehicles that were involved in transporting drugs to various law enforcement agencies pursuant to the Criminal Forfeiture Act, Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 513.607.1 and .2. The school district brought an action against the commissioners that claimed they were entitled to a portion of the proceeds pursuant to Mo. Const. art. IX, &sect; 7 because any statutory provisions that authorized distributions other than those listed in &sect; 7 was unconstitutional. The trial court denied the school district's claim and found in favor of the commissioners. The court reversed on appeal. The court ruled that &sect; 7 unequivocally made the proceeds of forfeitures collected for any breach of the penal laws of the State available only for school purposes. The court found that although the forfeiture provisions in question were designed to have been remedial and prophylactic in that they deprived drug operations of capital, their underlying purpose was to inhibit further violations of the penal statutes which made the proceeds subject to &sect; 7.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant taxpayers filed a petition for review of a decision of the Administrative Hearing Commission (Missouri), which had upheld a tax assessment of respondent, the Director of Revenue, that had denied the taxpayers' claims for state income tax credits that resulted from filing consolidated state income tax returns.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayers attempted to file consolidated returns and respondent found that they were not qualified to file consolidated returns under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 143.431.3(1), and denied the refund claims. The taxpayers appealed to the Commission claiming that &sect; 143.431.3(1) was unconstitutional. The Commission upheld the denial of the claims without reaching the constitutional issue, and the taxpayers appealed. The court affirmed the Commission's holding, with the exception of an addition to the deficiency, an issue that the court remanded. The court held that &sect; 143.431.3(1) was compatible with both the federal and state constitutions. The taxpayers admitted that the companies were parts of a unitary business. The interest income was thus from a unitary business and could be apportioned under the Multistate Tax Compact. The taxpayers challenged a five percent deficiency, which the Commission failed to address properly. The court required the Commission to address the deficiency on remand.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the administrative order but remanded the case for consideration of the addition to the deficiency assessed against the taxpayers.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee citizen's group filed an action seeking to enjoin appellant Secretary of State of Missouri (secretary of state) from placing an initiative proposal on the November ballot. The Circuit Court of Cole County (Missouri) entered judgment in favor of the citizen's group, and the secretary of state appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The issue before the court was whether the proposed constitutional amendment violated the requirement that an initiative petition contained no more than one subject and matters connected therewith. The secretary of state argued that the trial court had no jurisdiction prior to the election to reach the merits of the claim that the initiative petition contained more than one subject. The court determined that the trial court had the authority to consider prior to the election whether the petition complied with the requirements found in Mo. Const. art. III &sect; 50. The secretary of state contended that the citizen's group remedy was untimely because the pre-election remedy relating to dual subject matter was limited to a proceeding to test the sufficiency of the ballot title. The court held that the claim that the action was untimely was without merit. The court determined also that the claim that the citizen's group lacked standing was without merit.</SPAN></P>
