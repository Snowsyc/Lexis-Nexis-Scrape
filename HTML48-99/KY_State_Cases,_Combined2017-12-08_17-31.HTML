Defendant then appealed on grounds of prosecutorial misconduct. On appeal, the court reversed the conviction and held that a prosecutor could not comment about the possibility of an appeal and could not comment on the consequences of a not guilty by reason of insanity verdict at any time during trial. In addition, the court held that a venireman could not be asked on voir dire whether he would consider imposing the death penalty in the particular case before him.

Defendant contended that its attempts to enforce the Wild Rivers Act, Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 146.210 et seq., did not amount to a taking of property.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Several attempts by defendant Kentucky Department of Natural Resources to prevent plaintiff landowner from making various uses of its land, based on defendant's authority under the Wild Rivers Act (Act), Ky.

Accordingly, the court held that the trial court erred in finding that plaintiff's property had been taken, and reversed the judgment. The court held that defendant's unsuccessful attempts to impede defendant's use of land, and its posting of the land as open to the public, effected no taking of property. Furthermore, the mere passage of the Act was a valid exercise of police power, and any expense or loss defendant incurred thereby was not compensable.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant legislative officials sought review of the judgment from the Franklin Circuit Court (Kentucky), which, based on the action brought by appellees, governor and attorney general, declared a number of statutes, mostly pertaining to powers granted to the Legislative Research Commission (LRC), unconstitutional under the Kentucky Constitution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The General Assembly enacted laws giving new powers to the Legislative Research Commission (LRC). The governor and attorney general brought this action to declare the statutes unconstitutional, which the trial court did. The court affirmed in part and reversed in part. The court declared Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 7.090(1) and 7.100(8)&nbsp;unconstitutional. It purported to create a fourth branch of government and served to keep the General Assembly &quot;in session&quot; following adjournment. Statutes which allowed for legislative or LRC review of proposed regulations violated Ky. Const. &sect;&sect; 27-28 as a legislative encroachment into executive power. Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 13.092(3), which forbade the executive from issuing more regulations if the LRC could not veto them, violated Ky. Const. &sect;&sect; 69 &amp; 81. The statutes which gave the legislature or its officials power over appointments violated the governor's power to make appointments. Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 48.130, which required each branch of government to submit a plan of reduction with its budget, was not unconstitutional.&nbsp;Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 12.028(2), giving the LRC veto power over executive department reorganization, was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed in part and reversed in part. The court held that statutes which usurped or frustrated the executive's constitutional authority were unconstitutional. The Legislative Research Commission (LRC) could not constitutionally serve as a fourth branch of government. Statutes that gave the LRC a purely legislative function that did not involve enacting laws were constitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Movants appealed decisions of the Court of Appeals (Kentucky), which affirmed the decisions of the trial court in each cases to dismiss movants' parentage complaints under Ky.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Movants in each case commenced the proceedings by filing a parentage complaint under Ky. Rev. Stat. &sect; 406.021(1). Each complaint was filed more than three years after the birth of the child. In each case respondent moved to dismiss on the grounds that the action was barred by the three-year statute of limitations, Ky. Rev. Stat. &sect; 406.031. The trial court sustained the motions, which the appellate court affirmed on review. Movants appealed, raising the question of the constitutionality of &sect; 406.031. The court reversed because the limitation on actions to establish paternity was in violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution. The statute did not provide illegitimate children with an adequate opportunity to obtain support, and clearly did not substantially relate to the State's interest in avoiding litigation of stale or fraudulent claims. Therefore, the three-year statute of limitations as set out in &sect; 406.031 failed to afford equal protection to the illegitimate children and was therefore unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court held that Kentucky's adoption of the Uniform Residential Landlord and Tenant Act (URLTA), Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 383.505-383.715 (1974), was unconstitutional, that no implied warranty of habitability was recognized with the Commonwealth, and that the Consumer Protection Act, Ky. Rev.

Const. &sect;&sect; 59-60 and was, therefore, invalid. Further, the court stated that, absent legislation to the contrary, the established doctrine in Kentucky was that the tenant took possession of the premises as he first found them, and the landlord, absent an express covenant to the contrary, had no obligation to repair the premises. No implied warranty of habitability existed under Kentucky Law. The facts indicated that respondent landlord made assurances of repair which were never significantly honored or fulfilled. The court could not hold as a matter of law that such assurances constituted unfair, false, misleading, or deceptive acts declared unlawful under the Consumer Protection Act.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property valuation administrator employed a method of assessment that resulted in farm property being assigned a value based on general averages rather than individual and specific value related to the agricultural purpose for which it was used. The property was not physically inspected, but was compared using contour maps. The administrator relied on the income capacity of the acreage. The farmers filed an action against appellants challenging the assessment method. The circuit court found that the method was unconstitutional under Ky. Const. &sect; 172A because it imposed an unequal tax burden. The circuit court also found that Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 132.010(9), (10) and 132.450(2)(a) were unconstitutional. The court affirmed on appeal. The court held that although the method used was the same method used for all agricultural land in the county, the method was improper because it failed to value the property on the basis of uniform standards and did not result in an effective tax which was equally burdensome on all farmers. However, the court reversed the portion of the judgment requiring proof that the assessments imposed the same tax burden as those imposed in other counties.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the circuit court's judgment determining that the method of assessment for property valuation for agricultural and horticultural land was unconstitutional. However, the court reversed the part of the circuit court's decision requiring proof that the assessments imposed the same tax burden as those imposed in all other counties.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the judgment of the Wolfe County Circuit Court (Kentucky), which convicted him of murder and imposed the death penalty. Defendant, a juvenile at the time of the offense, alleged multiple errors including the juvenile court's decision to try defendant as an adult, Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. ch. 208, and the court's decision regarding defendant's motion for change of venue in order to get a fair trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, 15 years old when charged with the murder of a small child in a particularly heinous manner, was tried as an adult. While it was not wrong to do so, the court held that the lower court committed prejudicial error in the manner in which it conducted the proceeding to transfer him to adult court; the judge had an ex parte conference with prosecutors and police in which the entire case, including all evidence collected, was discussed at great length. Therefore, Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 26A.015(2)(b) required that the judge recuse himself because he had personal knowledge of disputed evidentiary facts. In addition, pretrial publicity was so extreme that the trial court's decision to transfer venue to the immediately adjacent county &quot;lacked substance&quot; and did nothing to insure defendant a fair, impartial trial. While the conviction was set aside on these grounds alone, and remanded for new proceedings beginning with the decision to transfer to adult court, the court addressed at length additional prejudicial, reversible trial errors, such as prosecutorial misconduct and the introduction of polygraph evidence, with the hope that they would not be repeated in a future trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court vacated the conviction in this cause back to the beginning and remanded it to the juvenile court for a de novo determination as to whether defendant's case should be dealt with in juvenile or adult court. In addition, the judge who conducted the original proceeding to transfer to adult court was disqualified and the trial court was directed to consider whether defendant should be committed as mentally ill while his case was pending.</SPAN></P>

He was sentenced to 15 years of imprisonment. Defendant had been previously convicted of four felonies, including first-degree burglary, first-degree bail jumping, storehouse breaking, and possession of burglary tools. Only the previous conviction for bail jumping was utilized for the purpose of creating the offense of carrying a handgun by a convicted felon. The other three convictions were utilized subsequently at the persistent felony stage of the trial. Defendant appealed the convictions to the appellate court, which affirmed. Defendant again appealed, citing numerous errors. In his first assignment of error, defendant complained that his status as a felon was used to create the crime and then used again to enhance his punishment, constituting a violation of his constitutional guarantee against double jeopardy and denying him due process of law. The court affirmed and found all of defendant's allegations of error to be without merit.</SPAN></P>

Further, the county substantially complied with publication requirements, and the property owners had an opportunity to be heard and present their views.

When the bridge was completed, the ferry owner sought to compel the state to follow &sect; 180.276. The trial court concurred with the state's position that it was not required to purchase the ferry under &sect; 180.276 because the ferry owner had allowed his franchise to lapse and thus at the time the bridge was opened for public use, the ferry owner was not in continuous operation for the immediately preceding 15 years. The court reversed. Based on the state's original position that the statute was unconstitutional, the ferry owner was lulled into inaction when the franchise came up for renewal. This failure then worked to ferry owner's detriment when the state relied on the continuous operation requirement of the statute. Accordingly, the court held that the state was equitably estopped from denying the ferry owner the benefit of &sect; 180.276 based on his premature withdrawal from the ferry boat business.</SPAN></P>

H.B. 746, &sect; 1, 2 retroactively. That section provided for a higher rate of contribution by the employer and increased the limit on the employer's contribution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The general assembly amended Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 341.030(6), 341.270, which increased the wage base and tax rate payable by employers for the purpose of unemployment insurance contributions. Due to the insolvency of the Unemployment Insurance Trust Fund the general assembly added an emergency clause that provided that the amendments were to become effective retroactively. Appellees, the attorney general and a general contractor association, filed the action for declaration of rights and injunctive relief. The basis of the lower court's opinion was that the subject legislation impaired the obligation of contracts in violation of Ky. Const. &sect; 19, which prohibited ex post facto laws or any laws that impaired the obligation of contracts. On review the court disagreed. The court held that in order for a law to impair the obligation of a contract, the obligation had to be rendered invalid, had to be released, or had to be extinguished. The court held that it was within the power of the general assembly to levy such unemployment taxes upon employers and a tax assessed by the taxing power of the state did not unconstitutionally impair the obligation of a contract.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The question the court addressed on appeal was the standard of proof necessary to involuntarily terminate the rights of a natural parent to his child. The court granted discretionary review because of a recent United States Supreme Court decision. The statute under which the case was tried did not specify a standard of proof necessary for the involuntary termination of parental rights. Accordingly, the trial court did not address that question in its findings of fact, conclusions of law, nor in its judgment. It indicated that the parent had abandoned and deserted the children and had substantially and continuously repeatedly refused to give parental care and protection for the children. The Supreme Court case held that the state must support its allegations, before the rights of a parent may be severed, by clear and convincing evidence. The court reversed the decision of the court of appeals, and remanded for a new trial in order to use the clear and convincing test as a standard of proof. The court found the current statute,&nbsp;Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 199.603(1) (1978), requiring only a preponderance of the evidence, was unconstitutional as it deprives parents of due process.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The corporation had been purchasing shares of a Kentucky corporation and owned 11 percent. Respondent Director of the Division filed this action alleging a violation of Kentucky's Take-Over Act, Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 292.560, et seq. On appeal, the corporation argued that the act as applied violated the Commerce Clause. The court agreed and reversed that part of the judgment finding a violation of the act and affirmed the order directing divestiture. The court compared the Kentucky Take-Over Act with three provisions of Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 121 1/2, para. 137.51, et seq., which were held preempted by the Williams Act for unduly burdening interstate commerce in violation of the Commerce Clause. The court found the Kentucky Take-Over Act had similar offending provisions. It directly regulated and prevented, unless its terms were satisfied, interstate tendered offers, which in turn generated interstate transactions. Kentucky had no legitimate state interest in protecting shareholders who lived outside the state of Kentucky. The Commerce Clause precluded the application of a state statute to commerce that took place wholly outside of the state's borders.</SPAN></P>

The court rejected appellants' assertion that their right to present certain defenses to the proposed annexation under the old statutory procedure had become vested and could not be eliminated by legislative action. Appellants' rights under the old statute were not vested rights, but were simply a legislative privilege. The court also rejected appellants' proposed definition of &quot;qualified voters&quot; and found that a minimum of 75 percent of qualified voters did not vote against the proposed annexation as required by &sect; 81A.420.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The surcharge was to fund a trust for incentives to municipal firemen and policemen. Ky.

Ky. H.R. 525 &sect; 15 declared an emergency to exist. The lower court found no clear and convincing evidence of unconstitutionality. The court affirmed. The reason stated in the act sufficiently supported the legislative declaration of emergency. Although the court had ultimate authority in determining whether an emergency existed, the legislative judgment had to be accorded the same presumption of validity that it enjoyed in other instances of constitutional inquiry. If there were any rational basis for the declaration, the court should not interfere with the legislative discretion. Utilizing that criterion, the court was unable to say that Ky. H.R. 525 &sect; 15 did not satisfy Ky. Const. &sect; 55.

The court reversed and remanded the trial court's declaration that &sect; 78.428 was unconstitutional. The court held that the subject matter of &sect; 78.428 was constitutional because it dealt with the organization or incidents of government. The establishment and maintenance of a county police force and the subsequent creation of a merit system were clearly governmental activities.

Defendant claimed that the unsigned judgment was improperly admitted and that the trial court erred in refusing her instruction on the presumption of innocence. The court reversed defendant's convictions. The court held that the prior judgment of conviction was ineffective until it was signed, that the omission mandated reversal, that the circuit court improperly attempted to divine the intent of the district court jury, and that the circuit court should have ordered a new trial. The court also held that the evidence was not overwhelming against defendant, that the absence of a presumption of innocence instruction when requested by defendant raised doubt about the fairness of the proceeding, and that upon retrial, the trial court should consider the propriety of the instruction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The homebuyers purchased a new home in 1972 from the builders. It was destroyed by fire in 1978. The buyers brought suit in 1980 against the builders, claiming that the loss of their property resulted from a defect in the electrical wiring system existing at the time they bought the property. The trial court dismissed the action as barred by the statute of limitations set forth in &sect; 413.135, enacted in 1966. The court of appeals reversed, relying largely on a previous case for its conclusion that, as applied to the damage sustained by the buyers, &sect; 413.135 was unconstitutional. On appeal, the court reversed, concluding that the trial court was correct. The court stated that the limitation statute under discussion was enacted in 1966. At that time the law of Kentucky did not provide a cause of action by the vendee of real estate against the vendor on the basis of an implied warranty, as later developed in the case relied on by the court of appeals. Therefore, the court held that there was no constitutional impediment to the statute, and it applied to the buyers' case.</SPAN></P>

Accordingly, the governor sought review, and the court of appeals held the governor's order had come within &sect; 12.025(1)'s authority. However, the court of appeals affirmed the circuit court based on a proviso that had been added to Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 12.020. As a result, the governor sought review, and the court affirmed, holding the circuit court had been correct in determining that Ky. Rev. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The gas company, pursuant to a plan instituted by the Public Service Commission, made improvements to the delivery of the system of providing gas service to a city.

Subsequently, the city enacted ordinances prohibiting the placing of gas meters or appurtenances within 25 feet of a public thoroughfare.The gas company filed suit against the city to enjoin enforcement of the ordinance. The trial court upheld the ordinances but declared the penalty provision unconstitutional. The Court of Appeals affirmed the judgment declaring the ordinance valid, but reversed the penalty portion of the judgment. The gas company appealed and the court reversed. The court found that Ky. Rev. Stat. &sect; 278.040(2) vested jurisdiction over matters of service in the Commission and therefore there was a fundamental conflict between the city ordinance and the regulations promulgated by the Commission and followed by the gas company. The court held that the regulations adopted pursuant to &sect; 278.040 preempted the field and rendering the ordinances invalid.</SPAN></P>

The court held that &sect; 344.230(3)(h) did not unconstitutionally deprive the employer of a jury trial because neither U.S. Const. amend. VII nor Ky. Const. &sect; 7 created such a right, and as the cause of action was statutorily-created, no common-law right of jury trial existed. The court also held that &sect; 344.203(3)(h) did not usurp judicial power as there were sufficient safeguards in the presence of agency regulations, hearing provisions, and judicial review.

Therefore, it held that any evidence flowing from its use was a fruit of the poisonous tree. In reversing the decision of the appellate court and reinstating the judgment of the trial court, the court found that defendant was an adult when the photograph was viewed.

Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 139.980(2) for failure to file tax returns.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer corporation was engaged in highway construction in Kentucky and surrounding states, and the taxpayer partnership was primarily engaged in leasing heavy equipment to the corporation. When the taxpayers challenged the assessment of sales and use tax deficiencies, the trial court affirmed the state board of tax appeals' approval of the assessments. On review of the appellate court's reversal of the penalty for failure to file a return and imposition of a use tax for consumable supplies purchased from an out-of-state vendor, the court held that: (1) the filing penalty was improper where the taxpayers demonstrated reasonable cause in relying on good faith upon the impartial advice of attorneys; (2) the imposition of a sales and use tax on construction equipment that was initially purchased outside of the state but ultimately transferred to Kentucky was constitutionally sound; and (3) the appellate court improperly held that no use tax could be imposed because the statutes and departmental regulations imposed a sales tax on all of the sales of consumable supplies, and no statutory exclusion existed for the imposition of the tax.</SPAN></P>

The court ruled that legislation dealing with the sale of alcohol did not pertain to the organization of the government. Because the legislation was passed merely on the application of one-third of the voters, without any economic issues being considered, the court ruled that the election approving the sale of alcohol in the specified precinct was unconstitutional and invalid.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state revenue department informed the administrator that his real property assessments were only 82 percent of the current fair cash value. The administrator increased the assessments from 1 percent to 400 percent. The taxpayers filed suit. The circuit court awarded judgment to the taxpayers. The administrator appealed, the appellate court affirmed, and the administrator appealed again. The court reversed and found that the lower courts had misconstrued and intermingled the taxation concepts of Ky. Const. &sect;&sect; 171, 172. Section 172 had not required that all the property in the county be assessed for the same amount, only that each parcel be assessed for its fair voluntary sale value. The uniformity was uniformity of assessment standard and not value. Because the constitutional challenge failed, the taxpayers' complaint was left to a claim of excess assessment, which was subject to the administrative remedies of Ky. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 131.120, 131.40. Because the administrative remedies were adequate, the taxpayers were bared from pursuing their claims in the courts until they had exhausted their administrative remedies before the county board of assessment appeals.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Under &sect; 67.045 the vital function of passing upon the proposed redistricting of magisterial districts and, more importantly, establishing new boundaries in the event the proposal was disapproved, was delegated to the district court. When no progress was made with regard to redistricting, a political party filed a petition for mandamus directing the district court to effect a redistricting. The circuit court granted the petition and the district court established the boundaries of the districts pursuant to &sect; 67.045. The individual contested the validity of the redistricting and the circuit court found in favor of the district court. The court reversed the judgment and held that Ky. Const. &sect; 27 forbade one branch of government from performing functions belonging to another and that the fixing of boundaries for electoral purposes was legislative in character. Although a court had authority to review a reapportionment proposal for statutory compliance, &sect; 67.045 provided no criteria whatever for such a review. The power to draw new lines was absolutely non-delegable by statute to a court of law, and for that reason the statute was void.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court's judgment with directions that the redistricting order entered by the district court was to have been set aside as void.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In movants' action against respondent, a department of transportation, a trial court ruled that a 1978 amendment to Ky.

It ruled that the 1978 Act applied only to automobile and truck recyclers. The Court of Appeals (Kentucky) reversed. The court granted discretionary review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The constitutionality of the 1978 Act was challenged. In affirming in part and reversing in part the judgment of the appellate court and remanding the cause to the circuit court, the court found that the 1978 Act was constitutional. The Kentucky General Assembly intended to continue the regulation of traditional &quot;junkyards.&quot; It also intended to add to its statutory regulation all those locations where five or more junked, wrecked or nonoperative automobiles, vehicles, or machines were deposited, parked, placed or otherwise located under Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 177.905(2) (1978). The court disagreed with the appellate court holding that the provisions of the 1978 Act applied lonely to auto and truck recyclers under Ky. Const. &sect; 51. All that was required of the title of an act was to give a general idea of the contents of the act. It did not have to specifically refer to every provision.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court had jurisdiction to hear the auditor's dispute over his authority to audit the KBA on the grounds that the issue presented an actual controversy. Because the KBA was an actual arm of the court itself, it could not be named as defendant in any other court in the state, and the court was the only forum in which the controversy could be heard. The court held that Ky. Const. &sect; 116, as amended in 1975, completely removed any authority over the KBA from the legislative branch to the judicial branch, and rendered any statutes concerning the KBA obsolete. Because the court had control over the KBA, and it was financed through funds that were not received from the legislature, the auditor, who occupied a position created by the legislative branch of state government, did not have authority to audit the KBA. The court noted that the KBA had its financial records regularly audited and that its books and records, with a few exceptions, were open for public inspection. Thus the court did not find a need for the auditor's inspection in addition to the fact that there was no authority for the audit.</SPAN></P>

Photographs that were admitted were not so gruesome or prejudicial as to outweigh their probative value as part of the doctor's description of what he found. Even though the court was not entirely convinced that appellant was entitled to any instruction whatever based on the mitigating theory of emotional disturbance, under the circumstances of the case there was no substantial error in the manner in which it was submitted to the jury.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state enacted the Litter Control Act to consolidate and promote statewide programs for the reduction of litter and to recycle waste materials. To fund the efforts, the legislature determined that part of the cost should be born by those industries reasonably related to the litter problems. The packagers challenged the constitutionality of the Act and the trial court dismissed their complaint. The court reversed, finding that the bill was unconstitutional because it was an appropriation bill and did not receive a majority of the votes of all members of the House of Representatives. The court noted that under the enrolled bill doctrine, it could not look behind the Act to determine if there were any defects because it was enrolled and certified by the appropriate officers. It then overruled prior case law to the extent that there would no longer be a conclusive presumption that an enrolled bill was valid and adopted the extrinsic evidence rule. Under that approach, there was a prima facie presumption that an enrolled bill was valid, but such presumption could be overcome by clear, satisfactory, and convincing evidence establishing that constitutional requirements were not met.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court declared the Litter Control Act to be unconstitutional, reversed the judgment of the trial court granting summary judgment to appellees and dismissing the packagers' complaint challenging the Act's constitutionality, and remanded the cause with directions to enter a summary judgment in favor of the packagers.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The circuit court ruled that Ky. Rev. Stat.

On review, the court was equally divided on the issue and, pursuant to Ky. Sup. Ct. R. 1.020(1)(a), affirmed the judgment of the circuit court without an official opinion. The court framed the issue as to whether the commonwealth or its agents could require the Ten Commandments to be posted on a wall in each public elementary and secondary school classroom. The justices that would uphold the ruling of the circuit court reasoned that the knowledge, understanding, and dissemination of philosophical and ethical ideas, and the exposure of students to the various political, moral, and religious doctrines that are part of our heritage as human beings are certainly necessary and desirable goals in order to educate the young and help them become mature and informed adults. The justices that would overrule the circuit court's judgment held that Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 158.178 gave a preference to a particular creed contrary to Ky.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged a judgment from the Jefferson Circuit Court (Kentucky), which, after a jury trial, convicted defendant of robbery and murder. The jury considered evidence of aggravating and mitigating circumstances and recommended a 20 year sentence for the robbery and death for the murder. The question presented on appeal was whether, statutorily, a death sentence pursuant to the 1976 statute could be imposed for a murder committed in 1975.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was indicted in May 1975 for the February 1975 murder of an armored car driver. He was arraigned in January 1976, but not tried until May 1978 because he escaped twice. In March 1977, the court was required by decisions of the United States Supreme Court to hold that the mandatory death penalty authorized by the state's 1974 statute could not be constitutionally imposed. In 1976 a new death penalty statute was enacted. On appeal, the court reversed, finding that the trial court could not impose the death sentence pursuant to the 1976 statute because it was not retroactive. The court noted that under Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 446.080(3), no statute could be construed to be retroactive unless expressly so declared, and there was nothing in the act of the legislature that even hinted at retroactive application of the 1976 statute. The court held, as a matter of statutory construction, that the death penalty sentence for a capital offense authorized by Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 532.030(1), 532.035 and the method for its imposition under &sect; 532.025 were applicable only to capital offenses committed after the effective date of those statutes, December 22, 1976.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's judgment in part and reversed in part, finding that defendant's sentence to the death penalty was in error and changing defendant's sentence relative to his conviction for murder to a term of life imprisonment. The court remanded the cause to the trial court with directions to sentence defendant to life imprisonment for the murder conviction.</SPAN></P>

Ky. Rev.

On appeal, the court held that the Act would have authorized the city to condemn productive agricultural property for the sole purpose of private industrial or commercial development and that it made no findings nor did it recite goals nor did it express guidelines.

However, he was not in police custody at the time he made the statements. He responded to the sheriff's question of &quot;What happened?&quot; when the sheriff arrived on the scene. The trial court refused to allow defendant to testify about specific incidents of violence committed by the decedent. Proof of the decedent's violent character could only be made through evidence of his general reputation. Ky. Rev.

The court held that the trial court did not err because the prosecution had the right to have cross-examined defendant when he submitted himself by testifying. Defendant next argued that the trial court erred in its jury instructions. The court determined that defendant's use of a pistol in firing a shot into the ceiling was not a separate offense from the first degree robbery charge. Therefore, it was error to have submitted to the jury the charge of wanton endangerment that grew out of the firing of the gun into the ceiling. The court further determined that the jury was sufficiently and properly instructed on the subject of reasonable doubt. Finally, the court held that when an instruction on the presumption of innocence was asked for and denied by the trial court, there was reversible error. Therefore, the court reversed the trial court's judgment and ordered a new trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's first trial ended in a hung jury. At his second trial, the defense learned that the state's main witness had had a robbery conviction vacated during the time between the first and second trial. Though the witness denied making a deal to give testimony against defendant in exchange for the vacation, there was evidence to the contrary. The trial court prohibited defense counsel from cross-examining the witness about the vacation of his conviction. The main claim of defendant in contesting the judgment that convicted him of murder and armed robbery was that the state's failure to disclose the vacation of its witness' conviction deprived him of a fair trial. In reversing the judgment, the court found that the nondisclosure deprived defendant of the opportunity to attack the witness' credibility; moreover, the witness' testimony denying any deal served to bolster his credibility. Reversal was required because there was a reasonable likelihood that the witness' false testimony affected the jury's verdict. The court also noted that in refusing to allow defense counsel to question the witness about the conviction, defendant's right to confrontation was violated.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Each of the four property renters had a leasehold interest in real estate owned by a governmental agency. The property valuation administrator for the county assessed these four leasehold estates for real estate ad valorem tax purposes. In due course the Kentucky Board of Tax Appeals affirmed the assessments, and its action was affirmed by the Boone Circuit Court. The renters appealed, arguing that their leasehold interests were exempt from taxation and secondly that if they were not exempt the taxes were assessed and levied in such a discriminatory fashion as to violate Section 171 of the Kentucky Constitution, Ky. Const. &sect; 171, which provided that taxes shall be uniform upon all property of the same class subject to taxation within the territorial limits of the authority levying the tax. The court affirmed the assessments because the property was not exempt under the constitution. Also, the court dealt with the renters' assertions of discrimination by pointing out that the proper remedy was to assess taxes on the similarly situated property which the administrator had failed to tax.</SPAN></P>

While the case was on appeal, &sect; 391.090(2) was declared unconstitutional. The decedent's father predeceased him. The lower court also contended that the son was not entitled to recover under the anti-lapse statutes because the decedent made a different disposition of the part of his estate that was originally devised to his father. The lower court found the decedent's intention to disinherit the son in the decedent's failure to name him as a devisee in his will when it was written. The court found that the inactions of the decedent could not be used to conclude that the decedent intended to disinherit the son in the event the devise to his father became incapable of taking effect.

R. App. P. 4.000, et seq., which provided that an erroneous decision made in good faith by a judge was not subject to the jurisdiction of the commission.The court found that the judge was unable to claim a lack of notice that his conduct subjected him to review by the commission as the authority to remove members of the judiciary for good cause was not ambiguous to the members of the legal profession. The court vacated the final order of the commission, however, and remanded the cause to the commission for reconsideration in light of Rule 4.020(d)'s promulgation. The court held that the purpose of Rule 4.020(d) was to make explicit that judicial incompetence not gross nor persistent was remedial at the ballot box, rather than action by the commission and that perhaps the case presented such a situation.</SPAN></P>

The court held: (1) defendant was forewarned in specifically specific terms that the depiction in the film of actual sexual conduct under the circumstances presented what was proscribed because it was hard core pornography; (2) Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 436.01 was not unconstitutional under U.S. Const. amend I or U.S. Const. amend XIV; (3) the seizure of the film was lawful because the seizure comported with the protection of the privacy policy enumerated in Ky.

Appellants also claimed that the trial court erred in permitting the testimony of a witness that they claimed was inadmissible hearsay, highly prejudicial, and deprived them of their right of confrontation. The court held that the statement complained of was not hearsay because it was not introduced to prove the truth of its contents.

The court affirmed in part, finding that the operators would have been entitled to injunctive relief if the ordinance was unconstitutional. The operators made no showing that the ordinance discriminated against or benefitted any operator over any other by dividing the districts because the Federal Communications Commission required franchising of the operations. The monopolization of the districts by awarding the franchises to the highest bidders was constitutional because it did not constitute a taking. The operators were not required to sell their equipment to the highest bidder, but the bidder was required to buy it if the operator wanted to sell. The court reversed in part, concluding that there was no rational, legal reason for prohibiting the operators from bidding on franchises in areas other than those in which they operated.</SPAN></P>

The fiscal court contented that they could enforce county ordinances within the boundaries of municipalities. The court held that the overly broad grant of authority would magnify jurisdiction problems. The cities and the resident contented that the Act was unconstitutional. The court held that the overly broad delegation of powers to the fiscal court was a &quot;quit claim deed&quot; to all its powers. The court held the Act was not thoughtful, purposeful, deliberate delegation of a known power.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant teachers, who were over the age of 65, sought review of the decision from the trial court (Kentucky), which granted summary judgment to appellees, a board of education, board members, and board superintendent, in the teachers' action challenging appellees' regulation that teachers were required to retire at the end of the school year in which they reached the age of 65.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the adoption of the challenged regulation, the board of education notified the teachers that they were no longer employed on a continuing service contract but rather on a limited contract. The teachers' contracts were not renewed. The board of education had adopted a policy of not hiring teachers whose status changed from a continuing to a limited contract basis.The teachers filed an action and claimed that the age policy adopted by the board of education was invalid. The trial court's decision to grant summary judgment to appellees was affirmed on appeal.  Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 161.720(4) defined &quot;continuing service contract&quot; as a contract for the employment of a teacher that remained in full force and effect until the teacher reached the age of 65. After age 65 the teachers reverted to a non-tenure status, and employment was at the discretion of the board of education upon a limited contract for one year at a time. Consequently, the teachers' right to tenure under a continuing service contract terminated when they reached 65. The court concluded that the non-renewal of the teachers' limited contracts was permissible.</SPAN></P>

Appeal was not perfected. Two motions under Ky. R. Crim. P. 11.42 were denied. Where a federal court granted a conditional writ of habeas corpus, the trial court (Kentucky) was given an opportunity to grant defendant a belated appeal, which it did.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At trial, defendant's wife testified that after an incident between defendant and her stepson, defendant left the house and did not return until 5:30 the next morning. In the meantime, the stepson had went to bed and was asleep in defendant's bedroom. The wife testified that defendant had been drinking before he returned to the house. Defendant had a shot gun with him. The wife testified that defendant had stated that if the stepson jumped on him again, he would kill him. Then, according to the wife, defendant went into the bedroom where the stepson was sleeping and shot him in the face. Defendant testified that the shooting was accidental. On appeal, defendant asserted, among other things, that the Commonwealth's attorney made improper remarks. The court affirmed, holding that: (1) none of the assertions of error were objected to at the trial or preserved in any manner for review of the issues by the court; (2) there was no merit to defendant's arguments concerning remarks made by the prosecution; (3) the appeal was frivolous without an arguable issue, even had the issues been preserved for review; and (4) the trial court properly refused to give an intoxication instruction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The general assembly enacted a bill relating to health care malpractice insurance claims. In a declaratory judgment subsequently consolidated, various parties challenged the constitutional validity of the act and its provisions. The trial court determined that &sect;&sect; 10(3), (8)(c), and (9) of Kan. Rev. Stat. ch. 304, tit. 10, were unconstitutional, but found the remainder valid. Appeals and cross-appeals followed. In reversing in part, the appellate court concluded that &sect; 9's provision for compulsory malpractice insurance was not a justified exercise of the state's police power, in the absence of which any interference with the natural right of individuals or groups to pursue a legitimate business or profession violated the state constitution. The court affirmed the lower court's determination that portions of &sect; 10 were unconstitutional as arbitrary and conferring special privileges, but deemed the entire section invalid as the remaining portions thereof were dependent upon those invalid provisions.</SPAN></P>

Const. &sect; 117 requiring nonpartisan elections, or it was not a &quot;primary election,&quot; but rather an election, which would have violated Ky.

On appeal, the court reversed, holding that the mere fact that the election was called a &quot;primary election&quot; did not deprive it of its nonpartisan character and was therefore consistent with Ky.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city entered into a contract with a railroad to build coal tipples. Then the city enacted an ordinance, which outlawed coal tipples. The mining company commenced a declaratory judgment regarding the constitutionality of the ordinance. The trial court upheld the ordinance, and the mining company appealed. The court held that a municipality could not prohibit the construction and operation of a coal tipple unless such a drastic measure was necessary for the protection of the health, safety, or general welfare of the people. Coal tipples became nuisances only when they were mismanaged. As such, a coal tipple could only be shut down if it was a nuisance and shutting it down was the only reasonable way of abating the nuisance. Coal tipples might not be appropriate in many areas of a community, but that was a zoning problem, and not an issue regarding the health, safety, or general welfare of the people. The problems that coal tipples created could be solved by a means less drastic than a blanket prohibition of their construction and operation.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from his sentence of the death penalty contending the state mandatory death penalty statute was unconstitutional. The state attorney general conceded the unconstitutionality of Kentucky's mandatory death penalty. The court stated that the United States Constitution was the supreme law of the land and thus, the mandatory death penalty was unconstitutional. The court next determined the punishment to be imposed upon defendant. The jury had chosen to convict defendant of the most serious and aggravated offense and invoked the ultimate punishment of death. It deliberately rejected the opportunity to extend mercy by declining to convict defendant of simple intentional murder or first-degree manslaughter. It was clearly the intention of the jury to impose the maximum punishment legally permissible. Thus, the court imposed the maximum punishment constitutionally permissible under Kentucky's penal code which was life imprisonment.</SPAN></P>

For each of those crimes, defendant received 20 years' imprisonment. Defendant was not sentenced on these convictions On appeal, the court reversed the judgment insofar as it imposed the death penalty, holding that the 1974 mandatory death penalty statute was unconstitutional. The punishment to be imposed on defendant for the conviction of murder was the maximum constitutionally permissible under the 1974 Penal Code, life imprisonment. The court further held that defendant's right to effective assistance of counsel was not violated by the trial court. There was nothing in the record to show a conflict of interest on the part of defendant's trial counsel, or that he failed in any respect in his duty to afford defendant competent representation, although defendant's trial counsel also represented a co-defendant who testified for the Commonwealth pursuant to a guilty plea.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant robbed an elderly woman using a sawed-off, double-barreled shotgun. After being convicted of robbery in the first degree, defendant appealed, urging that the trial court erred by not instructing the jury to find whether the shotgun used during the robbery was a &quot;deadly weapon.&quot; Upon consideration, the court affirmed defendant's conviction, holding that defendant's argument that the trial court should have submitted the question of whether or not a sawed-off, double-barreled shotgun was a deadly weapon stretched the bounds of credulity. At the time of the robbery, the victim had every reason to believe that defendant's shotgun was a deadly weapon. Under prior caselaw, within the context of Ky. Rev. Stat. &sect; 433.140 any object that was intended by its user to convince the victim that it was a pistol or other deadly weapon and did so convince him or her, was one.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a decision from a trial court (Kentucky), which sentenced him to 20 years' imprisonment in accordance with the jury's verdict that found him guilty of being a persistent offender under Ky. Rev. Stat. &sect; 532.080. Defendant was also found guilty of two counts of attempted robbery in violation of Ky. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 506.010, 515.020.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Ky. Rev. Stat. &sect; 532.080 provided for a bifurcated trial for accused persistent offenders. At the first stage of the trial, defendant's guilt for the crime charged was determined. In the second, the State presented evidence of previous convictions for the jury's determination of whether the persistent offender sentence was warranted. At defendant's trial, an eyewitness identified defendant and testified that the prosecutor had shown her his photograph. On appeal, the court held that, even if the eyewitness's in-court identification was improper, it was harmless because the victim had positively identified him. Defendant also had failed to object to the eyewitness identification at trial, and the challenge was not properly preserved for review. Defendant asserted that it was erroneous for the same jury to hear evidence in both stages of the bifurcated trial. The court held that the bifurcated trial cured the defects in the previous procedure that had allowed evidence of prior convictions to be admitted during the guilt phase of the trial. Defendant was not entitled to further constitutional protections.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction and sentence as a persistent offender.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, an unsuccessful candidate, a voter, and the Attorney General, sought review of a trial court (Kentucky), which dismissed an action against appellees, members of city council, to invalidate the election of several members of the city council and to declare their respective offices vacant.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The voter and candidate alleged that the council members were parties to the distribution of sample ballots that did not contain the identity of who paid for the advertisement, a violation of Ky. Rev. Stat. &sect; 121.190(1). Because the constitutional validity of that section was put in issue the Attorney General became an intervening party. The action was dismissed on the ground that the statute at issue violated the First Amendment right of free speech. On review, the court had to reverse. The obvious purpose of &sect; 121.190(1) was to promote honesty and fairness in the conduct of election campaigns. While the right to publish anonymous material might have existed to some degree, it did not seem altogether naive to assume that a fundamental objective of the First Amendment was to obviate the necessity for anonymity. The court did not hesitate when it declared that &sect; 121.190(1) was valid. The court noted that statutes that had been declared unconstitutional in other jurisdictions were aimless in their breadth or were limitless.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In an action brought by appellees, bonding association and bonding companies, the Jefferson Circuit Court (Kentucky) held that H.B. 254, 1976 Gen. Assem., Reg. Sess. (Ky. 1976), as it related to prohibition or abolition of the bail bondsman business, was unconstitutional. Appellants, attorney general and commonwealth attorney, appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following the enactment of H.B. 254, appellees filed suit challenging its constitutionality, claiming that the general assembly did not have the power to abolish an entire business. The trial court held that H.B. 254 was unconstitutional. Appellants sought review. The court reversed the trial court's judgment. The policy of promoting the public welfare was a legislative matter, which called into play the general assembly's police power. Concededly, the business of compensated surety in the bail bond system was subject to reasonable regulation through the police power. Bail bonding by compensated surety never enjoyed a favorable status, but existed because no better system was provided. It did not have protection as an integral part of the judicial process that required the court to invalidate the new system designed to remedy the evils of the existing system and at the same time provide adequate guarantee of pretrial release. The general assembly found the business of commercial bail bonding detrimental to the welfare of citizens. It responded accordingly by enacting H.B. 254. Thus, it violated neither the Fourteenth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution nor Ky. Const. &sect; 1.</SPAN></P>

The sheriff sued the clerk, challenging the constitutionality of &sect; 99. The circuit court entered judgment against the sheriff, denying injunctive relief and dismissing the complaint. The court affirmed. The court held that &sect; 99 was not unconstitutional. The court noted that, even if the sheriff had a fundamental right to run for re-election, the commonwealth did not have the burden of demonstrating a compelling state interest in the enforcement of &sect; 99. The court also held that the provision of &sect; 99 under discussion was not an irrational exclusionary classification, nor was it invidiously selective and discriminatory so as to violate the Fourteenth Amendment.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Part 6, &sect; 12 of the Appropriations Act of 1974 (Act) appropriated surplus funds to a general contingency fund to be allocated upon order of the Governor for specific purposes.

The citizens claimed that the Act unlawfully delegated legislative power to the Governor to expend public funds without any limits as to either dollar amount or program purposes on the basis of estimated revenue and that it was vague, ambiguous, and indefinite. In addition, the citizens claimed that the Governor abused his authority by allocating funds based upon his own priorities. The court rejected the citizens' claims. The court ruled that the trial court's finding that there was no abuse of power in allocating surplus funds by the Governor was supported by the evidence, that the stated purposes for allocation from the contingency fund were manifestly clear and unambiguous, and that the circumstances under which the contingency funds could be used were not of such a degree that they abdicated the Legislature's duty to make appropriations under Ky.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff patient filed suit against defendant charity to recover for the damages he suffered after contracting hepatitis from infected blood. The complaint alleged alternative theories of breach of implied warranty of merchantability and fitness under the Uniform Commercial Code, Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 355.2-314, 355.2-315, and of strict liability in tort. At the conclusion of the patient's opening statement, the trial court granted a directed verdict for the charity. The trial court reasoned that a sale was essential to a cause of action under strict liability or under an implied warranty, and under the broad public policy expressed in Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 139.125, the charity could not be held liable in this sort of situation. The patient appealed, and the appeals court affirmed. The court ruled that the directed verdict was proper because under the stipulated facts there were no methods available at the time by which hepatitis virus could effectively be excluded from blood or the presence of the virus determined. Therefore, to the extent that the blood in this case may have contained hepatitis virus, it was unavoidably unsafe, and therefore not unreasonably dangerous.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appeals court affirmed the directed verdict for the charity because there was no implied representation by the charity that the blood was free of the hepatitis virus.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant police officers sought review of an order of the circuit court (Kentucky), which held constitutional a city ordinance creating a permanent, continuing increase of 35 percent in the pensions of city police officers who became pensioners prior to a certain date. The officers contended that the ordinance was discriminatory, as there was no rational basis for a benefits increase restricted to those who retired prior to the particular date.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court noted that the trial court had found that prior to the date at issue, a limit was placed on the amount of salary upon which pension benefits were calculated which no longer existed, and police officers were not permitted to hold outside jobs and thus unable to obtain Social Security coverage. The trial court also found that since that date, both police salaries and benefits had increased substantially. Finally, the trial court had concluded that the purpose of the ordinance had been to correct obvious inequities between those who retired prior to the date at issue and those who retired afterward. The court agreed with the trial court that the findings fully justified the classification made by the ordinance. The court held that the applicable rule was that if a classification made by the legislature had a reasonable basis the law did not constitute special or local legislation prohibited by Ky. Const. &sect; 59 or deny the equal protection of the United States Constitution.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed that judgment as it applied to municipal workers who were engaged in work of state-wide concern on appeal. The court reasoned that, even if portions of the bill violated Ky.

The court further determined that the act's effect of requiring the municipalities to increase their employees' pay was not an exercise of absolute or arbitrary power over the municipalities under the standards of Ky.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs sued defendant insurance commissioner, challenging the validity of a no-fault automobile insurance statute. After the trial court ruled for defendant, plaintiffs appealed. On appeal, the court stated that, considering the modest extent to which the scope of tort recovery was constricted, the no-fault law gave much more to the many than it took from the few. The court affirmed the judgment for defendant, because the exercise of the option to reject the no-fault insurance did not involve the waiver of a constitutional right. The court modified the judgment to the extent that it resolved issues the parties had no standing to raise. The court noted that the implied consent to the law hinged on the use of the highways.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner was convicted and sentenced, whereupon his counsel, a public defender, promptly filed a notice of appeal and a motion to be permitted to appeal in forma pauperis and a request that the entire record be transcribed and filed as the record on appeal. The trial court sustained the motion, but held a hearing on what portions of the record could be omitted without prejudice to the petitioner. After the hearing, the trial court directed that the voir dire examination of jurors and the opening statements of counsel be omitted from the transcript because there was no assertion that any issue would be raised in the appeal involving any alleged error in the conduct of the voir dire examination of jurors. Petitioner argued that the application of Ky. R. Crim. P. 12.63 operated to deny him due process and also denied him equal protection of the law in contravention of the requirements of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments. The court denied the requested relief and concluded that the trial court properly excluded certain portions of the record because the possibility of reversible error during the voir dire or the opening statement was virtually nonexistent.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was indicted for the offense of armed assault with intent to rob, as denounced by Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 433.150. The first two jury trials resulted in a failure to reach a verdict. During the third trial, counsel for appellant moved to dismiss the indictment and requested a continuance.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant contended that his motion to dismiss should have been sustained because to force him into a third trial, violated his constitutional right of freedom from double jeopardy. In addition, he claimed to have been prejudiced by the trial court's refusal to continue the trial by reason of the absence of a material witness. The court found that appellant could be tried a third time without having his constitutional rights violated because the juries were unable to reach a verdict as to his guilt or innocence. The granting of a continuance on account of absent witnesses rested within the sound discretion of the trial court, and its action would not be disturbed except where it was clearly shown that there had been an abuse of discretion. The court concluded that there had not been a showing that the trial court abused its discretion in denying the continuance, and the trial court was justified in overruling appellant's motion for a continuance.</SPAN></P>

The Attorney General claimed that the statute violated Ky. Const. &sect;&sect; 2, 59 and 60 and the Equal Protection Clause of the U.S. Const. amend. XIV.

The statutes were Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 160.042, 160.044, and parts of 160.160, 160.200, and 160.210.</SPAN></P>

There were concerns around what transitional and permanent structuring of the county board of education shall have followed the merger. The circuit court held unconstitutional, as constituting local and special legislation prohibited by Ky. Const. &sect; 59, certain statutes making special provisions for such structuring where an independent school district embracing a city of the first class merged with the county school district of the county containing that city. The effect of that judgment was the resulting district after the merge, would have been governed by a county board of education which would have consisted initially of the member of the current county board of education. The city board of education appealed. The court reversed the judgment. The basis on which the classification made by the merger statute rested was a reasonable one because the size and population of the city and county had an appreciable relevance to the subject matter of the legislation. Hence, the special legislation did not violate Ky. Const. &sect; 59 because the classification was made upon a reasonable basis.</SPAN></P>

The circuit court's judgment was reversed with direction that the taxpayer's complaint be dismissed. The court held that under Ky. Rev.

The officer had been suspended for violating the statute after he sought such a nomination.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs argued that Ky. Rev. Stat. &sect; 90.220(2) did not prohibit the officer's candidacy. But the court agreed with the circuit court that the statute by necessary implication prohibited a person in the classified service from becoming a candidate for a party nomination for an elective office of the city. The express words of the statute forbade a person in the classified service from making a contribution to a candidate or in any manner being concerned with a candidate, and did not purport to apply only to candidates other than the person himself. The court reasoned that the purpose of the statute to forbid partisan political activity by persons in the classified service would be frustrated if candidacy was not embraced in the prohibition. The court concluded that the implication in &sect; 90.220(2) of the prohibition against candidacy was so obvious that the prohibition could be considered plain and understandable and, therefore, was not unconstitutional in its prohibition.</SPAN></P>

The Commonwealth contended that defendant was charged with the criminal nature of &sect;&sect; 202.267, .269 because they could be found in 1968 Ky. Acts 90. The court affirmed, holding that the trial court properly dismissed the indictment because there was nothing in Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. ch. 202 to indicate that Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 202.267, 269 were penal statutes or that the penalty provision in Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. ch. 201 related to Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 202.267, .269. 1968 Ky.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant City of Nicholasville sought review of a declaratory judgment issued by the circuit court (Kentucky), holding that appellee electric cooperative had the dominant right to continue to provide electric service in the territory annexed by the City, in accordance with Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 96.538.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The City annexed certain property and a dispute arose concerning whether the city's municipal electric plant, or an existing rural electric cooperative would provide service to new businesses and homes to be built in the annexed area. The lower court ruled largely in favor of the cooperative, holding that Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 96.538 gave the cooperative the dominant right to serve existing and new customers in the annexed area that were nearer to its facilities than to those of the City as they existed prior to annexation. The city alleged that the statute was unconstitutional in that it violated Ky. Const. &sect; 163, which prohibited a utility company from running its lines and poles along city streets without the city's consent. The court held that nothing in the Kentucky Constitution guaranteed a city the exclusive right to provide electric service within its territory. Cities' authority to own and operate power plants was statutory, and could be restricted by statute. However, the court held that Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 96.538 and 279.110(5) were unconstitutional to the extent that they purported to give cooperatives the right to install its facilities without the City's consent.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment to the extent that it declared that the City's electric plant could not render service in the annexed area to new customers located nearer the existing facilities of cooperative. In all other respects the judgment was reversed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owner had a number of slum properties and the city had previously effected the destruction of one of the houses of the property owner, which was not appealed.

The property owner sought a review in the trial court and the trial court upheld the determination and ordered the destruction within a certain time, after which the city was authorized to destroy the houses and place a lien upon the real property to recoup its expenses. The property owner challenged the decision and the court reversed and held that the provisions of the Paducah, Ky., Housing Code and Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 80.660, .670 requiring compelled destruction of property when the cost of repair exceeded 50 percent of value were unconstitutional as contravening Ky. Const. &sect; 2.

On appeal, the court found that appellants' plan was pyramid selling and that the motivational tapes served to provide appellants with a transparent claim of legitimacy for a fraudulent enterprise. The court held that the evidence showed that it was impossible for the majority of purchasers to earn a profit and, therefore, that the entire scheme was fraudulent and misleading. The court held that the trial court had jurisdiction because the affairs of the two corporations appeared to be intertwined. The court held that appellants' contentions of unconstitutionality of the sections of the governing statutes did not have an effect upon a judgment that granted an injunction after a trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the Henderson Circuit Court, Kentucky, which was entered after a jury convicted him of the offenses of maliciously shooting and wounding with intent to kill, pursuant to Ky. Rev. Stat. &sect; 435.170, and of the offense of carrying concealed a deadly weapon, a violation of Ky. Rev. Stat. &sect; 435.230. The appeal was from the second trial of the case.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When police officers attempted to serve a warrant on defendant for a parole violation, he took an officer hostage and shot him in the side. Defendant then wounded another police officer and was wounded himself. Defendant argued that both a ballistics report and the clothing worn by the officer he held hostage would have furnished a basis for his defense. The trial court overruled the motion for the clothing after the prosecution claimed that it was lost between trials. On the day of the trial, the prosecution attempted to introduce this clothing and advised the trial court that it had been found the day before. The trial court declined to permit the introduction of the clothing. On appeal, the court found no prejudice to defendant in the trial court's ruling and affirmed the judgment. The court rejected defendant's argument that the jury was biased by a remark made at voir dire. The court also held that the length of delay prior to the second trial did not deny defendant a speedy trial within the meaning of the Constitution. Defendant's argument that he was prejudiced by the delay because of the inability to secure the attendance of certain defense witnesses was without merit.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs brought an action for injuries caused by the negligence of defendants.

The trial court dismissed the complaint as to the unknown defendants. On appeal, the court ruled that the trial court did not err in considering the attorney's affidavits because they supported the motion to dismiss, and the trial court did not err in dismissing the employee's claim against the fellow-employee. The court held that the wife of the employee was not claiming through her husband but had an independent cause of action. The court ruled that the trial court erred in dismissing the action as to the unknown defendants because the warning order attorney said he could make no defense.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The statutes allowed a mosquito control district to be established after qualified voters, equaling 25 percent of the number who voted at the last general election in the county of the proposed district, signed a petition. As a result, a levy of not more than 10 cents on each $ 100 worth of property was assessed for local taxation. The court concluded that an act of the general assembly that provided that a relatively small number of voters could by petition establish a taxing district imposing a tax without the exercise of any discretion on the part of duly constituted local authorities was so repugnant to established constitutional principles as to render the act void. The court also determined that the taxpayers were only entitled to the attorney fee if the taxing district now withheld the funds collected or attempted to divert the funds to other purposes. The court affirmed and concluded that the provisions of Ky. Rev. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The facts showed that the business owner operated a novelty and book store. His main stock consisted of adult books and pictures that had been variously termed to be obscene and pornographic. The city had previously issued him a license to operate the book store, but the license was subsequently revoked pursuant to a city ordinance, and the police arrested a number of his employees on a charge of operating a business without a license. The city proceeded against the business owner under a clause of the ordinance that authorized a cancellation of the license upon specified grounds. The complaint in the case sought equitable relief by restraint against the enforcement of an unconstitutional order based upon unconstitutional acts arising from an unconstitutional ordinance. Upon review, the court affirmed the dismissal of the complaint, holding that the business owner was afforded due process at each step of the proceedings and that in view of the fact that the business owner neither pleaded the ordinance nor filed it as an exhibit, the court was unable to hold the ordinance unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Both appellant citizens and appellee government officials challenged the trial court (Kentucky) judgment, upholding generally a plan to merge all units of city and county government into an urban county form of government in a class action, contesting the plan. Citizens asserted an invalid delegation of legislative power and that the enabling legislation,&nbsp;Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 67A.101-667A.040 was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Citizens, acting in a representative capacity instituted class actions against government officials, challenging the validity of a plan merging all units of city and county government into an urban county form of government and contesting the constitutionality of Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 67A.010-67A.040, the enabling legislation. The trial court upheld the plan generally but invalidated certain provisions, and both sides sought review. The court reversed, in part, ruling that the new form of government authorized by the statute was not a city and thus, Ky. Const. &sect; 160 did not apply to it. The type of legislative body, which would prevail in the new government, was a matter of governmental structure rather than governmental power. The plan was valid because &sect;&sect; 67A.010-040 authorized local determination of the structure of government. The court affirmed the validity of the charter creating service districts and taxing districts and limiting the power of the fiscal court. It reversed holdings as to provisions for disciplinary hearings for police and fire officers and reversed an award of attorney's fees as unauthorized.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The gas company purchased gas from producers in other states and transported it to purchasers in Kentucky. Pursuant to &sect; 160.613, the gas company was assessed a utilities gross receipts tax. When the gas company refused to pay the tax, appellee county boards filed a declaratory judgment action to determine the validity of &sect; 160.613 and to determine if it was applicable to the gas company. The trial court found &sect; 160.613 was constitutional and applicable to the gas company. The gas company appealed, and the court affirmed. Taxation measured by gross receipts was constitutionally proper if it was fairly apportioned. Section 160.613 met this requirement through its inclusion of the phrase &quot;within the county.&quot; Further, the sale and distribution of gas to local consumers by one engaged in interstate commerce was essentially local in aspect and was subject to state regulation without infringement of the Commerce Clause. Taxation of property, shipped interstate, before its movement began or after it ended was not a forbidden regulation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The teachers were not natives of the county, but taught secondary education in the county's schools. The board notified that teachers that they were not to have been reemployed because the board was giving the positions to teachers who were county natives. The board offered the teachers the opportunity to teach in the primary grades. The teachers refused the offer and sought judgment directing their reemployment, along with compensatory and punitive damages. The trial court granted summary judgment to the board. The court reversed the judgment and held that because most of the county school system's funds came from state appropriations, the compelling governmental interest required to have been shown to sustain the classification in question would have to have been a state interest, and the board failed to show a compelling governmental interest by suggesting that natives had demonstrated a greater continuity in employment than non-natives. Such a policy was unconstitutionally discriminatory and preferential, in violation of Ky. Const. &sect;&sect; 1 - 3. Because there was an issue of fact as to the board's policy and whether it had been invoked, the issue was remanded for a trial.</SPAN></P>

On review the court held that the suspension was not arbitrary or capricious. There was no evidence that the hearing officer did not consider all of the evidence, nor was it improper to deny the driver's request to depose the Acting Commissioner of the Department of Public safety; even if such a discovery right existed, there was no evidence that the official had any relevant evidence. Neither was it an error for the arresting officer to certify his affidavit of non-compliance the day after the arrest, nor was it relevant that the driver finally took the test three or four hours after his release from jail.

The Commonwealth contended the 1972 Acts ch. 169, Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 439.265, providing for shock probation was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On December 19, 1972, one defendant was sentenced by the circuit court to a term of one year in the penitentiary, and a second defendant was sentenced to two one-year terms, to run consecutively. On January 19, 1973, each moved for shock probation under &sect; 439.265. The contention of the Commonwealth was that &sect; 439.265 in effect sought to confer on the courts the pardon power, which was exclusively relegated to the executive branch of government, by Ky. Const. &sect; 77. The court denied the petition of the Commonwealth, holding that during the statutory period for which the circuit court retained control over its judgments, the setting aside of a judgment of conviction of crime and the granting probation, was not an invasion of or encroachment upon the executive power of clemency. Section 439.265 was reasonably considered as establishing a period, not unreasonably long, during which the circuit court retained a limited control over its judgment in a criminal case, and that until the expiration of the period allowed for probating the sentence it was not final as regards commitment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant police judge sought review of a judgment from the Harlan County Circuit Court (Kentucky), which enjoined the police court from the exercise of jurisdiction in misdemeanor charges against appellee on the ground that due process and equal protection required that the presiding judge in the trial of any criminal prosecution, whether for a felony or a misdemeanor and whether punishable by imprisonment or only by fine, be a lawyer.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee was charged with violation of the motor vehicle traffic laws, punishable by fine alone, and disorderly conduct, punishable both by fine and by imprisonment up to six months. The trial court enjoined the police court from the exercise of jurisdiction and the police judge sought review. The court held that: (1) pursuant to Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 26.190, the police court judge of a fourth-class city was not required to be a lawyer, whereas, pursuant to Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 26.140, .150, the judge of a police court in a first or second class city was so required; (2) the right to counsel was constitutionally required in an adversary system, but the police court was not an adversary but a tribunal to reach a fair and impartial decision and the fact that the accused required a lawyer to defend him did not mean that he needed to be tried before a lawyer judge; and (4) the distinction in the requirements in the different classes of cities was a classification with a sufficiently reasonable basis.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment with directions that the police judge had jurisdiction to try appellee because the statute that did not require the police judge to be a lawyer did not offend the constitution.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The driver was arrested while he was nearly passed out behind the wheel of his car with the motor running. When the operator of the breathalyzer equipment was unable to obtain a reading, the driver was requested to breathe into the equipment a second time. He refused on the ground that he had already complied with the law. The state agency revoked the driver's license for refusal to submit to the test. At an administrative hearing, the revocation was upheld. On appeal to the circuit court, the revocation was set aside. On appeal by the state agency, the court reversed. The motor vehicle was subject to the driver's control. The arresting officer needed only reasonable grounds to believe that the driver was in actual control of the automobile or that he had been driving it. The driver failed to comply with the requirement of submission to the breathalyzer test, which contemplated that a sufficient sample be given to permit a test to be made and a test result obtained. Although no person could be compelled to testify against himself in a criminal matter, the taking of breath for criminal analysis was a search for evidence rather than a compulsion of testimony.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court appointed attorneys filed an action to enforce awards which had been made to them for the payment of court appointed attorney fees. The circuit court found in favor of the court appointed attorneys. On appeal, the court affirmed in part and reversed in part. The court found that the circuit court was correct in its conclusion that the system that required court appointed attorneys to represent indigent criminal defendants without compensation was flawed. The court determined that during the pendency of the action the legislature had enacted the Kentucky Public Defender Act of 1972, which provided adequate means to correct the problem of uncompensated court appointed attorneys. The court found that, based upon the legal authority in force at the time the judgment was entered, the attorneys were not entitled to a judgment to collect fees because, at that time, they were not entitled to them.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a decision from a trial court (Kentucky), which entered a jury verdict convicting him of assault and battery and imposing a fine of $ 2500. Ky. Rev. Stat. &sect; 431.075 limited the fine in all cases not otherwise covered by statute to $ 5000. Defendant argued that his fine was excessive and violated Ky.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The sole issue on appeal was whether the $ 2500 fine imposed for defendant's assault and battery was so excessive that it violated Ky. Const. &sect; 17 and U.S. Const. amend. 8. The court noted that assault and battery was a common law crime without a specific statutory penalty. Instead, penalties for assault and battery were in a catchall provision, Ky. Rev. Stat. &sect; 431.075, that limited punishments for crimes not otherwise provided for to 12 months in a county jail and a $ 5000 fine. There was no Kentucky case in which a fine approaching $ 2500 had been inflicted for a simple, unaggravated assault and battery. There were no degrees for the crime; however, the penalty had to be proportionate to the offense in light of the circumstances and could in no event be so excessive as to violate the federal and state constitutions. The court held that the fine was not so obviously and flagrantly excessive as to transgress the constitutional inhibitions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The citizens filed their action against defendants, city and its board of commissioners and the county fiscal court, after a commission to devise a comprehensive plan of urban county government had been appointed in the county pursuant to petitions filed in accordance with Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 67A.020. No plan had been submitted by the commission, so the citizens' action did not involve the validity of a particular plan, but only the constitutionality of the statute itself. The citizens first argued that the statute violated Ky. Const. &sect; 59 in confining its application to counties other than ones containing a city of the first class. The court held that there was a rational basis for the exclusion. The citizens also asserted that the statute was a delegation of legislative authority in violation of Ky. Const. &sect; 60 and that &quot;home-rule&quot; government could not have been granted to local political units without express constitutional authorization. The court disagreed and held that it was not convinced that no conceivable plan offered under the statute could have possibly been valid.</SPAN></P>

Defendant argued that the testimony with respect to the test did not comply with the basic requirements and that &sect; 189.520(4)(c) was unconstitutional because it created a presumption of guilt that conflicted with the presumption of innocence granted to all accused of a crime. The court held that it was competent for the legislature to prescribe that a certain state of facts constituted a presumption of the principal fact, and thereby cast the burden of overcoming the presumption on the adverse party. The court found that the presumption did not contravene constitutional provisions. The court, however, reversed the trial court's judgment and granted defendant a new trial because &sect; 189.520(4) established and validated a scientific standard which would have otherwise required expert testimony and the court found that the standard should have been read in connection with testimony concerning the blood-alcohol content.</SPAN></P>

The circuit court held that the order was arbitrary and capricious and the revocation was set aside. The department sought review of the decision. The issue raised was whether there was substantial and competent evidence to support a finding that the driver refused to submit to a blood-alcohol test. The court held that the driver's condition was such that it made it difficult for the officers to obtain his consent or refusal to the test. Further, the court found that the department did not show a positive request and refusal. Reasoning, the court held that a plea of extreme intoxication was not such a condition as to render a person incapable of responding to a definite and positive &quot;request&quot; unless the person was in a complete drunken stupor or &quot;passed out.&quot; As a result of the weakness of the office's testimony, the judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

The subpoena created a continuing obligation on his part to be available as a witness until the case was concluded or until he was dismissed as a witness.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner the City of Lexington, Kentucky, was indicted by a grand jury of Jessamine County with maintaining a common-law nuisance in Jessamine County and with pollution of a creek in that county in violation of Ky. Rev. Stat. &sect; 150.460(1). The City now sought an order of prohibition from the court to enjoin respondent, the judge of the Jessamine Circuit Court (Kentucky), from further proceedings upon the indictment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The pollution was discharged into a stream in Fayette County and carried downstream into Jessamine County, where it created a public nuisance. The court held that the prosecution for maintaining a public nuisance could be brought in the county in which either the nuisance was committed or the inhabitants were aggrieved. The Jessamine Circuit Court was not deprived of jurisdiction in the matter by reason of the enactment of Chapter 224 of the Kentucky Revised Statutes. The court held that whether the action was localized raised the question of venue rather than jurisdiction, and an appeal was an adequate remedy if any error was committed as to venue. The City asserted that the indictment placed it in jeopardy of twice being convicted because it was previously fined by the Kentucky Water Pollution Control Commission and that Ky. Rev. Stat. &sect; 150.460 was unconstitutional and discriminatorily enforced. The court observed that these matters related to whether a court was proceeding erroneously within its jurisdiction, and prohibition would not issue because it was not shown that the City would suffer irreparable injury or that its remedy at law by way of appeal was inadequate.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied the petition for an order of prohibition.</SPAN></P>

The court concluded that the punishment decreed did not bring the contempt within the classification of serious offenses. The trial court could not inflict a fine greater than $ 500 and incarceration for more than six months, except upon the unanimous verdict of a jury finding the offender guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the discrimination involved was invidious and arbitrary and that the statutes were unconstitutional in their application to women under the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment. As long as women were permitted to secure licenses to operate bars and thereby serve as bartenders and waitresses, and so long as women were legally permitted to sit at bars and consume malt beverages which had alcoholic content, there was no rational connection nor a fair and substantial relation between the claimed objective of regulating the sale of liquor or beer and a purely discriminatory provision prohibition non-licensee women bartenders and the consumption at the bar of distilled spirits rather than beer by women.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants' claims of unconstitutionality of the allocation statutes alleged that the citizens of the county paid 20 percent of the total gasoline tax received by the State but the county received only around one percent of the rural and county road fund distribution and that the county had by far the highest number of cars per mile of rural roads but received by far the lowest distribution per vehicle. Appellants contended that the distribution formula was arbitrary, unreasonable, special and local, and denied equal protection of the law. The court held that tax benefits were not required to have been proportioned equally to the tax burden. In fact, the Supreme Court of the United States stated that the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment prohibited a state from apportioning state services according to the past tax contributions of its citizens. The court rejected appellants' contention that the method fixed by the statutes for the improvement and maintenance of rural roads was not a reasonable one for accomplishment of the purpose.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The bar association claimed that the employee, as a lay officer of the bank, was not allowed to prepare real estate mortgages because a bank or trust company acting only in a fiduciary capacity could not draft deeds and mortgages. The employee claimed that he was allowed to perform such duties for the bank because the bank was a party to the transaction. The court held that the preparation of real estate mortgages for a bank by an officer of the bank, whether it was with or without remuneration from the mortgagee to the bank or to the officer, constituted the practice of law. The court overruled Carter v. Trevathan, 309 S.W.2d 746 (Ky. 1958), to the extent that it held that an officer of a corporation could draw a legal instrument on behalf of the corporation. The result did not deny to corporations the equal protection guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment because the effect of denying to a corporation what natural men could do occurred by virtue of the inherent nature of a corporation as an artificial entity. The court did not find the employee in contempt because of the natural misunderstanding attributed to the statement in the overruled case.</SPAN></P>

The Republican candidate intervened, seeking substantially the same relief. The circuit court overruled a motion to dismiss, and the defendants in that action thereupon instituted the instant original proceeding to prohibit the judge from entertaining the action. The court granted the relief sought and directed the judge to dismiss the underlying action because it found no inherent power in the courts to pass upon the validity of elections or to try contested elections. It reasoned that under Ky. Rev. Stat. &sect; 83.060, considered with Ky. Rev.

The trial court held that the juvenile was entitled to bail. On appeal the court reversed, holding that: the right of bail did not extend to juveniles pending determination of proceedings against them in juvenile court because a child held in custody pending determination of proceedings against him in juvenile court was not a &quot;prisoner&quot; within the meaning of Ky. Const. &sect; 16 and the custody was not a deprivation of the juvenile's right of due process, nor any abridgment of privileges and immunities, or denial of equal protection of the law and (2) the provision of Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 208.110 providing that the law relating to bail shall not be applicable to children detained in accordance with &sect;&sect; 208.010-.540 was constitutional because under &sect;&sect; 208.080, .110 there was ample authority in the juvenile court to release a child from detention.</SPAN></P>

The judge argued that the limitation of Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 432.260(1) prohibiting the imposition of fine more than $ 30 for contempt without the intervention of a jury was unconstitutional. The court ruled that it was not necessary to pass on the constitutionality of the statute because the attorney was not guilty of contempt under the circumstances of the case.

The court further found that the evidence was sufficient to support his conviction on the armed robbery charge. The court, however, concluded that the evidence had been insufficient to authorize submission of the motor vehicle charge to the jury because there was no evidence identifying the car used in the bank robbery as the same one that had been reported missing. In addition, the court found that the trial court erred by assuming his previous convictions as proven facts when it admonished the jury not to consider the convictions in determining defendant's guilt or innocence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant asserted that the trial court erroneously refused to suppress evidence obtained pursuant to a search warrant on the basis that the affidavit for the search warrant was defective. In reversing the trial court's judgment of conviction, the court held that the affidavit for a search warrant was defective. Thus, the trial court erred in failing to suppress the evidence obtained in the search of defendant's car. The affidavit contained a bare statement that an anonymous informant, whose averred credibility and reliability were not supported in any way, told of having information that marijuana was located in a certain automobile. The affidavit did not explain how that information was obtained. The report of the informant was corroborated to the extent that the described automobile was found to be parked where he said it was, but that minimal corroboration was insufficient to generate the basis for a finding of probable cause for issuing the search warrant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The driver contended on appeal that the arresting officers failed to make the type of request required by Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 186.565(3), and that the license revocation procedures of &sect; 186.565, imposed for failure to take a blood-alcohol test, violated the due process and equal protection clauses. The department argued that the driver had no &quot;vested property right&quot; in his driver's license. The court affirmed the judgment. The court noted that one officer had asked the driver if he would like to have a blood-alcohol test and both of them had warned him that failure to take the test would result in his license being suspended. The court concluded that there was substantial compliance with &sect; 186.565(3). The court noted that due process requirements had been made applicable to state termination of interests such as that involved in the driver's case. The court held that, balancing the public interest with the entitlement of the individual to operate a motor vehicle and in light of the requirement for an accelerated determination of the claimed violation, the procedure provided in &sect; 186.565 was a valid exercise of the police power.</SPAN></P>

Upon defendant's consent to a search, a canvas bag of marijuana was found in the vehicle.

Stat. Ann. &sect; 218.020 was unconstitutional on the ground that it did not require any criminal intent or knowledge. The court held that, in the area of drug regulation, guilty intent was not necessarily a prerequisite to the imposition of criminal sanctions. Different penalties for the use and for the possession of drugs did not violate the constitutional principle of equal protection. Defendant also claimed multiple trial errors. The court agreed that the commonwealth's attorney attempted to influence the jury that defendant was trafficking in narcotics by bringing the narcotics to the penitentiary. The court agreed that it was a highly inflammatory matter and that defendant was highly prejudiced by the commonwealth's course of conduct in cross-examination. The court held that this was reversible error.</SPAN></P>

Appellee, the Kentucky State Board of Dental Examiners, moved that the trial court under &sect; 313.360(2) to issue a rule against appellant to require him to show cause why he should not be held in contempt for having violated the injunction order. The rule was issued but no response was filed. Appellant, through counsel, admitted he had violated the injunction, however, he defended on technical grounds. The trial court ordered only that appellant execute a bond with sufficient surety in the amount of $ 1,000 running to the benefit of the Commonwealth of Kentucky to insure his compliance with the judgment previously entered. The trial court also ordered that in the event of further violations the bond be forfeited and the surety required to pay it. Appellant made no claim that he was unable to give the bond.

A subsequent adjudication declared that &sect; 138.565(1) was unconstitutional to the extent that it imposed taxes on fuel consumed on highways outside of Kentucky. The circuit court found that the taxpayers were entitled to refunds on the taxes paid and interest. The court affirmed on appeal. The court held that the taxpayers paid taxes under &sect; 138.565(1), which had been declared unconstitutional. Thus, the taxpayers were entitled to a refund. However, they were only entitled to refunds for taxes paid within the two-year statute of limitations.

The board of aldermen refused, and the members of the board of education brought a declaratory judgment action seeking a determination that the Roll-Back law was unconstitutional. The trial court found for the members of the board of education, and the court reversed. The court ruled that the Roll-Back law did not violate Ky. Const. &sect;&sect; 171, 172. The court held that the taxing power of a school district was not frozen because under Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 157.440, a district, by popular vote, could select as high a rate as it chose. Unconstitutional assessments were not perpetuated. The Roll-Back law, which was designed to protect taxpayers from sudden increases in their tax burdens, was not special or local legislation within the prohibition of Ky.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the decision of a trial court (Kentucky), which convicted defendant of the sale and distribution of obscene literature in violation of Ky. Rev. Stat. &sect; 436.101, and fined him. Defendant claimed that the statute was unconstitutional, the material sold was not obscene, and that the trial court had erroneously refused to permit defendant to waive a trial by jury.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was originally indicted on four counts of selling obscene material, but was only convicted of three of the counts that were magazines. Defendant was found not guilty of the indictment count that related to a magazine sold by defendant. Defendant appealed his conviction on three of the counts of selling and distributing obscene material, which was denied by the court. The court held that Ky. Rev. Stat. &sect; 436.101 was constitutional and had not required that the material being distributed be found utterly without redeeming social value as a condition precedent to being determined obscene. The court found that the material contained in the magazines was obscene because its content was consistent with earlier cases that found the depiction of females in various degrees of undress, with a primary emphasis being upon the naked female pubic area. Defendant was properly denied his requested waiver of a jury trial because there was no constitutional right that granted defendant the unqualified right to be tried by a judge without the intervention of a jury. The court stated that defendant had not suffered any prejudice due to having a jury trial, instead of a judge only.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer sought a declaration that &sect;&sect; 216.800 to 216.853 were unconstitutional, and for an injunction prohibiting the authority and corporation from acting on their agreement under the statutes. The attorney general intervened to defend the statutes and to challenge the agreement. The trial court found the statutes to be constitutional and upheld the agreement. On appeal, the court affirmed the ruling that the statutes were constitutional, and otherwise reversed. The court found that the title of 1968 Ky. Acts ch. 132 complied with Ky. Const. &sect; 51 because the &quot;establishment&quot; of the authority reasonably embraced all provisions of the Act. The court ruled that the authority's power to lease facilities to private corporations and its duty to apply a state guarantee fund to the principal and interest on its bonds in case of default did not lend or give the Commonwealth's credit to a private entity contrary to Ky. Const. &sect; 177. The court ruled that the authority and the corporation did not intend their agreement to be final in that it lacked certain details; thus, judicial action was premature because there were no enforceable rights or duties, nor an actual controversy.</SPAN></P>

The lower court concluded that the representative was adequate and that the school district had availed itself of all possible sources of revenue. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that the title of the Act was sufficient to put the members of the General Assembly and the public on notice that a tax might be authorized to finance education. Thus, the Act met the requirements of Ky. Const. &sect; 51. The tax authorized by Ky. Rev. Stat. &sect; 160.613 was for state purposes. Thus, it was not inhibited by Ky. Const. &sect; 181.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The controversy involved the constitutionality of a city ordinance that imposed upon hotel and motel owners, and others similarly engaged, what purported to be a &quot;license&quot; tax. The trial court held the ordinance was unconstitutional. Appellants sought review and the court held that the tax in question purported to levy an additional license tax upon those in the hotel and motel business. It was contended by the taxpayers, and the trial court found, that the tax in question was not truly a license tax but was an excise tax of the kind a city could not levy. The city had, prior to the tax in question, placed all businesses in one classification. Without reclassifying other businesses, it placed hotels and motels in a single special classification. The only justification the court could find for the tax in question and for the singling out of the particular class of taxpayers was that the city was in need of funds and hotels and motels comprised a convenient group to assume additional tax burdens. That was not a legally recognizable basis for classification. It was arbitrary in violation of Ky. Const. &sect; 2 and violated the uniformity principle of Ky. Const. &sect; 171.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After notice of the driver's conviction of driving while under the influence of alcohol in New York was sent to the department, the department suspended the driver's vehicle operator's license for six months pursuant to Ky.

On further review, the court affirmed. The court determined that the driver's vehicle operator's license was an important property right that could not have been suspended without an evidentiary hearing at the administrative level as a matter of due process, that there was no occasion for de novo review by the courts if such an evidentiary hearing was provided, and that the only question for review after an evidentiary hearing was whether the agency's action was arbitrary. The court further ruled that as the department did not afford the driver a due process hearing before suspending his license, the circuit court should have nullified the order of suspension, and the department could not complain that the circuit court reduced the period of suspension.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The seller entered into an agreement to provide the buyer with diesel fuel. The invoices the seller sent to the buyer did not include any tax charges even though Ky. Rev. Stat.

The state assessed and collected from the seller the unpaid taxes. The seller sued the buyer to recover that amount, alleging its belief that the buyer was a licensed dealer from whom it was not required to collect the tax under Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 138.565(a), or actually paying the tax. On appeal, the court held that: (1) while the seller was primarily responsible for the tax, Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 138.565(b) provided that the ultimate burden would pass to the consumer; (2) the buyer could not assert estoppel against the seller's claim when it allowed the seller to mistakenly believe that it was tax-exempt; (3) the seller was entitled to a refund for taxes paid on fuel consumed outside the state under an unconstitutional application of the pre-amendment statute; and (4) further proceedings were necessary to determine the seller's right to further refund.</SPAN></P>

The trial court found that &sect; 81.280 was unconstitutional as an unreasonable and arbitrary violation of the constitutional rights of the municipality under Ky. Const. &sect; 2. The court reversed, finding that &sect; 2, which was a blanket prohibition on the arbitrary exercise of power, did not prohibit the government from using power or making policy choices. The court held that the annexation of property by a municipality was a political act within the exclusive control of the legislature and that the legislature could enact any reasonable statutory procedures necessary.

The trial court properly overruled the motion for directed verdict because the publication demonstrated on its face that it possessed no such redeeming social value. The trial court's determination on that issue was properly made as a matter of law under the circumstances of the case. The trial court was not required to instruct the jury that it must find the matter utterly lacking in redeeming social value as a prerequisite to conviction because there was no factual issue on that score. The court further held that the instruction that required the jury to believe that the defendant had knowledge of the character of the material was as favorable to the defendant on the issue as was required.

The insurer requested a hearing before the commissioner but before notice of hearing was issued the request was withdrawn and the insurer filed a declaratory judgment action in the trial court against the commissioner. The commissioner applied to the court for an order of prohibition directing the trial court not to proceed with the declaratory judgment action, and the court denied the petition. The court found that there was possibly an issue concerning whether the policy had so affected the insurer's method of doing business to bring into application plainly expressed statutory standards. The court held that the trial court had jurisdiction of the declaratory judgment action wherein claims of unconstitutional and arbitrary actions were stated. The court concluded that the doctrine of &quot;primary jurisdiction&quot; recognized that the trial court had subject-matter jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The contemnor was a defendant in the kidnapping action before the court and was dismissed based on the Commonwealth's determination that a case could not have been made against him. After dismissing the contemnor, the Commonwealth called him to testify as to his involvement with the kidnapping, and the contemnor invoked his Fifth Amendment privilege and refused to answer. The court found that the judge did not abuse his discretion in ordering the punishment, dissolved the temporary order of prohibition, and denied the petition for a permanent order. The contemnor was not entitled to invoke the protection of the Fifth Amendment as to the questions propounded to him and properly was held in contempt for his refusal to answer the questions. There was no basis for anticipating that answering the questions might have exposed the contemnor to prosecution for an unrelated offense, and collateral estoppel would have prevented the prosecution of the contemnor for any crime before the court. Finally, the statutory limit of Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 421.140 on the extent of punishment so interfered with judicial power as to be unconstitutional, and the judge properly imposed the $ 500 fine.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a declaratory judgment action, appellant, an individual conducting a bail-bond business in appellee second-class city, appealed from a determination of the circuit court (Kentucky), which sustained the validity of certain portions of a city ordinance that undertook to regulate the bail-bond business carried on within the city.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The declaratory judgment that was the subject of the instant appeal was entered in August 1969. While the appeal was pending and after the briefs were filed, the general assembly enacted Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. ch. 304 which became effective June 18, 1970. By that statute the legislature declared the need for comprehensive regulation of the bail-bond business on a state-wide basis. The state Department of Insurance was delegated the authority to regulate the activity and was authorized to promulgate and enforce regulations consistent with the legislation to effect the legislative purpose. Under the circumstances, the court was persuaded that that change in the legal status of the parties required that it remand the case for a new determination concerning certain aspects of the controversy so that a declaration that actually terminated the dispute could be effected.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">So much of the judgment which declared that the city had a right to regulate the individual's bail-bond business was affirmed. The remaining declarations recited in the judgment which were the subject of the appeal were vacated and set aside. The cause was remanded to the circuit court for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

Appellants contended that the plan could not be considered to be in the furtherance of a public purpose of the city, but rather that it was for the primary benefit of the electric cooperative. The court affirmed the judgment, concluding that the provision for standby or reserve capacity was within the scope of a valid public purpose. The court found that the evidence fully warranted the conclusion that the plan would primarily and not merely incidentally serve the public purposes of the city. The court rejected appellants' contention that the plan violated Ky. Const. &sect;&sect; 164, 179.

On review, defendants argued that they were tried and convicted in a county in which no crime occurred, and therefore the trial court lacked jurisdiction to convicted defendants. The court found that when a crime was committed across county lines, any of the counties in which the crime occurred had jurisdiction, that defendants drove the victim in two counties, that one of those counties was the county in which defendants were convicted, and that the trial court had proper jurisdiction over defendants.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court noted that the statutory plan required the fiscal court of Jefferson County to impose an occupational tax. Section 160.486 provided additional revenue from a local source for certain counties, but the court rejected the claim that the statute was unconstitutional.&nbsp;Ky. Const. &sect; 183 permitted the legislature to provide, by appropriate legislation, for an efficient system of schools in the state. That the legislation had to be appropriate was the only limitation. The court ruled that there were no guarantees that individual school districts, which were agencies of the state, had to be treated as autonomous fiefdoms for all purposes, particularly in light of the constitutional provision for statewide education. The tax imposed was only used for school purposes within the county. The subject was a local one with statewide concern, and the county was authorized to levy the tax in question. The legislature had the constitutional power to determine the manner of distributing tax proceeds to the county on the basis that it deemed appropriate. The court ruled that &sect; 160.486 was valid and did not contravene the express will of the people that was contained in the state constitution.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant former judge challenged the judgment of a trial court (Kentucky), in which the chancellor held unconstitutional&nbsp;Ky. Rev. Stat. &sect; 21.150 to 21.510, under which the judge sought to compel the payment of retirement benefits, as violative of Ky. Const. &sect; 3.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">During the judge's service as a circuit judge from 1940 until 1952, there was no retirement or pension plan in effect. In 1954 a plan was enacted and in 1968, Ky. Rev. Stat. &sect; 21.365(3) provided a retirement allowance for each circuit judge in office in 1951, who had completed 10 or more years of service at that time. However, the chancellor held that &sect; 21.365(3) constituted a grant of public emolument in violation of Ky. Const. &sect; 3, which barred grants of exclusive, separate public emoluments or privileges to any man or set of men, except in consideration of public service. On appeal, the judge contended that circuit judges performed public services. Finding that the justification for the provision of pensions was as inducement to competent persons to enter and to remain in public service and to encourage the retirement of those who became incapacitated, the court sustained the chancellor's ruling. In so doing, the court held that no such purpose could be served by the payment of a pension to one who was not induced to enter or remain in public service, or who was not induced to retire by reason of such plan. Such compensation constituted a gratuity, which violated &sect; 3.</SPAN></P>

Certain single-family residence owners appealed the decision, contending that the rezoning decision was arbitrary and constituted impermissible &quot;spot&quot; zoning. They also protested the planned construction of a separate parking garage as an accessory use to the apartment building. The court affirmed the circuit court's judgment, finding that the evidence fully warranted the finding of the zoning authorities that there had been major changes in the area justifying the change in the zoning map and that the change did not constitute &quot;spot&quot; zoning, even if other sites might have been chosen for the construction. Moreover, parking space was certainly an accessory use under Ky. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The pension board paid the widow a pension of $ 30 per month for about a year. The widow sued the pension board, contending that under Ky. Rev. Stat. &sect; 95.773 she was entitled to a pension of $ 175 per month. The pension board argued that &sect; 95.773 was unconstitutional. Thereafter, the trial court held that &sect; 95.773 was valid and entered a judgment declaring that the pension board should pay the widow $ 175 per month from the husband's date of death until the date of the judgment. The pension board appealed, but subsequently entered into a settlement agreement with the widow. The pension board agreed to drop its appeal in return for the widow to accept a pension of $ 90 per month. The settlement agreement was never entered in the trial court. Thereafter, the widow filed a motion for an order requiring the pension board to pay her the sum of $ 175 per month as previously ordered and to pay an alleged deficiency in the previous payments. The pension board responded setting forth the terms of the settlement agreement. The trial court awarded the widow $ 175 per month. In reversing, the court found that the widow was bound by the terms of the valid satisfaction of the original judgment.</SPAN></P>

The Commonwealth of Kentucky, Kentucky Board of Revenue, and the Kentucky Board of Tax Appeals sought review. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that the tax imposed a special burden on the carrier of freight for the use of fuel in its operations on highways in other states. Therefore, the court reasoned that Ky. Rev. Stat. &sect; 138.656(1) violated the interstate commerce clause of U.S. Const. art. 1, &sect; 8.

The county board contended that the hearings were judicial and that procedural due process was required. The court concluded that the hearings were to enable the commissioner to obtain pertinent information, not to preside over a justiciable controversy, and that the conduct of the hearing was to have been left largely to the discretion of the commissioner. The court affirmed, in part, the judgment of the trial court that the finding of the county board was not supported by the evidence, but reversed, in part, the judgment of the trial court holding that &sect; 337.522 was unconstitutional.

The court noted that such regulations were adopted pursuant to enabling legislation, as permitted under the Ky. Const. &sect;&sect; 27, 28. The court found that there were sufficient safeguards in the regulations to protect the public and to afford those affected by the code with &quot;due process of law.&quot; The court held that there was no violation of federal or state constitutional provisions, including Ky.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant city sought review of a judgment of the Mercer Circuit Court (Kentucky), which dismissed a prosecution against appellee railway company for violation of a city ordinance prohibiting the blocking of a street crossing by a train for more than five minutes. The judgment was based on the circuit court's opinion that the ordinance was unconstitutional as imposing an unreasonable burden on interstate commerce.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The moving train's length and speed caused it to block a street crossing for over 12 minutes in violation of the five-minutes permitted by the Harrodsburg, Ky., Ordinance 91.719 (Sept. 20, 1966) (reenacted January 31, 1967). The train was involved in interstate commerce. The sole contention in the case was that the ordinance placed an unreasonable burden on interstate commerce. After reviewing the decisions of other jurisdictions, the court concluded that the question of whether an unreasonable burden was imposed depended upon the relative weights of the state and national interests as based upon the evidence. The court observed that the blocking of the main streets for long periods of time could create a very serious safety problem as well as materially impede the flow of interstate highway traffic. The weight of the local interest was apparent, from common knowledge and experience. On the other hand, there was no basis in common knowledge or experience alone on which to rest a finding that to require trains to clear the city street crossings in five minutes would seriously burden interstate commerce. Therefore, the trial court erred in dismissing the prosecution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment of the circuit court with direction that the circuit court enter judgment upon the stipulation to which the case was submitted.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The milk producers brought an action for a declaration that the act was unconstitutional and for an injunction to prevent the commission from enforcing regulations thereunder. The court reversed the decision holding the act unconstitutional and found that the act did not contain unreasonable classifications or constitute special legislation so as to make it void under Ky. Const. &sect; 59. The act was not void for vagueness and it did not involve the unconstitutional delegation of legislative and judicial powers to the commission. The circuit court erred by holding that Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 260.705(1) was vague because its provision prohibiting engagement in any marketing practice established to be unreasonable by the commission referred to practices that the commission would have identified before the occurrence of an act that was prohibited under the act. Because the act provided for procedural safeguards, including the right to appeal the commission's decisions, there was not an unconstitutional delegation of legislative and judicial power. The mere fact that there were persons in private business on commission did not constitute a violation of due process.</SPAN></P>

The court held that a candidate for judicial office could be nominated for a position on the ballot by petition as well as by the nominating processes permitted for major and minor political parties. It further held that &sect; 118.173 was constitutional as it afforded each voter a free and equal opportunity to cast his or her ballot. The court found that the petition filed by the candidate complied with the requirements of Ky. Rev. Stat. &sect; 118.080 and that it did not purport to comply with any other procedure for nomination. It held that the party under which the candidate was nominated did not exist and thus, he had to be designated on the ballot as an independent as opposed to the party under which he claimed to be nominated.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1989, the legislature passed the act, which authorized counties and or cities to establish commissions to promote convention and tourist activity. The commissions were authorized to impose a transient room tax to provide funds. Pursuant to the act, the county passed a resolution and order to establish a commission and imposed a two percent tax on the room rent, as authorized by Ky. Rev. Stat. &sect; 83.350. A transient room was defined by the county as one occupied by a guest for a consecutive period of 30 days or less. The hotel operator filed suit against the county's taxing authorities and maintained that the act was unconstitutional. The chancery court upheld the constitutionality of the act and the orders and regulations adopted in conformity with the act. On appeal, the court affirmed and held that: (1) the act was not ambiguous; (2) the failure of the legislature to define transient did not make the act void; (3) the relationship between the transient room tax and the promotion of tourism was sufficient to support the classification that subjected the hotel operator to the tax; and (4) the tax did not impose a burden on interstate commerce.</SPAN></P>

He was sentenced to life imprisonment on each count. On appeal, the court held that the photographs of the victim depicting the scene of the crime were properly admitted as there was a savage murder followed by a life sentence and it could not have been said that defendant was prejudiced by the introduction of the photographs. Defendant was not prejudiced by the admission of an accident report as the report was merely cumulative of an officer's testimony given at trial without objection. There was no merit in defendant's contention that he was not given his rights before giving a confession, nor in his contention that he should have been given a separate trial on the being a habitual criminal charge. However, the court found that the trial court erred in sentencing defendant to life on both counts as only the penalty under the principal offense, willful murder, should have been imposed.

Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 160.605. A Kentucky trial court granted the boards' motion for summary judgment. The taxpayer appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Kentucky State Department of Education recommended that two school districts merge and build a new school building. In order to fund the project, the boards decided to raise revenue through the imposition of the occupational license tax. The boards placed an ad in a local newspaper of general circulation that advised the readers of the time, place, and purpose of a hearing to discuss and decide the merger and related issues. The ad made a reference to a House Bill No. 1 when referring to the occupational tax. The ad should have referred to House Bill No. 471. The error was typographical. The taxpayer argued that the newspaper notice did not comply with Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 160.605, and therefore, the tax was not enforceable. The boards argued that the newspaper ad, combined with a substantial article that explained the merger was a substantial compliance with &sect; 605. In affirming the summary judgment, the court held that the lack of strict compliance with the notice requirements as specified by the fiscal court was not substantial enough to invalidate the election because it appeared that as an actual fact, reasonable notice was received by the voters.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment as modified. The court held that as to all trusts so represented, except the trust of one individual, it was proper to make a declaration and the declaration made was correct. The testamentary trust of on individual presented a different problem because the express terms of the trust itself provided for termination of the trust upon the happening of a certain event, merger or consolidation with another institution.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant university students sought review of a judgment of the Fayette Circuit Court (Kentucky) that was entered pursuant to the jury's verdict finding the students guilty of breach of the peace, in violation of Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 437.010. The students had appealed their conviction by the police court, and the circuit court overruled their motion to dismiss and denied their motion for a directed verdict.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The students met with the dean to establish ground rules for a planned protest on campus. After the protest began, the students refused several requests to leave and blocked doorways, but they did not raise their voices, use profanity, or physically attack anyone. They did, however, force people to step over them. After additional warnings, the students were arrested and charged with breach of the peace. On appeal, the court held that the breach of peace law was not unconstitutionally vague because it had never prohibited constitutionally protected conduct. The court stated that the question of whether the students could validly be convicted must have been considered in terms of the offense as defined by law vis-a-vis the jury instructions. In particular, the students' conduct could have amounted to a breach of the peace only after their right to be present and the time and the place in question had been terminated. The students were in a place from which the university had the right to exclude them; their conduct in remaining thus assumed a different significance after they had been asked to leave as they knew then that they were in a place they had no right to be.</SPAN></P>

The circuit court entered judgment declaring that the actions of the city were valid, finding that an adjudication as to the constitutionality of &sect; 102.060 was not required. Appellants asserted that &sect; 102.060, and the actions of the city purporting to have been taken thereunder, violated Ky.

The court found that under prior court holdings, a governmental body could choose a private institution as an instrumentality for the accomplishment of a public purpose. There was no violation of &sect; 179 by the city.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Five months after the referendum, an action was filed to validate the election. The intervenors' motion to intervene was sustained. On appeal from summary judgment, the court noted that both the original complaint and the intervening complaint were filed too late to contest the election by the terms of Ky. Rev. Stat. &sect; 122.140(1), which limited the right of appeal to 30 days after the election. The trial court was vested with a discretion to permit the filing of the intervening complaint under Ky. R. Civ. P. 24.02 (Permissive Intervention). Even so, on motion for summary judgment the trial court was justified in concluding that the intervening complaint was insufficient to warrant relief. Affirming, the court ruled that the intervening complaint showed on its face it came too late as an election contest under the statute and the new issues it presented were not properly adjudicated in the action at hand.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury convicted defendants of the obscenity charges. On appeal, the court affirmed the convictions. Although motion picture films were entitled to constitutional protection of freedom of speech, obscenity statutes, such as Ky. Rev. Stat. &sect; 436.101, were not unconstitutional per se. Section 436.101 was in conformity with the controlling authority upon the test of what constituted obscenity. Thus, &sect; 436.101 was constitutional. There was no contradiction in the statute that rendered it fatally defective because knowledge of obscenity meant nothing more than knowledge of the contents of the material. The trial court properly excluded testimony from defendants' expert witness on his opinion of what constituted obscenity because it was inconceivable that he could have had a better opinion of the community standards, than the 12 jurors sworn to try the case. Moreover, he could not have portrayed more vividly the contents of the film than was revealed by showing the film itself. The jury had sufficient evidence before it upon which to base its verdict. Obscenity was not protected by the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution of the United States.</SPAN></P>

The applicants filed a suit alleging that the provisions of the amended ordinance establishing the conditions and procedures upon and by which a permit could be granted were unconstitutional in that they granted arbitrary power to the planning commission. The court affirmed the judgment dismissing the action, holding that the applicants did not have standing to attack the constitutionality of the provisions of the ordinance for granting of permits for planned unit developments because if the provisions of the ordinance for granting of permits were held unconstitutional, then the entire legislative act would fall and there would remain no authority under the original zoning ordinance for construction of a planned unit development.</SPAN></P>

The utility claimed that its failure to inspect, discover, and remedy the hazardous condition created by the cooperative was secondary negligence, whereas the cooperative's negligence in creating the condition was primary. The trial court determined that the cooperative was insulated against the claim by the utility and the insurer by reason of the exclusive remedy provision of the Workmen's Compensation Act (Act), Ky.

At issue was whether a use tax was an ad valorem tax or an excise tax and, if the use tax was an excise tax, whether the city was still exempt under Ky. Const. &sect; 170.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Board held that the city was not liable for use tax under Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 139.310 for certain items of equipment purchased outside of the state. The city contended that it was not liable for the tax under &sect; 139.310 because that provision violated Ky. Const. &sect; 170, which exempted from taxation public property used for public purposes. On appeal, the court first classified the tax in issue as an excise tax and not an ad valorem tax. The court next found that, because the tax was not an ad valorem tax exempt under Ky. Const. &sect; 170, the only other basis to support its exemption was if the incidence of the tax was so similar to an ad valorem tax so as to be brought under the protection of &sect; 170. The tax was levied upon the transfer presumably for its use, storage, or consumption within Kentucky. Since &sect; 170 exempted the city from tax upon public property used for public purposes, the court found that the taxation upon the city would be unconstitutional. The court further noted that if the Kentucky Legislature chose to levy a tax in favor of one governmental unit against another, it had the power to do so unless the levy violated a provision of the Kentucky Constitution.</SPAN></P>

Moreover, &sect; 431.155 applied only to sentences imposed after June 13, 1968. Moreover, &sect; 431.155(4) was not unconstitutional as a violation of the equal protection clause of Amendment XIV, United States Constitution, as discriminating against defendant as one sentenced before the effective date of the Act and in favor of one sentence after such date. Specifically, the Fourteenth Amendment did not forbid statutes and statutory changes to have a beginning, and thus to discriminate between the rights of an earlier and later time. Finally, Ky. Rev.

Neither were there sufficient irregularities in how the commissioner who heard the case was appointed to justify setting aside the conviction. The court did, however, rule that the statute imposing life imprisonment without benefit of parole was cruel and unusual punishment when applied to juvenile offenders and thereby violated Ky.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee, the Urban Renewal and Community Development Agency of the City of Maysville, Kentucky, brought suit in a circuit court (Kentucky), which sought to condemn the three houses that belonged to appellant owners. The circuit court ruled in favor of the Agency, and the owners appealed and moved for continuation of an injunction that had prohibited the Agency from taking possession. The Agency moved to dismiss the appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In the circuit court litigation the owners insisted that the Agency had no right to take their property. The circuit court granted injunctive relief to the owners during the trial, and after the evidence was submitted, ruled in favor of the Agency. The Agency paid the amount of the judgment in to the clerk and posted a bond. The circuit court then denied the owners' motion to continue the injunctive relief, and they appealed and renewed their motion with the court. The case was not submitted to the court on the merits, so it decided that the right to appeal should be considered along with the merits of the case. The court denied the motion for injunctive relief. The right to appeal was a legislatively granted right, and the prohibition on interference with a public project through delays while appeals were pending above the circuit court level, contained in Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 99.420(14), was not unconstitutional.&nbsp;Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 99.420(9) provided protection to the owners, who could take the money paid in to the clerk and still appeal. The bond covered any additional judgment against the Agency.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with grand larceny and two previous felony convictions, one in Kentucky and the second in West Virginia. To sustain a conviction under the Habitual Criminal Act, Ky. Rev. Stat. &sect; 431.190, the state was required to show that the second offense was committed after the first conviction, and that the instant offense was committed after the second conviction. At the trial, over objection by defendant, the state introduced a certified copy of the West Virginia record that included the date of indictment on the second offense, which was alleged to have been committed after the first conviction. On appeal, the court held that the objection to the evidence should have been sustained. The West Virginia record, offered to show a previous conviction under the habitual criminal indictment, had not been authenticated in accordance with Ky. Rev. Stat. &sect; 422.040 and Ky. R. Civ. P. 44.01. There was a failure of proof that the second offense had been committed after the first conviction. The objections to the lack of authentication, while not sharply to the point, adequately alerted the trial judge to the proposition that the method of proving the foreign record was improper.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Department held that a transfer of funds from the decedent to the wife was a gift made in contemplation of death and was taxable pursuant to Ky.

The trial court held that the gift was not made in contemplation of death and ordered a refund. The court noted that Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 140.020(2) raised a presumption that a gift was made in contemplation of death if it was made less than three years before the donor's death. The presumption was rebuttable, yet it would suffice to support an administrative finding unless the evidence presented in opposition to it was so convincing that the fact finder might not reasonably reject it. Examination of the evidence adduced on behalf of the wife convinced the court that it did not possess that high degree of probative value which destroyed the rebuttable presumption created by &sect; 140.020(2). The trial court erred in setting aside the Commission's order because the Commission's finding was supported by the statutory presumption which was not destroyed by the evidence in behalf of the wife.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer brought suit, challenging the validity of a city ordinance that imposed a one percent occupational license fee on persons engaging in occupations, trades, professions, and businesses within the city. The trial court upheld the ordinance. The taxpayer contended that the ordinance was invalid because of an irregularity in its passage and because it was unconstitutional. On appeal, the court held that the trial court's finding that one of the council members who voted for the ordinance had not abandoned his residence in the ward in which he was elected at the time he voted was supported by the evidence. Although only six out of 12 council members voted for the ordinance, a seventh who passed would be considered as acquiescing with the majority. Moreover, because the requirement was that a majority of those present and voting enact the ordinance, the requirement was met as only 11 members voted. The court held that, because the taxpayer did not claim that he was engaged in interstate commerce, he did not have standing to attack the ordinance on the ground that it unduly burdened interstate commerce in violation of the U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 8.</SPAN></P>

The trial court appointed commissioners who issued an award to which the owner and the City excepted. The trial court held a pretrial conference and, on its own motion, entered a judgment dismissing the action as to one of the parcels. The court reversed. The owner was the only party with standing to contest the City's right to condemn, and she chose not to do so. The trial judge was not a party to the litigation. The Kentucky Rules of Civil Procedure did not provide for a dismissal on the trial court's own motion, and the record did not present a case of the City's unreasonable failure or refusal to prosecute its claim, or another appropriate circumstance for sua sponte dismissal. Because the landowner choose not to challenge the City's right to take, she waived the defense, and the case should have proceeded to trial on the question of the amount of compensation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The department entered an order increasing by 15 percent the 1966 assessment of farm property in the county. The county through its fiscal court appealed to the board, which upheld the order. The county then appealed to the circuit court, which held that the order was invalid. The department and board appealed from that judgment. The court reversed and held (1) the department's method was valid and produced reliable evidence of underassessment; (2) because of the problems arising in 1966 in connection with the transition to full fair cash value assessments it was impossible for the department to complete its equalization duties and certify all of its assessment orders by the required date; (3) the county did not show that any of its problems in relation to its tax collection program were attributable to the delay in certification, therefore the delay did not prejudice the county and did not invalidate the assessment increase; (4) the department's failure to contact the mayors of two cities which had farm property in them did not invalidate the whole reassessment procedure, because it affected just the city taxes on only eight parcels of land out of a total of 751 parcels.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In negligence action under Ky. Rev. Stat. &sect; 342.055, appellant employees sought review of a judgment from a trial court (Kentucky), which granted the motions of appellees, architects and subcontractors, for summary judgment. The order found that they were covered by workmen's compensation and could not maintain a common law action for damages for injuries sustained on a job against anyone else directly connected with the performance of the job.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employees were injured while engaged in work for their employer on a construction site. The employer and the subcontractors were operating under the Workmen's Compensation Act. The employees filed common law actions against the subcontractors other than the employer. The trial court granted the employer's motion for summary judgment on the ground that the subcontractors were covered by workmen's compensation and could not maintain a common law action for work-related damages. The trial court's judgments were reversed with directions for further proceedings in conformity with the opinion. The court held that the only immunity from common-law liability provided for in the Workmen's Compensation Act was that of the employer, pursuant to Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 342.015(1). The employees did not waive their common-law right of action against the subcontractors, who worked on the same project as his employer because they had no right of workmen's compensation against him. Thus, the subcontractors had no immunity from suit that arose out of the availability of workmen's compensation to the employees.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed an order from the Pike County Circuit Court (Kentucky), which denied his Ky. R. Crim. P. 11.42 motion for postconviction relief from his armed robbery conviction. He contended that his conviction was tainted by a waiver of juvenile jurisdiction, which occurred while he was not represented by counsel.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued, and the court agreed, that the waiver of jurisdiction by the juvenile court amounted to a denial of due process, because defendant was not represented by counsel at the proceeding. The court accepted the principle that waiver of jurisdiction was a &quot;critically important&quot; action determining vitally important statutory rights of a juvenile, to which the right to counsel attached. The court further held that the issue was cognizable in this case under Rule 11.42 because the law had been to the contrary during the trial and appellate stages, when the issue was not raised. But the court declined to accord retroactive application to grant the relief sought, because defendant had attained the age of majority, and could not be retried as a juvenile, and the case for waiver in any event was conclusive.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction for armed robbery.</SPAN></P>
