<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants challenged the judgments from the trial court (Florida), which convicted both of them of inciting a riot under Fla.

Appellants alleged that the riot statute was unconstitutional and that there was an improper pretrial identification procedure.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants were charged in separate cases and were convicted of inciting a riot under Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 870.01(2). One appellant was also convicted of aggravated battery. In consolidated cases, both appellants challenged the constitutionality of the riot statute for failure to set forth sufficient information and guidelines. The appellant convicted of aggravated battery also appealed, claiming an improper identification procedure which allegedly made an independent identification at trial impossible. The court reversed both riot convictions without prejudice to the prosecution because although the riot statute was constitutional, the charges were not well pled. The court affirmed appellant's conviction for aggravated battery because there was nothing in the record to show that the in-court identification was tainted by the prior improper out-of-court identification procedure.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants challenged the decision of the Circuit Court of the Thirteenth Judicial Circuit (Florida) that held that Fla. Laws ch. 69-1651 was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city board of adjustment (board) granted an individual the right to alter an existing residence to a tearoom restaurant. The city's building inspector denied the requested permit, and an appeal was taken to the board. The board granted the use variance despite the unanimous contrary recommendation of the county planning commission that, under Fla. Laws ch. 69-1651, had to review all such applications before the board could act. Appellees brought suit and the circuit court granted summary judgment to appellees holding that the board's grant was void and that Fla. Laws. Ch. 69-1651 was unconstitutional. The circuit court held that the law was invalid insofar as it purported to grant the board authority to issue a use variance permitting property to be used in a manner prohibited by the zoning ordinances. On appeal, the court disagreed and found the law not to be violative of Fla. Const. art. II, &sect; 3. The court reasoned that the standards found within Fla. Laws. ch. 69-1651 would in no instance authorize the board to engage in amendments of the basic zoning ordinance, a legislative function.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed and remanded the decision of the circuit court and held that the law at issue regarding zoning law was not violative of the state's constitution.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the conviction, holding that there was no sufficient basis to reverse the trial court's denial of his motion to suppress because appellant received Miranda warnings three times prior to his confession, and the new evidence alone was not sufficient to grant a new trial.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the decision of the Circuit Court in and for Dade County (Florida) denying his motion to dismiss the charges against him, finding that Fla. Stat. ch. 800.02 was constitutional and convicting him of four crimes. Defendant claimed that he was denied a fair trial, that ch. 800.02 was unconstitutionally vague, and that the acts he committed did not constitute a violation of ch. 800.02.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with extortion, assault and battery, conspiracy to commit an unnatural and lascivious act, and committing an unnatural and lascivious act. Defendant moved to dismiss the indictment on the ground that Fla. Stat. ch. 800.02 was constitutional. The motion to dismiss was denied and the court found the statute to be constitutional. Defendant was convicted on all charges. Defendant appealed on several grounds. The supreme court affirmed the judgment of the trial court because the two comments made by the prosecutor during his closing argument, to which defendant made timely objections, were not so tainted as to require a reversal of the convictions. The cautionary instructions were sufficient to destroy their harmful effect; thus, the trial court acted properly in denying a mistrial. Moreover, the words &quot;unnatural and lascivious&quot; as used in ch. 800.02 were not void for vagueness because the words were of such a character that an ordinary citizen could easily determine what act was intended to be included in the offense. Finally, the act of forced oral copulation committed by defendant constituted an unnatural and lascivious act within the meaning of ch. 800.02.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment convicting defendant of extortion, assault and battery, conspiracy to commit an unnatural and lascivious act, and committing an unnatural and lascivious act was affirmed. Cautionary instructions destroyed the harmful effect of improper comments made by the prosecutor during closing remarks, the challenged law was not unconstitutionally vague, and the act defendant committed was unnatural and lascivious.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of first-degree murder for the murder of his mother-in-law. In a bifurcated trial, the jury recommended life imprisonment, but after weighing factors in aggravation and mitigation, the trial judge sentenced defendant to death. Defendant sought review of his conviction and sentence on grounds that the State failed to establish premeditated intent because there was no evidence of prior hostility between himself and his victim, or prior pronouncements of murderous intent. The court affirmed the conviction of first-degree murder because defendant's conduct of concealing a deadly weapon and pursuing his victim established premeditation by circumstantial evidence. The court quashed the death sentence and directed the trial court to enter a sentence of life imprisonment because there was no reason to override the jury's advisory sentence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Fla. Stat. ch. 370.151 prohibited shrimping in a certain area. The legal description defining the prohibited area was defective. The state department of natural resources recognized the mistake and corrected the description in an administrative regulation. Appellee shrimp boat owner was arrested by appellant state marine patrol and charged with shrimping in a prohibited area. In an action for declaratory judgment brought by appellee, the trial judge declared that Fla. Stat. ch. 370.151(2), was so vague and indefinite as to be unenforceable. The trial judge, in his findings, determined that the state department of natural resources had no legislative authority to define an area prohibiting the taking of shrimp. That was a legislative function and, because the legislature had mistakenly failed to adequately describe the prohibited area, it followed that the department of natural resources had no such authority. Appellant marine patrol challenged the decision. On appeal, the court affirmed the holding of the lower court and its explanation. The court observed that the trial judge properly brought the statutory defect to the attention of the legislature for correction.</SPAN></P>

Further, the state department of natural resources had no legislative authority to define an area prohibiting the taking of shrimp. Accordingly, the confiscation and holding of nets and shrimp doors belonging to appellee shrimp boat owner were without legislative authority and null and void.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of a judgment of the Municipal Court of the City of Homestead (Florida) that convicted him of assault and battery and resisting arrest without violence, allegedly in violation of Fla. Stat. chs. 784.03, 842.02. Defendant claimed that ch. 843.02 was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested for assault and battery and resisting arrest without violence, and he was purportedly charged for violations of Fla. Stat. chs. 784.03, 842.02, respectively. He was found guilty of the charges. In its order denying defendant's motion for a new trial, which alleged the unconstitutionality of Fla. Stat. ch. 843.02, the trial court ruled that the statute did not violate the state constitution. On appeal, the supreme court ruled that it could not assume jurisdiction in the case and transferred the case to the circuit court. An examination of the supplemental record revealed that defendant was not charged under Fla. Stat. ch. 843.02, but under a municipal ordinance that adopted all of the criminal misdemeanor laws of the state as municipal ordinances. The procedure was perfectly acceptable, but as a result jurisdiction rested with the circuit court to hear an appeal of a criminal judgment of the municipal court. Thus, the circuit court was the proper forum in which to contest the constitutionality of Fla. Stat. ch. 843.02.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's review of his conviction in the municipal court could not be heard by the supreme court because defendant was convicted of violating not a state statute but a municipal ordinance. Thus, defendant's appeal was transferred sua sponte to the circuit court, which had jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent administratrix brought a wrongful death action against petitioners, individual and insurance company, seeking to recover funeral expenses and &quot;loss of accumulations&quot; resulting from the alleged wrongful death of decedent. Respondent sought the damages on behalf of decedent's two sisters. The trial court denied petitioners' motion to strike the portion of respondent's complaint that claimed damages for loss of net accumulations. The trial court held that the new wrongful death act (the act), Fla. Stat. ch. 768.16-768.27, which limited recovery of such damages to &quot;a surviving spouse or lineal descendants,&quot; was unconstitutional. The supreme court quashed the trial court's order and remanded for further proceedings, holding that the act was constitutional and did not violate the equal protection clause. The court determined that distinguishing rights of recovery for a surviving spouse and lineal descendants from those who were collateral descendants was not an unreasonable classification. Further, the legislature had the authority to change the elements of damage for wrongful death and the standards by which they were recovered.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed an order of the Duval County Court (Florida) which denied his motion to dismiss two traffic offense charges brought by the state.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested and charged with failing to drive in a single lane and driving while intoxicated. He moved to dismiss the charges, claiming that the court lacked jurisdiction to prosecute him on the basis of a traffic ticket rather than an information, and claiming in the alternative that Fla. Stat. ch. 316.018 was unconstitutional. The trial court denied the motion to dismiss. Defendant pleaded no contest to the charges and appealed the trial court's ruling. The supreme court affirmed the trial court's order. The supreme court found that defendant had no vested right under the state constitution to require a state attorney or a grand jury to pass upon probable cause for the commission of a traffic offense. Furthermore, Fla. Stat. ch. 316.018 did not reflect an unconstitutional delegation of prosecutorial authority to a police official. The statute merely directed the deposit of all traffic offense tickets with the appropriate court, after which judicial proceedings commenced. A state attorney actually prosecuted the matters on behalf of the state, not the issuing police official.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant title agent sought review of a judgment finding Fla. Stat. ch. 201.17(2) constitutional, resulting in the imposition against him of a penalty equal to the amount of the taxes appellant should have paid before filing a conveyance of real property. The court affirmed the judgment assessing the penalty, finding that it was not so great as to shock the conscience of reasonable people and bore a rational relationship to the failure to pay such taxes. The court determined that the assessment of the penalty against appellant was the common method for insuring and protecting the collection of excise taxes. The mandatory imposition of such a fine was the inducement for the taxes to be paid in the first instance. The court concluded that, given the difficulties involved in collecting delinquent documentary stamp taxes, the penalty imposed was not so harsh or oppressive as to warrant the court's intruding on the plenary power of the legislature to tax, which necessarily carried with it the power to fix reasonable penalties to insure collection of such taxes.</SPAN></P>

The indictment, containing three counts of murder in the first degree, alleged that defendant committed each murder by strangling the victims.

Stat. chs. 775.082, 782.04, and 921.141, arguing that the death sentence was per se cruel and unusual. The court noted that the death penalty statute contemplated that the trial jury, the trial judge, and the appellate court would exercise reasoned judgment as to which factual situations required the imposition of death and which factual situations could be satisfied by life imprisonment in light of the totality of the circumstances present in the evidence. The court found that the death sentence in this case was a proper sentence because, comparing the aggravating and mitigating circumstances with those shown in other capital cases and weighing the evidence, defendant's conduct in strangling and sexual assaulting the victims warranted the death penalty.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment adjudging defendant guilty of murder in the first-degree and sentencing him to death was affirmed because defendant's act of strangulating three women was a heinous act that warranted a death sentence.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, defendant questioned the sufficiency of circumstantial evidence to support a finding of premeditation and, thus, the sufficiency of evidence to support a jury verdict of first-degree murder. The court accepted the jury's evaluation of the evidence and held that where a jury's verdict was supported by competent evidence, an appellate court should not substitute itself as trier of fact. The court rejected defendant's assertion that remarks by a prosecutor constituted reversible error, finding that defendant failed to raise objections at trial and that the remarks were not decisive factors that required a finding of fundamental error. Further, the court held that the trial court's consideration of a presentence investigation report was not grounds for error because Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.710 permitted consideration of the report. The court affirmed defendant's conviction and sentence, finding aggravating circumstances and no mitigating circumstances. The court concluded that the death penalty was not cruel and unusual punishment or unconstitutionally discretionary.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee was charged with inciting a riot under Fla. Stat. ch. 870.01(2) (1973). No specific facts were set forth in the information. The trial court found the statute facially unconstitutional. The supreme court reversed the trial court's decision and found the statute constitutional, subject to certain limiting instructions. Riot was not defined in the statute, so the common law definition of riot applied and each of the common law elements had to be established before one could be guilty of violating the riot statute. An information had to articulate facts that establish that three or more persons acted with a common intent to mutually assist each other in a violent manner to the terror of the people and a breach of the peace. With respect to inciting a riot, the charging document had to establish circumstances justifying a clear and present danger of a riot and that appellee's language tended to incite the persons assembled to an immediate breach of the peace. The information that charged appellee with violating the statute was inadequate to establish a violation of the statute.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Criminal appellant was charged with first degree murder and assault with intent to commit murder in the first degree. He was 15 years of age at the time the crimes were committed. Appellant filed a motion to dismiss the criminal indictment, on the grounds that he had already been adjudicated by the juvenile court as a delinquent child. He contended that the criminal proceedings were barred by the juvenile court action, alleged double jeopardy, and claimed that Fla. Stat. ch. 39.02(6)(a) was unconstitutional as applied. The trial court denied the motion, maintaining that jeopardy did not attach to a juvenile proceeding and that chs. 39.02(6)(a)(b)(c) were not unconstitutional The jury found petitioner guilty of both crimes and sentenced him to life imprisonment. Upon review, the court held that the criminal proceedings against petitioner were barred by Fla. Const. art. I, &sect; IX. and U.S. Const. amend. V. The juvenile court took jurisdiction and had entered the taking of testimony. Therefore petitioner was put in jeopardy when the court began to hear evidence. The court reversed the trial court's decision and remanded for further proceedings consistent with its findings.</SPAN></P>

At the time of his initial employment and until his discharge, the rules and regulations governing the police pension fund held that wanton or willful neglect in performance of duties or deliberate destruction of city property was a group three offense. It was conceded that appellant was found guilty of having committed such an offense. Under the applicable legislative act, the offense precluded entitlement to a retirement pension. Appellant argued that the legislative act violated his constitutional rights to due process and equal protection. The trial court found for appellee and the supreme court affirmed. The supreme court held that the legislative act was not unconstitutional because the legislature had the power to create the sanctions, appellant did not show that the act was totally without a rational basis and was an arbitrary use of police power, and appellant was aware of the sanctions, which were part of his employment contract, at the time he began working for appellee.</SPAN></P>

Laws ch. 74-177, to members of the Florida Bar acting in their professional capacity as officers of the Court. Petitioner contended that the Florida legislature had no constitutional authority to include judicial officers and entities within the scope of ch. 74-177, asserting that the separation of powers doctrine rendered the chapter unconstitutional as applied to the judicial branch. Respondent Commission on Ethics maintained that the law properly included the judiciary, and, because the Florida Bar was a public agency of the judicial branch of government, officers and other officials of the Florida Bar were considered public officers under the law and required by the Act to file an annual financial disclosure statement. Upon review, the court held that the regulation of the above mentioned parties was exclusively within the power of the judicial branch pursuant to Fla. Const. art. V, &sect; 15. It determined that ch. 74-177 was inapplicable as a code of conduct for officers of the judicial branch and that the legislature had no power to control members of the bar.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant manufacturer sought review of an order of the Broward County Circuit Court (Florida), which upheld the constitutionality of Fla. Stat. chs. 320.641 and 320.695 and held that the termination of appellant's contract with appellee seller was invalid.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant manufacturer and appellee seller were parties to a franchise agreement. Appellant terminated the agreement without notice and appellee filed suit under Fla. Stat. ch. 320.695, requesting reinstatement. The trial court found ch. 320.695 to be constitutional and deemed the termination invalid for appellant's failure to provide 90 days notice of termination as required by the law. Appellant challenged this decision, contending that the statute, which became effective in 1971, was intended to be prospective in operation and was not applicable to the 1970 franchise agreement; if it were found to operate retroactively, it would unconstitutionally impair the contract. The court noted that Florida legislation was presumed to be prospective unless it facially indicated otherwise. The legislation made no such indication. The court held that the laws application via the state's police power would unconstitutionally impair the contract, which was not tolerated by the state, and that the state's interest in policing franchise agreements was superseded by the sanctity of contracts. The court concluded that ch. 320.641 applied prospectively and quashed the trial court's order.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court quashed the order of the trial court with directions to dismiss appellee seller's complaint because state law did not indicate that it was to be applied retroactively and because the use of the state police to apply the law to the franchise agreement of appellant manufacturer and appellee would result in an unconstitutional impairment of the contract.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed appellant's conviction for malicious trespass in violation of Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 821.18. In 1971, the trespass statute was amended to read that trespass was a misdemeanor that was punishable under Fla. Stat.

The court found that the language of &sect; 821.18 conveyed a sufficiently definite warning as to the proscribed conduct when measured by common understanding and practice.

Appellant was convicted of murder in the first degree, for which he was sentenced to death, and of robbery, for which he was sentenced to life imprisonment. On appeal, the court affirmed appellant's convictions because the court found no reversible error. The admission of the weapon and a gun stolen from the motel was proper. Appellant was not illegally sentenced for his conviction of robbery because separate sentences were properly imposed on appellant for his separate offenses. The court reduced appellant's death sentence to a sentence of life imprisonment, however, because the person who actually shot the motel desk clerk had received life imprisonment. Therefore, it would not be equal justice to sentence appellant, a mere accomplice, to death.</SPAN></P>

Petitioner claimed that the primary purpose of the taking was to construct a shopping mall in furtherance of private interests. The Florida Supreme Court granted petitioner's writ of certiorari and held that because the shopping mall would be leased to a private enterprise, the creation of the shopping mall was to create the need for the public parking proposed. Without the private development there would have been no public need for the parking cited as the sole basis for condemnation. The court cited this as a very dangerous precedent that would allow a total departure from the basic requirement that there must first be a showing of a public necessity or public use, in order for eminent domain to be utilized against private ownership.</SPAN></P>

The court explained that Fla. Const. art.

The court stated that &sect; 39.02(5)(c) implemented this constitutional provision by permitting removal of juveniles to the criminal division by indictment. The court held that removal in appellant's case did not violate due process, noting that appellant enjoyed the same substantive and procedural rights as any other person. The court also held that &sect; 39.02(5)(c) did not implicate equal protection by according the state unfettered discretion to decide which juveniles to bring indictments against, noting that this was the same discretion wielded by prosecutors in the federal system, and under the common law of England.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant applicant sought review of an order from the Circuit Court of Leon County (Florida), which denied appellant's petition for a writ of mandamus to compel appellee state highway patrol to reinstate him as a state trooper. Appellant contended that the maximum age limitation for state trooper applicants was unconstitutional, and that appellee violated Fla. Stat. ch. 112.043 and Fla. Admin. Code Ann. r. 22A-7.05.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant applicant sought reinstatement as a state trooper, a position that he had resigned from. Holding that the age limitation for state trooper applicants passed rational review, and that appellee state highway patrol had not violated any state laws, the court affirmed the denial of appellant's petition. Preliminarily, the court held that the trial court had jurisdiction to consider appellant's petition, noting that mandamus was an original, not appellate, action. The court held that equal protection did not mandate that that a statute or rule necessarily apply equally to all persons, or that things which were different in fact be treated in law as though they were the same. The court held that the age limit for trooper applicants was reasonably related to the maintenance of agility, alertness, and dexterity in the patrol. The court next held that appellee had published the age restriction as required by Fla. Stat. ch. 112.043, and that the statute was not unconstitutional as applied to appellant. The court also held that because Fla. Admin. Code Ann. r. 22A-7.05, contained the word &quot;may&quot; in regard to reinstatement, reinstatement was clearly permissive, not mandatory.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the order that denied appellant applicant's petition for writ mandamus. The court stated that equal protection did not bar laws that discriminated on a rational basis that was calculated to promote a valid state interest, and held that it was permissible to discriminate among trooper applicants on the basis of age. The court also held that appellee state highway patrol properly had published its age discrimination policy.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted by a jury for possession of marijuana and cocaine following a search of a vehicle in which she was a passenger. The trial court denied defendant's motion to suppress on the ground that consent had been given for the search. The court below held that the initial seizure by the patrolman of the plastic bag and its contents was illegal and that those items should have been suppressed. However, the court below held that defendant subsequently consented to the search of her cosmetic bag so that the illegal contents of her cosmetic bag were admissible. On appeal, the court agreed that the initial search and seizure of the sandwich bag was illegal. However, the court held that the subsequent searches and seizures were also illegal. Reviewing the record, the court determined that the question of consent developed only after a series of illegal actions by the arresting officer. Therefore, the court determined that the evidence was gained by an illegal search and seizure and that the motion to suppress should have been granted as to the subsequent searches as well.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, a Florida corporation, brought suit against defendants, all non-residents of Florida, to recover a brokerage commission resulting from an exchange of stock of a South Dakota corporation for stock in a Florida corporation. Plaintiff's president allegedly traveled to South Dakota to discuss the stock transfer, and the transaction closed in Chicago. On only one occasion did any of the defendants come to Florida for a meeting. The trial court dismissed the complaint upon a finding that the defendants did not have the minimal contacts in Florida sufficient to subject them to substitute service, and the district court reversed. On appeal, the court reversed. Construing Fla. Stat. ch. 48.181, the court determined that whether a nonresident sold, leased or consigned personal property through to a person in this Florida depended on whether the sale, lease or consignment occurred in Florida. Applying the general rules of the law of contracts, the court concluded that because the exchange agreement was executed in Illinois, and the closing took place in Illinois, Fla.Stat. ch. 48.181(3) could not be utilized to acquire jurisdiction over the defendants.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant parents voluntarily delivered their minor child into the temporary custody of the state for her protection and welfare. Three days after delivery, a hearing was conducted to determine whether the child should have been adjudicated a &quot;dependent child&quot; within the meaning of Fla. Stat. ch. 39.01(10). Appellants were both present at the hearing, but they were not at that time advised that they had a right to be represented by counsel or that if they were indigent, the state would provide counsel for them. The child was adjudicated a dependent child and committed to the temporary custody of the state. Appellants filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus asking for the child's return. The district court of appeal denied the writ. Appellants sought review, asserting that the original adjudication of dependency was invalid per se, as they were not represented by counsel and had not been advised of their right to counsel. The federal constitution did not require counsel in this juvenile dependency case.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant estates appealed from decisions of the Dade County Circuit Court (Florida) and the Duval County Circuit Court (Florida) in which a motion to strike recovery of punitive damages from appellee tortfeasor was granted and in which the constitutionality of the Wrongful Death Act, Fla. Stat. ch. 768.16-27, was certified as a question of great public interest.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant estates sought the recovery of damages, including punitive damages, in wrongful death actions under Fla. Stat. ch. 768.16-768.27. The legislature had replaced the two prior statutory separate and independent causes of action, a survival action and a wrongful death action, with a new wrongful death action intended to merge the survival action and wrongful death action into one case. The claim for pain and suffering of the decedent from the date of injury to the date of death was eliminated and replaced by a claim for pain and suffering of close relatives. The court held that the title of the act did provide sufficient notice of the legislative intent to consolidate survival and wrongful death claims into one action. Tortfeasor answerability for damages resulting in death remained unimpaired. Further, the statute did not repeal the public policy right to claim punitive damages, which was established by case law that was as valid under the new act as it was under the old. The legislature did not intend a tortfeasor to be punished for his malicious and reckless acts when they maimed another but not for those same acts when they killed the victim.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held the wrongful death act to be constitutional to the extent that it consolidated survival and wrongful death actions and substituted for a decedent's pain and suffering the survivors' pain and suffering as an element of damages. The court further held that punitive damages were not eliminated and could be recovered once for each death in an action if justified by the facts. The cases were remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff bank filed an action over certain documentary stamp taxes and intangible taxes which were assessed by defendants against plaintiff in connection with promissory notes and mortgages that were executed in favor of plaintiff. Plaintiff alleged that defendant assessed and demanded payment from it of additional documentary and intangible taxes and penalties as a result of the subject transactions. The court held that the owners of property could never forget that the power to tax was the power to destroy. Those who assessed and collected taxes, like other human beings, make mistakes. The only nonviolent defense is legal action against the government. Plaintiff admitted noncompliance with Fla. Stat. Ch. 199.242 and subsequently, the trial court granted defendants' motion to dismiss.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Consolidated appeals were filed after defendant juvenile was found guilty, following a jury trial, of armed robbery. Defendant contended that the juvenile judge erred in declaring Fla.

The court noted that a subsequent decision upheld the constitutionality of the statute, so that part of the juvenile judge's order was reversed. The court upheld the order of transfer and the judgment and sentence because the juvenile judge properly considered all the elements and factors required under ch. 39.09(2)(c) before he decided to transfer defendant for trial as an adult. The court held that the juvenile judge was not required to determine whether there was a reasonable prospect of rehabilitation prior to defendant's reaching majority before effecting the transfer.</SPAN></P>

Stat. ch. 30.49(4, 5) was an unconstitutional attempt to vest in an appointed official unrestricted discretion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After appellee county commissioners rejected two items in appellant sheriff's proposed budget, appellant filed an appeal to the department of administration (DOA) to have the budget deletions restored. The DOA found that an additional sum was to be added to appellant's budget, but specifically approved the deletion of the one item. The county, however, refused to give appellant the sum until an order validity determination was made. Appellant filed a petition for alternative writ of mandamus seeking to have the county comply with the DOA order. After appellees challenged the constitutionality of Fla. Stat. ch. 30.49(4, 5), the circuit court held that the appeal power vested in the DOA was an unconstitutional attempt to vest in an appointed official unrestricted discretion. The state supreme court held that the allocation of the sum within the six items of the budget was solely within appellant's power. The court reasoned that although Fla. Stat. ch. 30.49(4) empowered the county to make lump sum reductions or additions of monies allocated to any of the six budget items, the county did not have the authority to intrude into functions solely within appellant's power.</SPAN></P>

After the jury returned a guilty verdict, the jury returned an advisory sentence recommending that a life sentence be imposed. The trial judge adjudicated defendant guilty and thereafter imposed the death penalty instead. In so doing, the trial judge entered written detailed findings of fact in support of the death penalty pursuant to the safeguards afforded by Fla. Stat. ch. 921.141. The trial court found that aggravating circumstances existed because the capital felony was especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel and that there were no mitigating circumstances. The findings described multiple physical injuries suffered by the victim, including injuries stemming from an assault on the victim's sexual organs. After reviewing the evidence to determine whether the interests of justice required a new trial, the court found that no reversible error occurred. Further, the evidence in the record did not reveal that the ends of justice required that a new trial be awarded.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed defendant's conviction and sentence and held that the search and seizure were constitutional because the gun was taken from an area not exclusively used by defendant. Defendant contended that the trial court erred when it denied defendant's motion for acquittal because the evidence was insufficient to establish premeditation.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of felony murder, and the jury recommended a sentence of life imprisonment. The judge thereafter imposed the death penalty, pointing out that he was in possession of additional facts not known to the jury. Some of the supplemental information included the fact that defendant was accused of 13 additional robberies, and that a magistrate had found that defendant likely committed the robberies. Defendant took no issue with the facts relied upon by the judge. The record included defendant's plea of guilty to 10 separate charges of robbery. The supreme court found that there were sufficient aggravating circumstances to justify the judge's imposition of the death penalty. The court looked at the facts of the armed robbery incident under consideration, defendant's prior record, including the commission of multiple robberies, and the fact that defendant was a hard drug user, requiring the expenditure of $ 200.00 per day. The court also noted the specific finding of threats of reprisals against persons involved in the prosecution of defendant, and appellant's violent temper. The facts were more than adequate to justify the imposition of the death penalty.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In four consolidated cases, the issue before the court was whether Florida's loitering statute,&nbsp;Fla. Stat. ch. 856.021, was constitutional. Appellee loiterers argued that the statute was vague and overbroad, required self-incrimination, and was subject to arbitrary enforcement. The court found that the statute was constitutional and a proper law enforcement tool to protect the public safety, and that the statute did not authorize police officers to use their unbridled discretion to arrest whomever they pleased. The statute only authorized an arrest where the person loitering or prowling did so under circumstances that threatened a breach of the peace or the public safety. While the statute was subject to unconstitutional application in certain situations, it was no ground for finding the statute itself unconstitutional. The whole purpose of the statute was to provide law enforcement with a suitable tool to prevent crime and allow a specific means to eliminate a situation which a reasonable man would believe could cause a breach of the peace or a criminal threat to persons or property.</SPAN></P>

Appellant state argued, on consolidated appeals, that Fla. Stat. chs. 112.313(2), 112.314(1), and 839.07 were not unconstitutional, as the lower court held. The judgment of the lower court was affirmed in part and reversed in part. The court affirmed the lower court's ruling that Fla. Stat. ch. 112.313(2) was unconstitutional. Fla. Stat. ch. 112.314 was not unconstitutional and the court reversed the judgment of the lower court. The indictment against appellee as presently framed was void for vagueness; however, the court held that the charges could be refiled either by indictment or information if the state chose to do so.

Appellants argued that the trial court erred in determining that laches did not apply to the case and contended that appellee should be estopped by its lack of diligence to assert that through some error the tax certificates remained outstanding because they were unconstitutional. Appellants also argued that the lower court erred in refusing to find that the Murphy Act vested color of title in the state. Finally, appellants contended that the trial court erred in dismissing appellants' counterclaims with prejudice. The appellate court affirmed the trial court's judgment.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged the trial court decision that convicted him, after a jury trial, of rape and first-degree murder and sentenced him to death. On review, the court affirmed. The court held that the sentencing procedure pursuant to Fla. Stat. chs. 782.04 and 921.141, was constitutional. The mere presence of discretion in death penalty sentencing was not unconstitutional, and the death penalty did not constitute cruel and unusual punishment under the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments. It was not prejudicial error to admit evidence that defendant attempted to engage in a homosexual act immediately prior to the commission of the crimes because such evidence was relevant as to motive and was not an improper character assault. Evidence of items taken from defendant's home under color of a search warrant that authorized a search for shell casings was admissible. The authorized search logically led to areas where the seized clothing was found. Defendant's sentence was properly imposed after the trial court found that the aggravating circumstances far outweighed mitigating circumstances.</SPAN></P>

The court answered the question in the affirmative, finding that the questioned portion of the act constituted a clear infringement upon the constitutional power of the governor to restore civil rights. The people of the state through adoption of Fla. Const. art. IV, &sect; 8, expressed their will that the power of pardon and restoration of civil rights vest in the executive. The court determined that this method was exclusive. The court's advisory opinion did not carry with it a mandate of the court.

On review, the court reversed and remanded. The law in effect at the time defendant was charged required that he be indicted on the offense of first degree murder. An information against defendant was insufficient to bring him to trial on the charge. The alleged capital offense of first degree murder was committed on November 13, 1972. As of that date, the law required that an indictment issue in order to bring defendant to trial on a capital offense. Therefore, defendant's trial based on an information was void and his conviction was in error.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner applied for a writ of habeas corpus to obtain release from a mental institution where he had been held in custody since being adjudged not guilty of murder by reason of insanity. Petitioner argued that because respondent superintendent had determined petitioner was no longer a threat, the trial court illegally applied Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.460 to him to continue his detention.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent superintendent certified that petitioner was no longer a danger to the safety of others. The trial court found otherwise after a hearing and remanded petitioner to the custody of respondent superintendent. Holding that Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.460 always contemplated that a person adjudged not guilty of murder by reason of insanity would remain in custody until released by order of the committing court, the court discharged the writ of habeas corpus. The court stated that Rule 3.460 as in effect at the time of petitioner's commitment embodied the standard applicable under Fla. Stat. ch. 919.11, which Rule 3.460 had replaced. The court stated that ch. 919.11 had been construed to allow for continuing jurisdiction in the trial court to determine by subsequent hearing and order whether a person was still manifestly dangerous to the public. The court noted two factually indistinguishable cases in which a petitioner had been denied release pursuant to ch. 919.11. The court held that an amendment to Rule 3.460, which added language expressly stating this continuing jurisdiction after petitioner's commitment, was only a clarification of the rule, not a substantive change.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court discharged petitioner's writ of habeas corpus. The court held that the trial court retained jurisdiction over persons committed after they were adjudged not guilty by reason of insanity, and that the trial court's decision after a hearing that petitioner was manifestly still a danger to himself and others was proper and fully supported by the record.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of his conviction for second-degree murder from the trial court (Florida). Appellant asserted that the trial court erred by failing to make a specific finding of voluntariness with regard to his confession and that Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 913.08(1)(a) and Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.350(a) were unconstitutional because they allowed the same number of peremptory challenges for defendants charged with capital crimes and with felonies.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed appellant's conviction for second-degree murder. The court rejected appellant's argument that the trial court erred in failing to make a specific finding that his confession was voluntary. The court found that when the uncontradicted testimony of police officers indicated that the confession was voluntary, and appellant had not raised any suggestion of coercion, the trial court's denial of appellant's motion to suppress the confession would be considered a finding of voluntariness. The court also rejected appellant's argument that Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 913.08(1)(a) and Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.350(a) were unconstitutional because they allowed the same number of peremptory challenges for a defendant charged with a capital crime as for a defendant charged with a felony punishable by life imprisonment. The court held that the exact number of peremptory challenges was a procedural process, not a fundamental right, and noted that appellant had not used all of the challenges he was entitled to and had not demonstrated any prejudice.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed appellant's conviction. The court found that when the evidence clearly established that the confession was voluntary and appellant had not claimed coercion, the trial court's denial of the motion to suppress would serve as a finding of voluntariness. The court found that the statute and rule regarding peremptory challenges were constitutional when that was a procedural issue, not a fundamental right.</SPAN></P>

Appellants planning and zoning authority (authority), and the county government were named as defendants. Appellant county filed an answer and cross-claim against appellant authority claiming that chapters 72-564 unconstitutionally violated several sections of the Constitution of Florida. The trial judge entered final declaratory judgment declaring the questioned act unconstitutional on grounds that the act violated Fla. Const. art. III, &sect; 11(a)(1). The court found the basic purposes of the act was to remove from the county commissioners their zoning jurisdiction in the described area and to place that jurisdiction in the appellant authority; and to give appellant authority power to enact county ordinances and then obligate the county commissioners and other county officers, boards and departments to comply with and enforce such ordinances. The trial court held, per the constitution, transfer of jurisdiction and authority could not be done by special act. The court affirmed on the same grounds.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant taxpayers sought review of an interlocutory order from the Circuit Court of Broward County (Florida), which denied their petition for a rehearing after holding that Fla.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant taxpayers, after a hearing, obtained a property tax exemption from the board of tax adjustment. Appellee department of revenue, after reviewing the matter, and without first giving appellants notice or a hearing, invalidated the exemption. Holding that appellants were denied due process of law by appellee's action, the court quashed the judgment and remanded for further proceedings. The court held that Fla. Stat. ch. 193.122(1) was facially valid but was applied unconstitutionally. The court held that even though the statute was silent as to due process requisites, they were constitutionally implied. The court held that a tax exemption was a valuable right and should not be lightly shorn without a taxpayer having had a contemporaneous opportunity at the administrative level to be heard where the body reviewing the exemption had equal authority to disallow it. The court held that appellants' ability to bring a de novo action in the circuit court to obtain an exemption was no substitute for the constitutionally required administrative process.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent was convicted in municipal court for violating the Lantana Town Ordinance 8-20, which disallowed publication or circulation of any charge against a candidate seven days preceding the date of an election. On appeal, the district court held that the ordinance violated the Fla. Const. art. I &sect;&sect; 4 and 9; U.S. Const. amend. I. The supreme court affirmed the district court. The court explained that the United States Supreme Court had coupled the freedom of the press with the responsibility of the press. There was, however, always the possible mischief to a free exchange of expression from all sides, which could result from the restrictive ordinance in question; it was this restriction which was constitutionally impermissible. The Lantana ordinance outlawed not only false statements, but true statements as well, those that would be helpful and fair, as well as any which might be harmful and prejudicial. The ordinance constituted a clear incursion on First Amendment rights.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff challenged the application of Fla.

The supreme court accepted plaintiff's request for a constitutional writ in aid of jurisdiction or for a decree in accordance with a previous mandate to resolve an issue related and intertwined with the prior appeal, specifically, if ch. 561.42 prohibitions against extending credit were enforceable. The supreme court reviewed the statutes' history and found that a constitutional ruling was not necessary to rule that the ch. 561.42 prohibitions were not enforceable. In invalidating ch. 562.21, cash sale requirements imposed upon vendors of beer and wine vanished, and the ch. 561.42(8) distinction between beer, malt beverages, wine, and liquor was meaningless and vitiated by the opinion in the prior appeal. Under what was left of the statutes, the seller of beer and wine was entitled to extend the same ch. 561.42(1), (2), (7) 10-day credit as permitted for liquors.</SPAN></P>

Appellant challenged the decision, and the court reversed the opinion of the trial court insofar as it held Fla.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee, charged with driving under the influence and drug offenses, filed a motion to dismiss under the speedy trial rule, alleging that the offenses charged were misdemeanors and that more than 90 days had elapsed since he was taken into custody. As to two offenses, the state argued that the speedy trial rule did not apply; nonetheless, the trial court entered an order to dismiss. On appeal, the state argued that there was no demand in the record for a speedy trial. Appellant also argued that the trial court had no authority to construe constitutional provisions so as to invalidate the various rules. Appellee argued that the trial court did not attempt to make a rule but merely attempted to select from conflicting rules one which would achieve a constitutional result. The state supreme court quashed that part of the trial court's order dealing with the constitutional application of the speedy trial rule because that part of the order was improperly entered based on precedent. However, the court affirmed the dismissal of appellee's criminal charges because it held that dismissal was proper.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants sought review of their convictions for conspiracy to commit arson and arson of a school. The school board had closed the school because of its poor physical condition. The court affirmed the convictions, finding Fla. Stat. ch. 833.04 was constitutional because the conduct it proscribed was understandable to a person of ordinary intelligence. The court determined that to make a statute sufficiently certain to comply with constitutional requirements it need not include detailed plans and specifications of the acts or conduct prohibited, but need only convey a sufficiently definite warning as to the proscribed conduct. The court found that no overt act was necessary to commit conspiracy under ch. 833.04, and that all that was required was an agreement and an intention to commit an offense. The court further concluded that defendants were precluded from challenging the residency requirements for qualification of jurors because appellate review was not the proper place to litigate or correct the rights of third persons. The court did note that residency requirements were valid provided they did not operate to systematically exclude a cognizable group.</SPAN></P>

Petitioner misplaced reliance on the cited cases because they involved ordinances that lacked sufficient guidelines to limit the building official in the exercise of his discretion. The ordinance at issue was properly read and considered with the other provisions of the city code. A party aggrieved by a building official's decision could appeal, and the minimum standards of other sections of the code were incorporated by reference, further limiting the building official's discretion.

Appellee tenant had sought a determination of her rights and appellant asserted due process and contract clause constitutional violations.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee was a tenant in a mobile home park owned by appellant mobile home park company.

Stat. chs. 83.271, 83.281, and 83.291. The trial court held that the tenant's rights laws were constitutional and ordered appellant to lease the premises to appellee again because appellee had not violated any federal, state, or local laws or park regulations and she was allowed peaceful possession of the premises as long as reasonable. Appellant sought review and asserted various constitutional arguments and errors. On review, the court found that mobile homes were actually highly immobile once situated on property. The court found that the tenant's rights legislation constituted a reasonable and necessary regulation due to the peculiar nature and problems presented by mobile homes and that appellant's constitutional rights did not usurp the State's ability to use its police power for the benefit of the community at large. The court affirmed accordingly.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that the tenant's rights legislation was constitutional because mobile home owners had the right to security in dealings with mobile home park owners.

In consolidated actions to evict defendant mobile home dwellers, plaintiff mobile home park owners claimed the statute was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff mobile home park owners sought to evict defendant mobile home dwellers, who owned homes located in the park. Defendants claimed that plaintiffs did not have grounds for eviction as provided in Fla. Stat. ch. 83.271 (renumbered 83.69). Plaintiffs asserted that the statute was unconstitutional, and the trial court certified a question regarding whether the statute was constitutional. The supreme court answered the question in the affirmative, holding that the statute was a valid exercise of the state's police power and was constitutional under federal and state due process and equal protection standards. Unfettered eviction power subjected mobile home tenants to a form of economic servitude and oppressive treatment by park owners. The statute was enacted to protect tenants. Recognizing the hybrid property relationship between mobile home owner and park owner, the legislature endeavored to protect both parties' interests. The statute established a classification of mobile home park landlords, as distinguished from other landlords, that was rational, nondiscriminatory, and bore a reasonable relationship to the statute's purposes.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court answered a certified question in the affirmative, finding that a statute restricting eviction of mobile home park owners was constitutional where the class established by the statute, mobile home park owners, was rationally related to the legitimate state purpose of protecting the rights of mobile home owners. The statute did not violate due process and equal protection standards and was a valid exercise of the state's police power.</SPAN></P>

The juvenile court ruled that ch. 39.02(2) was void and unconstitutional because it conflicted with rules promulgated by the supreme court. On appeal, the supreme court reversed that portion of the juvenile court's order that found ch. 39.09(2) unconstitutional, holding that the factors presented in ch. 39.02(d) were intended as guidelines for the determination of the public interest. The supreme court concluded that ch. 39.02 had to be considered in conjunction with the rules of the court and that the provisions of ch. 39.02 were discretionary and not mandatory.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">During a custody dispute, appellant father challenged the constitutionality of Fla. Stat. ch. 742, the state's bastardy statute. He contended that the statute was unconstitutional because it denied the father of an illegitimate child the rights that the father of a legitimate child enjoyed, including equal consideration during custody proceedings. The trial court found the statute valid. On appeal, the supreme court affirmed. According to the supreme court, the statute did not preclude the trial court from granting appellant similar rights to child custody as might be granted a father in a dissolution of marriage situation. The supreme court held that while a trial court ordinarily gave precedence to the desire of the mother for custody if the desire existed, if the father expressed a similar desire and showed that he was the better choice as custodial parent, the court could in its sound judgment and discretion award custody of the child to him. Thus, the language of the statute was broad enough to allow the trial court in its discretion to award appellant custody of the parties' child.</SPAN></P>

The trial court ruled that appellant was the proper party to question the constitutionality of the dower statute, but declared the statutes to be constitutional, and appellant sought review. The court held that the proper party to raise the issue of discriminatory operation of the dower statutes must of necessity have been a male widower, who elected to take dower in his deceased wife's estate and was denied that right by the very operation of the statutes.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Florida Public Service Commission (commission) adopted Rule 25.14.02, which allowed the commission to treat as much of the Florida corporate income tax as an operating expense as was necessary to prevent the earnings of a regulated company from falling below the minimum fair, just, and reasonable rate of return allowed by the commission. Petitioner utilities challenged the rule, contending it would unconstitutionally deprive a utility of the opportunity to earn a fair rate of return by requiring the computation in the rule without allowing the utility to recover all tax expenses for which it was legally obligated. Noting that the commission had considerable discretion and latitude in the rate-fixing process, the court determined the rule realistically recognized the inevitable necessity of both the regulated and the unregulated corporate entity sharing tax burdens from their profits. Thus, the court sustained the rule subject to limitation and amendment. The court eliminated the word &quot;minimum&quot; from the fair, just, and reasonable rate of return, holding that a minimum rate could be too stifling to a utility in periods of growth or need for correction of inadequate service.</SPAN></P>

Because the court found that only &sect; 196.197(1), (2), (3) of ch. 196 was unconstitutional, and because the essential purpose of ch. 196 remained intact without the unconstitutional part, and because other sections in ch. 196 provided constitutional means of determining an exemption, the court excised &sect; 196.197(1), (2), (3) from ch. 196.

The court agreed, noting first that the contested sand beach area where petitioner was building condominiums was allegedly acquired by the public by custom and prescription. Rejecting the contention that respondent could assert vested property rights in the public generally and then sue to enforce these rights, the court ruled that respondent could not maintain its suit in the absence of allegations of special injury, namely, that its injury was different in kind from that suffered by the general public. To rule otherwise, the court added, would encourage endless litigation by individuals possessed of the same interest, as none would be bound by res judicata as a result of prior suits.

Appellants further alleged that this system was unconstitutionally applied to certain county residents. Appellees filed a motion to dismiss, which the lower court granted. The supreme court affirmed the grant of appellees' motion to dismiss the complaint. The court found that, although the expenditure of primary road funds within the county might have been disproportionate based upon area, population, number of registered vehicles, road needs, or any other criterion, appellants' complaint nevertheless did not state a cause of action. The court perceived no constitutional or statutory right to a proportional expenditure of such funds, on any criteria, which was thereby infringed. The court held that the state's primary road system was not designed to create separate road systems within each county for the benefit of the county's residents only, but rather for all state residents, wherever they were situated.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Three children were involved in a permanent commitment case. Based upon the evidence, the trial court found that the children's natural parents, who had neglected to give parental care and protection, abandoned them.

It found that it was manifestly in the best interests of the children to be permanently committed to the custody of the state. The trial court in its final order impliedly passed upon the constitutionality of Fla. Stat. ch. 39.11(2)(a)(4). Appellants sought review, attacking the statute as unconstitutionally vague and violative of fundamental due process. The court found that the contention was without merit. Chapter 39.11(2)(a)(4) was clear, unambiguous, and was not violative of fundamental due process.

The court dissolved the stay of the prosecution because the statute did not violate the due process or equal protection clauses of U.S. Const. Amend. XIV.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant corporation showed an obscene film. Criminal and civil proceedings were initiated against defendant corporation and defendant employee. Defendant employee was acquitted on the criminal charge, and the criminal charge against defendant corporation was dropped. The trial court then dismissed the injunction proceeding against defendants because it found Fla. Stat. ch. 847.011 to be unconstitutional because subjecting a defendant to both the civil injunction and criminal penalty portions of ch. 847.011 for a single act constituted a violation of double jeopardy. Plaintiff State of Florida appealed. The supreme court reversed because ch. 847.011 was not unconstitutional. The statute was not unconstitutional because due process was not offended by a statute which allowed both criminal and injunctive relief for the unlawful dissemination of obscenity. Moreover, the statute was not violative of double jeopardy because the injunctive relief was not punitive in nature; thus, such proceedings were civil in nature, and double jeopardy principles did not bar the maintenance of the civil action after termination of the criminal proceedings under the statute.</SPAN></P>

The court held that to expose defendant to a greater penalty than that which originally could be imposed at the time of the commission of the offense would be an ex post facto application and was clearly unconstitutional. The court held that the portion of the district court's opinion dealing with which law was applicable for the imposition of sentence was reversed with instructions to apply the penalty provision in effect at the time of the commission of the offense.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The driver's car was struck by the operator's car.

The driver then appealed, challenging the constitutionality of the no-fault insurance law. On review, the court held that rights of access to the courts were not violated because a reasonable alternative to the traditional tort action was provided. The right of trial by jury was not violated because there was nothing for a jury to consider. Two of the thresholds for recovery for pain and suffering did not violate equal protection; the thresholds for the amount of medical benefits and for death or permanent injury bore substantial relationships to the legislative purpose, were reasonable classes, and treated those within a class equally. The third threshold for a specific non-permanent injury did violate equal protection because it was arbitrary and unreasonable.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged a ruling of the trial court (Florida), which upheld the constitutionality of Fla. Stat. ch. 847.05, prohibiting the public use of indecent or obscene language.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was arrested under the purview of Fla. Stat. ch. 847.05, which prohibited the public use of indecent or obscene language. Following his initial arrest, appellant was then arrested for resisting arrest with violence and possession of marijuana. Appellant claimed that the statute was unconstitutional and asserted that the resultant search and seizure as well as the conviction were invalid. The trial court upheld the constitutionality of the statute and appellant challenged. The court noted that the applicable test for constitutionality required a determination of whether the words of the statute established a standard by which the uttered words conveyed to the transgressor, an average citizen of common understanding, a warning of the conduct prohibited by the statute. The court held that Fla. Stat. ch. 847.05 met the test and, therefore, was constitutional. The decision of the trial court was affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court determined that the statute under which appellant was convicted of obscenity was within constitutional bounds and was not void for overbreadth, but to the contrary, contained language sufficient to convey to a person of common understanding its prohibition. Thus the decision of the trial court was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant municipality filed a petition for condemnation of appellees' property, a declaration of taking, a summons to show cause directed to appellees, and a notice of hearing. Following a hearing, the trial court rendered two resolutions null and void, quashed the declaration, denied the petition for condemnation, and taxed costs and attorney's fees against appellant. The trial court also held Fla. Stat. chs. 73.021, 73.031, 74.031, and 74.041 to be unconstitutional. On appeal, the court held that the trial court erred in its decision. The court determined that the state procedure as outlined within the challenged statutes did provide appellees with adequate notice and an opportunity to be heard at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner. Appellant had the burden of proving that there was a public purpose for the taking and a reasonable necessity that the land was being taken for public use.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Consolidated cases came before the court on a petition for writ of prohibition and return thereto, and a petition for certification of question. The cases had in common the issue of application and operation of the statute of limitations governing the respective prosecutions of petitioner and defendants for the offense of first degree murder, due to changes in the law as to the classification of capital offenses.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner and defendants were charged with first degree murder. Before their prosecutions, the classification of capital offenses was abolished due to a United States Supreme Court decision, which then subjected all capital crimes to prosecution within a two-year period. That situation (the interim period) remained in effect until a death penalty statute was reenacted. Because the parties' prosecutions were commenced beyond the two-year period in effect during the interim period, they argued that the limitations statute should have been given the status of procedure, so that the court would look to the limitation period in effect at the time of the arrest to determine whether their prosecutions were timely instituted. The court held that because both crimes were allegedly committed prior to the decision, the statutes of limitations were substantive and the two-year period to institute prosecution was inapplicable. Petitioner, however, was charged by information after the effective date of the reenacted death penalty statute, which was violative of the procedure for commencement of &quot;capital crimes&quot; trials, which required indictment by a grand jury. The court reversed on that issue.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found that a two-year limitations period for prosecutions of capital offenses, effective during an interim period between changes in the law, did not apply to petitioner and defendants because their crimes of first degree murder were allegedly committed prior to the start of that period. The court did find that petitioner was improperly charged by information after the later change in law. It reversed and remanded as to that issue.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed the decision, finding that the statutes were unconstitutional as applied to appellants and that the state should pay the publication fees. The court found that, pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 63.021, adoption was exclusively a state-created right with exclusive jurisdiction vested in the state court. The court determined that there were fundamental rights involved in the termination of one parent-child relationship and the creation of another through the adoption process, and the required publication fees prevented appellants from their right of access to the court to determine their fitness as persons to adopt. The court concluded there was a fundamental right to have children either through procreation or adoption, and the statutes at issue interfered with that right.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the statutes required respondent to remain a resident of the area from which she was elected both at the time of her election and during her term of office. The court determined that the statutes did not improperly establish additional qualifications for office over and above those in the state constitution because the constitution merely created the office and established the complement of the school board, but did not create any qualifications for the office.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, the minor son and daughter of the decedent, filed an action seeking to recover damages for wrongful death. The decedent died before a new wrongful death statute, and the action was filed after the new statute. Defendants moved to dismiss on the ground that there was no cause of action for wrongful death of a person in Florida who died prior to the new statute. The trial court dismissed the cause, but upon plaintiffs' motion certified questions, including: &quot;Whether the repeal by Chapter 72-35 of Sections 768.01, 768.02 and 768.03 and the restriction of those portions of Chapter 72-35 designated as 768.16 through 768.27 to deaths occurring on and after July 1, 1972, terminated all rights of action for the wrongful deaths of persons dying prior to July 1, 1972 unless said rights of action had been reduced to judgment prior to the effective date of such repeal?&quot; The court answered in the negative, because the incidental repeal of the old law was not intended to nor did it have the effect of destroying the rights of persons for wrongful death under the old law. The old law governed deaths occurring prior to the new statute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that that the new wrongful death statute did not terminate all rights of action for wrongful deaths of persons dying before the new wrongful death statute, and that the old wrongful death statute governed those deaths.

The supreme court held that the states remained free to confine the selection to citizens, to persons meeting specified qualifications of age and educational attainment, and to those possessing good intelligence, sound judgment, and fair character. The supreme court held that while the separate filings for professional persons and others may not be proper, they did not represent a constitutional error. The supreme court further held that appellant failed to establish how these requirements prejudiced him.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court affirmed the constitutionality of the jury selection statute because there was no systematic exclusion of any racial or economic groups. The supreme court further held that appellant failed to establish prejudice.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner father and child brought suit against respondent county and assurance corporation for injuries that arose from the shooting of petitioner child by a deputy sheriff of respondent county. Respondent assurance corporation moved for a severance pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 455.06(2), which was granted by the trial court. Petitioners sought review of the trial court's ruling in the lower appeals court, but it dismissed the action without a discussion of the merits of the cause. On appeal, the supreme court ruled in favor of petitioners. It was apparent from an examination of the record that the lower appeals court's decision was in direct conflict with the supreme court's recent opinion that Fla. Stat. ch. 455.06(2) was unconstitutional. Thus, the lower appeals court's decision was quashed, and the case was remanded for further proceedings consistent with the opinion of the supreme court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was charged by information with inciting and encouraging a riot in violation of Fla. Stat. ch. 870.01(2). Appellant moved to dismiss the information on the ground that the statute was unconstitutional. The trial court denied appellant's motion and appellant sought review. The supreme court reversed the trial court's decision. The supreme court declined to rule on the constitutionality of Fla. Stat. ch. 870.01(2), finding the trial court erred in its failure to dismiss the information charging appellant with inciting and encouraging a riot. The supreme court reasoned the trial court unconstitutionally applied the statute to the facts of the case where the information lacked allegations that clearly established that appellant's actions caused a present danger to the public peace or that any riot actually occurred as a result of his actions. Additionally, appellant's indecent language alone was not sufficient to provoke a riot. Therefore, reversal was necessary.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, petitioner asserted that he should have been afforded an opportunity to present evidence on his mental capacity at the time of sentencing. The appeals court denied petitioner's request. The supreme court quashed the appeals court's decision. The supreme court held that as a general rule the trial court was without discretion at the time of sentencing to consider the mental impairment of petitioner at the time of the crime because the jury had resolved the issue of petitioner's ability to distinguish between right and wrong. The supreme court held, however, that the trial court had the authority to hold an evidentiary hearing at the time of sentencing pursuant to Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.740 to determine petitioner's sanity at the time of sentencing. According to the supreme court, the intent rule 3.740 was that no insane person should be so incarcerated and thereby denied mental treatment.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court granted appellee's petition for writ of habeas corpus and discharged appellee from custody, holding Fla. Stat. ch. 949.10, which imposed automatic revocation of probation upon the charging of a subsequent felony, violated the separation of powers doctrine. The court reversed based on its previous holding that ch. 949.10 was constitutional. The statute had to be read in pari materia with ch. 949.11, 949.12, and 948.06, which provided the proceedings requisite to revocation of probation. Supervision of parole was not a function of the court directly, but that of an administrative agency. Furthermore, Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.790 superseded ch. 949.10 with regard to the trial court's discretionary power to grant bail. Appellee's argument that discharge was proper because there had been no finding of guilt was rejected, as ch. 949.10 applied to probation hearings either with or without an adjudication of guilt, and the case was remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

No lighted fuses had been placed at the crossing as required by Fla. Stat. ch. 357.08. Appellant filed suit against appellee railroad company and the trial court granted in part appellee's motion for summary judgment, holding that Fla.

Appellant sought review and asserted that the statute was within the state's police power. On review, the supreme court held that the statute was within the proper and reasonable exercise of the state's police power and that the law was not an arbitrary or unreasonable exercise of that power. The court ruled that there was a relatively small burden considering the potential threat to human life posed by trains blocking intersections. The court indicated that Fla.

The court reversed the appellate court's decision and held that the proscription against self-incrimination applied to any administrative proceeding of a &quot;penal&quot; character.

However, the court found that the district court was incorrect in finding that appellants could be prosecuted under ch. 794.01 on charges of rape and forcible carnal knowledge. The court found that the district court's radically new interpretation of ch. 794.01, as punishing as criminal conduct that which was not criminal under the existing statutes at the time of the incident, violated the Due Process Clause of the United States Constitution and the Florida Constitution as being ex post facto in its application, because the wording of ch. 794.01 had been changed to include all persons as possible victims, but related crimes classified at common law as sodomy were as yet uncovered.</SPAN></P>

The statute was neither vague nor indefinite but rather was sufficiently clear to give reasonable notice to appellant as to what conduct would render him liable to its penalties.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On direct appeal, appellant challenged the decision of the Circuit Court, Fifteenth Judicial Circuit in and for Palm Beach County (Florida) denying its motion to dismiss numerous counts charged in the information and upholding the constitutionality of Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 828.21, 800.02, and 797.07.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was charged by information with two counts of causing a minor to become a delinquent or dependent child, two counts of unnatural and lascivious acts, and four counts of assignation in violation of Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 828.21, 800.02, and 796.07. Appellant's motion to quash and dismiss the information on grounds the statutes were unconstitutional was denied. Appellant changed his plea of not guilty to a plea of nolo contendere on three counts, and appellant was adjudged guilty. Appellant renewed his constitutional challenges on appeal and argued that the trial court erred by accepting his nolo contendere plea. The court upheld the constitutionality of the statutes finding that they conveyed a sufficiently definite warning as to the proscribed conduct when measured by common understanding and practice. The court held that the words &quot;unnatural and lascivious&quot; or &quot;lewd and lascivious&quot; were of such a character that an ordinary citizen could easily determine what character of act was intended. The court also held that appellant's assignment of error on his plea of nolo contendere was without merit, and thus abandoned, because it was not addressed by his brief.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed appellant's conviction and upheld trial court's findings that the challenged statutes were not unconstitutional for overbreadth and vagueness. The court found that terms used in the statutes conveyed a sufficiently definite warning as to the proscribed conduct, and were of such a character that an ordinary citizen could easily determine what character of act was intended.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">By mandate of the U.S. Supreme Court, reconsideration granted of previous decision involving seizure of &quot;obscene&quot; films under minors statute,&nbsp;Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 847.013.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court concluded that the minors statute,&nbsp;Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 847.013, was constitutional, given that a related obscenity statute,&nbsp;Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 847.011, when subjected to U.S. Supreme Court guidelines, passed constitutional muster. The statute explicitly spelled out sexual acts and conduct, satisfying the obscenity test in requiring offending material to be utterly without redeeming social importance for minors. In addition, the seizure of drive-in movie films to which a minor had been admitted, without check of identification, was proper. The seizure, the court explained, was pursuant to a warrant issued by a judge following an inquiry into the films' obscenity and for the purpose of preserving the material for criminal prosecution; the temporary detention of the film did not deprive the appellant theater operator from showing other film copies. And the statute was not constitutionally infirm by allegedly failing to provide for prompt appellate review; while an appeal would have precedence, no expedited process was sought. Finally, application of community -- county, rather than state -- standards was appropriate in determining whether the films were harmful to minors.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Reconsideration of decision involving seizure of films under obscenity statute supported rulings that statute met constitutional muster by explicitly setting out obscene sex acts that lacked redeeming social value for minors, by providing for prompt appellate review, and seizure of &quot;obscene&quot; films proper when accomplished pursuant to warrant, and application of community -- county -- standards was appropriate to weigh films' harm to minors.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants sought review of the judgments from the Municipal Court of the City of Belle Glade (Florida), and from the County Judge's Court of Jackson County (Florida), which convicted appellants of violating Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect;877.03.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants were both convicted of disorderly conduct in violation of Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 877.03 (the statute) following their participation in a protest march. Appellants sought the court's review of their convictions challenging the constitutional validity of the statute. The court held that in order for the statute to be constitutionally applied, it had to be proved that some act on the part of the accused either corrupted the public morals, outraged the sense of public decency, affected the peace and quiet of persons who witnessed the conduct of the accused, or that the accused engaged in brawling or fighting, or in some conduct which constituted a breach of the peace or disorderly conduct. Therefore, where there was no evidence that either appellant struck or touched a police officer, threatened a police officer physically, or violated the law in any way, appellants' convictions were reversed on the basis of the failure of appellees to prove actions on the part of appellants which would constitute violations of the statute. The judgment of the trial court was accordingly reversed and the causes remanded.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants' convictions reversed where because appellants' actions during the protest march in which they participated did not violate the law in any way, those actions therefore did not constitute violations of the breach of peace/disorderly conduct statute under which appellants were convicted.</SPAN></P>

The court held appellant's motion for a presentence investigation sufficiently suggested that appellant felt there were factors which should have been considered in mitigation of his sentence. The court held that when the trial judge denied the request for a pre-sentence investigation, he should at least have allowed the defendant the opportunity to present evidence as to what such an investigation might have disclosed.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee was informed against for the use of profane, vulgar, and indecent language. A decision holding Fla. Stat.

The statute was sufficiently explicit to withstand the test of vagueness and the charge of overbreadth to inform those who were subject to its provisions as to what conduct on their part would render them liable to the penalties of the law. The enactment of &sect; 847.04 was a valid exercise of the state's police power and was reasonably construed as expedient for the protection of public safety, public welfare, and public morals, in order to maintain public decency and order. The statute did not abridge the constitutional right of liberty of speech. The language sought to be proscribed fell within the narrowly limited classes of speech which included the lewd and obscene, the profane, the libelous, and the insulting or fighting words. The record did not indicate in what context the words were used and the court could not determine whether they were incorporated within the language sought to be proscribed by the statute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the decision because the statutory provision was neither impermissibly vague nor unnecessarily overbroad, nor did it violate the First Amendment or the state's freedom of speech provision.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At the time appellant police officers were hired, a special law provided that they were entitled to a 50 percent refund upon their discharge or resignation of mandatory contributions made to the police pension fund.

The trial court dismissed the complaint, and appellants sought review. The court affirmed. Appellants were estopped from challenging the special law because they had accepted the benefits of their employment contract with appellee city. A person was estopped from asserting right otherwise existing by virtue of the acceptance and retention of benefits which could have been rejected or contested. Further, appellants did not have a due process challenge to the special law because they did not have a property interest in the pension fund.

The court explained that in order to invoke direct appeal jurisdiction, the lower court had to make an express ruling which explained, defined, or overtly stated a view that eliminated existing doubt to a constitutional provision. The court found appellant's attack on the lower court's ruling on search validity did not present an issue of statutory validity. The court found appellant's attack on the petit jury venire and urged error in denial of an evidentiary hearing did not support a direct appeal because the validity of a statute or constitutional provision was not expressly construed in such ruling.

On appeal, the court affirmatively ruled upon the threshold question of whether the attorney were a proper party to the appeal, relying upon a similar case in which a county had been entitled to certiorari review of an order that had directed payment of a fee to a special assistant public defender, even though that county had not been a party in the underlying criminal case. The court next ruled upon whether Fla. Stat. ch. 925.035 were constitutional, holding that Fla. Stat. ch. 925.035 did not violate the Due Process Clause and or the Equal Protection Clauses, either facially or as applied, to the attorney's provision of extraordinary services to an indigent client. The court held that, if a change in the compensation permitted by Fla. Stat. ch. 925.035 were called for, it was the province of the legislature, not the court, to make such a change.</SPAN></P>

After the trial court granted appellee's motion to dismiss, appellant state sought review. On appeal, the court emphasized that the statute could not be used against public officials who exercised their powers of office in ways displeasing to certain segments of the public, unless such conduct directly conflicted with written laws prescribing the obligations of the offices which they held.

The court said that the common law was adopted by legislative act and was modified by subsequent legislation, and the court re-emphasized its proper application in such cases.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At trial, defendant moved to dismiss the charges against him on the grounds that individuals were impermissibly omitted from the petit jury, that the process of selecting the pool for the grand jury was discriminatory, and that 1957 Fla. Laws. Ch. 57-550(5), which sets forth the procedure for selecting the grand jury pool, was unconstitutional. The court ruled that it did not have direct appeal jurisdiction over the petit jury and discrimination in the grand jury issues because the trial court did not pass on the constitutionality of any law in denying defendant dismissal on these grounds. The court emphasized that a trial court had to do more than merely apply a construction of a statute to the facts in the case to warrant direct appeal review by the court. The court exercised jurisdiction over the issue involving the constitutionality of ch. 57-550 because the trial court ruled on the constitutionality of ch. 57-550. Relying on recent decisions from the court, the court found that ch. 57-550 was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Movant, a witness in a grand jury proceeding, moved to strike and suppress evidence obtained through a wiretap authorized under Fla. Stat. ch. 934.07. The trial court denied the motion, and the district court affirmed, finding that movant did not have standing to attack the admission of the evidence. The court granted the petition for writ of certiorari and quashed the district court's decision. The court determined that movant had standing to challenge the admission of the wiretap evidence under Fla. Stat. ch. 934.09(9)(a) because he was an &quot;aggrieved person&quot; involved in a &quot;proceeding&quot; before a court. In so finding, the court ruled that grand jury investigations were judicial proceedings in court. The court noted that the omission of the term &quot;grand jury&quot; from ch. 934.09(9)(a) was inadvertent, and without the right to challenge admission of evidence, witnesses before a grand jury would face denial of their right to privacy without any protection from the courts. The court also ruled that movant was entitled to have the contents of the wiretap suppressed because the evidence obtained through the wiretap was not related to a crime enumerated in ch. 934.07.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of breaking and entering with the intent to commit a felony. Appellant was also convicted of possession of burglary tools, based on his possession of a screwdriver. On appeal, appellant challenged the concurrent sentences imposed by the trial court for the two convictions. The appellate court affirmed the sentences. The court reversed the sentences and remanded for resentencing. The court ruled that it was inappropriate to sentence appellant to concurrent sentences for two facets of the same transaction. The court noted that the district court erred in distinguishing the facts of the present case from prior decisions requiring one sentence for convictions involving the same criminal conduct. The court observed that since appellant could not have been convicted of possession of burglary tools for the simple possession of screwdriver without the conviction for breaking and entering with the intent to commit a felony, concurrent sentences for these convictions was inappropriate.</SPAN></P>

The court further found that the manner for establishing that right was properly set forth in ch. 196.131.

Fla.

Appellant contended that Fla. Const. art. III, &sect; 10 required notice of intention to enact the laws if they were special laws. On appeal, the court held that the laws were considered special or local laws. As such, the state constitution required publication of notice of intent to enact.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The claim for premiums on workmen's compensation policies arose from the mistake in issuing one policy with incorrect experience modification factors. Plaintiff challenged the constitutionality of the rating statutes involved namely Fla. Stat. ch. 627.091 and 627.291. Plaintiff argued that these two sections were an unlawful delegation of legislative power and a denial of due process of equal protection under the state and federal constitutions. The court found that the legislature may delegate to authorized officials and agencies the authority to promulgate subordinate rules within prescribed limits. What the legislature may not delegate was the power to enact laws or to declare what the law shall be or to exercise unrestricted discretion in applying the law. Fla. .Stat. ch. 627.091, when read in conjunction with Fla. Stat. ch. 627.072, was not an improper delegation of legislative power because through Fla. Stat. ch. 627.072 the necessary guidelines and standards to be followed in establishing rates and rating plans have been provided by the legislature. The court affirmed the decision of the lower court as plaintiff had failed to exhaust his administrative remedies.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the decision of the lower court because the summary judgment was expressly based upon defendant's failure to exhaust administrative remedies under the statute, and thereby precluded a challenge of the billed rates in the lower court proceedings.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Consolidated for review were two cases before the court on direct appeal transferred from the Third District Court of Appeal (Florida) as passing upon the constitutionality of 1957 Fla. Laws ch. 57-550 and 1970 Fla. Laws ch. 70-1000 relating to grand jury selection and composition in the larger counties of the state having a population of 450,000 or more.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In consolidated appeals, one appellant found guilty of murder and the other appellant charged with rape challenged the constitutionality of 1957 Fla. Laws ch. 57-550 and 1970 Fla. Laws ch. 70-1000 relating to grand jury selection and composition in the larger counties of the state having a population of 450,000 or more, and so challenged the grand jury indictments against them. The court affirmed each cause. The court found that both appellants waived their asserted challenge to the grand jury panel afforded them under Fla. Stat. chs 905.02, 905.03, and 905.04. Because appellants chose not to challenge the grand jury at the proper time under the statutes, they could not do so on appeal. Nevertheless, the court also ruled that ch. 70-1000 was constitutional. The court said that the multiple number of circuit judges in large circuits was calculated to reflect a fair cross section of the citizens, and that those judges were particularly suited to the task of selecting grand jurors.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner, an out-of-state corporation, brought an original proceeding in mandamus seeking to compel respondents, the comptroller of the state of Florida and the Florida Department of Revenue, to refund a certain amount it paid to the state in sales tax on the sale of food from vending machines. An alternative writ was issued, returns were filed, and petitioner moved for the issuance of a peremptory writ notwithstanding the returns.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner sold food and drink items from vending machines at various locations within Florida. Petitioner was required to pay a tax on its sales, under rules and regulations promulgated by respondents that they construed as a sales tax statute. The legislature later amended the tax law to specifically provide that items such as those sold by petitioner were not exempt from the sales tax. When petitioner learned of the enactment, it demanded a refund, asserting that its sales were not taxable prior to the enactment of the amended statute. An original proceeding in mandamus was brought, returns were filed, and petitioner moved for the issuance of a peremptory writ notwithstanding the returns. The court found that the determination by respondents in the rules and regulations was not clearly erroneous in light of legislative intent. Moreover, the court found that the legislature in enacting the amendment merely intended to clarify its original intention, rather than change the tax law. Finally, petitioner bore no tax liability because it was supposed to have added the tax in the purchase price. The motion for peremptory writ was denied and an alternative writ was discharged.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner's motion for a peremptory writ was denied because the court found that a determination by respondent state taxing authorities of a certain tax statute to impose a sales tax on food items sold by petitioner was not clearly erroneous, and an amendment to that statute by the legislature was only intended to clarify its original intention, rather than change the law. An alternative writ previously issued to petitioner was also discharged.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee was informed against for contributing to the delinquency of a minor in violation of Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 828.19 (1971) because he unlawfully encouraged a minor to become delinquent by having unlawful sexual intercourse with her. Appellee filed a motion to dismiss the information because the statute was unconstitutional as overbroad and void for vagueness. The trial court dismissed the charge and ruled that the statute was unconstitutional. The supreme court reversed and remanded the lower court's order. The court found that the statutory provision was neither impermissibly vague nor unnecessarily overbroad. The court applied the test for vagueness, which determined whether the language of the statute conveyed a sufficiently definite warning as to the proscribed conduct when measured by common understanding and practice. The court held that the statute provided persons with notice of the prohibited acts and was not so broad that it would have led to arbitrary and erratic arrests and convictions. The court ordered that a new information be charged against appellee because the charging information was inadequate to state the statutory crime charged.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of forcible rape, and he appealed his conviction. He argued that he was denied due process of the law because attorney's were excluded from the grand jury pursuant to Fla. Laws ch. 57-550, and the grand jury was constitutionally infirm because the master list from which the jurors were drawn was the product of the subjective choices of the grand jury commissioners. In affirming the conviction, the court held that the reasonableness of the exclusion of lawyers from jury duty classification has long been recognized, and there was nothing in the statute that denied any rights secured by the U.S. Constitution. Defendant's effort to impeach his victim was without merit because he had no right to examine a statement by the victim. The statement he sought was available as a public record and defendant made no reasonable effort to procure the statement from the police. Also, the record failed to demonstrate any materiality concerning the alleged inconsistent statements. Defendant could not raise the failure to instruct on lesser-included offenses issue because he failed to meet the requirements of Fla. App. R. 6.7g.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction of forcible rape holding that the exemption of lawyers from jury duty was not uncommon, and it was not error to refuse to grant defendant's motion to examine the statement of the victim.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, owner of an adult theater, had displayed two films that were seized. He was convicted of publicly exhibiting the films in violation of Florida's obscenity statute,&nbsp;Fla. Stat. ch. 847.011. Because the trial judge ruled ch. 847.011was constitutional, a direct appeal was taken to the Florida Supreme Court. That court affirmed appellant's conviction, and held that ch. 847.011 was constitutional. The Florida Supreme Court held that the trial court used the standards for obscenity in force at the time of the violations, which did not include the newest test and guidelines provided by the United States Supreme Court. To have used standards that came into being after the violation would have been prosecution ex post facto. As to the constitutional sufficiency of ch. 847.011 per se, the trial judge was correct in applying local community standards in the trial, which was the standard set forth in Fla.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants' appeals were consolidated on questions as to whether capital punishment was unconstitutional if certified by the Circuit Courts of Dade, Duval, and Orange Counties (Florida), and the State appealed from a decision of the Circuit Court for Dade County (Florida) that Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 775.082 and 921.141 were unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State appealed the lower court's ruling that death penalty provisions were unconstitutional, and defendants appealed on questions certified by the lower courts as to whether the capital punishment law was unconstitutional. The court held that the death penalty was not, per se, violative of the constitution. It was the quality of discretion and the manner in which it was applied that led to death penalty laws being struck down. If judicial discretion, which was possible and necessary under the statute, was shown to be reasonable and controlled, rather than capricious and discriminatory, the current constitutional test was met. The court considered the procedures provided by the statute and the safeguards of defined aggravating and mitigating circumstances and found that the process was reasonable, rather than discriminatory or capricious, with specific standards and meaningful restraints and guidelines. Further, the wording was not vague, but was understandable. Therefore, the court held that Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 775.082, 782.04, and 921.141 were constitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court answered the certified questions in the negative, determining that the capital punishment statute was constitutional. The court reversed the lower court decision which had found the statute to be unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Florida Bar sought the adoption of a Code of Judicial Conduct in lieu of the existing Canons of Judicial Ethics. The court found that the purpose of Fla. Stat. ch. 123.09 and 123.20 was to prohibit a retired judge subject to assignment from engaging in the practice of law while drawing retirement compensation provided by the state. However, other retirees under Fla. Stat. ch. 121 were allowed to receive retirement benefits while employed at other occupations. Thus, the court held that Fla. Stat. ch. 123.09 and 123.20 were unconstitutional because it would be a denial of equal protection to say that all retirees, except justices and judges, might engage in other employment without losing retirement benefits. The proposed Code required that many incumbent justices and judges be required to rearrange their financial business interests. Thus, the court held that it would allow the incumbent justices and judges a period of two years within which to bring themselves in strict compliance with the Canon.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant political candidate demanded that appellee newspaper print his replies to appellee's editorials attacking his character. Appellee refused; appellant filed a complaint for declaratory and injunctive relief and punitive damages, under Fla. Stat. ch. 104.38. The trial court determined that the provision was a criminal statute and that equity would not ordinarily enjoin commission of a crime. The trial court further concluded that the statute was violative of Fla. Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 4 and 9 and U.S. Const. art. XIV. The court here believed that this statute enhanced rather than abridged freedom of speech and press and would encourage rather than impede wide open and robust dissemination of ideas and counter-thought. It strengthened freedom of the press and speech in that it presented both views leaving the reader to reach his own conclusion. The provision was also not impermissibly vague or unnecessarily broad. The court held that it did not constitute a constitutional violation and reversed the trial court in that regard, but agreed that it was criminal in nature and absent special circumstances, equity would not enjoin the commission of a crime.</SPAN></P>

Stat. ch. 69-192 was unconstitutional as applied to a certain inter vivos trust agreement executed prior to the law's effective date and that it had no application to savings and bank account trusts unrelated to interests in real property.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant widow's husband executed a savings account discretionary revocable trust agreement with a savings association in behalf of appellee daughter. The husband was listed as trustee for appellee. Thereafter, Fla. Stat. ch. 69-192 became effective. Subsequently, the husband executed five additional trust agreements in appellee's behalf. After he died intestate, appellant became administratrix. She filed a declaratory judgment proceeding. The circuit court held that Fla. Stat. ch. 69-192 was unconstitutional as applied to the initial trust agreement executed prior to the law's effective date and that it did not affect the subsequent agreements because it did not apply to savings and bank account trusts unrelated to interests in real property. On appeal, the court agreed with the circuit court's judgment and its distinction between trust accounts established under Fla. Stat. ch. 665, 669 and those relating to interests in real estate governed by ch. 69-192. Moreover, there was no evidence that the accounts were illusory and an attempt to defraud appellant.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment holding statute was unconstitutional or inapplicable to trusts in behalf of appellee daughter was affirmed because the first trust was a contract in being which could not be impaired, a distinction existed between savings and bank account trusts and those trusts relating to the interests in real property governed by the statute, and no evidence supported that the accounts were illusory and attempted to defraud appellant widow.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant pawnshop owner brought suit against appellee sheriff for declaratory and injunctive relief concerning the provisions of Fla. Stat. ch. 811.165, which required appellant to maintain records for his pawnbroker business. Appellant alleged that the statute, which appellee enforced, was unconstitutionally vague and denied him equal protection of the laws. Appellant also alleged that he suffered loss of customers and other hardships as a result of the statute. Appellant and appellee filed cross motions for summary judgment. The trial court granted summary judgment to appellee. On appeal, the court held that the statute was neither vague nor ambiguous because the statute's language conveyed sufficient warning to the proscribed conduct when measured by common understanding and practice. The statute did not violate the equal protection clauses of the federal and state constitutions. Frustrating the sale of stolen merchandise and greatly enhancing the possibility of return of such items to their rightful owners was in the interest of public welfare. Classifying retailers was a constitutionally valid exercise of legislative power. The judgment was accordingly affirmed.</SPAN></P>

Stat. ch. 627.738, appellant had no right of action against appellees because appellant had no property damage insurance and her damages did not exceed $ 550. On appeal, the court held that ch. 627.738 was unconstitutional because it violated Fla. Const. art. I, &sect; 21, which guaranteed the right to have access to the courts. The court determined that Fla. Stat. ch. 627.738 was unconstitutional because ch. 627.738 was enacted after the adoption of the state constitution, and appellant would have had a right of action at the time the constitution was adopted.

He was convicted, sentenced to jail, and fined for contempt without the benefit of a jury trial. The district court affirmed. On appeal, the court stated that criminal contempt trials were effectively criminal in nature. The court held that Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.804(a)(4), which allowed the trial court to try the contempt case without a jury, did not pass constitutional muster. It authorized a judge to impose a sentence of over six months' imprisonment without empanelling a jury to try the facts. The court further held that if a judge contemplated a sentence of less than six months, a jury would not have to be empanelled. Because petitioner's sentence was four months, it fell within the constitutional limitations of the law. Lastly, the court held that the trial court's denial of petitioner's motions to take a juror's deposition and for a bill of particulars was error.

Nevertheless, the court answered the certified question affirmatively and held that a plaintiff in an action based on negligence would no longer be denied any recovery because of plaintiff's contributory negligence. The court applied its opinion to cases already commenced, but did not apply its opinion as to those cases in which trial had already begun or in which verdict or judgment had already been rendered, unless the applicability of comparative negligence was appropriately and properly raised during some stage of the litigation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner pleaded guilty to two informations charging him with breaking and entering and grand larceny. In the plea negotiations, the state would not agree to petitioner's desire to have a finding of guilt only so that he could remain in the army. The court accepted the plea over the state's objection and sentenced petitioner to 30 days in jail after finding him guilty. After the hearing was concluded, the state's attorney objected to the sentence, and the court set aside the adjudication and withdrew petitioner's plea of guilty on his behalf. The district court of appeal affirmed the trial court's modified judgment. The supreme court quashed the judgment of the court of appeals and reinstated the original finding and sentence because after petitioner was found guilty and sentenced, jeopardy had attached and the court was without power to modify the sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court quashed the judgment court of appeals and reinstated the trial court's original sentence, holding that once petitioner had entered a voluntary plea of guilty, sentence had been imposed, and the hearing had been concluded, the trial court was without power to increase petitioner's sentence under the constitutional protection against double jeopardy.</SPAN></P>

The court found appellant was granted leave to intervene in the case for purposes of appeal after the trial judge declared the last sentence of Fla. Stat. ch. 553.38(3)&nbsp;unconstitutional. Appellee contended that in another case a comptroller of the state of Florida did not have the right to appeal a decision of a trial judge declaring a state statute to be unconstitutional because the comptroller had not been a party in the trial court. However, the reviewing court stated that appellant was the chief legal officer of the state and was charged to appear in matters where the state may be a party pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 16.01. Although it would be futile for appellant to defend each statute against all constitutional challenges at the trial level, when the trial court found a statute to be unconstitutional, it was proper that appellant appear on appeal to defend the statute.

Appellees sought to administer to him the oath required of prospective voters in Florida by Fla. Stat. ch. 97.051. Appellant refused to take the oath, and appellees accordingly refused to register him as a voter. Thereupon appellant brought an action in the circuit court which sought to test the constitutionality of Fla. Stat. ch. 97.051. The circuit court granted appellees' motion for summary judgment, and appellant sought review of the decision in the state supreme court. The state supreme court affirmed the decision. Fla. Const. art. VI, &sect; 3 provided explicitly for the questioned oath to be administered to prospective voters. Appellant was contending that his &quot;constitutional rights&quot; were denied by the requirement to subscribe to the oath demanded by that very constitution as a condition to the exercise of the right. The state supreme court held that appellant's position was completely devoid of merit or reason and that the oath in question conflicted with neither state nor the federal constitution provisions.</SPAN></P>

Appellant city contended that, as of the enactment of the special law, appellee utility company was no longer regulated by appellee commission. Appellee utility company maintained that the special law was unconstitutional because it violated Fla. Const. art. III, &sect; 11(a)(20). The trial court found in favor of appellees and held the special law was unconstitutional and invalid as it applied to appellee utility company because violated art. III, &sect;11(a)(20). The supreme court reversed the trial court's finding and held the special law was constitutional.

The trial court granted appellees' motion to dismiss and explicitly declared ch. 704.05 to be unconstitutional. On appeal, the supreme court held that because ch. 704.05 did not operate retrospectively, the trial court's decision was correct in that it granted appellees' motion to dismiss. The court held, however, that a determination of the validity of ch. 704.05 was not required for the disposition of the case and, therefore, it would not reach the issue of the statute's constitutionality. The supreme court held that the fact that it was unnecessary for the trial court to reach the issue of the statute's constitutionality did not divest it of its jurisdiction to dispose of the entire matter on appeal.

The court rejected appellants' argument that the proposed purchase and takeover violated Fla. Const. art, VII, &sect; 10 or Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 349.04. The court found that the purchase of the bus system was not a purchase on a deferred basis that required the issuance of bonds and that the aid provided by the city through the use of municipal funds was for the public acquisition and operation of the bus system and was authorized by law. The court held that the purchase did not constitute an extending of public funds or credit to aid private corporations, that the management contract and the fees to be paid were to employ expert managerial service for the successful operation of the bus system through the transitional period from private to public ownership, and that such management fees were payable only from appellees' revenues.</SPAN></P>

V and XIV, and by Fla. Const. art. I, &sect; 9. The court agreed, acknowledging that the asserted right against self incrimination, originally limited to criminal actions, had been extended to proceedings &quot;penal&quot; in nature, irrespective of whether they were classified as criminal or civil in the traditional sense. Because the statutory sanction threatened by respondent in its administrative proceeding subjected relator to revocation of his license and loss of livelihood if he failed to answer the information, the statute was coercive and suffered a constitutional infirmity. However, relator was not denied due process by respondent's rules limiting discovery, as he was entitled to present all matters in his defense before respondent.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, school districts and a county commissioner, sought review of the judgment from the Circuit Court for Leon County (Florida) that held that Fla. Stat. 236.07, which gave the state auditor-general the right to determine the accuracy of an assessment by the county tax assessor for school funding purposes by using a ratio study of an assessment roll compared to the full value, did not violate Fla. Const. art. VII, &sect; 4.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">As part of a state-wide school funding program, the state auditor-general was authorized by Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 236.07(8)(a) to determine the correctness of a county tax assessor's property assessment by preparing a study of the ratio of the assessment roll compared to the full value of the property. Appellants, school districts and a county commissioner, challenged the validity of the statute, and the trial court held that it was constitutional. On appeal, the court held that a county tax assessor had a duty under Fla. Const. art. VII, &sect; 4 to assess all property at full value. The tax assessor was given broad discretion in making the assessment, and the assessments were presumed to be correct. Because Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 236.07(8)(a) usurped the duties of the tax assessor, and because &sect; 196.092 gave the state the right to challenge the assessments in court, &sect; 236.07(8)(a) was unconstitutional insofar as it allowed the auditor to make an independent assessment. Therefore, the court reversed the judgment and remanded the case with instructions to enter judgment for appellants.</SPAN></P>

Stat. ch. 61.052. The court certified three questions to the court: to determine whether the law improperly affected property rights under Fla. Const. art. I, &sect; 10; whether the law was unconstitutionally vague, uncertain and indefinite; and whether the law applied retroactively to marriages before the law was enacted. The court held that divorce was a state law creation, and did not exist beyond legislative enactment, and thus did not interfere with the parties' property rights. The court also determined that the law was not vague, uncertain, and indefinite, because the court was able to construe the law to the parties to avoid an unconstitutional result, and was not any more vague than the previous version of the divorce law. Finally, the court concluded that the law did apply retroactively, because it was the legislative prerogative to amend or change dissolution laws, and the court's duty was merely to apply the law as given. The court answered the certified questions, and remanded back to the federal court for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court upheld the validity of Fla. Stat. ch. 790.26, which made it unlawful for any person in the state to assemble any pistol, revolver, or other handgun from parts manufactured or originating from outside the United States. Petitioners, manufacturers in Florida of firearms utilizing foreign parts, challenged the statute on several grounds. Petitioners contended that the regulation of foreign commerce, including the power to exclude foreign products, was a power reserved to Congress and that the state had not shown that a police power exception applied. The state urged that Fla. Stat. ch. 790.26 was a valid exercise of the police power in that it proposed to protect the public safety by cutting off a source of cheap, dangerous, easily-concealed handguns. The court reversed the decision, holding that there was no evidence that the statute would effectively prevent the manufacture of cheap handguns. Therefore, Fla. Stat. ch. 790.26 was unconstitutional as an unjustifiable invasion of the power to regulate foreign commerce, which had been delegated to Congress.</SPAN></P>

The state supreme court reversed the decision and instructed the lower court to vacate its initial decision authorizing appellee to incorporate appellants' land. The court held Fla. Stat. ch. 298.07 was constitutional. The establishment of a drainage district created exactly the same benefits and duties for the included landowners as were created when land was incorporated into an existing district by amendment.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant fire district, a special taxing district created by legislation, sought to issue bonds to help provide fire protection for the property encompassed by the fire district. The financing was to come from taxes based on an assessment plan authorized by 1970 Fla. Laws ch. 70-933 and approved by the voters in a referendum election. Appellee commercial property owners filed suit attacking the validity of 1970 Fla. Laws ch. 70-933. The circuit court held the act to be unconstitutional and denied the validation of the bond issue because part of the repayment plan had been invalidated. The supreme court found that the facts in the case failed to show that the legislature had acted in an arbitrary and unwarranted manner. All that had been shown was the comparative value of the commercial property involved and the fact that the taxes had risen sharply for appellees. Other considerations, including frequency of fires, manpower and equipment requirements, and benefits extended to commercial properties were not sufficiently rebutted. The court concluded that appellees had not met the burden of clearly showing the invalidity of the act. The contrary judgments were reversed and remanded.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In an action on a mortgage note, an equitable defense was sustained for a credit to appellee mortgagors. Appellant trustee sought review, but the supreme court determined that it did not have jurisdiction and dismissed the appeal. The court concluded that it lacked jurisdiction because the decision below failed to explain or define any constitutional terms. During the proceedings before the district court, two constitutional questions pertaining to alleged impairment of contracts, Fla. Const. art. I, &sect; 10, and denial of equal protection, Fla. Const. art. I, &sect; 2, were raised for the first time. Notwithstanding, the affirming decision of the district court did not discuss or refer to any constitutional provision or argument. Appellant suggested as a basis for supreme court jurisdiction that the district court &quot;inherently&quot; construed the constitutional provisions. The supreme court held that the &quot;inherency&quot; doctrine did not apply. Instead, the Armstrong rule applied, which stated that a judgment did not construe a provision of the constitution unless it undertook to explain, define, or otherwise eliminate existing doubts arising from the language or terms of the provision.</SPAN></P>

Reviewing the legislative record, the court found that the tax exemption statute at issue was intended to reduce the disparity between the economic capabilities of men and women by reducing the tax burden on women whose husbands had died.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant county civil service employees filed suit challenging the validity and constitutionality of 1967 Fla. Laws ch. 1370, &sect;&sect; 18, 23, which prohibited county employees from engaging in political activity. The trial court determined that the statutes were generally valid, but struck &sect; 18 because it unconstitutionally imposed criminal sanctions for political activity. Appellants sought review. The supreme court affirmed the judgment of the trial court, holding that &sect; 18 was unconstitutional but that &sect; 23 was constitutional and valid. The supreme court held that the statute was more specific and narrowly defined than its federal counterpart, which had been pronounced constitutional. In addition, there was no doubt about what constituted prohibited political activity under the statute. The supreme court was not authorized to consider the wisdom or necessity of legislative enactments, but simply their constitutionality.</SPAN></P>

However, the court found appellant's contention as to the insufficiency of the evidence against him to be meritorious and concluded that the evidence was insufficient to convict appellant of a violation of ch. 822.23. The court held that the evidence as a whole did sufficiently establish appellant's guilt under the omnibus provisions of a lesser offense prescribed in Fla.

The appellants filed an appeal from a decision of the trial court which determined that a newly promulgated rule by the Division of Pari-Mutual Wagering, Rule 305 A-1.23(17), was unconstitutional. The rule set forth a minimum jockey fee schedule for payment of jockeys in absence of contract. In a declaratory judgment proceeding, the appellants defended the rule on the two-fold theory that: the state's inherent police power appropriately embraced the profession of jockeying, and the division was authorized to exercise that power in the manner under contest by Fla.

The court held that the legislature had not specifically authorized the setting of fees, and this was too broad a power to be derived from the general statutes cited. The Fla. Const. art.

Judicial cognizance of municipal ordinances was neither required nor barred by statute.

At trial, the evidence that STP was a hallucinogenic drug was given by a chemist who testified that STP was listed in the U.S. Registry of Drugs one year after &sect; 404.01(3) applied, but the registry was not introduced into evidence. The appellate court affirmed the conviction. On certiorari review, the court held that the trial court did not err in taking judicial notice of the registry without more, because it was part of the official records of an administrative agency. However, because the legislature could not adopt in advance any federal act or ruling, and because STP was not an illegal drug when &sect; 404.01(3) took effect, STP was not an illegal drug as defined in &sect; 404.01(3) and petitioner did not violate Florida law.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant nightclub commenced an action against appellee city, which sought to enjoin the enforcement of Fort Lauderdale City Ordinance, C-70-34, which fixed the hours for selling alcoholic beverages within the city. Appellant specifically asserted that the ordinance and Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 562.14(3), which authorized the city to adopt such ordinance, were unconstitutional. The trial court found the statute and the ordinance to be constitutional and appellant sought review. Fla. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 5 provided that the sale of intoxicating liquors was to be regulated by law. Section 2(b) provided that municipalities had governmental powers to enable them to conduct municipal government and exercise any power for municipal purposes except as otherwise provided by law. Thus, the court affirmed the trial court's judgment, which held that the statute and ordinance in question were constitutional. Furthermore, even though other municipalities in close proximity to appellee city had established hours governing the sale of intoxicating beverages different from those set by appellee, that in no way affected the validity of the statute or the ordinance.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Florida statute regulating the time for sale of alcoholic beverages was a general law relating to all municipalities and therefore did not violate Florida's constitution. Thus, the statute was constitutional and the city ordinance enacted by appellee city pursuant to the authority granted by the statute was valid, constitutional, and enforceable against appellant nightclub. Thus, the judgment of the trial court was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

The trial court entered judgment for appellee comptroller, and the court affirmed the trial court's decision. Fla. Stat. ch. 212.06 required that the full cost to appellant be the basis of the tax, and the relevant cost price was that of the fabricated steel rather than that of the raw steel before fabrication. Appellees' failure to collect the sheet metal tax had not invalidated the tax on structural steel because it would have been constitutionally permissible to levy a use tax on structural steel alone.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee taxpayers, who were also members of the state senate, sought a declaratory judgment against various state agencies, asserting that certain sections of the1971 General Appropriations Act, 1971 Fla. Laws ch. 357, violated the Florida Constitution. Appellant filed a motion to dismiss for failure to state a cause of action and for lack of standing to sue and, further, that there was not a justiciable controversy qualifying the complaint for declaratory judgment under the statute. The trial court denied the motion to dismiss. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court recognized that if the General Appropriations Act was immunized from attack by ordinary citizens, then there would be no avenue of relief even if it were illegal, should the appropriate public officials choose not to sue. Therefore, the court created an exception to requirement that a taxpayer show a special injury in order to have standing. The court held that where there was an attack upon constitutional grounds based directly on the legislature's taxing and spending power, there was standing to sue without the requirement of special injury.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellant was charged with violating Fla. Stat. ch. 790.19. A motion to dismiss on the ground that the statute was unconstitutionally vague and uncertain was overruled by the trial court. The court held that the test of a statute, insofar as vagueness was concerned, was whether the language conveyed sufficiently definite warning as to the proscribed conduct when measured by common understanding and practice. The constitutional requirement of definiteness was violated by a criminal statute that failed to give a person of ordinary intelligence fair notice that his contemplated conduct was forbidden by the statute. The underlying principle was that no man should be held criminally responsible for conduct which he could not reasonably understand to be proscribed. The court held that the statute was impervious to a constitutional attack upon the grounds stated. The court determined that any person of ordinary intelligence would have notice that wantonly and maliciously throwing a 12-ounce soft drink bottle at a police van from a distance of less than 15 yards was forbidden by the statute. The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the question concerning bifurcated trials was moot, because at that time capital punishment could not be imposed. The court held, therefore, that the trial judge did not have the power to impose the death sentence. The court based its holding on the rule that there were no capital offenses in Florida, and if there were no capital offenses, there could be no capital penalty. The court further found that the punishment for what were formerly capital offenses under Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 775.082(1), which became effective January 1, 1972, was life imprisonment.</SPAN></P>

The circuit court dismissed the complaint with leave to amend. On appeal, the court held the appeal was premature and interlocutory in that it was filed prior to the expiration of the 30-day amendment period. However, because no prejudice to the rights of the parties could have resulted from the failure to wait, the court held it would not dismiss the appeal. Instead, it temporarily relinquished jurisdiction of the cause to the circuit court for entry of final judgment dismissing the complaint. Thereafter, it directed the circuit court to return the cause to the court for a determination of jurisdiction. Appellants were also permitted to file a new notice of appeal directed to the final judgment, and the interlocutory appeal would merge with the full appeal. Additionally, the court directed the circuit court to further clarify and identify the reasons that led to the dismissal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant architect allegedly held himself out to the public as being in an architectural partnership with another person who was not a registered architect or registered engineer. Appellant was also alleged to have improperly affixed his name and seal on architectural drawings prepared by non-architects in violation of Fla. Stat. chs. 467.14(1)(c) and 467.15(2). In accordance with these statutes, appellee state architectural board revoked appellant's certificate of registration. Appellant sought review in the lower court because he claimed that the statutes were unconstitutional and that revocation was too severe. The lower court upheld the statutes' constitutionality and denied the writ. The state supreme court determined that the statutes were constitutional but remanded the lower court's decision. The court determined that appellee abused its discretion by ordering appellee's license revoked rather than suspended for a brief period or directing a reprimand.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant father, individually and as administrator, challenged the constitutionality of the Workmen's Compensation Act (Act), Fla. Stat. ch. 440, which limited benefits for the death of appellant's minor son in an industrial accident to those survivors financially dependent upon him. The court affirmed the constitutionality of the Act, finding that appellant's preclusion from receiving benefits because neither he, nor any survivors of the child, was financially dependent upon the child was not discriminatory. The court determined that the child voluntarily entered into optional coverage under the Act, and bound himself and his representatives and survivors to that exclusive liability. The court concluded that the mutual trade-off between the minor and his employer met the purpose and intent of the Act in allowing for quick resolution of work-related claims and the avoidance of timely, costly, and uncertain litigation. The court found that limiting benefits to those survivors financially dependent upon the employee comported with the intent of the Act to provide for the loss of earning power and did not encompass damages normally related to traditional tort claims.</SPAN></P>

The trial court entered judgment for defendants, upholding the constitutionality of the statute. The court reversed. It rejected defendants' argument that the law was required to protect the public health, morals, and safety. While certain malformations could so affect the morals and general welfare of the public as to lend them to a prohibition by a proper law, which set appropriate standards, this statute contained no such standards. An individual had the right to pursue a lawful occupation and this was a property right protected by the constitution. Further, the validity of the statute as a regulation for the protection of the public health, morals and welfare was questionable in light of the fact that the statute only prohibited exhibitions where admission was charged.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the death penalty was declared illegal, the court vacated the death sentence of 60 persons convicted of both murder and rape and remanded each for resentencing.

Petitioner requested that the court impose life sentences on the convicted murderers and indeterminate sentences of time served to life imprisonment on convicted rapists, remanding them to the trial court for discretionary sentencing. The court held that it had granted the requested relief to 27 members of the class and found no reason why the remaining members should be treated differently. The court held it was in the best interests of the public to impose life imprisonment on all members of the class sentenced to death who had committed murder. Life imprisonment was also imposed on those convicted of rape, but with instructions remanding them to their respective trial court for further consideration of the sentence with the opportunity for mitigation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">By mandate of the United States Court of Appeals, Fifth Circuit, the court was required to review petitioner's first degree murder conviction that had occurred 27 years previously because petitioner's appeal of the trial court's denial of his motion for a new trial had been perfected, but never prosecuted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1944, petitioner and his codefendants were convicted of first degree murder. Petitioner was 14 years old at the time. A series of appeals and post-conviction proceedings followed. Finally, almost 27 years after petitioner's conviction, the federal court of appeals remanded the case to the federal district court with directions that the state supreme court had to review petitioner's conviction. The federal appellate court held that an appeal filed of the trial court's denial of petitioner's motion for a new trial had been perfected, but never prosecuted. On remand, the court affirmed. The evidence was sufficient to show that petitioner had rendered assistance in the commission of the crime and was guilty as a principle. Petitioner's right to effective assistance of counsel was not denied by the shortness of the time allowed for preparation because a criminal prosecution in 1944 was not complicated, and there were no discovery proceedings. Also, petitioner did not show that his trial counsel had been incompetent. Petitioner failed to object to the composition of the grand and petit juries. Petitioner received a fair trial in accordance with the law as it existed in 1944.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the lower court that convicted petitioner of first degree murder. The evidence was sufficient to establish that petitioner had rendered assistance in the commission of the crime and was guilty as a principle, there was no reversible error, and petitioner received a fair trial in accordance with the law as it existed in 1944.</SPAN></P>

App. P. 2.1(5)(d), 32 F.S.A., appellant attorney general filed a motion requesting that the court temporarily relinquish jurisdiction and remand 40 cases in which the death penalty was imposed to the respective circuit courts for the imposition of life sentences. The court held that it should correct the illegal sentences previously imposed without returning the prisoners to the trial court. The sentences were corrected to provide that each of the named parties be imprisoned for the term of his natural life. The sentences of the named parties convicted of the crime of rape without recommendation of mercy and sentenced to death were vacated and set aside, and the court was to relinquish jurisdiction solely for the purpose of imposition of an appropriate legal sentence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner was convicted of conspiracy to commit a felony, sale of marijuana, and possession of marijuana and he sought review of the appellate court's ruling that evidence taken from his parents' home was admissible. The court quashed the appellate court's decision, ruling first that the appellate court erroneously concluded that the unannounced entry into the home of petitioner's parents for the purpose of making that arrest was proper under Fla. Stat. ch. 901.19(1). Essential was testimony by the arresting officers or other competent evidence that they had reasonable grounds to believe the marijuana within the house would have been immediately destroyed if they announced their presence. The court held that absent such evidence, the fruits of any search conducted pursuant to such arrest were illegally obtained, and petitioner's signed consent, while sitting on a bed beside an open box of marijuana wrapped in plastic bags, was tainted and could not be upheld.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court quashed the appellate court's decision upholding petitioner's conviction and ruled that the marijuana evidence should not have been introduced at trial, holding that it was seized pursuant to an unconstitutional consent.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee widow initiated a negligence action against appellant department alleging that faulty design, construction, and maintenance of the intersection was the proximate cause of her husband's death. The aforementioned event arose during a one-year period of time in which sovereign immunity for tort claims had been waived. Thereafter, the waiver of sovereign immunity for tort claims was repealed and appellant moved for and was granted dismissal. Appellee filed an appeal and the appellate court, pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 71-165, which permitted revival of causes of action during the one-year period of waiver, reversed the trial court's dismissal and remanded for further proceedings. Appellant challenged the decision and contended the revival statute was unconstitutional and violated Fla. Const. art. III, &sect; 6. The court affirmed the appellate court's decision. The court held the revival statute was constitutional. The court reasoned the legislature enacted the statute in order to permit revival of prior causes of action because no saving provision had been included in the statute repealing waiver of sovereign immunity, therefore, the statute constituted a valid enactment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee deputy constable was charged with soliciting and accepting money to influence his actions in a matter before him in his official capacity. Appellee filed a motion to dismiss the information, which was denied. The appellate court ruled that it was necessary to re-evaluate the constitutionality of ch. 932.06 in light of recent U.S. Supreme Court decisions. The supreme court, on review, found that the legislature saw fit to prescribe a different period of limitation for a crime committed by an officeholder in connection with the discharge of his duties, and that the classification was a reasonable one, having substantial relation to the valid purposes of ch. 932.06. The supreme court ruled that the trial court properly rejected appellant state's contention that appellee did not resign from his position after the offense but simply took a leave of absence during his campaign for another office, so that his later reappointment was a continuation of his original term of office. The supreme court reversed the portion of the trial court's order that held ch. 932.06 was unconstitutional and affirmed the order in all other respects.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of a final judgment dismissing its complaint in condemnation. Appellant, a county board of commissioners, announced a policy of acquisition and operation of all privately owned water and sewer systems operating within the county as the only feasible means of controlling existing pollution and of providing adequate water and sewer service to meet present and anticipated future needs within the county. The court noted that Florida's full compensation standard, Fla. Const. art. X, &sect; 6(a), required that the method of valuation that was utilized take into consideration the value of the contributed property. The county filed a petition pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 73.021 seeking condemnation of the corporate stock of the named corporations. The court found that the record did not support the trial court's finding that the county was committed to capitalization of regulated earnings as the sole acceptable approach to evaluation. Because the dismissal of the action was grounded primarily on that finding, the court found that the judgment appealed from must be reversed and the petition reinstated.</SPAN></P>

The court determined that since the U.S. Supreme Court rulings voiding capital punishment removed capital cases, logically the Florida circuit courts lacked jurisdiction in cases previously delineated as capital. Thus, jurisdiction in pending capital cases vested in the courts of record and were required to be transferred to those courts in the 17 counties of Florida that had such courts. Moreover, the court held that there was no change with respect to the remaining circuit courts in the other counties of Florida where all such jurisdiction remained in the circuit court for the trial of all felonies. Finally, the court examined various implications of the U.S. Supreme Court ruling that capital punishment was no longer available as a sentencing option. Thus, the court directed the circuit court to transfer the cause to the county court of record for trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner filed a petition for writ of certiorari of a decision of the First District Court of Appeal (Florida), which affirmed respondent's revocation of petitioner's real estate broker's registration under the authority of Fla. Stat. ch. 475.25(2). Petitioner also sought review of the trial court's judgment which found the statute to be constitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When petitioner moved from Florida to Georgia, respondent Florida Real Estate Commission entered a final order revoking petitioner's broker's registration under the authority of Fla. Stat. ch. 475.25(2). The district court affirmed the revocation but certified its decision as one passing upon a question of great public interest. The court found that unless there was a reasonable, compelling, state interest justifying the residency requirement, it could not be upheld because it had a chilling effect on Florida real estate brokers who might wish to reside in another state. The court found no merit in respondent's contention that it would be virtually impossible to discipline and police nonresident registrants if Florida real estate brokers licenses were not limited to residents of the state. The court found that it may be necessary to change the venue rule of the statute to close an obvious loophole, but that the need to perhaps change a procedural rule was not a compelling enough reason to justify holding the statute constitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court remanded the district court's decision with instructions to reinstate petitioner's registration as a Florida real estate broker.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellees were convicted and received sentences imposing fines, or imprisonment upon default in payment of the fines. Appellees were each represented by private counsel at the trial and surety bonds were posted after their arrest.

Appellant contended that alternative sentences of fine or imprisonment were not a violation of the due process clause of U.S. Const. amend.

The court found that the municipal court did not commit error in sentencing appellees to pay a fine or, in the alternative, to serve a term of imprisonment. The court found that the imposition of such a sentence did not, in itself, violate any of the constitutional rights of appellees or of any defendant for that matter.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of forcible rape in violation of Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 794.01. Defendant received a sentence of life imprisonment. Defendant's separate pre-trial motions for a medical examination pursuant to Fla. Stat.

At a hearing held subsequent to his conviction under &sect; 917.12, defendant was declared a mentally disordered sex offender and his life sentence was suspended. Defendant complained that the benefit of this sex offender act after a trial and conviction came too late, that he was denied equal protection, and that &sect; 917.12 was unconstitutional because it was not afforded to him as a defendant in a capital case prior to trial. The ultimate result under either method was the same. Defendant received the advantage of &sect; 917.12 and was thus not in a position to complain. Moreover, &sect; 917.12 met the test of reasonable classification in dealing with capital and non-capital offenders. As such, the judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant truck driver was cited, pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 317.781, by the state highway patrol for allowing load to sift onto the highway after puffs of sand were blown by the wind and movement of his truck onto the highway. Appellant brought a direct appeal, charging that Fla. Stat. ch. 317.781 was unconstitutionally vague. Appellant contended that the statute did not contemplate blowing of sand by the wind and provided no test at all to be applied to the alleged offense but instead permitted an arbitrary crackdown on sand haulers in a selective enforcement campaign in a given geographical area, depriving such truck drivers of equal protection under the law. The court held that there was no denial of equal protection because the law was uniformly and equally applied, even though it was done at different locations at different times. Further, the court held that the statute was not vague because the statute was sufficient to advise the average citizen of common intelligence of the offense proscribed. Therefore, the statute met the constitutional requirements, the evidence supported the judgment, and the appeal was dismissed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Florida legislature passed a reapportionment plan that divided districts by using population units that geographically followed the lines used by the federal census bureau and that did not match precinct lines. As a result, some of the districts for both the house and senate were multi-member districts while others were single-member districts. Those opposed to the reapportionment plan argued that the classification of districts was not reasonable. The state attorney general sought a declaratory judgment regarding constitutionality. The court found that the percentage deviation among districts was de minimis. The court held that multi-member districts were not per se illegal under the federal equal protection clause or per se invalid under Fla. Const. art. III, &sect;&sect; 1 and 16. The court stressed that it only upheld the validity of the reapportionment plan on its face and would entertain subsequent challenges that the plan was unconstitutional in its operation. The court noted that a challenger would have the burden of proof and would have to show that the multi-member districts unconstitutionally operated to dilute or cancel the voting strength of racial or political elements.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant gun owner registered his submachine gun under the National Firearms Act of 1968. After he fired the submachine gun in self-protection, appellee sheriff charged him with aggravated assault and took possession of the gun. The charges against appellant were dismissed and appellant demanded that appellee return his gun. Appellee refused to return the gun because in the intervening time between the seizure of the gun and the dismissal of the charges, the Florida legislature enacted Fla. Stat. ch. 790.221, which made machine guns illegal. Also, the city had an ordinance that made submachine guns illegal. Appellant filed a replevin action and the trial court granted summary judgment in favor of appellee. On appeal, the court found that the statute was inapplicable because Fla. Stat. ch. 790.221(3) provided an exception for firearms that were lawful under federal law. The court reasoned that appellant's registration under the National Firearms Act made his gun lawful under federal law and held that his right to possession was not barred by Fla. Stat. ch. 790.221. The court also concluded that the city ordinance could not supercede this exception.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Summary judgment in favor of appellee sheriff in appellant gun owner's replevin action was reversed because the court found that while the relevant state statute prohibiting machine guns was constitutional, it did not make possession of the submachine gun unlawful where the statute expressly excepted weapons, such as appellant's, that were lawful under federal law.</SPAN></P>

On review, the court affirmed the circuit court's order finding the statute to be constitutional. Under Fla. Stat. ch. 180.13(2), rates for utility services were required to be just and reasonable. Further, Fla. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 2(b), provided the power to municipalities to conduct government functions and to provide services.
