</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellants, nine tenants, sought an interlocutory appeal from the decision of the Fulton State Court (Georgia), which granted appellee landlord writs of possession to rental property in the landlord's dispossessory proceedings pursuant to Ga. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 61-301 and 61-302 when the tenants failed to pay past due rent into the trial court as required under Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 304.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The tenants had paid into the trial court approximately two-thirds of the rent and the other third was receipts representing repairs made by the tenants. The landlord contended that the receipts were not payment of rent under &sect; 61-304. The court affirmed the judgment, finding that the legislative history unequivocally showed that the general assembly in giving the tenants the right to remain in possession during the pendency of a dispossessory proceeding by tendering the payment of rent into the trial court intended &quot;rent&quot; to mean money. The house bill had allowed a tenant to tender money or an accounting of out-of-pocket expenditures due the landlord's alleged failure to make repairs. The senate deleted the provision that allowed an accounting and the house agreed with the change. Thus, the court would not subvert the legislative will by a construction contrary to its express meaning. Whether or not the tenants were required to recoup or set off the amounts they paid for repairs will be determined by a jury trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the decision in favor of the landlord in the landlord's dispossessory proceedings against the tenants for failure to pay rent.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant challenged a judgment of the Upson Superior Court (Georgia), which convicted him of theft by conversion, in violation of Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 28-1808, as charged by the State of Georgia and sentenced him to ten years, to be served on probation with payment of a fine and restitution. The superior court had overruled defendant's motion for a directed verdict.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The evidence showed that defendant had accepted money from homeowners to build a room on their home within a certain time period. The room was not completed when promised and the homeowners learned that there were materialmen's liens outstanding for building supplies for which defendant had not paid. The State did not present evidence to show how much of the money defendant had actually spent on the construction. On appeal, the court held that the conviction must be reversed because the evidence was insufficient to show how much money defendant had spent on the project and how much, if any, he had converted. The court noted that this impermissibly placed the burden on defendant to show that he had not converted the money. The court held that the probationary portion of defendant's sentence was improper because the evidence was insufficient to support the amount of restitution required. The court rejected defendant's claim that Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 26-1808 was void, or unconstitutional as applied to this case. Further, the court noted that the State's error in listing the applicable statute as Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 26-1803 rather than &sect; 26-1808 had previously been found to be harmless error.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the judgment of the superior court, which had convicted defendant of theft by conversion as charged by the State. The court remanded for a new trial.</SPAN></P>

The trial court admitted the testimony as part of the res gestae. The court found that the statement by the child to her mother, almost two days after the event, was not a spontaneous declaration and because the statements of the child were a narrative of an earlier event, it was inadmissible hearsay. However, the court found that the admission of the statement was not harmful error because the testimony was cumulative of other evidence. Defendant challenged his conviction cruelty to children where the indictment against him charged him with aggravated assault. The court found that the crime of cruelty to children was a lesser included offense to aggravated assault and, thus, the indictment was a sufficient basis for the conviction. The court found that there was sufficient evidence to support the verdict and affirmed it.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant borrower challenged the order of the Muscogee Superior Court (Georgia), which granted appellee lender's motion to dismiss his complaint with prejudice. The complaint was based on the Truth in Lending Act, collection of usurious interest, and a breach of contract, and had been previously dismissed without prejudice from a federal court and refiled under the renew statute, Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 3-808.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The lender made loans to the borrower, and the borrower paid the prime rate each quarter on the interest without regard to the interest listed on the notes. When the borrower refused to make further interest payments in excess of the interest stated on the note, the lender brought suit, and the borrower paid off the notes without filing an answer. The lender dismissed the suit. The borrower filed suit against the lender in federal court. The federal court dismissed the suit without prejudice, and the borrower refiled the suit in the superior court. The lender's motion to dismiss was granted by the superior court. The borrower appealed. The court affirmed. The court rejected the borrower's assertion of the coercive force of the lender, because it was not raised at the superior court level. The court found that the borrower's voluntary payments prevented recovery. The court found that the expiration of the one-year statute of limitations under Ga. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 3-1004, 57-115 and 15 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1640 ran before the action was filed in superior court.

The city attempted to appeal on the ground that the property was improperly annexed. The father and son then filed an action seeking to declare the purported annexation void, which was denied by the trial court. On appeal, the court held that because the father held himself out to represent both himself and the son and the son, through his silence, ratified the request, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying their claim.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was accused of defiling the flag by displaying in a shop window a photograph that showed a partially nude male touching a flag of the United States on the rectum area of his nude buttock. Defendant demurred on the grounds that the accusation did not allege an offense; that the charge did not sufficiently inform him of the nature of the offense; and that O.C.G.A. &sect; 26-2803 was unconstitutional. The trial court sustained the demurrer on the basis that the statute was silent as to photographs and the trial court concluded that the statute as written did not cover photographs of flags. The trial court specifically did not rule on the constitutionality of the statute. On appeal, the court reversed the trial court judgment. The court noted that the statute did not define the word defile but it was an ordinary one and had to be given its ordinary signification. Defile was defined by Webster as to sully, to tarnish, to dishonor. The court held that deliberately inserting the national ensign into the anal area of the human anatomy fell within the definition of the term defile and violated the statute.</SPAN></P>

The former employee sought to recover damages against the nonresident former employer in an action for breach of contract.

The nonresident former employer alleged that the evidence in the record showed that the former employee failed to obtain personal jurisdiction over the nonresident former employer. The lower court held that the parties' alleged employment contract was negotiated and signed in another state. The lower court further held that the exercise of extraterritorial jurisdiction over the nonresident former employer was unconstitutional. The lower court stated that the former employee's purposeful activity within this state in the performance of the parties' contract was so limited that the exercise of extraterritorial jurisdiction over the nonresident former employer offended notions of fair play and justice.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">At trial on the passenger's claims, the trial judge instructed the jury on the judicially-created guest rule that a driver was not liable to a guest in his vehicle unless the driver was guilty of gross negligence. The jury returned a verdict for the driver. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court agreed with the passenger's constitutional challenge to the guest rule. The court recited the judicial history of the guest rule. The rationale of the promotion of hospitality by insulation of the drivers from lawsuits by guests was no longer applicable because the Georgia Motor Vehicle Accident Reparations Act, Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 56-3401b et seq., required mandatory minimum insurance that protected drivers. The guest rule only served to protect insurance companies. The justification that asserted that the guest rule prevented collusive lawsuits by drivers and guests was without merit because the common law guest rule was overinclusive. However, the court was not authorized to overturn a common law rule sustained by the state supreme court. The court held that the four contested jury instructions were proper and that there was adequate evidence to support the verdict in favor of the driver.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A loan to the partnership to develop land was secured by a deed. The lender declared the loan to be in default and an undivided 98.77 percent interest in the deed to secure debt was assigned three days later. The property was advertised for sale under a power of sale contained in the deed to secure debt, and the property was sold under power. An application for confirmation of the sale was filed. The partners answered, raising several defenses including estoppel, novation, increase of risk, failure of consideration, failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted, failure to sell at the true value and improper venue due to the lender's failure to assert the application for confirmation in their action for equitable relief and damages arising from the same transaction. Confirmation was denied. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that the duty of the court was to test the fairness of the technical procedure of the actual sale and to insure that the sale had bought at least the true market value of the property pursuant to O.C.G.A. &sect; 67-1503 et seq. Because there was an issue of whether or not a default had occurred, the trial court had properly denied the confirmation.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was convicted of a misdemeanor under O.C.G.A. &sect; 68A-507(b) relating to uniform rules of the road. Defendant argued that the statute, as applied to the facts of the case, unlawfully denied his personal rights, especially freedom of speech, in contravention of the First and Fourteenth Amendment. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that even where municipal or state property was open to the public generally, the exercise of First Amendment rights could be regulated so as to prevent interference with the use to which the property was ordinarily put by the State. The court held that defendant's act of choosing the paved area of a highway for a place to stand and transact his business, no matter how laudable the business itself might have been, was certainly a privilege rather than a right, and therefore subject to regulation by the state. The court held that the mere fact that defendant was exercising his First Amendment rights did not shield him from the observance of normal traffic regulations.</SPAN></P>

Defendant asserted that the trial court erred in admitting a copy of an administrative order showing his transfer as a prisoner without further proof that he was originally committed as the result of a lawful conviction, including a sentence to confinement. He complained that the trial court erred in not directing a verdict of acquittal. The court upheld the conviction. There was ample evidence supporting the trial court's denial of the motion for a directed verdict of acquittal. O.C.G.A. &sect; 77-309(b) provided that persons convicted of a felony and sentenced to serve time in a penal institution were committed to the custody of the director, who was to designate the place of confinement. The director also had the sole authority to transfer prisoners between correctional institutions. Thus, the trial court had before it evidence that defendant was a sentenced prisoner committed to the director for appropriate incarceration.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Two brothers were denied entrance to the park because they were not wearing shirts.

Upon their acquittal, they filed suit against the park. The trial court directed a verdict in favor of the park when the brothers failed to produce a transcript of their criminal trial and dismissed the brothers' motion for new trial as abandoned. On appeal, the court held that the trial court did not err by refusing to admit the transcript into evidence, as it was never offered in evidence because the brothers were unable to get a copy of it. The court also held that the motion for new trial was properly dismissed because the brothers' attorney said that he would not argue the motion orally and requested, by letter, that the trial court grant a continuance so that he could obtain the transcript or that the trial court deny his motion so that he could perfect an appeal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The juvenile offender was adjudicated delinquent for burglarizing a residence. The juvenile was 12 years of age. On appeal, the juvenile offender claimed that the juvenile court's application of O.C.G.A. &sect; 24A-3503, pertaining to fingerprinting, was unconstitutional. The police fingerprinted the juvenile offender after he was arrested on suspicion of another burglary. The juvenile offender claimed that the juvenile court erred in allowing his fingerprints to be admitted into evidence. O.C.G.A. &sect; 24A-3503 required that children 12 years could not be fingerprinted &sect; 24A-3503(a), except in one specific instance under &sect; 24A-3503(e), and even then the fingerprints could not have been filed unless directed by an appropriate court. The court held that the procedure followed in this case clearly constituted a violation of the plain terms of the statute insofar as routine fingerprinting of the 12 year-old juvenile was concerned. The fingerprints were not taken under &sect; 24A-3503(e). The fingerprints in this case were unlawfully taken, filed, and used for comparison purposes but such error did not require a reversal because the juvenile offender confessed to breaking into the house.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court charged the jury based on O.C.G.A. &sect; 94-1108, making proof of an injury inflicted by the running of locomotives or cars prima facie evidence of the want of reasonable skill and care on the part of the servants of the company in reference to such injury. The court found that this charge was in error and reversed the decision of the trial court. The statute was taken in totidem verbis from a Mississippi statute which had been interpreted to operate only when the facts had not been produced and was intended to compel the railroad to explain how the injury occurred. The Mississippi statute created merely a temporary inference of fact that vanished upon the introduction of opposing evidence. The court held that when a statute had been adopted from another state, the judicial construction already placed thereon by the highest court of that jurisdiction accompanied it, and was treated as incorporated therein. The court found that the railroad had made a full disclosure of the circumstances surrounding the collision, and the evidence adduced was sufficient to tend to dispute each and every allegation of negligence.

Defendant was assessed the costs of the court reporter, and she appealed.

In addition, any party could as a matter of right have the case reported at her own expense. Thus, it was not an abuse of discretion to require defendant to pay the cost. The court refused to hear defendant's argument that the statutory procedure that allowed for the payment of recording costs in felony cases and not in misdemeanor cases violated due process and equal protection because it did not have jurisdiction where a favorable ruling on such attack would not affect the rights of the party raising the issue.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant sought review of his conviction for unlawful possession of marijuana by the Clayton Superior Court (Georgia). On appeal, defendant principally argued that the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress because the prosecution failed to show any legal justification for defendant's arrest so the drugs found in defendant's possession and in his car were the fruits of an unlawful arrest.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was arrested for violation of a city ordinance prohibiting public drunkenness. At the suppression hearing, the prosecution failed to introduce a certified copy of the city ordinance so it could not serve as a basis for upholding the arrest and subsequent search. The prosecution then argued that the arrest was based on Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 26-2607, the public drunkenness provision of the state's criminal code. The prosecution also argued that admission of the evidence was harmless because, after defendant's motion to suppress was denied, defendant testified to and admitted possession of the marijuana. The court held that: (1) defendant's conduct did not fall within the purview of &sect; 26-2607; (2) the prosecution was able to prove defendant's possession of marijuana solely by the admission of the illegally seized drugs and it was obvious that defendant would not have attempted to justify his possession of the drugs had the state been unable to prove possession in the first place; and (3) a judicial determination of harmless error could only be made in accordance with certain principles so prior case law establishing per se rules of harmless error were overruled.</SPAN></P>

Defendant had been indicted with another individual. At trial, out-of-court statements made by the co-indictee were admitted into evidence. Defendant had objected that these statements were inadmissible hearsay because he had not been charged with conspiracy under O.C.G.A. &sect; 26-3201.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant also argued that the State had failed to show the co-indictee was unavailable, that the jury should have been instructed that the State was required to prove conspiracy beyond a reasonable doubt before it could consider the co-indictee's statements, and that certain provisions of the Act were unconstitutional. The court rejected defendant's argument's concerning the State's failure to show that the co-indictee was unavailable and that the Act was unconstitutional on the grounds that defendant had not raised these issues below. The court noted that O.C.G.A. &sect; 38-306 provided that, after the fact of a conspiracy was proved, the declarations of any one of the conspirators were admissible against all. The court held that, because this statutory rule of evidence did not condition admissibility on the existence of an indictment for conspiracy, the superior court had properly admitted the co-indictee's statements. The court also held that the jury was required to weigh all the evidence, including the declarations, to determine whether a conspiracy existed and that the trial court had not erred in refusing to charge that the &quot;beyond a reasonable doubt&quot; standard applied.</SPAN></P>

The court stated that when the State offered the evidence that defendant was paid for the pools and that he in turn failed to pay his suppliers the burden of proof shifted to defendant to account for the funds. The court stated that in light of the evidence that defendant received and spent the money he had received an acquittal was not required.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The assignee of a conditional sales contract on an automobile filed an action against the owner of the vehicle for the deficiency balance that was owed on the contract after the automobile was repossessed and sold. The trial court found that the owner was 30 days late in making payments, and had fallen behind in his payments on three occasions. However, the trial court entered judgment in favor of the owner because there was no notice from the assignee to the owner that strict compliance with the terms of the original sales contract would be insisted upon. The court reversed the judgment of the trial court. The mere fact that the assignee had accepted late payments from the owner on five different occasion did not operate as a waiver of the express contract provisions that related to the timeliness of the payments in view of the language set forth in the contract. The court reached its decision in view of the fact that on one occasion the assignee had obtained a written 90-day extension of the due date of the note from the owner.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jones then filed an action against Southern Home, alleging the above facts and in addition urging (1) that in filing defensive pleadings to the action by Littlefield against her in her name the company had acted without her consent, that her interests were disregarded and her privacy invaded, and (2) that she relied upon the company to represent her in the defense of the action and also in settlement negotiations and to secure and accept a settlement which would protect her to the fullest extent possible; however, the insurer, although receiving an offer to settle the case for $ 10,000, refused&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the offer without informing or consulting with her, as a result of which a large judgment has been entered against her.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defendant moved for summary judgment on the ground, among others, that plaintiff stated no claim on which relief could be granted.  Meanwhile, it appeared that the action by Jones against Southern Home was in fact filed by the attorneys for Littlefield pursuant to a contract under which Jones assigned any cause of action she might have against the insurer to Littlefield with the exception of $ 1 in compensatory damages, all punitive damages, and attorney fees.  The insurer urged that under these facts Jones was not a proper party plaintiff.  Littlefield then filed an intervention praying to be made a co-party plaintiff, which contains an order of approval by the trial court.  Later, however, another order was entered dismissing the intervention, followed by an entry of summary judgment for the insurer.  Jones and Littlefield appeal.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant, an uninsured motorist, sought review from the Polk State Court (Georgia), which granted appellee insurer's motion for summary judgment in appellant's action that alleged that appellee acted in bad faith toward appellant in its handling of defensive pleadings filed on appellant's behalf by appellee.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A motorist was killed in a collision with a car driven by appellant. The widow sued appellant, who carried no insurance. Appellee filed defensive pleadings in appellant's name. A verdict was entered against appellant for $ 95,000. Appellee paid the amount of its policy coverage, $ 10,000. An execution was entered against appellant for the balance. Among other reasons, appellant sued after learning that appellee had received an offer to settle for $ 10,000 but had refused the offer without consulting appellant. The court affirmed. Appellant's due process rights were not violated when appellee made defensive pleadings in appellant's name because that was exactly what Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 56-407.1(d) authorized. Appellant was not an insured and therefore appellee did not owe appellant a duty of good faith in settling the claim. The duty of good faith arose in the context of a contract between an insured and insurer for insurance coverage. Appellant and appellee had no such contract between them. There was no privity of contract between the parties.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the lower court's decision, finding that appellant could not recover against appellee on the basis of bad-faith refusal to settle because appellee did not owe appellant any duty of good faith to settle because appellant was not an insured. Appellant and appellee had no contractual relationship between them. The filing of defensive pleadings in appellant's name did not impose on appellee a duty of good faith to settle.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The employee claimed that she was disabled due to exposure to sulfur fumes at her place of employment. The employer moved for a continuance of the workmen's compensation hearing based on the employee's refusal to submit to a physical examination by an allergy specialist. The superior court dismissed the employee's appeal from the Board's dismissal of her appeal from a deputy director's order granting the employer's motion. On further review, the court determined that the Workmen's Compensation Act did not permit appeals to the superior court from interlocutory orders, but only allowed appeals from final awards. Rejecting the employee's contention that the effect of the Board's dismissal was to terminate her right to pursue her claim, the court noted that the Board's order remanded the employee's claim to the deputy director for a hearing as to the validity of her refusal and thus actually preserved her rights. The court also ruled that the Board's ruling did not unconstitutionally deprive the employee of the opportunity to show why she should not be subjected to the allergy tests because the employee possessed at least two procedures for presenting her objections.</SPAN></P>

The question was not what instructions the owner had given his son as to the way and manner in which the son operated and managed the vehicle; the owner could not limit his liability by such private instructions, to which the injured parties were not privy. The test was whether the car was being operated in the scope of the owner's business. The owner had made it his business to furnish a car for the pleasure and convenience of family members. The law did not allow a principal to insulate and absolve himself of liability by private instructions to his agent. The &quot;family purpose car doctrine&quot; was an extension of the principal-agent relationship. The court overruled Strickland v. Moore, 147 S.E.2d 682, Pritchett v.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The veterinarian's wife, who was not licensed to practice veterinary medicine, administered puppy and worm shots to a basset hound when the veterinarian was not present and had not directed the administration of medication. The veterinarian argued that O.C.G.A. &sect; 84-1502.3 required that all elements set forth in subparagraphs (a), (b), and (c) thereof must concur for any act to constitute the practice of veterinary medicine. The veterinarian accordingly contended that no violation of &sect; 84-1509.7 was proven because there was no evidence that his wife violated &sect; 84-1502.3(c) by employing a title, words, abbreviation or letters in a manner that induced a belief that she was qualified to perform veterinary medicine. The court held that the Board's factual findings and stated principles of law were correct. The court approved the reasoning that the veterinarian's argument transformed the provisions of &sect;&sect; 84-1502.3(b) and (c) into mere surplusage and rendered the grammatical structure of &sect; 84-1502.3 meaningless. The court declined to revisit the Georgia Supreme Court's decision rejecting the veterinarian's argument that the statute as construed by the Board was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

The police officer had filed a petition for certiorari against the police board, and the trial court denied the petition. The police officer limited his appeal to two basic issues, which were the constitutionality of the police rules that he allegedly violated, and whether he was denied procedural due process of the law. The court found the police rule requiring a reprimand of a police officer who publicly criticized the official action of a superior officer was not overly broad and did not violate the right to free speech. The court found the police rule was reasonable for maintaining good order and discipline within a police department. Next, the court did not find any due process violations just because the police board failed to make findings of fact and conclusions of law. The court held that in the absence of a statute so requiring, the lack thereof did not affect the validity of the police board's decision. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the lower court's judgment. The court found that strict compliance with the statute was required unless there was a showing of evasion by the non-resident. The court further found that there was a presumption of compliance with the statute but that there also was evidence to overcome this presumption from the fact that the letters were returned and marked &quot;unclaimed.&quot; Because there was evidence before the lower court that could be considered sufficient to overcome the presumption of proper service, the court held that a finding of failure of notice of the suit was authorized.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The borrowers denied liability for the loan on the ground that the lender's action was based upon a contract which was null and void because the provisions of the contract violated the Georgia Industrial Loan Act of 1955 (Act), Ga.

The court held that the Industrial Loan Act lender could have recovered from the borrowers the balance of the principal owing from a loan under the theory of assumpsit, or money had and received, when the loan contract between the lender and the borrowers was null and void because terms of the contract violated the provisions of the Act. The court stated that although the contract was rendered void when the contract failed to meet the specifications of the contact's enabling legislation, the transaction made between the parties in the belief that they were in compliance with the Act should not ipso facto have been ruled violative of public policy. The court also held that because the lender initiated its action after the expiration of the one-year limitations period of the Truth-In-Lending Act, 15 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1601 et seq., the borrowers' counterclaim was untimely.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The creditors brought suit on separate promissory notes against the debtor company and its president, who had guaranteed the debt. The creditors demonstrated that the debtor and the guarantor were attempting to set off against each note payable to each individual creditor debts due the debtor and the guarantor by a corporation in which each creditor owned an interest. The answers of the debtor and the guarantor and the affidavit of the guarantor submitted by them in opposition to each motion showed affirmatively that the claims sought to be set off were due them by a partnership of which each creditor was a member. The trial court granted the creditors' motions for summary judgment in each case. On appeal the court affirmed. Under either version, whether corporation or partnership, setoff was not available to the debtor and the guarantor. The tender made by them was based upon the calculation of the setoff that was not available to them because a debt due by a partnership could not be set off against a debt due by a third person to one of the firm. The tender was therefore insufficient under O.C.G.A. &sect; 20-1105, so there was no genuine issue as to any material fact.</SPAN></P>

The owner claimed that because he had not been convicted of the violation of any city ordinance there could be no revocation of his license, that due cause for revocation was not shown, and other constitutional attacks on varying city ordinances.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The owner was served with a notice to show cause why his city whiskey-pouring license should not be revoked. The notice detailed the time and place of the hearing and recited seven grounds on which revocation was sought. After a hearing before the mayor and city council, the owner's license was revoked. The trial court denied the owner's petition for certiorari. The court affirmed. Hapeville, Georgia, City Ordinance 3-35 provided that due cause for the suspension or revocation of a whiskey license consisted of the violation of any laws or ordinances that regulated such business, or violation of regulations made pursuant to the grant of authority to regulate such businesses. If a statute directed the revocation of a license on conviction of such offense, then in the absence of a court conviction there could not be a legal revocation. However, when the cause of revocation was specified as a violation of the laws, the licensing authorities could act on other evidence than a judgment of conviction. Testimony was offered of specific violations and was sufficient to satisfy the due cause requirement. The city acted within its police powers in restricting sales of whiskey.</SPAN></P>

He shot the victim through a door and wounded him in the hand and arm to the extent that it had to be amputated.

Defendant contended that it was error to deny his motion for mistrial because of an expression of opinion as to guilt by the district attorney in his opening statement. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that it was within the discretion of the trial court to allow the prosecutor to remain in the courtroom to assist in the presentation of the case. The court held that where the trial judge quickly admonished the jury to disregard the district attorney's statement concerning his opinion on defendant's guilt, denial of defendant's motion for a new trial was not improper. The court held that where defendant testified, the trial judge did not err in charging the jury relating to defendant's testimony because the jury had a right to take into consideration defendant had an interest in the result of the prosecution.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Action for damages.  Cobb Superior Court.  Before Judge Hames.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On March 7, 1968, the plaintiff, Joseph G. Maddox, was appointed as a member of the State of Georgia Board of Pardons and Paroles to fill an unexpired term.  On April 10, 1969, Joseph G. Maddox was appointed to a full seven-year term to the State Board of Pardons and Paroles by the Honorable Lester Maddox, said appointment being confirmed by the Senate on June 12, 1969.  On the morning of the swearing in of Joseph G. Maddox for the full term abovementioned, Governor Lester Maddox had Joseph G. Maddox sign an undated resignation to be kept by the Governor.  On January 6, 1971, Governor Lester Maddox accepted the resignation of Joseph G. Maddox and sent him a Western Union Telefax signed by the Governor notifying him that he was accepting his resignation.  Joseph G. Maddox subsequently told newspaper reporters at a press conference that he intended to continue his duties as a member of the Board of Pardons and Paroles and would disregard the action of the Governor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Upon learning that the plaintiff, Joseph G. Maddox, intended to disregard the acceptance of his&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  resignation and to continue to perform his duties as a member of the said board, Governor Maddox instructed Frank Blankenship, Assistant Attorney General assigned to the Governor as legal advisor, to go to the chairman of the Board of Pardons and Paroles to have him change all of the locks on the doors to the board in order to secure the confidentiality of the files of said board.  Frank Blankenship conveyed the Governor's instructions to the defendant, J. O. Partain, Chairman of the Board of Pardons and Paroles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defendant, J. O. Partain, Chairman of the Board of Pardons and Paroles, then passed on the Governor's instructions to an employee of the Board of Pardons and Paroles, instructing said employee to advise the office manager that Governor Maddox directed that the locks be changed on the offices of the Board of Pardons and Paroles, and the locks were changed.  On January 7, 1971, when the plaintiff appeared at the board offices, he was allowed entry only to retrieve his personal effects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On January 13, 1971, six days after the locks were changed, Joseph G. Maddox filed the instant suit in the Superior Court of Cobb County against J. O. Partain, as Chairman of the Board of&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Pardons and Paroles and individually, seeking to enjoin the defendant from interfering with his performance of his duties and from preventing him from entering his office, and seeking actual damages as well as $ 100,000 in punitive damages for the defendant's allegedly interfering with the plaintiff's performance of his duties.  At 4:55 p.m., January 13, 1971, the Honorable Luther C. Hames, Jr., Presiding Judge of the Superior Court of Cobb County, signed a temporary restraining order enjoining the defendant from interfering with the plaintiff's right to pursue his duties and ordering the defendant to allow the plaintiff to enter his office for those purposes, and setting the case down for a show-cause hearing on January 19, 1971.  Said temporary restraining order was obtained ex parte and was served upon the defendant on January 14, 1971.  On January 14, 1971, after newly assuming the office of Governor of the State of Georgia, the Honorable Jimmy Carter declared the office of Joseph G. Maddox vacant, and officially appointed Richard A. Chappel as a member of the Board of Pardons and Paroles, replacing the said Joseph G. Maddox.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On January 19, 1971, Arthur K. Bolton, Attorney General&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of the State of Georgia, appeared in behalf of the defendant, and, in addition to denying the claims made by the plaintiff, sought quo warranto, seeking a declaration that the office be declared vacant.  On January 20, 1971, the Honorable Luther C. Hames, Jr., entered an order which in essence held that whether or not the resignation of Joseph G. Maddox was valid was an issue to be determined by the jury, and that the restraining order previously entered against the defendant be continued until final adjudication of the issue.  On January 29, 1971, the Honorable Luther C. Hames, Jr., granted a certificate of immediate review of the said order.  Arthur K. Bolton, Attorney General for the State of Georgia, filed a notice of appeal in the defendant's behalf, and the plaintiff, through his attorney, filed a notice of cross appeal from the said order, all parties being dissatisfied with the ruling of the trial court.  In that fashion, the issue of the right to hold the office was submitted to the Supreme Court of Georgia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On May 20, 1971, the Supreme Court of Georgia issued its order and opinion on the issue of the right to hold the said office.  The Supreme Court ruled that the resignation&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  obtained by Governor Lester Maddox was unconstitutional and void, and concluded that the plaintiff, Joseph G. Maddox, was entitled to hold the said office for the full term of his appointment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On June 11, 1971, the case having been remanded to the Superior Court of Cobb County, the judgment of the Supreme Court was made the order of the trial court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On September 3, 1971, the plaintiff filed an amendment to his complaint seeking $ 2,500 attorney fees as damages in the suit against the defendant individually for interference with the plaintiff's right to pursue the duties of his office during the period January 7, 1971, through January 13, 1971.  A pre-trial order was entered in the case on April 25, 1972, signed by the Honorable Luther C. Hames, Jr.  The jury trial began on May 14, 1973, and on the first day of trial, the plaintiff filed an amendment to his complaint striking all claims for punitive damages and seeking $ 5,000 in attorney fees as damages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the conclusion of the plaintiff's evidence, the defendant, J. O. Partain, made a motion for directed verdict on the grounds that: (a) the defendant was clothed with governmental immunity, (b) there had been no evidence indicating&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  bad faith, wilful or malicious conduct, and (c) the only evidence of damages introduced in the case was that of attorney fees incurred in adjudicating the right of title to the office.  The defendant Partain thus argued that he was entitled to the entry of verdict and judgment as a matter of law.  The trial judge overruled the defendant's motion for a directed verdict.  At the conclusion of the presentation of the defendant's evidence, the defendant again renewed and made a motion for a directed verdict on the same grounds mentioned above.  Upon the second day of trial after the evidence was concluded but prior to final arguments to the jury, the plaintiff, over the defendant's objection, filed an additional amendment to the plaintiff's complaint, withdrawing the plaintiff's demand for attorney fees &quot;eo nomine,&quot; and seeking damages pursuant to Code &sect; 105-2004 for court costs in the amount of $ 280 and $ 3,000 in attorney fees as expenses, seeking a total judgment in the amount of $ 3,280.  The trial court ruled that there was no sufficient showing of the incurring of a $ 280 court cost, but allowed the amendment to be filed instructing the plaintiff's attorney that he would allow&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  him to argue and to seek attorney fees in the amount of $ 3,000 since that was &quot;the only proof that has been offered.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The case was submitted to the jury and resulted in verdict and judgment for the plaintiff for $ 3,000.  Subsequently, the defendant filed his motion for judgment n.o.v. or in the alternative for new trial.  The motion for new trial was later amended.  The trial judge denied both motions and the defendant appeals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The thrust of the defendant's appeal is (1) that the defendant was clothed with governmental immunity and (2) that attorney fees are not recoverable as an item of damages in cases of this nature.  </SPAN></P>

In passing on the governor's instructions to an employee of the board, with instructions to the employee to so advise the office manager, defendant acted within his discretionary authority as chief executive of the board. The court found that the record was devoid of any conduct by defendant that could be construed as being sufficient to lift the shield that protected public officers acting colore officii.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed his conviction from Fulton Criminal Court (Georgia), where he was found guilty of two of three alleged violations of O.C.G.A. &sect; 26-2101, for distributing obscene material, and received a sentence of 12 months and a fine of $ 1,000 on each count.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">At a pre-trial hearing, the trial court found that the three films allegedly shown by defendant were &quot;hard-core pornography&quot; and issued a search warrant to seize the films. When the sheriff attempted to do so, defendant was not present at his theater or able to conceal the films from the sheriff's search warrant. However, the sheriff did not search the premises or make any further attempt to seize the films before a hearing on a citation for contempt against defendant was brought for his failure to produce the films. When defendant refused to testify at this pre-trial contempt hearing, based on his rights against self-incrimination, the trial court found him in contempt. Defendant then involuntarily turned the films over and unsuccessfully objected to their use as evidence at trial. The pre-trial contempt hearing evidence fell far short of that necessary to support a contempt adjudication. The trial court had no authority to order defendant to furnish incriminating evidence against himself on pain of contempt. The trial court erred in overruling defendant's objection to the introduction of the films as evidence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed defendant's obscenity convictions.</SPAN></P>

Defendant's suspended sentence had been conditioned on her leaving the county and not returning to the area, or using the public streets or highways in that area, for a period of 12 months.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The sentence required that she leave the county and not return to it, or to any of six surrounding counties, during that period. She was observed in the county using its roads about 10 months later. Defendant argued that the conditions of suspension amounted to an unconstitutional banishment. On appeal, the court held that the superior court had the authority, under Ga. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 27-2709, 27-2714, to impose a suspended sentence in this criminal case, since the sentence was in harmony with the verdict. The verdict had indicated the jury's wish that defendant receive probation as if for a misdemeanor. The court noted that Ga. Const. art. I, &sect; I, para. VII (1945), Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 2-107, provided that banishment beyond the limits of the state was not a permitted punishment. The court further noted that the fundamental public policy of the state was that one political division was not permitted to dump its undesirable persons upon another. Additionally, the court remarked that the legislature could have chosen to specifically permit banishment to other areas within the state but had not done so. Therefore, the court determined that defendant's motion should have been sustained.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the superior court's order, which had denied defendant's motion to dismiss the proceeding brought by the state to revoke the suspension of her sentence for possession of marijuana, a violation of the Georgia Drug Abuse Act.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff judgment creditor brought an action against defendant insurer, alleging it to be the liability insurer of debtor. Defendant contended that debtor's liability policy was canceled prior to the automobile collision that injured plaintiff upon notice by a premium finance company, under a power of attorney, of a request for cancellation due to debtor's default of a premium loan. Plaintiff appealed the trial court's grant of summary judgment on the grounds that the policy was not legally cancelled where defendant did not give proper notice of cancellation. The reviewing court reversed the judgment, holding that Ga. L. 1963, p. 588, Ga. L. 1969, pp. 561, 568, and the contract of insurance required 10 days notice to debtor of defendant's intention to cancel before cancellation became effective. Defendant was not authorized under a power of attorney to ignore the notice requirements. The court explained that the statutes, rather than the policy, controlled. Thus, the policy was in full force and effect at the time of the collision and the trial court erred in granting defendant's motion.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The State of Georgia appealed from a judgment and order of the Criminal Court of Fulton County (Georgia), which sustained defendant's motion to suppress the State's evidence in its airport-search case against defendant, from whom a weapon was confiscated at an airport after an airport metal detector alerted officials to its presence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued that a search of persons upon the basis of the results shown by a metal detector was unconstitutional whether such persons be passengers or non-passengers, and that written or oral consent was required to legitimize the search. The court disagreed, holding that it was not unreasonable to set up a magnetometer at a concourse entrance to loading ramps to reduce the risk of air piracy, nor was it unreasonable to subject to a magnetometer scan anyone proceeding past that point, whether a ticketed passenger or merely a well-wisher. The court reasoned that airport authorities were not required to conclude that all those who intend to commandeer an airplane, an act which could be committed while the plane stood at the ramp, would purchase tickets. Because there was nothing unreasonable in placement of the magnetometer, or in the airport security officers' stopping defendant when the device gave an alert, seizure of the weapon was justified, and the evidence should not have been suppressed.</SPAN></P>

An action for damages was filed against the driver of the other car. The complaint alleged as negligence per se the violation of a certain municipal traffic ordinance. The trial court, pursuant to a motion by the driver of the other car, struck all portions of the complaint referring to the ordinance because it was found to be unconstitutional. The case went to trial with the complaint recast. When the attorney for the passenger indicated in his opening statement that the driver pled guilty to the ordinance, the driver's motion for mistrial was granted. The passenger appealed. The court held that: (1) the trial court was correct in finding the municipal ordinance unconstitutional, (2) the trial court was correct in striking the ordinance from the pleadings, (3) evidence that the driver entered guilty pleas to the unconstitutional ordinance was admissible as an admission against interest, and (4) the trial court did not commit reversible error in sustaining the driver's motion for a mistrial.</SPAN></P>

The insurer and the claimant filed cross-appeals from the judgment of the Fulton Superior Court (Georgia), which reversed and remanded the case to the Board on the basis that the Board exceeded its powers and followed an erroneous legal theory in making the award.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After the claimant received an award for total incapacity, the Board entered an award for partial incapacity from a certain date.

In reversing, the court found that the Board followed the authority provided to it by the change in condition section of the Act. The court reasoned that the trial court improperly relied on federal case law that was not binding on it. After the referenced federal case determined that O.C.G.A. &sect; 114-709 (1972) and Ga. Bd. Workers' Comp. R.17 were unconstitutional, the General Assembly the Board amended those provisions. The Board found as a fact that the claimant had an economic change of condition on a certain date and the evidence supported this finding. Retroactively, the claimant lost his entitlement to the compensation previously awarded to him. The court found that the claimant's admission that he returned to work was evidence of a change of condition. The claimant had been properly allowed to testify to the use of his thumb but not his opinion as to his percentage of disability.</SPAN></P>

Defendants challenged the judgment of the Bibb Superior Court (Georgia), which, under the provisions of O.C.G.A. &sect; 81A-112(h)(1), denied a motion to set aside a default judgment against them.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The individual was properly served. Because the sheriff could not locate the corporation in Bibb County, papers were served on the Secretary of State; and a copy of the filed certificate was forwarded to the corporation by registered mail. Neither defendant appeared or answered. Defendants presented affidavits showing the corporation's address and registration as in Jones County. Pursuant to &sect; 81A-112(h)(1), because both defendants were served in an official, legal manner, the defense of lack of jurisdiction over the person and improper venue was waived because not presented to the trial court by motion or by responsive pleading. The court rejected case law relied upon by defendants because it represented the law prior to &sect; 81A-112(h)(1). Defendants then attempted to raise the issue of the constitutionality of &sect; 81A-112(h)(1). The court had no jurisdiction to adjudicate the constitutionality of statutes, and the Secretary's record did not indicate the county of incorporation. Therefore, the court found that the constitutional issue was not before it, and it retained jurisdiction over the action. The trial court was not in error in denying the motion to set aside the judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The subscriber brought an action for damages against the telephone company due to its negligence in curtailing service. The trial court granted the subscriber's motion to strike the telephone company's defenses based upon &sect; A2.4.4 of the Georgia Commission General Subscriber Services Tariff (tariff), and the telephone company appealed. The court held that the counts based on negligence were subject to the defense pleaded, and as to those counts it was error for the trial court to have granted the subscriber's motion to strike. There was nothing harsh or inequitable in upholding such a limitation of liability when it was thus considered that the rates as fixed by the Georgia Public Service Commission were established with the rule of limitation in mind. Reasonable rates were in part dependent upon such a rule. As to the count alleging that the interruption of the telephone service, delays, and disconnections of the subscriber's telephone were the result of willful misconduct on the part of the telephone company, the court affirmed the order granting the motion to strike. The tariff had no application and constituted no defense against that count.</SPAN></P>

The trial court denied the motion and instructed the jury to disregard defendants' mention of the occupant's previous claims.

Under &sect; 81-1009, the trial court was required to rebuke defendants' counsel and to endeavor to remove the improper impression from the jury.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The corporation was the holder of an installment sales contract on a car and filed a &quot;notice of intention to foreclose&quot; in the trial court, alleging that the debtor was in arrears. The debtor filed a cross-complaint asserting that the corporation had repossessed the car with the assistance of the police without authority of the law. The trial court found the debtor in arrears and ordered the foreclosure and sale of the car. The debtor appealed. Upon review, the court reversed the judgment. The court found that because the trial court treated the action as a notice of intent to foreclose in order to have a notice and hearing as to probable validity before proceeding with a foreclosure under O.C.G.A. &sect; 67-701 et seq., it should merely have entered an order authorizing the corporation to proceed with the foreclosure under the statute. Instead, the trial judge ordered execution, levy, and sale. Essentially the trial judge's order completed the foreclosure when it ordered a sale. Thus, the court ruled that, on remand, the debtor's answer and crossclaim should be treated as an affidavit of illegality with the right to amend and make any attacks upon the execution as desired.</SPAN></P>

A summons was served upon the debtors, and a default judgment was later entered in favor of the finance company. Subsequently, the debtors moved to vacate the judgment, but the trial court denied their request. On appeal, the debtors contended that the summons was not in the form required by the Civil Practice Act, O.C.G.A. &sect;&sect; 81A-104, 81A-301 and that it did not amount to a summons at all. The court disagreed and held that, although the debtors were served under the authority of an earlier statute that was subsequently amended, they were allowed more than 30 days to answer. The court determined that the debtors were actually given 38 days after service to answer the complaint, which was more than the 30 days authorized by O.C.G.A. &sect; 81A-112(a). Thus, the debtors could not complain of that which was favorable to them, as they were allowed more time to answer the complaint that under the Civil Practice Act. The court concluded that it was not created to correct errors, no matter how flagrant, that operated to the benefit of the party complaining.</SPAN></P>

Defendant challenged the local list of the grand jury and petit jury contending there was an unconstitutional, systematic exclusion of blacks, women, and young adults between the ages of 18 and 30. The court followed precedent and overruled his challenges to the jury system. The court found that defendant was not deprived of constitutional rights to a fair trial through denial of his request for personal use of a professional court reporter in addition to the official court reporter. The case was not so complicated that defendant's attorney needed immediate transcripts, and defendant did not point to any factor that would indicate he sustained any harm by the court's denial of his request. The court held that the grand jury was properly impaneled. The court found that portions of the State's closing argument were so prejudicial that the trial court erred in refusing to rebuke him and in overruling motions for mistrial. The remarks objected to were improper as they were comments that had no relevance to the evidence adduced during the trial. The trial court should have granted a mistrial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff alleged that defendant, while having its place of business in another county, owned and operated a speedway in the county sued in where, by reason of defendant's negligence, plaintiff's child was killed.

The court held that the trial court erred in dismissing the action for lack of venue because it was properly brought in the county where the cause of action originated. However, the trial court did not err in sustaining the motion to quash service because there was no valid service. A speedway caretaker who did not meet the statutory status of an officer, cashier, or agent under Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 81A-104(d) accepted service. Nor was the service sufficient by leaving a copy at the place of business because the speedway was no longer in operation. There was no authority under Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 81-215 for issuance or service of a second original because there was only one defendant. Nor did defendant qualify as a &quot;common carrier,&quot; subject to service under Ga.

Though initially granted, the trial court later revoked its order claiming the request for service by publication was made after the statute of limitation had run on plaintiffs' claim and dismissed the claim. Plaintiffs appealed. The court found that service by publication was not valid and could not authorize an in personam judgment as sought; however, plaintiffs had the benefit of no statutory method or common law method by which lawful service could be effected, and since there had been no waiver, the statute of limitation was tolled under Ga.

The court found that defendants were not entitled to pretrial discovery or inspection and possession of evidence and that the State was not required in the indictment to negative any exception, excuse, proviso, or exemption contained in O.C.G.A. tit. 79A, which permitted certain persons to lawfully have in their possession prohibited drugs and narcotics. The court found that in conducting a surveillance of a house, a police officer overheard a conversation involving defendants and others about a package containing &quot;good marijuana.&quot; The court determined that the overheard statement, coupled with defendants' flight from the house thereafter, constituted probable cause for police officers to believe that defendants had marijuana then in their possession and were attempting to escape. The court thus concluded that the officers had authority to arrest defendants without warrants and, as incident thereto, to search their persons and their car.</SPAN></P>

The officer then called Johnson and they arranged to meet.  By agreement of his supervisors, an electronic transmitting device was concealed upon the officer's body for the meeting.  No attempt was made to secure a warrant.  Two other officers went along to receive and record the upcoming conversations.  Shortly after the officer met Johnson, he was taken to another automobile where the defendant was seated.  The officer had a conversation with the defendant in which the defendant allegedly offered money to the officer in return for intelligence-type information&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  on police activities.  </SPAN></P>

Defendant argued that the evidence was a result of prohibitions found in &sect; 26-3001. On appeal, the court affirmed and held that &sect; 26-3001 was inapposite because the officer had not intercepted or overheard a conversation that was made directly to him, nor was the officer an eavesdropper, nor did he have the conversation under surveillance. The court ruled that there was no interest legitimately protected by the Fourth Amendment involved when defendant misplaced his belief that the person to whom he voluntarily confided his wrongdoing would not have revealed it. The court determined that no warrant to search and seize was required. The court concluded that &sect; 26-3001 did not apply to a party to the conversation and did not prohibit interception, recording, or divulging of a message when the message constituted the commission of a crime or was directly in furtherance of a crime, provided at least one party thereto consented.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earl Upton was indicted in the Superior Court of Henry County for the murder of his wife, tried, and convicted of involuntary manslaughter in the commission of an unlawful act.  There is some evidence tending toward an inference that Pat Upton, the wife, had been strangled in Clayton County where she was seen by a witness at a distance prior to the incidents occurring in Henry County.  The jury had ample grounds to disbelieve this witness, and apparently did so, since Upton was acquitted of both murder and voluntary manslaughter.  The case was first appealed to the Supreme Court on the ground, among others, that the present venue statute is unconstitutional.  The Supreme Court transferred the case to this court (229 Ga. 834 (195 SE2d 21)) holding that &quot;the verdict was guilty of involuntary manslaughter in the commission of an unlawful act and the evidence was uncontradicted that this crime was committed, if it was in fact committed, in the county where the defendant was tried,&quot; that is, in Henry County.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jury verdict and this holding eliminate from consideration all the testimony which, if believed, would&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  have led to a verdict of guilty of murder or voluntary manslaughter, and all testimony relating to certain occurrences in Clayton County insofar as the cause of death is involved.  This leaves the following evidence:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shortly after 11:00 p.m. the defendant came to the house of the witness Dodson to get help for his wife.  An ambulance was called, and the witness and defendant then went back up the road, where Mrs. Upton was lying unconscious on the right side of the pavement.  She was taken to the hospital and pronounced dead on arrival.  The defendant made a statement that his wife had fallen out of the car and that at the time he was traveling between 45 and 60 miles per hour.  In his statement to the jury he said: &quot;I was going into the curve, and it's quite a variation between 45 and 60 miles an hour, but driving a sports car, I wasn't used to it, so I really don't know.  It had two or three gauges on it.  I don't know, but I was running at least 45 and not over 60.  I went into the curve and got out on the outside.&quot; He further stated that he did not know whether his wife jumped or fell from the car, but that she was out before he realized what had happened.  From other evidence&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  as well as other parts of the defendant's statement it appeared that they had been quarrelling, that both had been taking medication, that Mrs. Upton at least had been drinking, and the defendant described his own condition as being &quot;in a state of numbness&quot; but said he knew what he was doing, his coor dination was all right, and he had had to battle with his wife on previous occasions during the trip to keep her from jumping out of the car.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The only unlawful act on which the trial court charged the jury was the offense of speeding. The court determined that the trial court should have granted defendant's motion for a new trial because his commission of an unlawful act was not proven beyond a reasonable doubt. The court explained that there was no evidence except that defendant's wife was injured when she hit the roadway, that defendant admitted that he was going between 45 and 60, and that the speed limit was 50. The court noted that it was not error to omit from a charge that a defendant's unsworn statement had as much force as the jury chose to give it. The court concluded that defendant could not complain that he was not informed by the State that a certain witness would have testified because the witness had testified at a prior trial, defendant knew what testimony he would have given, and defendant made no further demand for a list of witnesses. The court determined that where defendant had entered a plea of nolo contendere for a previous offense, it was not error to inquire on cross examination of witnesses to his good character whether they were aware that he had been arrested for such offense.</SPAN></P>

Further, the court found that other laws that created the Clayton County Water Authority and the Bibb County Water and Sewerage Authority were not assessed sales taxes on their purchases of personal property because those authorities, by laws creating them, were made a division or a part of the county government, making them exempt under &sect; 92-3403a(C)(2)(d). The court held that the disparity did not violate equal protection because uniformity in taxation did not mean universality. In reversing the trial court's judgment, the court held that an amendment to the laws creating the water authority, 1972 Ga.

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The principal parties involved in these cases are herein set out.  They are C. P. Company (hereinafter referred to as C. P. Company); Coe &amp; Payne Company (hereinafter referred to as Coe &amp; Payne); Overall Paint Company (hereinafter referred to as Overall Paint); Wood-Mosaic Corp. (hereinafter referred to as Wood-Mosaic); Atlanta Flooring Company (hereinafter referred to as Atlanta Flooring); Betty C. Allen (hereinafter referred to as Allen).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The action involving appeals 46725, 46726 and 46727 was brought by C. P. Company, the owner of the building, for property damage.  Coe &amp; Payne, one of three named defendants, filed third-party complaints against Atlanta Flooring, Overall Paint, and Wood-Mosaic, as well as several other parties.  Atlanta Flooring, in turn, filed cross claims against Wood-Mosaic and Overall Paint.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The action involving appeals 46739 and 46740 was brought by plaintiff Allen for the wrongful&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  death of her husband, a workman killed in the fire.  The defendants included Atlanta Flooring, Overall Paint and Wood-Mosaic.  Atlanta Flooring filed cross claims against Wood-Mosaic and Overall Paint.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The pleading and evidence of record showed that one theory as to the cause of the fire involves the possible explosion of vapors given off by an adhesive known as &quot;R-65,&quot; which is designed to be used in the laying of parquet flooring.  Coe &amp; Payne, a flooring contractor, was laying parquet flooring in the Gaslight Tower on the day of the fire, and was using R-65.  The adhesive was manufactured by Overall Paint, an Ohio corporation, and distributed by Wood-Mosaic, a Kentucky corporation, for use with its parquet flooring.  The adhesive was sold by Wood-Mosaic to Atlanta Flooring, a Fulton County concern, and Atlanta Flooring, in turn, sold the adhesive to Coe &amp; Payne.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both Overall Paint and Wood-Mosaic asserted jurisdictional defenses, claiming that they were not subject to the jurisdiction of Georgia courts under the Georgia Long-Arm Statute, the chosen basis of jurisdiction.  After hearing evidence on the motions of those two parties, the trial court sustained their position and dismissed&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the various pleadings as to Overall Paint and Wood-Mosaic.  The appeals are here upon certificates of immediate review.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">46726 is the appeal of Atlanta Flooring from the trial court's order dismissing the third-party complaint as to Overall Paint and Wood-Mosaic, and consequently dismissing Atlanta Flooring's cross claims against those third-party defendants.  C. P. Company and Coe &amp; Payne also appealed from the trial court's order, which appeals bear docket numbers 46727 and 46725 respectively.  Those two appeals and the appeal of Atlanta Flooring Company have been consolidated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">46739 is the appeal of Allen from the trial court's order dismissing the complaint as to Overall Paint and Wood-Mosaic.  46740 is the appeal of Atlanta Flooring from this order and the consequent dismissal of its cross claim against the defendants Overall Paint and Wood-Mosaic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With these facts in mind, we now consider the pleadings.  First with regard to the C. P. Company's appeals and then with regard to the Allen appeals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The action involved in the C. P. Company's appeals commenced with the filing of a complaint by C. P. Company against Coe &amp; Payne Company and two other defendants.  The short form complaint&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  simply alleged that three defendants negligently caused the fire in question causing plaintiff damage in excess of $ 110,000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Coe &amp; Payne answered and filed a third-party complaint against Atlanta Flooring, Wood-Mosaic, Overall Paint, and others.  The third-party complaint alleged, as to Overall Paint and Wood-Mosaic, that those parties were nonresidents of the State of Georgia, but transacted business and had committed tortious acts within the State of Georgia so as to be subject to the jurisdiction of the courts of Georgia under the Georgia Long-Arm Statute (Ga. L. 1966, p. 343; 1968, p. 1419; 1970, p. 443; Code Ann. &sect; 24-113.1 et seq).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The third-party complaint alleged that the fire was caused when fumes or vapors from &quot;R-65 Wood Block Flooring Adhesive&quot; exploded or caught fire; that the adhesive was manufactured by Overall Paint, had been expressly recommended, specified and sold by Wood-Mosaic, manufacturers of the parquet flooring being installed by Coe &amp; Payne and had been sold to Coe &amp; Payne by Atlanta Flooring Company; the third-party complaint then alleged liability based upon both negligence and warranty against Overall Paint, Wood-Mosaic, and Atlanta Flooring, and concluded&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  with prayers that Coe &amp; Payne have judgment against the third-party defendants for all or part of any sums that might be adjudged against it in favor of plaintiff.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Atlanta Flooring answered the third-party complaint and asserted cross claims against Overall Paint and Wood-Mosaic.  In its cross claims, Atlanta Flooring alleged that if in fact the &quot;R-65 Wood Block Flooring Adhesive&quot; contributed to this fire and was sold by Atlanta Flooring to Coe &amp; Payne, then Atlanta Flooring had purchased that adhesive from Wood-Mosaic, that the adhesive was manufactured by Overall Paint, that both Overall Paint and Wood-Mosaic had impliedly warranted to Atlanta Flooring that the adhesive was merchantable and fit for the use intended, and that if the adhesive was in fact not merchantable and fit for the use intended, then Overall Paint and Wood-Mosaic would have breached their warranties as described.  The cross claim further asserted negligence on the part of both Overall Paint and Wood-Mosaic, and prayed for judgment over against Overall Paint and Wood-Mosaic in the event that any judgment is returned against Atlanta Flooring.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wood-Mosaic filed its answer to the third-party complaint, wherein it&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  asserted, inter alia, jurisdictional defenses.  Wood-Mosaic also filed its motion to dismiss the third-party complaint, asserting insufficiency of process, lack of jurisdiction, and unconstitutionality of the Georgia Long-Arm Statute.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Similarly, Overall Paint filed its answer to the third-party complaint, asserting several jurisdictional defenses.  Overall Paint also filed a motion for summary judgment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plaintiff C. P. Company then filed an amended complaint wherein it added as parties defendant Atlanta Flooring, Overall Paint, and Wood-Mosaic, as well as certain other parties.  Basically, the allegations of the amended complaint repeated the allegations of Coe &amp; Payne's third-party complaint.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Atlanta Flooring filed its answer to plaintiff's amended complaint, asserting cross claims against Overall Paint and Wood-Mosaic identical to those contained in its answer to the third-party complaint.  Overall Paint filed an answer to plaintiff's amended complaint basically identical with its original answer to the third-party complaint.  Similarly, Wood-Mosaic filed an answer to plaintiff's amended complaint paralleling its earlier answer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wood-Mosaic subsequently filed, as &quot;third-party&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  defendant and an additional named defendant,&quot; a motion for summary judgment for want of jurisdiction.  Overall Paint also filed a motion for summary judgment &quot;as a defendant and a third-party defendant.&quot; Overall Paint's second motion was identical to its first, simply referring to its new-found status as a defendant as well as a third-party defendant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The action involving Allen's appeals commenced with the filing of a complaint by plaintiff against Atlanta Flooring, Wood-Mosaic, Overall Paint, and others.  The complaint alleged, as to Overall Paint and Wood-Mosaic, that those parties were nonresidents of the State of Georgia, but transacted business and had committed tortious acts within the State of Georgia so as to be subject to the jurisdiction of the courts of Georgia under the Georgia Long-Arm Statute (Ga. L. 1966, p. 343; 1968, p. 1419; 1970, p. 443; Code Ann. &sect; 24-113.1 et seq).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The complaint alleged that the adhesive used in installing floors where plaintiff's husband was working was manufactured by Overall Paint, had been expressly recommended and specified by Wood-Mosaic, manufacturers of the flooring being installed, and had been sold to Coe &amp; Payne (a flooring contractor&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and plaintiff's husband's employer) by Atlanta Flooring Company.  The complaint then alleged liability based upon the negligence of all defendants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Atlanta Flooring answered the complaint and asserted cross claims against Overall Paint and Wood-Mosaic.  In its cross claims, Atlanta Flooring alleged that if in fact the adhesive contributed to this fire and was sold by Atlanta Flooring to Coe &amp; Payne, then Atlanta Flooring had purchased that adhesive from Wood-Mosaic, that the adhesive was manufactured by Overall Paint, that both Overall Paint and Wood-Mosaic had impliedly warranted to Atlanta Flooring that the adhesive was merchantable and fit for the use intended, and that if the adhesive was in fact not merchantable and fit for the use intended, then Overall Paint and Wood-Mosaic would have breached their warranties as described.  The cross claim further asserted negligence on the part of both Overall Paint and Wood-Mosaic, and prayed for judgment over against Overall Paint and Wood-Mosaic in the event that any judgment is returned against Atlanta Flooring.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wood-Mosaic filed its answer to the complaint, wherein it asserted various jurisdictional defenses.  Wood-Mosaic also filed&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***9]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  its motion to dismiss the complaint, asserting insufficiency of process, lack of jurisdiction, and unconstitutionality of the Georgia Long-Arm Statute.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Similarly, Overall Paint filed its answer to the complaint, asserting several jurisdictional defenses.  Overall Paint also filed a motion for summary judgment.  Wood-Mosaic subsequently filed a motion for summary judgment for want of jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In both sets of appeals prior to the hearing of the jurisdictional motions by the court, the parties entered into a stipulation incorporating into the record of this case certain interrogatories and answers filed in Lutz v. Coe &amp; Payne Company et al., Case No. B-50266, Superior Court of Fulton County, which discovery was germane to the jurisdictional question before the court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The proof considered by the court in both the Allen case and the C. P. Company case consisted of the affidavits of Martin A. Davis and Joseph Mann, interrogatory answers, and interrogatory answers stipulated from the Lutz record.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The affidavit of Martin A. Davis showed that he is Secretary-Treasurer and Chief Executive Officer of Overall Paint, and therefore familiar with the means and methods whereby Overall Paint&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***10]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  conducts its business; that Overall Paint has never had any representatives in the State of Georgia, has never maintained an office or place of doing business in the State of Georgia, has never had an agent or employee located in the State of Georgia, and has never owned any real or personal property located within the State of Georgia; that Overall Paint has never sent a representative into the State of Georgia for the purpose of soliciting business, and does not solicit orders within the State of Georgia; that Overall Paint is an Ohio corporation and is not and has never been authorized to transact business in the State of Georgia; that Overall Paint does not do business within the Stage of Georgia, and has not committed a tortious act within the State of Georgia; that Overall Paint has never produced or manufactured any product in the State of Georgia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Joseph Mann submitted two affidavits.  His affidavit dated January 20, 1971, showed that he is Secretary-Treasurer of Wood-Mosaic and familiar with its business; that Wood-Mosaic never had any representatives or agents in the State of Georgia, has never been domesticated in the State of Georgia, has never maintained a place of doing&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***11]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  business in the State of Georgia, and has never had an agent designated for service of process or an agent upon whom service could be perfected in the State of Georgia; that Wood-Mosaic has never maintained an office or place of doing business in the State of Georgia, has never had an agent or employee located in the State of Georgia, and has never owned any real or personal property in the State of Georgia; that Wood-Mosaic is a Kentucky corporation which has never been authorized to do business in the State of Georgia; that Wood-Mosaic does not do business within the State of Georgia, has not committed a tortious act within the State of Georgia, and has never produced or manufactured any product within the State of Georgia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With reference to the business of Wood-Mosaic, Mr. Mann testified in his affidavit that Wood-Mosaic manufactures wood flooring, which flooring is sold in Georgia &quot;by order from the customer which orders are accepted and filled by Wood-Mosaic Corporation in Kentucky, and the product is shipped from Kentucky upon invoice to the customer which invoices are paid by remittance paid to Kentucky.&quot; The affidavit further shows that the R-65 adhesive was sold to customers&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***12]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  along with orders for wood flooring, and that &quot;this adhesive and the wood flooring was sold in the State of Georgia by orders received from the customer which were accepted and filled by Wood-Mosaic in Kentucky, and the wood flooring and adhesive was shipped F.O.B. our factory in Louisville, Kentucky upon invoice to the customer,&quot; which invoices were paid by remittance to Kentucky.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The second affidavit of Joseph Mann, dated January 27, 1971, showed that the &quot;customers&quot; referred to in his prior affidavit did not include Coe &amp; Payne, C. P. Company, James A. Allen, or Billy D. Palmer; that it purchased R-65 Wood Adhesive from Overall Paint Company, and sold its own wood flooring and the R-65 adhesive to Atlanta Flooring in Georgia; that Wood-Mosaic did not at any time sell flooring or R-65 adhesive to Coe &amp; Payne Company, C. P. Company, James A. Allen or Billy D. Palmer, and that Wood-Mosaic had no knowledge of what happened to its wood flooring or the adhesive after they had been received by Atlanta Flooring Company.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Mann's second affidavit also identified as an exhibit a copy of the installation and maintenance instruction manual supplied by Wood-Mosaic with its flooring.  The&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***13]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  manual generally recommended the use of R-65 adhesive or Fastac No. 47.  It specified the use of R-65 &quot;only&quot; with the Hadden Hall pattern parquet flooring being laid by Coe &amp; Payne.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stipulated evidence brought over from the Lutz record included the following:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wood-Mosaic's answers to Coe &amp; Payne's first interrogatories showed that Wood-Mosaic, during the past five years, had shipped flooring on invoice to various wholesale distributors within the State of Georgia; Wood-Mosaic denied that these invoiced shipments constituted contracts.  Wood-Mosaic denied having any records of the value of its products which were ultimately sold to customers in Fulton County or elsewhere in Georgia.  It does not prohibit the resale of its product in Fulton County or elsewhere in Georgia.  Wood-Mosaic admitted that it shipped or delivered its products, including the flooring and adhesive involved in this fire, to locations within Fulton County and elsewhere in Georgia, but denied that it &quot;distributed&quot; or &quot;recommended&quot; its products.  It denied having records showing the volume of deliveries so made.  Wood-Mosaic admitted shipping miscellaneous flooring products to Atlanta Flooring during the past five&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***14]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  years in a total dollar amount of approximately $ 40,000, but denied that these shipments constituted agreements or contracts with Atlanta Flooring, and denied knowledge of the ultimate consumer of these products.  Wood-Mosaic's flooring is manufactured in Kentucky.  Wood-Mosaic does not know the values of the R-65 adhesive it purchased from Overall Paint during the past five years, but does know that the values for the past two years total $ 525.60.  Wood-Mosaic has not shipped any R-65 since January 1, 1970.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wood-Mosaic's answers to Coe &amp; Payne's second interrogatories contained Wood-Mosaic's denial that it sold, distributed, or otherwise marketed R-65 in Fulton County or Georgia, but its admission that it filled orders received from Georgia customers and shipped R-65 F.O.B. in the total amount of 957 gallons and total value of $ 2,288 for the years 1965 through 1968.  In answer to a query as to whether Wood-Mosaic recommended the use of R-65 adhesive, Wood-Mosaic referred to its installation manual; that manual requires the use of R-65 with the parquet flooring in question.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Overall Paint's answers to Coe &amp; Payne's first interrogatories showed that Overall Paint sold roof coating&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***15]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to two Georgia concerns (not parties to this litigation) in 1968 and 1969 resulting in shipments from Overall Paint in Ohio to its customers in Georgia.  Nonetheless, Overall Paint denied transacting business in the State of Georgia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Overall Paint's answers to Coe &amp; Payne's second interrogatories showed that the gross dollar volume of its direct sales to Georgia customers in 1968 and 1969 was $ 14,100.  Overall Paint's answers showed that Wood-Mosaic (Louisville, Kentucky) was its sole customer, that some $ 44,000 worth of R-65 had been sold by Overall Paint to Wood-Mosaic during the years 1966-1968, and that Wood-Mosaic Corporation &quot;was the exclusive distributor of R-65 adhesives.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Atlanta Flooring's answers to Coe &amp; Payne's interrogatories showed that during the years 1965 through 1968 it purchased R-65 adhesive from Wood-Mosaic in the amount of 957 gallons and in the dollar value of $ 2,288.  In addition, Wood-Mosaic sold in excess of $ 98,000 worth of miscellaneous flooring products to Atlanta Flooring during the years 1965 through 1970.  </SPAN></P>

The citizens argued that the superior court had no authority to reverse its first decision and ordinances at issue were not reasonable and they were invalid under the state and federal constitutions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The ordinances, which established a new system of ad valorem taxation, were enacted under the charter of Columbus, Georgia, a new body politic. The trial judge denied appellees' motions for directed verdict ruling that there were issues of fact in dispute. On appeal, the court held that, under &sect; 50(b) of the Civil Practice Act, 1966 Ga. Laws 609, 656, as amended, the judge acted within the authority given him by Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 81A-150(b). The reasonableness of the ordinances was a question of law for the trial judge. Further, the court held that the two challenged ordinances complied with the requirements as to the procedures to be followed prior to the creation of urban services districts. After reviewing each of the claims of the citizens, the court held that the ordinances were reasonable and not capricious or arbitrary; the taxation reasonably reflected differences in services. They violated neither the equal protection clause of U.S. Const. amend. XIV nor that of Ga. Const. art. I, &sect; I, para. II. Nor did they constitute the arbitrary taking of property without compensation in violation of U.S. Const. amend. XIV and Ga. Const. art. I, &sect; I, para. III. The court affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court upholding the ordinances.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed his conviction and the denial of his motion for a new trial, and the court reversed his conviction. The court noted that there was sufficient evidence to convict him of the offense and accordingly, the denial of the motion for a new trial on general grounds was proper. Additionally, the fact that the trial court commented to the jury, during defense counsel's closing arguments, with respect to various traffic laws, did not justify the granting of defendant's motion for mistrial. The court found no harmful error for the trial judge's interjection at that time. However, the court held that a new trial was required because it was error for the trial court to have allowed the arresting officer to testify to the fact that defendant was offered the opportunity to take an intoximeter test and refused it. It was noted that defendant had insisted upon his right against self-incrimination both by not taking the test and again at the trial by objecting to the introduction in evidence of the fact that he refused to take the test. Such error required reversal.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The injured party in each of the suits sought recovery for personal injury, and in one the owner of the car also sought damages for its alleged destruction, because of negligence charged against the driver in operating a truck on the highway and bringing about a collision with the car in which the injured parties were riding. There were verdicts for the injured parties. Motions for new trial were filed, amended and overruled, and company and driver appealed. The company and the truck driver contended that method of selecting the jury panel was unconstitutional and that counsel for the plaintiffs was the clerk of the county commissioners and exerted his influence upon them in the selection of names for submission to the judge of the superior courts and from which he was bound to appoint the jury commissioners. The court held that the company and its truck driver failed to file a timely attack on the jury selection process and the constitutionality of the legislation and thereby waived such grounds. The court also concluded that the allegations of conflict of interest against counsel for the injured parties were waived by the failure to file a motion to disqualify counsel.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed those convictions on appeal. The court reasoned that the electronic recordings that were made pursuant to an order that authorized the surveillance of defendants were properly admitted because they were timely returned to the issuing judge under Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 26-3004(c). The court also held that the order that authorized the surveillance was valid because the record clearly showed that the order complied with the applicable federal and state statutes. The court further opined that defendants' constitutional rights were not violated because the surveillance was not interrogation to which a right to counsel attached and defendants were only suspects that were not in custody at that time. The court further found that the convictions were consistent with a not guilty verdict. The verdict purported to allege aspects of the same acts to state two offenses that were based on the same transaction due to a distinction between an accusation of soliciting a sale of a vote of soliciting the sale of influence in procuring favorable legislative action.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The City of Atlanta adopted the following ordinance: &quot;It shall be unlawful for any person to exhibit or perform in any hall, house or public place in the city any indecent, immoral or lewd play or dance, or to sing to a public audience any sacrilegious, indecent, vulgar or lewd song.  It shall be the duty of the police and officers of the city to arrest every person violating this section in their presence, or on complaint of any citizen of a violation thereof by any person.&quot; Shirley Thomas filed an action in the Superior Court of Fulton County stating that she intends to dance topless, that the ordinance which is construed by police to forbid this activity is unenforceably vague and also violates designated First and Fourteenth Amendment standards and is therefore void, and praying a judgment to this effect with incidental injunctive features.  Attached as an exhibit to the petition is a letter from H. T.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The city of Atlanta adopted an ordinance prohibiting &quot;indecent, immoral, or lewd&quot; plays and dances. The woman sought a declaratory judgment that the ordinance, which was construed by police as forbidding topless dancing, was unenforceably vague and also violated designated First and Fourteenth Amendment standards. The trial court denied the police chief's motion to dismiss the woman's petition and entered a judgment declaring the ordinance unconstitutional. On appeal, the court reversed. The court held that a decision as to the validity of the ordinance would, by its very nature, be abstract or advisory only. The court noted that topless dancing was not a part of the woman's employment contract, but that her employer had in fact prohibited her from doing so while the ordinance was in effect. Hence, the woman's right to dance was not impaired, and no property right was at stake. The court also noted that, as to the possible infringement of First Amendment freedoms, and the fact that fear of arrest under a possibly unconstitutional ordinance was involved, it was infinitely preferable to try the issues involved after rather than before the fact.</SPAN></P>

The court held: (1) that the Act of 1902, 1902 Ga.

The following year, the hospital amended its cross-claim and sought judgment against the physician for the sums formerly expended by it to obtain the covenant with the patient. The physician's motion for a judgment on the pleadings was granted and the hospital appealed. The outcome of the matter was rooted in procedural law in that the hospital's cross-claim was no longer pending at the time it was amended because the trial court had filed a consent order reciting that the patient's claims had been settled and the action dismissed with prejudice.

The State Court of DeKalb County (Georgia) denied the foreign corporation's motion to quash service of process, and the foreign corporation sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The foreign corporation's motion to quash contended that the application of O.C.G.A. &sect; 24-115 was unconstitutional because, in light of the rules of the trial court, the foreign corporation was not given a reasonable time to prepare and file its answer. The court noted that 1951 Ga. Laws 2401, 2405 provided that each action was to be filed and summons issued thereon not less than 12 days prior to the first day of the court term and that the summons was to be served not less than nine days prior to the first day of that term, provided that service effected too late for a particular term was good for the next term. The action was filed on February 27 and was thus returnable to the April term, which commenced on April 6. Having been served on March 2, the foreign corporation was allowed more, not less, time than it would have been entitled to under general law. Therefore, the application of the local statutory practice rule was never a denial of due process in the trial court when the action was filed less than 12 days from the commencement of the next succeeding term, and the date for answer stated on the process was more than 30 days from the date of service of process.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mrs. J. W. Bailey brought suit in the Superior Court of Dodge County for loss of consortium of her husband against James Ross, Jr. and his employer, Stone's Independent Oil Distributors, Inc.; Gerald NeSmith and his employer, Rentz Bus Lines, a partnership consisting of G. P. Register and Burtz V. Register; and Dallas Rodgers.  The complaint alleged that one Charlie Mullis collided with the north side of a bridge on an east-west highway in such a manner that his automobile came to rest blocking the west-bound traffic lane.  When plaintiff's husband came upon the scene, the automobile in which he was riding was parked, and he ran back to rescue Mullis who was injured and lying helpless in the wreckage.  Stone's tanker truck, driven by Ross, drove onto the bridge traveling easterly and stopped in the immediate vicinity of the Mullis wreckage with its headlights on high beam; Rodgers approached from the opposite direction, traveling westerly, collided with the tanker truck and careened into the Mullis wreckage; NeSmith, who was following Rodgers driving&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the Rentz bus, collided with the Rodgers vehicle; and these collisions crushed plaintiff's husband against the Mullis vehicle.  None of the defendants except Rodgers was a resident of Dodge County, it being alleged that venue was properly in Dodge Superior Court since the action was brought jointly and severally against all the defendants, including the resident Rodgers, for their joint and concurring negligence as set out in the complaint.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The plaintiff then amended her complaint by striking NeSmith and his employer Rentz as defendants, and Ross and his employer Stone filed a third-party complaint against them as third-party defendants after obtaining leave of the court pursuant to CPA &sect; 14 (a) (Code Ann. &sect; 81A-114 (a)).  NeSmith and Rentz filed their substantially identical motions to dismiss the third-party complaint, one of the grounds being that it would be in violation of the Constitution of Georgia, Art. VI, Sec. XIV, Pars. IV and VI (Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 2-4904, 2-4906) to apply CPA &sect; 14 (a) (Code Ann. &sect; 81A-114 (a)) to them since they were residents of counties other than the county where suit was brought.  The trial court denied the motions to dismiss, certifying its order for&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  immediate review, and the appeal was taken to the Supreme Court.  That court transferred the case here.  Register v. Stone's Independent Oil Distributors, 225 Ga. 490 (168 SE2d 133). </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In plaintiff wife's action for loss of consortium, third-party plaintiffs, driver and employer, filed a complaint against third-party defendants, driver and employer. Third-party defendants filed motions to dismiss on the grounds that venue was improper under Ga. Const. art. VI, &sect; 14, para. 4, 6 and that the complaint was inadequate. The Dodge Superior Court (Georgia) denied the motions to dismiss, and third-party defendants appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The wife's claim arose out of a multi-vehicle accident. Third-party plaintiffs impleaded third-party defendants under &sect; 14 of the Civil Practice Act (CPA), Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 81A-114. The court affirmed the trial court's decision. It stated that no independent claim had been made by third-party plaintiffs against third-party defendants, but only a claim for contribution in the event third-party plaintiffs were held liable. Thus, the court stated, this claim was an ancillary one contingent upon the outcome of the main case and could not properly be regarded as a &quot;suit&quot; or &quot;case&quot; for venue purposes. The court also rejected third-party defendants' argument that the third-party complaint was deficient because it did not specifically allege that third-party plaintiffs and third-party defendants were joint tortfeasors, stating that the third-party complaint was adequate under the notice-pleading provisions of &sect; 8(a) of the CPA, Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 81A-108(a). Finally, it held that it was not possible at this stage to determine whether third-party plaintiffs and third-party defendants were in fact joint tortfeasors, stating that this was a matter that addressed itself to factual proof.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the trial court's decision denying third-party defendants' motions to dismiss third-party plaintiffs' complaint in plaintiff's action for loss of consortium.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court construed &sect; 4 of the Act most strongly in favor of the taxpayer in view of its doubtful meaning. Considering the &quot;in and out&quot; exclusion together with the inclusions with respect to use and consumption of property after it had come to rest in Georgia, and resolving any doubt in favor of the taxpayer, the court concluded that the General Assembly, by the declaration of intent prior to February 19, 1965, did not intend to impose a use tax on the value of property moving &quot;in and out&quot; of Georgia, which merely had other property attached to it while it was in Georgia, and which was at all times intended for use in another state. The trial court properly concluded that the taxes and interest were illegally assessed as to a truck chassis. By cross appeal, the taxpayer contended that all other transactions before February 19, 1965, were exempt under &sect; 4. The court disagreed. No controlling precedent had come to the court's attention to require a holding that the taxes created a multiple taxing situation on interstate commerce.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant appeals from the denial of his motion for acquittal and from the order placing his case on the dead docket.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant was indicted in January 1968.  The case was called for trial in March and April and on both occasions defendant obtained a continuance.  The case was also continued in June, although there is some dispute as to which side made the motion.  When called again in September, the State asked for a continuance because the prosecuting witness was in Viet Nam.  The same day defendant filed a demand for trial with the clerk.  The State requested and received continuances in October, November and December, at which time the court ordered that the demand for trial be spread upon the minutes.  In January and February of 1969, continuances were again granted to the State due to the absence of its witness.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant obtained several continuances of his criminal trial. The State was granted several continuances when it was learned that the complainant was in Viet Nam. The trial court denied defendant's motion for acquittal on speedy trial grounds, and granted the State's motion to have defendant's case placed on the dead docket. Defendant appealed, contending that his statutory speedy trial rights had been violated. The court held that it was impossible to tell whether the trial court had given defendant special permission pursuant to Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 27-1901 to make a demand for a speedy trial because the trial court denied defendant's motion for acquittal but also stated erroneously that it did not have the power to grant special permission in accordance with &sect; 27-1901. The court ordered the trial court to construe its order. With regard to the placement of defendant's case on the dead docket, the court held that such was unconstitutional because defendant had not given his permission therefor. However, the State was still entitled to try and make a reasonable showing for a continuance pursuant to Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 27-2002.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the charge impermissibly shifted the burden of proof to defendant and shattered the presumption of innocence. The court noted that alibi was not truly an independent affirmative defense, but rather was evidence in support of a plea of not guilty and should be treated as evidence tending to disprove defendant's presence at the time and place of an alleged crime.

The case was before a supreme court on the alleged unconstitutionality of a criminal statute, but the case was transferred to the court after the issue was adversely decided against defendant.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant claimed that the trial court erred in denying his motion requesting an examination by a psychiatrist at the county's expense, in denying his motion for a new trial, and in charging a jury. The court affirmed his conviction. The court held that the trial court did not err in denying his motion for an examination by a psychiatrist where defendant had not entered a special plea of insanity at the time of trial. The court found that a letter from a psychiatrist, which supported defendant's claim of insanity, had not been submitted to the trial court and was considered newly discovered evidence. Defendant and his counsel had to show that the newly discovered evidence could not have been obtained by the exercise of ordinary diligence prior to trial, which they failed to do. Defendant's counsel caused defendant to be psychiatrically examined 3 days prior to trial and apparently took no affirmative steps to learn by expeditious means the examining psychiatrist's opinion. If defendant and his counsel had been diligent, a plea of insanity could have been asserted under O.C.G.A. &sect;&sect; 27-1501, 27-1502. The trial court's charge to the jury was a correct statement of the law.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In May, 1966, the claimant received an injury which arose out of and in the course of his employment.  A standard form of agreement to pay compensation was approved by the State Board of Workmen's Compensation in July, 1966.  The parties then submitted a stipulation to the board which was approved on August 24, 1966.  However, on September 23, 1966, the claimant filed an appeal to the superior court where the award was reversed.  Upon appeal to this court the judgment of the superior court was affirmed.  U. S. Fidel. &amp;c.  Co. v. Gibby, 118 Ga. App. 758, 762 (165 SE2d 455). On March 27, 1968, the employer requested the board either to approve the stipulation, with certain portions deleted, or to set the claim down for a hearing to determine a change in condition.  The matter then came on for a hearing to determine a change in condition.  The award of the deputy director held in part that the claimant had undergone a change in condition in that total disability ceased as of July 18, 1966, and that the employer was authorized to discontinue payments of compensation&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  as of that date.</SPAN></P>

It was an equitable proceeding, and the superior court entered a judgment that was signed by the judge. There was only one judgment and decree in the record. The court concluded that the action came under the Judiciary Act of 1799, O.C.G.A. &sect; 7-224, not the Arbitration Act of 1856, O.C.G.A. &sect;&sect; 7-201 to 7-223. The Arbitration Act applied only to cases originating out of court.

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">James F. Galbreath was employed by Star Service &amp; Petroleum Corporation as its supervisor in an area including a portion of Georgia, North Carolina and South Carolina.  His duties required that he travel in the area and the company furnished him an automobile for that purpose, allowing him to garage it at his home and to use it for personal business or pleasure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Sunday, March 10, 1968, Galbreath and his wife went in the car to Roosevelt Baptist Church where he preached at the morning service.  After conclusion of the service at about 12:10 p.m., he and his wife started back home and on the way the company car (which he was driving) collided at an intersection with that of Bingham Price, which was being operated by his daughter, Rebecca Ann, and she suffered injury.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Suits were filed by Mr. Price individually, and as next friend for his minor daughter against Mr. Galbreath and Star Service &amp; Petroleum Corp. seeking the recovery of damages.  Plaintiffs served interrogatories on Mr. Galbreath seeking to ascertain the nature of his employment, and whether he was acting as agent of his employer in operating the car&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  at the time of the collision.  He answered under oath that the car belonged to the company and that on that date he was generally in its employment, but asserted that his use of the car in going to and returning from the church was purely a personal use, having nothing to do with his duties of employment.  He admitted that his use of the vehicle was with the consent and permission of his employer, that he had the discretion of garaging it at his home and that he had done so the night before.  When he used it for personal purposes he paid for the gasoline and oil used.  On this occasion he had gone directly from his home to the church, and was returning to his home without deviation and without any intention of going or stopping elsewhere.  There had been no stops between the church and the intersection where the collision occurred save when required by traffic signs or signals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Star Service &amp; Petroleum Corp. moved for a summary judgment, submitting in support of its motion the interrogatories and Mr. Galbreath's answers.  Plaintiffs sought to call him for oral examination at the hearing on the motion, but were denied the privilege of doing so.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The motion for summary judgment was&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  sustained, and plaintiffs appeal, enumerating as error the sustaining of the motion and granting of a judgment dismissing Star Service &amp; Petroleum as a defendant in the cases, and the refusal of the court to permit the calling of Galbreath for oral examination at the hearing on the motion.  </SPAN></P>

The employee filed an affidavit that stated that the accident occurred while he was on his way home from church and that he was not on the business of the employer. On appeal, the court held that the affidavit was not self-serving hearsay because it was contrary to the interests of the employee, it was under oath, and any benefit to the employer was incidental. The court found that the affidavit negated the allegations of respondeat superior and shifted the burden back to the plaintiffs on a motion for summary judgment under Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 81A-156(c) to show that there was no material issue of fact. The court held that the statute did not require or favor oral testimony since such testimony would open the door to trial-like proceedings. The court rejected the argument that the garaging of the car at the home of the employee was for the convenience of the employer and made it liable. The court noted that statutes that had attempted to assign liability on mere ownership without fault had been held to be unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

Where it did not appear from the record that issues were made in the trial court, they could not be raised by certiorari in the superior court, and reviewed in the court.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant sought to have a certain statute declared unconstitutional. The superior court refused to rule on the issue, holding that the issue had been brought up for the first time on appeal. The court affirmed the superior court. Appellant did not contend that he had made a proper attack on the constitutionality of the statute in the recorder's court. Appellant contended this had been unnecessary because the recorder had orally stated he knew that the case was to determine certain constitutional issues. The court held that a mere statement by the judge trying the case that he understood that constitutional issues might be determined in the case did not relieve appellant from making a proper constitutional attach for the trial judge to rule upon. Where it did not appear from the record that issues were made in the trial court, they could not be raised by certiorari in the superior court, and reviewed in the appellate court. The court was a court alone for the trial and correction of such errors of law as appeared from the record as made in the trial court. The same principle applied to the superior court upon petition for certiorari to an inferior court.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Declaratory judgment.  Fulton Superior Court.  Before Judge Dyer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Carling L. Dinkler, Jr., d/b/a Dinkler Plaza Hotel, and fourteen other plaintiffs brought suit against Herbert T. Jenkins, Chief of Police of the City of Atlanta, and various law enforcement officials of Fulton County and the Atlanta Judicial Circuit, seeking a temporary restraining order, interlocutory injunction, and declaratory judgment based upon the contention that plaintiffs are entitled to pursue their businesses of selling distilled spirits by the drink for consumption on the premises until 2 a.m. following midnight on Saturdays.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Omitting allegations pertaining to the propriety of the remedies sought, the petition alleges in substance as follows:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By virtue of Ga. L. 1964, p. 771, any municipality lying within a county having a population of 40,000 or more in which the sale of alcoholic beverages is permitted by law is authorized to conduct a special referendum for the purpose of determining whether or not the sale of distilled spirits by the drink for consumption on the premises should be permitted.  Among other things, the 1964 Act provides&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  that cities holding a favorable referendum shall have the full power and authority to adopt all reasonable rules and regulations governing the qualifications and criteria for issuance of licenses to sell distilled spirits or alcoholic beverages for beverage purposes by the drink for consumption only on the premises and to promulgate reasonable rules and regulations governing the conduct of the licensees, including the regulation of hours of business.  Pursuant to this Act the City of Atlanta conducted a favorable referendum and adopted an ordinance providing for the licensing of establishments to engage in the business of selling distilled spirits by the drink.  The ordinance, attached to the petition as an exhibit, provides in Section 30 (d) that licensees for the sale of spirituous liquors by the drink shall not engage in the sale or permit the consumption of spirituous liquors between the hours of 2 a.m. Sunday and 9 a.m. Monday.  It is alleged that the plaintiffs are licensed owners and operators of establishments in the City of Atlanta engaged in the business of selling distilled spirits and alcohol by the drink for consumption on the premises, and that defendants seek to close&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the establishments at 12 midnight on Saturdays.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The State Revenue Commissioner was allowed to intervene as a party defendant, and all defendants, with the exception of Police Chief Jenkins, filed general demurrers to the petition.  From the sustaining of the demurrers and the dismissal of the petition, plaintiffs appealed to the Supreme Court.  That court held that the case was not one within its jurisdiction and transferred it to this court.  Dinkler v. Jenkins, 223 Ga. 807 (158 SE2d 381). </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff bar operators appealed from a judgment of the Fulton Superior Court (Georgia), which sustained the demurrer of defendant officials to the operators' petition for injunctive and declaratory relief to prevent the officials from prohibiting the sale of liquor by the drink after midnight on Saturdays.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The officials contended that the operators were prohibited from selling liquor after midnight by the &quot;tippling house statute&quot;, Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 26-6105, which prohibited keeping a bar open &quot;on the Sabbath day or Sabbath night&quot;, and by two provisions of the 1938 Act, Ga. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 1079, 1060, which re-authorized the sale of liquor for off-premises consumption after repealing a general prohibition, and prohibited sale from midnight Saturday to midnight Sunday night. The operators asserted that the sale until 2:00AM Sunday morning was allowed under a local ordinance passed pursuant to the 1964 Act, Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 1083. On appeal, the court reversed the superior court order sustaining the officials' demurrer. The court interpreted &quot;Sabbath&quot; under the &quot;tippling house statute&quot; as precluding sale from dawn Sunday until midnight, thus inapplicable. The court held that the 1938 Act pertained only to sales for off-premise consumption, thus did not conflict with the &quot;1964 Act&quot; which specifically authorized municipalities to regulate sales by the drink, thus the local ordinance permitting the operators to remain open until 2:00 AM was a valid exercise of the authority conferred.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the superior court judgment which had sustained a demurrer by the officials to the operators' petition for injunctive and declaratory relief to prevent the officials from prohibiting the sale of liquor by the drink after midnight on Saturdays.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After he was found guilty of violating the City's ordinance that prohibited the blocking of a public crossing by a railroad train, or car, or locomotive, the superior court sustained the trial court's judgment, and defendant sought further review. On appeal, defendant contended that he was not liable under O.C.G.A. &sect; 94-517. The court found that the evidence showed that it was possible that an engineer, or a brakeman, or a flagman might have halted the railroad car without the knowledge of, or instructions of, defendant. Therefore the court ruled that the City failed to carry the burden of proving defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. Based on the determination that the conviction was unauthorized by the evidence, the court held that it was unnecessary to determine whether the constitutionality of &sect; 94-517 was properly raised in the trial court by the prosecution. The court held that it was also unnecessary to determine whether the trial court erred when it held that the statute was unconstitutional or whether a &quot;defense&quot; under the statute was proven. The court ruled that the trial court erred when it overruled defendant's petition for certiorari.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The railway company filed a demurrer and sought a judgment as a matter of law, which was denied. The general demurrer contended that the company was not liable for the injury when the owner permitted the animals to stray. On review, the court found that under O.C.G.A. &sect;&sect; 94-1108, 18-607, 68-710, only a burden of proof was established, no substantive rule. The court concluded that the rule to apply was that the railway company was not liable in the absence of willful or wanton acts of negligence on its part where the animals went onto railway property. The court noted that under O.C.G.A. &sect; 62-1604, animal owners were prohibited from permitting animals to roam on others' properties without permission. The court determined there the railway did not act with willful or wanton negligence, so it was not liable for damages. Thus the court ruled that the trial court erred in failing to sustain the company's demurrer. The court declined to decide, however, whether the trial court also erred in refusing to direct a verdict for the company and thereafter denying a judgment notwithstanding the verdict.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed and found that the taxpayer's cost of fabricating the steel could never have been included in the tax base. The trial court was not erroneous in reversing the commissioner's additional use tax assessment on the structural steel. The court further held that because the taxpayer did not contend or introduce evidence that the commissioner's figures for fair market value were incorrect or unreasonable or more than the cost price of the equipment, or that like taxes had been paid in another state for which it should have been given credit, the judgment of the trial court was erroneous in reversing the commissioner's additional use tax assessment as to the taxpayer's erection equipment used in performing steel erection contracts in Georgia.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Patricia Davis brought suit against the Western &amp; Atlantic Railroad Company and the Southern Railway Company for the wrongful death of her husband who was killed when the automobile he was driving was struck by Western &amp; Atlantic's train, the &quot;Georgian,&quot; at a public crossing in Dalton.  The petition seeks recovery for the concurrent negligence of the two railroads and alleges substantially as follows.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plaintiff's decedent was operating his automobile in an easterly direction on Industrial Boulevard not more than 75 feet behind a car being operated by Brown.  When the Brown car reached the Industrial Boulevard crossing it slowed and then proceeded across the two switch tracks and the two main-line tracks, with plaintiff's decedent still following not more than 75 feet behind.  At the same time the Georgian was traveling north toward the crossing at a speed of 55 m.p.h.  Both defendants had placed railroad cars on their switch tracks to the south of the crossing which obstructed decedent's view to such an extent that he was unable to see the train approaching from that direction&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  until he was already on the tracks of the approaching train, when the collision occurred.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was further alleged that the obstruction to view created a special hazard so that the defendants should have maintained a mechanical signal device or watchman to warn traffic of approaching trains; that neither of the defendants maintained any mechanical signal device or watchman at the crossing; and that the whistle on the Georgian was not blown at any point within 400 yards of the crossing, nor was the bell rung.  Specifications of negligence as to Western &amp; Atlantic are: failure to ring the bell of the train in violation of a city ordinance; failure to blow the whistle in violation of Code Ann. &sect; 94-506; failure of its engineer to exercise due care in approaching the crossing as required by Code Ann. &sect; 94-506; operation of the train at a speed of 55 m.p.h. in violation of a city ordinance; failure to maintain safety signals, safety lights or watchmen at the crossing in violation of a city ordinance; and failure to keep the train under such control as was necessary to stop the train at the crossing, in violation of a city ordinance.  Allegations of negligence on the part of Southern are&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  failure to maintain safety signals, safety lights or watchmen at the crossing in violation of a city ordinance; negligence in placing its cars on the siding just south of the crossing where it knew or should have known that these would block the view of persons entering the crossing from the west of trains of either defendant approaching the crossing from the south; and failure to maintain a mechanical signal device or watchman under such circumstances, constituting a hazard to persons so entering upon the crossing.  Both defendants are charged with negligence in maintaining the obstructions to view on the southwest side of the crossing and the failure, under these circumstances, to maintain a mechanical signal device or watchman to warn motorists of trains approaching from the south.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Western &amp; Atlantic appeals from an order overruling its general demurrer, and plaintiff appeals from an order sustaining the general demurrer of Southern.  Errors are enumerated on various other rulings on the pleadings.  </SPAN></P>

The trial court had sustained demurrers filed by defendant southern railway.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The complaint sought damages for the concurrent negligence of the two railways. The western railway demurred on the basis that the decedent could have seen the approaching train and stopped short of the main-line track in time to avoid the collision. On review, the court affirmed in part and reversed in part. The court concluded that it could not say as a matter of law that the sole proximate cause of the decedent's death was his failure to exercise ordinary care for his own safety or the independent and superseding negligence of the western railway in the operation of its train. Accordingly there was no error by the trial court in overruling the general demurrer of the western railway, and the court affirmed to that extent. The court found, however, that the trial court did err in overruling the general demurrer of the southern railway because it was possible for the wife to demonstrate that both railways were liable under the facts presented.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Action for damages.  Elbert Superior Court.  Before Judge Williford.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lucy R. Hill brought suit against Benjamin Willis and Southern Poultry, Inc., seeking to recover damages for the wrongful death of her husband who was killed when the pick-up truck he was driving collided with Southern's tractor-trailer truck while being operated by its employee, Willis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The petition, as twice amended, alleged that on November 20, 1964, at approximately 3 p.m., plaintiff's husband was driving his Chevrolet pick-up truck in an easterly direction on Vanna Road in Hart County approaching its intersection with the Bowman-Goldmine Road.  At the same time Willis was driving Southern's truck in a southerly direction on the Bowman-Goldmine Road approaching the same intersection.  Both roads were public, paved, county roads approximately 20 feet in width with shoulders approximately 5 feet wide on each side.  Plaintiff alleged that her husband stopped at the intersection and that &quot;after ascertaining that no traffic apparently was approaching on the Bowman-Goldmine Road, then proceeded into the intersection at a speed of approximately 5&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  miles per hour, when he was suddenly and without warning struck by defendant Southern's truck being driven by defendant Willis.&quot; The Bowman-Goldmine Road, which Willis had traversed, was level, straight and of unobstructed vision for a distance of approximately 500 feet just prior to the point of impact, which was in the intersection approximately 5 feet across the center line of the Bowman-Goldmine Road in the north lane of travel; the collision occurring right front of the tractor-truck to left front of the pick-up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was alleged that the proximate cause of the collision and death of plaintiff's husband was the negligence of Southern's servant and agent in operating the truck at an excessive speed, driving across the center line, failing to keep a proper lookout, failing to yield the right of way to deceased's vehicle which was already in the intersection, and failing to turn the tractor-truck to the right so as to avoid colliding with deceased's vehicle.  Liability was sought to be imposed upon Southern under the doctrine of respondeat superior, it being alleged that at the time of the collision Willis was its servant and agent, acting within the scope and in the performance of&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  his duties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The case thus proceeded to trial on this theory and resulted in a mistrial.  Thereafter plaintiff amended her petition a third time by adding, though not in a separate count, paragraphs 19A and 20A alleging that &quot;Willis was an incompetent driver given to reckless operation of motor vehicles at speeds in excess of lawful limits, which facts were known to defendant, Southern Poultry, Inc., . . .&quot; and that the proximate cause of the collision and death was, as to Willis, his negligence as previously set out, and as to Southern, its negligence &quot;in knowingly employing a reckless servant and permitting him to have possession of a tractor-trailer truck knowing said servant to be an incompetent driver given to reckless operation of motor vehicles at speeds in excess of lawful limits.&quot; Demurrers and objections to the amendment and to the petition as amended were overruled.  The case then proceeded to another trial on the theory that Southern was liable under the doctrine of respondeat superior for the negligence charged against Willis and in addition was liable for its own negligence in knowingly entrusting its truck to an incompetent driver who, because of his incompetency, negligently&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  caused the collision.  Evidence was admitted over objection as to Willis' prior driving record purporting to show his general character for carelessness and recklessness in driving and instances of negligence on other occasions, and the second trial resulted in a general verdict and judgment for plaintiff against both defendants.  Defendants appeal, making 172 enumerations of error.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tax appeal.  Coweta Superior Court.  Before Judge Knight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">William L. Bonnell Company, a Georgia corporation, brought a suit for refund of Georgia income taxes for the tax years 1961, 1962 and 1963 in the Coweta Superior Court.  Bonnell contended it was entitled to apportion that part of its income attributable to out-of-state business under the &quot;three factor ratio&quot; of Code Ann. &sect; 92-3113 (Ga. L. 1950, pp. 299, 300; Ga. L. 1962, pp. 455, 456) and thus claimed a refund of income taxes on approximately 36% of its income for the years in question.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The State of Georgia and the State Revenue Commissioner filed an answer to the petition.  The facts were then stipulated and the parties agreed that the trial judge sitting without the intervention of a jury would decide all issues of law and fact.  The trial judge found that the Bonnell Company was entitled to apportion its income and entered judgment for the taxpayer for the amount sought.  Appeal was taken from that judgment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pertinent facts as stipulated by the parties are as follows: The taxpayer is a Georgia corporation manufacturing, producing and selling tangible personal&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  property, i.e. aluminum extrusion products.  Its sole manufacturing plant is located in Newnan, Ga.  All orders for the taxpayer's products are forwarded to Newnan, and are subject to acceptance by the taxpayer in Newnan.  The taxpayer sells its products to customers located both within and without the State of Georgia.  All of the taxpayer's goods are manufactured and shipped from Newnan.  All contracts are accepted in Newnan.  All commissions and salaries are paid by the taxpayer from Newnan.  All sales promotion and advertising programs are originated, conducted and directed from Newnan.  The taxpayer is not qualified to do business under the laws of any other state.  The taxpayer is not domesticated in any state other than Georgia.  The taxpayer did not and does not pay corporate franchise taxes, state income taxes or property taxes to any other state.  The taxpayer pays road use, motor fuel, sales and use taxes to other states.  The Revenue Commissioner does not contend that the taxpayer &quot;must pay an income or franchise tax to, or qualify to do business or domesticate in, another state in order to apportion its Georgia income.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The parties further stipulated that the taxpayer&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  markets its products through salaried salesmen, a New York corporation and a Florida corporation manufacturer's representatives and sales arrangements made with certain out-of-state companies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All the taxpayer's customers were instructed to make payments at its Newnan office, except those customers whose accounts were serviced through a New York corporation, which customers were instructed to make payment to the taxpayer in the New York City office for deposit in the taxpayer's New York City bank account.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The following facts relative to the taxpayer's business activities outside Georgia were stipulated.  Ninety-two percent of the taxpayer's gross sales were to customers outside Georgia.  During the years in issue the taxpayer paid his employees outside Georgia over $ 1,250,000.  The taxpayer maintained an office in New York City on the same premises occupied by its New York sales agency.  From this office, the taxpayer served its eastern sales account; its name was on the door of this office, on the building directory and in the telephone directory.  The taxpayer bore the full expense of rent, furnishing and upkeep of the office in which a full time employee of the taxpayer worked. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  This employee devoted his efforts exclusively to credit and collection work on the taxpayer's accounts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was also stipulated that the taxpayer employed full time, salaried salesmen, residents of five different states, who devoted their time exclusively and regularly to soliciting sales and promoting products of the taxpayer outside Georgia; that the salesmen were assigned to territories covering several states; each salesman, operating from an office in his home where he maintained files, papers and correspondence relating to the taxpayer's business, was supervised by taxpayer's home sales manager and carried on the taxpayer's payroll.  The taxpayer owned four automobiles out of state and furnished a car for four of its salesmen and reimbursed another for the business use of his car.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The taxpayer had two corporate sales agencies, one in New York, the other in Florida, each run by a vice president of the taxpayer and each the taxpayer's sole and exclusive agent under a long term employment contract.  Each employment contract required the agency to sell and promote no other product but the taxpayer's and to &quot;devote his entire time, skill, ability, experience and best efforts to&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the duties of his employment.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Certain &quot;manufacturer's representatives&quot; outside the state, who were independent contractors, by arrangement with the taxpayer were permitted to solicit orders for products.  However, their activity was not the taxpayer's activity outside Georgia.  The taxpayer also had sales arrangements with several companies in various states.  The goods involved were &quot;shelf inventory,&quot; shipped on orders received directly from the particular company.  The taxpayer assumed any risk of loss until the goods were actually sold, but the individual company sold the goods to customers of its own choosing, on its own terms and any credit loss was the company's and not the taxpayer's.  Each company had the right to return the goods.  The taxpayer neither paid rent for space occupied by the goods nor paid any service or handling charges to the companies.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The corporate taxpayer was a Georgia corporation that manufactured, produced, and sold tangible personal property.

The court determined that the corporate taxpayer was doing business outside of the state as defined by Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 91-3113. The court concluded that the corporate taxpayer was engaged in activities and transactions outside the state for the purpose of financial profit or gain.

The claim is for an injury which the plaintiff allegedly incurred on May 14, 1963.

The court held that the superior court had jurisdiction under the Election Code, despite the fact that Congress had authority to decide not to seat either candidate, and that the election contest, while a special proceeding, was a civil case, thus was included within the provisions of the Appellate Practice Act of 1965, 1965 Ga.

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This appeal and cross appeal originated as an action in Fulton Superior Court by Suzanne E. Brissette against B. C. Munday, Jr. and John L. Brissette, seeking recovery for personal injuries she sustained on February 12, 1962, when an automobile in which she was riding on the right front seat, driven by John L. Brissette, her brother, collided with an automobile driven by Munday.  The collision occurred on Lake Forrest Drive in Fulton County in the middle of the street at the intersection of the street and the driveway to Munday's home on the west side of the street.  Munday was proceeding out of the driveway into the street, and John L. Brissette was proceeding north on Lake Forrest Drive.  The left front of the Munday vehicle collided with the left front of the Brissette vehicle, and the Brissette vehicle veered to the right off the street into a tree.  The case was tried before a jury, and on October 5, 1964, the jury returned a verdict for plaintiff against B. C. Munday, Jr. only, for $ 15,000.  Munday appealed on August 24, 1965, from the overruling&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of his motion for a new trial on July 30, 1965.  This court on January 28, 1966, held that John L. Brissette was a proper party appellee, and that a new trial should have been granted as to both defendants.  Munday v. Brissette, 113 Ga. App. 147 (148 SE2d 55). The Supreme Court granted certiorari, and on May 26, 1966, held that Munday had no right to object to the verdict of the jury discharging his co-defendant Brissette.  Brissette v. Munday, 222 Ga. 162 (149 SE2d 110). On June 21, 1966, this court conformed its opinion to the mandate of the Supreme Court, and amended its judgment to show that &quot;the court did not err in denying a new trial as to the co-defendant, John L. Brissette.&quot; Munday v. Brissette, 113 Ga. App. 849 (149 SE2d 829). Thereafter, by order entered on August 31, 1966, the trial court overruled plaintiff's amended motion for a new trial as against the defendant John L. Brissette, action on her motion having been previously suspended during litigation in this court and the Supreme Court on the issue of whether Munday was entitled to a new trial as against the plaintiff, or both the plaintiff and defendant Brissette.  The plaintiff Brissette now appeals from the overruling&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of her motion for new trial, as against the defendant Brissette, and the defendant Brissette cross appeals seeking a reversal of the trial court's ruling on his demurrers, a motion for a directed verdict, and an order of the trial court striking a portion of the remittitur of the Court of Appeals from the files of the trial court.  Additionally the defendant Brissette moves to dismiss the plaintiff Brissette's appeal.  </SPAN></P>

The driver also filed motions for a directed verdict, for an order striking a remittitur, and to dismiss the passenger's appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The driver struck another vehicle as it was exiting from a driveway. The passenger filed a personal injury action and a verdict for the passenger against the other vehicle's owner only was returned. On the first appeal, the court held that the driver was a proper party appellee and that a new trial should have been granted to both defendants. The state supreme court granted certiorari, and held that the other vehicle's owner had no right to object to the verdict of the jury discharging the driver. On remand, the trial court overruled the passenger's amended motion for a new trial as against the driver and the driver's demurrer. On appeal, the court held that under &sect; 2(a) of the Appellate Practice Act of 1965, 1966 Ga. Laws 494, the passenger had the right to appeal the adverse determination of her motion for a new trial. The court determined that the passenger's allegations against the driver were clearly sufficient to have placed him on notice of the duty of care owed and that the trial court did not err in overruling the driver's demurrers. The court found that the trial court's raising of constitutional issues in denying the passenger's motion for a new trial was untimely.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The petition as amended further alleged: &quot;That the defendant, David Charles Blakely, owner and operator of the vehicle causing injury and damage to the plaintiff, was not covered by a policy of property damage or bodily injury liability insurance; therefore, same was an 'uninsured motor vehicle.' That the nominal defendant, State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company, issued a policy of automobile liability insurance to the plaintiff, which insurance policy provides for coverage to him for damage caused by an uninsured motorist, and said policy was in full force and effect&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  at all times herein mentioned.

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The prayer was for process requiring &quot;said defendants&quot; to answer the complaint and for judgment against &quot;defendant, David Charles Blakely.&quot; Process was issued against Blakely and State Farm, and a copy of the petition and process was served upon State Farm's agent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">State Farm, as &quot;one of the defendants in the above-stated case,&quot; filed a general demurrer, an answer, and a motion to purge the petition of prejudicial matter by striking its name as a party defendant.  It also filed an application for leave to intervene, alleging that the application was filed before any party was in default and that it was necessary that it be allowed to file defensive pleadings as an intervenor, as distinguished from a defendant, in order to protect its rights.  Defendant Blakely also filed an answer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plaintiff filed motions to dismiss the demurrer and the answer of &quot;the nominal defendant, State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company,&quot; upon the grounds that&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the nominal defendant was not a real party to the action and that there was no provision of law authorizing the filing of a demurrer and answer by the &quot;nominal defendant.&quot; Plaintiff also moved to dismiss the application for leave to intervene upon similar grounds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The lower court denied plaintiff's motions to dismiss the general demurrer, answer, and application for leave to intervene.  It also overruled the general demurrer and denied the motion to purge filed by State Farm &quot;as one of the defendants.&quot; The application for leave to intervene was allowed, the order reciting that State Farm was permitted to plead and to protect all of its rights in the litigation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">State Farm appealed from the orders overruling its general demurrer and denying its motion to purge; in the cross appeal plaintiff assigns as error the order allowing the application for leave to intervene and the orders denying its motions to dismiss the general demurrer, answer and application for leave to intervene.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">William E. Whitehead, an employee of Whitehead Die Casting Company, suffered a hernia arising out of and in the course of his employment November 1, 1960, from which disability began January 18, 1961.  An agreement for the payment of compensation was entered into February 1, filed with the compensation board and approved by it February 6.  Payment for total disability was made for 13 weeks and then terminated because the employee refused to submit to surgery for a correction of the hernia.  His counsel directed a letter to the board on April 19 asserting that, although the employee continued to be disabled, the insurer had discontinued the compensation payments, and asked that the matter be assigned for hearing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The employer's insurer notified the board on April 26 that it was represented by counsel, who would appear for it at the hearing to be scheduled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A hearing was set for June 1, and on May 29, employee's counsel requested that it be postponed because of the physical inability of the employee to attend.  The hearing was postponed and no request&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  was made by either party for a rescheduling of the matter until June 19, 1963, some two years later, when the insurer's counsel asked that it be reassigned and that a determination of whether there had been a change in the employee's condition be made.  A hearing was scheduled for August 2 and all parties were notified.  Upon the opening of the hearing, counsel for the employee moved that his original request for a hearing be withdrawn and dismissed.  The motion was denied, and the hearing proceeded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The deputy director made his findings of a change in condition and entered an award December 19, 1963, by which compensation was terminated as of April 19, 1961, the date of the original request for hearing by the employee after the employer had ceased making compensation payments.  The award was appealed to the full board and after argument a majority, being of the opinion that there was ample evidence to support the findings made by the deputy director, adopted them and made his award that of the full board.  An appeal was entered to Fulton Superior Court and on April 12, 1965, an order was entered sustaining the appeal, remanding the matter to the board with direction that it hold&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  its award in abeyance pending the outcome of a proceeding which the employee had filed in Fulton Superior Court July 31, 1963, seeking a judgment for unpaid compensation alleged to have been due during the period from April 19, 1961, to June 27, 1963.  The order provided that it was without prejudice as to the merits of the claim, leaving the board free to reissue its award after determination of the pending proceeding in the superior court.  There was no appeal from that order.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On September 3, 1965, the board gave notice to all parties of a hearing scheduled for September 27 for the purpose of determining on what date a cessation of payments of compensation by the insurer may have been authorized.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On February 28, 1966, a judgment was rendered in the superior court for the amount claimed to have been due as payments not made during the period from April 19, 1961, to June 27, 1963, with interest, from which this appeal was entered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The employee cross appeals, enumerating as error the denial of his motion to dismiss his original request for a hearing after the cessation of payments, and the admission of certain pleadings as evidence in the hearing on the proceeding in the superior&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  court.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After suffering a work-related hernia, the worker received disability pay for 13 weeks. It ceased when the worker refused to undergo surgery. The worker sought a hearing on the cessation of payments, but later moved to withdraw the request, which motion was denied. In the interim, he suffered a mental breakdown, and when the case was heard two years later, an administrative finding of change of condition was made, and compensation was terminated. Meanwhile, the worker filed suit in the superior court for unpaid compensation and won an award. The employer and its carrier appealed, and the worker appealed the denial of his motion to withdraw his hearing request. The court affirmed both judgments. After rejecting jurisdictional claims based on competing interpretations of a repealed law, the court held that the administrative finding of change of condition was unauthorized because the worker's hernia, not his mental illness, was the condition at issue. But a finding as to the timing of the offer of surgical correction had to be made in order to determine the date on which payments were properly terminated. The court also gave directions for further administrative proceedings.</SPAN></P>

The court found that while the witness did not specifically state that his opinion was as to the value of the land on the date of the taking, it appeared that the plat made by the condemnor for the purpose of the proceeding was tendered to him in identifying the tract and he was then asked if he was familiar with the market value of the property. But the court determined that while the trial court's charge to the jury on estimated values and the condemnees right to actual market value was a correct statement of the law at the time the case was tried, it was in direct conflict with the provisions of 1966 Ga.

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In her petition plaintiff alleged that on January 7, 1963, she was the tenant of an apartment on the 12th floor of the Darlington Apartments, and that she and her sister got on one of the automatic elevators and descended to the ground floor, where they were to get off, and, as she attempted to leave the elevator the doors closed against her, causing her to fall and sustain certain injuries.  She alleged that the door to the left was equipped with a rubber bumper which, when touched, would cause that door to open, while the door to the right was not so equipped, and that the defendant was negligent in failing to have both doors so equipped and in failing to provide her with a safe means of ingress and egress.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Upon trial of the case plaintiff testified that she lived in the apartment from shortly after the building opened for tenants in 1951, until after this occasion when she was injured in 1963, and that she had used and operated the elevators practically every day during that time except when she was out of town.  She knew how they operated -- one&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  just pushed the signal button and when the elevator came and opened its doors, one got on and pushed the button indicating the level at which she wished to get off.  There is a button on the panel having &quot;hold&quot; on it, which will hold the door open if pushed, but she did not use that; if she had wanted to hold the door open she could just put up her hand and touch the rubber cushion on the left door, and she had done so many times, though she did not on this occasion.  The elevator is of regulation size, well lighted, and on the occasion when she fell it was lighted as usual and operated just as it usually did.  There were no foreign objects or anything of the kind causing her to trip or to slip and fall.  The elevator door just struck her and she fell.  Her sister, who was with her when she fell, testified to the same effect.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Westinghouse had made and installed the elevators and its electrical engineer, testifying as an expert for the defendant, asserted that he inspected the elevator shortly after the accident and also at a later time and found it to be in proper working condition.  It had been installed in accord with the American Standard and Safety Code, sponsored by the American&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Institute of Architects, the National Bureau of Standards, and the American Society of Mechanical Engineers.  The equipment in 1963 was that which had been installed in 1951.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Superintendent of Electrical Affairs for the City of Atlanta asserted that he had made annual inspections of the elevator from 1957 through 1964 and on each occasion found it to be in proper working condition and meeting all requirements of the city elevator ordinance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There was no proof of any defect in the mechanism of the elevator, or of its automatic doors, or of any malfunctioning of them.  There was no proof of any knowledge on the part of the defendant that there had been any lack of proper functioning in the elevator or its doors, or of any malfunctioning of them.  There was no evidence that it had given trouble or that it had caused others to fall on any previous occasion.</SPAN></P>

The trial court overruled defendant's motions for a new trial and judgment notwithstanding the verdict.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The tenant alleged that the landlord was negligent in its failure to equip both elevator doors of an elevator in her building with rubber bumpers that would cause the door to open when touched. Only one of the elevator doors was equipped with a bumper, and the tenant alleged that one of the elevator doors hit her as she attempted to leave the elevator and knocked her down. On appeal, the court reversed and directed the trial court to enter judgment notwithstanding the verdict in favor of the landlord. There was no basis to support a finding of negligence by the landlord or a failure by the landlord in its duty to exercise extraordinary care in the maintenance and operation of the elevator. The doctrine of res ipsa loquitur was inapplicable because mechanical devices, such as the elevator, get out of working order and become dangerous without negligence. The tenant testified that the elevator was operating normally. The landlord was not required to install bumpers on both elevator doors, the elevator was properly installed and had been in proper working order at the time of the accident, and was reasonably safe for all persons who operated it with ordinary care and diligence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Action on insurance policy.  Sylvester City Court.  Before Judge Monk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is an appeal from the City Court of Sylvester by State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company, which had filed defensive pleadings as intervenor (as allowed by order of the trial judge) in an automobile damage suit pending in the City Court of Sylvester.  Appellant had issued its policy of automobile liability insurance containing &quot;uninsured motorist&quot; coverage which applied to the collision being sued on.  Certain orders and rulings of the trial judge adverse to appellant are appealed to this court as being in error.  For convenience, appellant is sometimes referred to herein as &quot;State Farm&quot; and/or &quot;Intervenor,&quot; and Arthur Guarnieri is sometimes referred to herein as &quot;plaintiff,&quot; the position he occupied in the trial court.  On May 13, 1965, Arthur Guarnieri, by next friend, filed his suit for personal injuries in the City Court of Sylvester, against Junior Lee Jordan, alleged therein to be a resident of Colquitt County, and against William Glover, alleged therein to be a resident of Worth County.  The petition alleged that the plaintiff sustained&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  personal injuries and property damage for which the action was brought, allegedly caused by the negligence of the defendant, Junior Lee Jordan, while operating an automobile belonging to defendant William Glover which was involved in a collision with the motorcycle being operated by plaintiff.  This petition was served on Junior Lee Jordan but was never served on William Glover.  Plaintiff caused a copy of the petition in this matter to be served on State Farm as provided by Ga. L. 1964, pp. 306-309, which Act relates to uninsured motorists.  No defensive pleadings or appearance has ever been made in the case by either Junior Lee Jordan or William Glover.  State Farm filed its petition in the trial court for leave to intervene in the cause, alleging that it had issued an automobile liability insurance policy providing coverage to plaintiff for damages caused by an &quot;uninsured motorist&quot; under provisions of such insurance policy; that it had been served with a copy of the petition filed by the plaintiff; that it was necessary to protect State Farm's rights that it be given leave to intervene, made a party to the cause, and allowed to file an answer and other defensive pleadings to the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  plaintiff's petition; and that State Farm should be given an opportunity to resist the rendition of a judgment operating to its prejudice in the case.  On June 19, 1965, at a time when no party was in default, the trial judge entered an order extending the time within which the insurance company might file &quot;an answer, demurrers, pleas or any other pleadings&quot; in the case for an additional period of time after the entry of the final order of the court granting or denying the petition for leave to intervene.  This order was consented to in writing by the plaintiff's counsel.  The trial court ordered the petition for leave to intervene filed and set a date for hearing thereon.  The trial court entered an order on July 10, 1965, reciting that the petition to intervene having come on regularly to be heard on July 9, 1965, the court ordered that the petition for leave to intervene by State Farm be granted, and ordered that State Farm be made a party intervenor &quot;authorized to make such appearances and to file such answer and other pleadings as it deems appropriate.&quot; Thereafter, State Farm filed a timely plea to the jurisdiction of the court on July 21, 1965, before filing its answers or demurrers&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to the petition.  In this plea State Farm alleged that (1) Junior Lee Jordan is a resident of Colquitt County, Ga., is not a resident of Worth County, Ga., and that the Superior Court of Colquitt County has jurisdiction of this case and the City Court of Sylvester has not; (2) that at the time of filing of the plea to the jurisdiction by State Farm, Junior Lee Jordan has failed to file a plea to the jurisdiction or other defensive pleadings, though more than thirty days have elapsed since the time he was served with process and suit; (3) that intervenor has not waived jurisdiction as to the parties herein and any waiver by Junior Lee Jordan of jurisdiction would be prejudicial to this intervenor; and (4) that as of the date of the filing of the plea the codefendant, William Glover, has not been served with process or copy of the petition herein.  Appellant filed demurrers to the petition and an answer.  Appellant renewed its demurrers after the petition was amended by plaintiff.  In its answer, appellant denied the material allegations of negligence contained in the petition.  On August 12, 1965, appellant propounded interrogatories to plaintiff.  On August 13, 1965, plaintiff propounded&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  interrogatories to appellant.  On August 21, 1965, appellant filed objections to the interrogatories propounded by plaintiff.  On August 23, 1965, plaintiff filed objections to appellant's interrogatories.  The attorney for plaintiff, H. P. Burt, filed an affidavit relating to the interrogatories on August 27, 1965.  The attorney for appellant, Mr. George D. Busbee, filed an affidavit relating to the interrogatories on August 27, 1965.  On August 28, 1965, the plaintiff filed an amendment striking paragraph 1 of the original petition, wherein plaintiff had alleged that Junior Lee Jordan was a resident of Colquitt County and inserting in lieu thereof a new paragraph 1 alleging that Junior Lee Jordan was a resident of Worth County.  On September 11, 1965, plaintiff filed three motions in the case.  They are as follows: &quot;1. Comes now plaintiff and moves the court to dismiss intervenor's (State Farm Mutual Insurance Company) answer with respect to contesting the alleged negligence charged against defendant, Junior Lee Jordan, on the ground that said case is in default as to Junior Lee Jordan and the only issue remaining is the question of damages.  Plaintiff moves the court to strike the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  following paragraphs to defendant's answers: 1, 2, 3, 4, that portion of paragraph 7 denying paragraph 9 of plaintiff's petition and paragraph 8.&quot; &quot;2. Comes now plaintiff, and moves the court to dismiss intervenor's (State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company) demurrers on the ground; (I) There is no provision of law authorizing intervenor to file said demurrers.&quot; &quot;3. Comes now plaintiff, and moves the court to dismiss intervenor's (State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company) plea to the jurisdiction on the ground: (I) A plea to the jurisdiction is a personal plea, which can only be filed by the defendant, Junior Lee Jordan.  (II) Said action is in default as to defendant, Junior Lee Jordan, who was served personally in said State and county.  (III) There is no provision of law authorizing intervenor to file said plea.&quot; Appellant filed a motion to dismiss the plaintiff's petition because plaintiff had wilfully failed and refused to respond to interrogatories to which no objections were filed by plaintiff, and that plaintiff had wilfully failed to answer interrogatories or cause any hearing to be held on his objections.  On December 11, 1965, the court entered two orders.  The&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  first order reads as follows: &quot;The plaintiff's motion to dismiss intervenor's answer with respect to the alleged negligence charged against defendant, Junior Lee Jordan, coming on for a hearing, and after due consideration of same, it is ordered that said motion be sustained and that the case be marked in default as to defendant, Junior Lee Jordan.&quot; The second order of December 11, 1965, reads as follows: &quot;The plaintiff's motion to dismiss intervenor's plea to the jurisdiction, coming on for a hearing, after due consideration of same, it is ordered that said motion be sustained, and the said plea be dismissed.&quot; On January 3, 1966, the court entered an order overruling the demurrers of appellant as renewed.  On January 3, 1966, the trial judge also entered the following order in this case: &quot;With respect to the pending motions as filed in court in the above stated case, by the plaintiff in said case, and also by the intervenor in said case, pertaining to the interrogatories as filed in court by each of said respective parties hereto and more specifically pertaining to the admissibility and execution of certain numbered questions as propounded and contained in interrogatories as filed&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  with the clerk of the court by each of said parties hereto, and, it now appearing to the court that said case is, in default as to the defendant in said case, no answer having been filed.  And it further appearing, that the question involved in this cause of action is one of unliquidated damages, which of course is incumbent on the part of the plaintiff to prove.  Accordingly, all motions and objections as made by each of the parties hereto, plaintiff and intervenor, with respect to interrogatories, are hereby overruled and denied, excepting such evidence only as may be applicable and admissible in establishing the amount of unliquidated damages in said case, and/or in mitigation thereof and which evidence when so submitted, the intervenor herein is not precluded from contesting the same in mitigation of the amount of such damages claimed by due cross examination as he may deem proper.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The insurance company appeals from the order of the court, dated January 3, 1966, overruling the general demurrers of Intervenor to plaintiff's petition as amended; the order of December 11, 1965, sustaining plaintiff's motion to dismiss Intervenor's answer; and from the order of December 11, 1965, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***9]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  sustaining plaintiff's motion to dismiss Intervenor's plea to the jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellant's enumeration of errors is as follows: &quot;1. The court erred in sustaining plaintiff's motion to dismiss appellant's plea to the jurisdiction by order dated December 11, 1965.  2. The court erred in sustaining plaintiff's motion to dismiss appellant's answer with respect to the alleged negligence charged against Junior Lee Jordan and marking this case in default as to defendant Junior Lee Jordan by order dated December 11, 1965.  3. The court erred in overruling appellant's demurrers and renewed demurrers on each and every ground thereof by an order dated January 3, 1966.  4. The court erred in overruling appellant's motion and objections and in sustaining plaintiff's motion and objections with respect to certain interrogatories in an order dated January 3, 1966.  5. The court erred in its order dated January 3, 1966, which order, in effect, held that intervenor could not contest the question of defendant's negligence but could only introduce evidence on the question of the amount of damages plaintiff is entitled to recover.&quot; </SPAN></P>

The trial court granted the insured's motion to dismiss the insurer's answer and the insured's motion to dismiss the insurer's challenge to jurisdiction. On appeal, the court affirmed in part and reversed in part. The court held that the insurer could challenge jurisdiction and could contest liability because the uninsured motorist law allowed a first-party insurer to defend an uninsured motorist claim. The court also held that the insurer's general demurrer was properly overruled because the objection to the addition of a new cause of action by amendment was not properly raised where it was not to the amendment alone and did not specifically point out that it added a new cause of action.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To this action the defendant filed a plea in bar in which it was alleged that the plaintiff had received the sum of $ 14,956.50 from the State of Georgia as compensation for the same damages which she was seeking to recover in the present action; and it was asserted that the acceptance of such compensation extinguished the plaintiff's cause of action, released the defendant from liability thereon and constituted a bar to the prosecution of this suit.  Attached as an exhibit to the plea was a copy of Resolution Act No. 241 of the General Assembly, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  approved by the Governor on March 26, 1964, which provided in part as follows: &quot;Whereas, on January 8, 1964, at about 4:15 p.m., Morris M. Jones, a resident of Upson County, Georgia, was operating a certain 1954 Ford pick-up truck owned by him on State Route No. 74 traveling in a westward direction and was at a point about five (5) miles west of thomaston, Georgia, when he met a truck belonging to the State Highway Department and operated by an employee of said State Highway Department; and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Whereas, the driver of the State-owned vehicle negligently turned said vehicle to the left and onto the left-hand side of said highway while driving in an eastwardly direction directly into the path of the vehicle driven by Morris M. Jones; and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Whereas, William R. Oxford was a passenger in the vehicle operated by Morris M. Jones, the said William R. Oxford was fatally injured in said collision; and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Whereas, Mrs. Katherine Landers Jones incurred $ 275.00 doctor bill, $ 266.20 hospital bill, $ 25.00 ambulance fee and $ 1,035.30 funeral expenses; and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Whereas, the vehicle owned and operated by Morris M. Jones was damaged beyond repair and was rendered worthless and the fair market value of said&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  vehicle immediately prior to said collision was $ 855.00; and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Whereas, Morris M. Jones was 35 years of age at the time of his death and was employed by Thomaston Cotton Mills, Thomaston, Georgia, with an average weekly earning in excess of $ 60.00 per week; and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Whereas, the Carlisle Mortality Table shows a life expectancy for a person 35 years of age to be 31.00 years; and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Whereas, based on said Mortality Table the full value of said life would be $ 96,720.00 and reducing said sum to its present cash value, the cash value of said life would be $ 39,227.00; and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Whereas, the said Morris M. Jones was critically injured and died from said injuries sustained in said collision on the 13th day of January, 1964, which collision occurred through no fault of the said Morris M. Jones, and it is only fit and proper that his widow be compensated for his death and expenses relative thereto.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, therefore, be it resolved by the General Assembly of Georgia that the State Highway Department be and is hereby authorized and directed to pay to Mrs. Katherine Landers Jones, widow of Morris M. Jones, deceased, the sum of $ 12,500.00 for the cash value of the life of Morris M. Jones, plus the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  amount of $ 855.00 for damage to said truck, plus the amount of $ 566.20 for hospital, doctor and ambulance expenses and fees, plus the amount of $ 1,035.30 for funeral expenses.  Said payment shall be in full and final satisfaction for any claim against the State arising as a result of the collision described and set forth in this Resolution.  The payment of said sums shall be from the funds appropriated to or available to the State Highway Department.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Evidence adduced on the hearing of the defendant's plea disclosed that the plaintiff had authorized her attorney to seek compensation from the State of Georgia for the death of her husband and other damages arising out of the collision between his vehicle and that of the State Highway Department; that the damages for which she received compensation from the State as enumerated in Resolution Act No. 241 arose out of the same act upon which her right of recovery against the defendant in the present action was based; and that she had received and cashed a check from the State Highway Department in the amount of $ 14,956.50.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trial court who by agreement of the parties heard the plea in bar without the intervention of a jury entered&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  an order overruling the plea and the appeal is from that judgment as one which would have been final if entered as contended for by the appellant.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The tortfeasor's employer was the state. In affirming the judgment, the court held that the state's payment of compensation to the wife did not bar the wife's action against the tortfeasor. In so ruling, the court noted that, generally, the release of one of several joint tort-feasors extinguished a plaintiff's cause of action and relieved all jointly liable thereon. However, the tortfeasor's employer, the state, had no legal liability to the wife, as it was immune. As such, it did not share joint liability with the tortfeasor. Unlike other states, the state had not established any statutory guidelines to insure that parties in the position of the wife received fair and adequate compensation for their injuries, and as such, the award was purely discretionary. However, because the law prohibited the double recovery of damages, the tortfeasor was permitted to plead the settlement in reduction or avoidance of the wife's right of recovery but not as an absolute bar to her right of action.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">W. J. Fletcher leased from Georgia Power Company 164 acres in Troup County for a term of four years beginning January 1, 1963, and ending December 31, 1966, for a rental of $ 400 payable $ 100 each September 1, beginning September 1, 1963.  A portion of the land was woodland and the rest of it tillable farm land.  The lease provided, inter alia, that the land was to be used &quot;for farming only and in such manner as will not violate any local, State or National laws,&quot; and that upon failure of the tenant to pay rent promptly when due or &quot;to do and perform any of the other obligations and covenants hereof, the owner has the right, after giving 30 days notice of its intention to do so, to cancel this lease and take possession of said property.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lessor learned that the lessee had discontinued planting corn, cotton, and the like on some 24 acres of the land and placed it, along with adjoining lands owned by the lessee, in what is commonly known as the Cropland Adjustment Program of the Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service of the U. S. Department of Agriculture, which, while permitting the planting of&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  legumes or pasturage grasses on the land, prohibits any harvesting thereof or grazing between May 1 and November 1 of the year involved.  Taking the position that the lessee had violated his obligation under the lease to &quot;farm&quot; the land, lessor notified him that the lease was being canceled, and demanded possession.  There is no contention that the rentals were not paid or tendered promptly when due.  Lessee declined to surrender possession, and a dispossessory warrant was sued out.  The issue was tried before a jury, which returned a verdict for the defendant, and plaintifflessor a jury, which returned a verdict for the defendant, and plaintifflessor appeals, with enumerations of error amounting to the general grounds of a motion for new trial.  </SPAN></P>

The trial court entered a judgment for the lessee. On appeal, the court affirmed because the expression &quot;farming purposes&quot; was not limited to the cultivation of the soil and growing of crops; it included stock raising and maintaining pasturage. Furthermore, the character of the use caused by the diversion into the conservation program was not changed because that fell within the meaning of the farming purpose clause of the lease. Finally, the conservation program was not a prohibited sublease because the federal government acquired no interest in the land that was put into the program.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is an appeal from the order of the Superior Court of Richmond County denying the motion of the defendant Sanders Truck Transportation Co., Inc. to strike and dismiss the plaintiff's petition, and from certain other rulings of the trial court respecting the defensive pleadings of the transportation company.  The allegations of the petition show substantially the following facts: The defendant Sammons was driving a truck of the defendant transportation company which was towing another truck and trailer also owned by the defendant transportation company and driven by the other defendant Jeffers.  The drivers had stopped the vehicles on the Sand Bar Ferry bridge in Richmond County at a point about 450 feet west of the Georgia-South Carolina Line, at about 9:30 p.m. They failed to provide any lights on their vehicles visible to one approaching from the rear thereof and violated other statutory provisions, which acts were charged against the defendants as negligence and which were alleged to have proximately caused the plaintiff's automobile to collide&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  with the rear vehicle resulting in the injuries to the plaintiff for which she sued.

The court affirmed, concluding that (1) the petition was not so devoid of substance as to be incapable of amendment; (2) the amendment did not change the parties in any way; (3) the corporation's officers knew, or should have been able to ascertain, which of its drivers was driving which truck, and while it was entitled to have this information correctly alleged, the confusion engendered by the original petition was not such as to materially hinder its defense; and (4) service of the petition on the clerk rather than an officer was not so defective as to be void but was merely irregular and was subject to amendment.</SPAN></P>

No general employment by the station owner of the second customer existed; no payment of compensation for the services to be performed was contemplated.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Commissioner of Agriculture filed suit against poultry farmer to recover inspection taxes allegedly due on poultry feed. The poultry farmer raised poultry under lease agreements with lessors under which the poultry farmer supplied the lessors with everything that they needed to raise baby chicks to the broiler stage, including the baby chicks. The lessors were paid a portion of the proceeds of the sale of the broilers. The trial court expressly declined to invalidate the 1956 amendment to O.C.G.A. &sect; 42-205 on constitutional grounds, but it sustained the demurrer and dismissed the action on the ground that the provisions imposing the tax on feed furnished, supplied, or used for the growing of the poultry farmer's own poultry under contracts, leases, or agreements were too vague, indefinite, and uncertain to be enforced. The trial court found that the language of the proviso insofar as it refers to any ''person, firm, or corporation'' granted an exemption was void for uncertainty. The court disagreed and reversed the judgment because the language was inclusive enough to impose a tax on poultry feed mixed by the poultry farmer and fed to his or its own poultry.</SPAN></P>

The committee denied the application without making any findings of fact.  In September, 1962, the Board of Aldermen of the City of Atlanta adopted the adverse report of the Planning and Zoning Committee, again without any findings of fact.  The trustees then filed their petition for certiorari, which was sanctioned by the superior court judge in October, 1962.  The city filed its answer to the certiorari petition in February, 1963, after the trustees moved for a contempt citation for failure to answer.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trustees argued that a city zoning ordinance was unconstitutional. The court found that a city zoning ordinance provided reasonable standards and was constitutional for any of the reasons urged. The court also found that the application for the permit was approved as to form by the planning commission, that it otherwise complied with the requirements of buildings in the district, and the parking space provisions. The remaining objective standard under the denial could have been based on the desire to not create a traffic hazard or congestion. The evidence, without dispute, showed that the location of the church would increase the daily traffic flow by a very small percentage no more than three time a week. Because the application met all of the objective criteria pertaining to special use permits, there was no evidentiary support for the denial. The applicants having met all of the objective standards of the zoning ordinance pertaining to special use permits, the court reversed, directing the superior court to sustain their application for certiorari and make a final decision in their behalf.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The allegations of the petition essentially are: In 1956 the Retirement System and the county amended their previous contract to bring sheriff's deputies and employees under Social Security, and the county began making payments on these individuals, continuing until September, 1957, when the Supreme Court of Georgia determined that the 1952 Act placing the sheriff on a salary rather than a fee basis of compensation and making the sheriff's employees employees of the county was unconstitutional and void because it had been improperly advertised.  Gay v. Laurens County, 213 Ga. 518 (100 SE2d 271). From the time of this decision until the end of 1960 the county did not report and pay Social Security for these persons. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12"><SUP>1</SUP></SPAN><BR><BR><BR></P>

The System's contract with Federal Social Security Administration requires it to make payments for all employees covered whether or not the System has collected for them on penalty of deduction from any Social Security money due the State.  It is alleged that the System will be put in a position of having to pay Federal Social Security Administration for the deputies and other employees before their status as to Social Security coverage is determined.</SPAN></P>

Because the contract was invalid during the period in which the system sought contribution, the fact that the contract may have been entered into in good faith and payments may have been made thereunder could not have had the effect of estopping the county, requiring it to make further payments under the contract. Moreover, during the period involved the county paid no wages to the employees. They were paid by the sheriff. The employees did not work for the county; rather they worked for the sheriff. Absent any payment of wages to them by the county there was neither any obligation on its part to make any deductions or payments, nor any intention on the parties to the contract that it be done.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The plaintiff in error, following her discharge as a teacher in the Richmond County School System, brought certiorari directly to the Superior Court of Richmond County without first appealing the judgment of the local Board of Education of Richmond County to the State Board of Education.  The record of the hearing before the county board was duly transmitted to the superior court with the petition in certiorari.  The petition for the writ was sanctioned by the superior court on September 21, 1962.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The respondent filed a motion to dismiss the petition for certiorari in November 1962, and on December 21, 1962, the trial judge, the Hon. G. C.

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The grounds of the motion to dismiss sustained by the trial judge and upon which the dismissal of the petition is based are as follows:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;1. That the above stated petition for certiorari is void and should be dismissed as the said&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  petition does not set forth any sufficient, legal, or proper assignment of error upon the judgment of the County Board of Education of Richmond County, in discharging the petitioner as a teacher.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;2. That the above stated petition for certiorari is void and should be dismissed as the said petition does not plainly and distinctly set forth the errors complained of and contains no sufficient, proper, or legal assignment of error.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;3. That the assignments of error in the petition for certiorari set forth as (a), (b), (c), (d), (e), and (f) do not plainly and distinctly set forth the errors complained of and are not sufficient, proper, or legal assignments of error and should not be considered by this Honorable Court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;4. That the said petition for certiorari should be dismissed as it is directed to F. J. Pritchard, Chairman of the Board of Education of Richmond County, when no such office exists as F. J. Pritchard, Chairman of the Board of Education of Richmond County; and under the laws of Georgia, it should have been directed to the County Board of Education of Richmond County, as the law provides that the County Board of Education of Richmond County constitutes the tribunal for&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  hearing and determining any matters of local controversy in reference to the construction or administration of school law, and the president of said board is not the tribunal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;5. That the said petition for certiorari should be dismissed as it purports to appeal from a decision of the Board of Education of Richmond County, when the same should have been an appeal from the County Board of Education of Richmond County, and the laws of Georgia specifically provide that when the County Board of Education of Richmond County has made a decision, it shall be binding on the parties and that an appeal from any decision of the County Board of Education of Richmond County is to the State Board of Education; therefore, the writ of certiorari does not and cannot lie directly to the Superior Court of Richmond County from said decision of the County Board of Education of Richmond County.</SPAN></P>

The trial court sustained the chairman's motion to dismiss the teacher's petition in certiorari. On appeal, the chairman contended that the petition should have been dismissed because it was directed to the chairman and not to the tribunal itself, which was the county board of education. The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court. The court held that: (1) ordinarily neither the faulty prayer seeking issuance of the writ directed to the wrong party nor the subsequent erroneous direction of the writ would necessarily be fatally defective before final judgment; (2) the petition could have been amended to correct the defect before final judgment; and (3) the record did not show that a request was made by the teacher for additional time within which to amend nor did it show that an amendment was offered prior to the time of the trial judge's final order of dismissal.</SPAN></P>

Although neither party raised the issue of jurisdiction, the court sua sponte examined the issue and determined that a direct appeal from the board under 1963 Ga. Laws 156 violated Ga. Const. art. VI, &sect; 2, para. 8, which limited its jurisdiction to the correction of errors of law from superior courts, certain city courts, and &quot;such other like courts.&quot; The board was not a &quot;like court,&quot; but an administrative body, and, under the constitution, the court of appeals had no power to entertain a direct appeal from the board. Thus, that provision of 1963 Ga. Laws 156 was unconstitutionally void and O.C.G.A. &sect; 114-710 remained in full force and effect.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed from his conviction by the Superior Court of Hall County (Georgia) for the offense of abandonment. He contended that his motion for a new trial should have been sustained because the trial court erred when it permitted counsel for the State to cross-examine him, without his consent, after he made an unsworn statement to the court and jury in his own defense pursuant to O.C.G.A. &sect; 38-415.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On appeal, the court noted that prior to a decision by the United States Supreme Court, it was within the trial court's discretion whether to allow counsel for a criminal defendant to ask the accused questions or make suggestions to him relating to his unsworn statement while he was making such statement in his defense or after he had concluded that. However, the Supreme Court's decision held that as a matter of right, the accused was entitled to be questioned by his counsel to elicit his unsworn statement. The trial court erred when it stated that if defendant was permitted to be questioned by his counsel, the State had a right to cross-examine him even if he objected. The court relied on the Supreme Court of Georgia's ruling that while the statute provided that a defendant who made a statement could be cross-examined, it was a matter of right to him that he could not be examined unless he desired. His willingness to submit to the examination must be expressed by him, after he had completed his statement. Without his consent, neither the court or counsel could legally propound a question to him.</SPAN></P>

This ordinance assessed one-half of the cost against real estate abutting on the north side of the street and one-half on the south side.  The plaintiff in error contended that the ordinance was never legally adopted; that it was never spread upon the minutes of the governing authority, in violation of the city charter, and that it was adopted without proper hearing; that it was being discriminatorily administered; that the street paving assessment was being arbitrarily and discriminatorily assessed against the plaintiff in error the entire length of the side street as plaintiff in error had previously paid a street paving assessment for the front of his property; and that the resolution was unconstitutional and in violation of the Constitution of the United States and&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of the State of Georgia.</SPAN></P>

The court also ruled that the assessment was not arbitrary because the city assessed all property at the same rate and that the city could assess against the resident's property for each street it abutted.

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These are companion cases representing the actions of Mrs. Alma D. Cox for her own injuries and Mr. T. C. Cox, her husband, bringing his action for loss of his wife's services and for expenses incurred as a result of her injuries.  Throughout the opinion the references are to the pleadings and demurrers in Case No. 39090, T. C. Cox v. N. M. DeJarnette et al., Trustees, and the rulings apply equally to the corresponding demurrers in Case No. 39089.  Counsel has stated that the questions are identical in the two cases, and the court so treats them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plaintiff T. C. Cox brought this action to recover for the loss of his wife's services and expenses in connection with her injuries against N. M. DeJarnette, et al., as Trustees of the Inman Park Methodist Church.  The petition charged that the named trustees held the legal title to the church and educational building of the Inman Park Methodist Church and the real estate upon which they were located; that these buildings and real estate were held by the defendant trustees for the church and the charitable purposes of the Methodist&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Church; that the educational building was constructed for the church during 1954, 1955, and 1956, and was accepted by the defendant trustees of the church from the building contractor on September 17, 1956; that from that date, and particularly on July 15, 1957, the date of the injury to petitioner's wife, the possession of the educational building, its steps and approaches, for the purpose of exercising supervision, oversight and care of the building, was in the defendant trustees as trustees of the church; that the pastor of the church was authorized to extend an invitation to all persons, including members of the church, to use the physical facilities of the church for religious purposes, including use of the prayer room; that petitioner's wife at the time of the injury was a member of the Board of Stewards and of the Committee of Membership and Evangelism of the church, and was secretary of the Christian Missionary Education of the church; that she performed the duties without salary or compensation; that she and the petitioner made regular monthly contributions to the church; that at the entrance of the educational building were front steps and a landing constructed by the defendants&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  through the contractor; that such steps were constructed without a non-skid tread, but were troweled with a steel trowel so as to have a slippery surface; that, when the steps or landing were wet or damp with rain water, the steps and landing were slippery like glass; that they were a nuisance by which third parties would be injured when walking on them; that they were certain to cause persons to slip and fall, were inherently and intrinsically dangerous to third persons, were so negligently defective as to be imminently dangerous to third persons; that the steps and landing were accepted by the trustees without actual knowledge of the dangerous condition, but if they had exercised ordinary care, they would have discovered the dangerous condition of the steps and landing; that petitioner's wife on the day of the injury entered the educational building at a time when the steps and landing were dry in order to use the prayer room of the church; that a sprinkling of rain fell upon the steps and landing and wet and dampened them while she was in the building; that in leaving the building, not knowing the steps were slippery and unsafe, her feet slipped and slid out from under her causing&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  her to catapult down the steps, causing serious and permanent injuries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The petition set forth ordinances of the City of Atlanta, providing as follows: &quot;. . . Exterior stairways shall conform to requirements of interior stairs in Section 604 . . . (c) Treads and landings shall be constructed in a manner to prevent persons from slipping thereon.&quot; and, &quot;(1) Conditions Constituting Nuisance.  Any building structure, enclosure, place or premises is a nuisance where it is perilous to life or property by reason of its construction . . .&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The petition charged the defendant trustees were negligent in causing the steps and landing to be constructed and maintained in such a manner as to be dangerous to life and limb of third persons when walking on them in damp or wet weather; in causing the steps and landing to be constructed contrary to and in violation of the alleged city ordinances; in failing to roughen the steps and landing so as to make them safe for persons walking on them in damp or wet weather, or applying an abrasive tread for the same purpose; in failing to correct the slippery surface of the steps and landing and thereby eliminate the condition which the petition charges was a&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  nuisance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The petition urges that the negligence alleged was administrative negligence of the trustees, chargeable to them in their capacity as trustees, and not chargeable to any subordinate employees of the trustees.  The petition set forth the injuries to the petitioner's wife and the medical expense incurred for her, and prayed for these items as damages.  The petition alleged that the defendant trustees held the title to the various properties for the benefit of the Inman Park Methodist Church, most of the property being dedicated and devoted to the charitable purposes of the church, but some of the property being held for noncharitable purposes, and &quot;that among the non-charitable assets to which title is held by defendant trustees on July 26, 1957, was and is an owner's public liability policy, issued by Dixie Fire and Casualty Company of the City of Greer, South Carolina, insuring defendant trustees for bodily injury liability to third persons for which the insured trustees shall become legally obligated to pay to third persons, such as your petitioners, arising out of the ownership, maintenance or use of the Church premises, and all operations necessary or incidental thereto.&quot; </SPAN></P>

Petitioner does not seek to subject any personal or individual assets owned by any of defendant trustees in their personal or individual capacities . . .&quot;</SPAN></P>

The trial court sustained the defendants' general demurrers and dismissed the petition.  All, or parts of all, of nine of the special demurrers were sustained, and all or parts of five special demurrers were overruled.  Paragraph 10 of the special demurrer was overruled on the ground that paragraph 27 (a) by incorporation of paragraph 17 of the plaintiff's petition was partly good and partly bad, and paragraph 10 being to the entire paragraph 27 (a) with paragraph 17 incorporated, was bad in form.  Paragraph 15 was overruled on the ground that paragraph&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  27 (g) was partly good and partly bad, and paragraph 15 of the demurrers being to the entire paragraph 27 (g) was bad in form.

Defendant concluded his statement by stating that he shot the victim to keep the victim from cutting him. The State produced a witness who heard a voice just before the shot was fired say please don't shoot. In addition, a knife was found near the victim's body and testimony was introduced that the victim was shot from a distance of 15 feet or less. The court held that it appeared that defendant and the victim voluntarily entered into a duel with deadly weapons with knowledge that injury or death might result therefrom. As a result, the trial court did not err in refusing to charge the jury on the law of accidental killing. Finally, defendant could not argue that the provisions of O.C.G.A. &sect;38-415, relating to the unsworn statement of defendants in criminal trials, were unconstitutional because he failed to raise the issue at trial.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defendant was tried and convicted in the Recorder's Court of the City of Albany for violation of a city ordinance containing the following provisions:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Section I.  Every person who, within the City of Albany, shall solicit memberships in any club, association or union, where there is any charge for membership therein, shall prior to any solicitation for members thereof, apply to and obtain from the City Clerk a certificate and license authorizing such activities upon his or her part.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Section II.

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defendant, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  a labor union organizer, filed a plea in abatement challenging the validity of the ordinance on a number of Constitutional and statutory Federal grounds.  Evidence was offered in support of the plea which revealed that the defendant was employed for the purpose of meeting with employees of A. &amp; M. Karagheusian, Inc. to discuss the feasibility of becoming organized, to talk with them directly in and around the plant gates and at their homes, and to request them to join the Textile Workers Union, and that he also held meetings for the purpose of talking with and soliciting such employees.  The application form required before the issuance of the license contains the following language: &quot;The undersigned submits, in connection with the foregoing application (a) a certificate from --- attesting to the fact that I am a person of good moral character, and I state that I have never been convicted of any offense against the laws of any State, or of the United States; and (b) that I am not now and have never been affiliated with or a member of any organization or group having communist beliefs.

The recorder overruled the plea in abatement and found the defendant guilty of the violation charged.

He filed a plea in abatement challenging the validity of the ordinance, but was convicted. He appealed. The court reversed the conviction, holding that Congress had no power to intrude in the field of purely intrastate commerce. The ordinance denied to all citizens of the city the right to request their friends join any dues-paying association unless they first obtained a license for that purpose, and the grant of the license was conditioned upon payment of a fee and the furnishing of statements that the applicant was of good moral character, never violated any law, and never joined any organization having &quot;Communistic&quot; beliefs.

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defendant in error filed a petition in the Superior Court of Fulton County for the adoption of a child.  The petition, to which was attached the written consent of the child's mother, alleged that the petitioner was a resident of Fulton County; that the mother of the child was the petitioner's wife; that the petitioner and his wife did not know the whereabouts of the child's father; that the father for more than twelve months had wantonly and wilfully failed to comply with a decree of the Superior Court of Cobb County, ordering him to make weekly payments for the support of the child, and that therefore his consent was not required.  Upon presentation of the petition the court entered an order for interlocutory hearing, setting a date for hearing and directing that &quot;service be perfected upon the party or parties whose written consent to the adoption is required, unless service of said petition and notice has been or will be duly waived in writing.&quot; The record does not show any service (personal, by registered mail or by publication) upon the father.  On the date set for hearing the court entered a temporary&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  order, reciting that after the examination of the parties interested, in chambers, under oath, and after giving consideration to the investigation and report made by the State Department of Public Welfare, it appeared that the adoption was for the best interest of the child; ordering that the prayers of petitioner be granted and that temporary custody of the child be awarded petitioner; and that the matter be set down for final hearing after the expiration of six months.  Before the final hearing, the plaintiff in error, the natural father of the child, filed the following: (1) a plea to the jurisdiction on the grounds (a) that the courts of Colorado, where the father resided, and not the courts of Georgia had jurisdiction of the subject matter of the adoption, because the child's residence follows that of his father; and (b) that the father had not consented to nor been served or received notice as required by Georgia law; (2) a general demurrer on the grounds that the petition did not show (a) facts constituting abandonment or the father's consent; (b) that the child was a resident of Fulton County; (c) that service was made as provided by law, or; (d) that the father was a resident&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of Fulton County or had forfeited his parental rights and thereby that the court had jurisdiction; (3) an answer and objection praying that the adoption be denied and the interlocutory order be revoked, in which he denied and sought to refute the contention that he had wilfully and wantonly failed to comply with the court order for support of the child and that his consent was not necessary, and showed that he never received a conformed copy of the adoption petition and order for interlocutory hearing.  The evidence adduced on the plea to the jurisdiction related to the domicile and residence of the natural father, the residence of the natural mother, the child, and the petitioner; support furnished by the natural father, his visits to Georgia and efforts to see the child.  In this pleading the father appears to have followed the procedure provided by Code Ann. &sect; 74-415 permitting the court, at any time before entry of a final decree, to revoke its interlocutory order for good cause shown.  From the wording of the father's answer and the evidence presented in its support his position appears to be based on his contention that he had not wilfully and wantonly failed to comply with&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the support decree; and he contends therefore that his consent to the adoption was required; and that therefore the provisions of the statute for service, either on nonresidents (mailing a conformed copy), or on persons whose residence is unknown (by publication) should have been followed.  After hearings on each the court took all of these matters under advisement, and thereafter overruled the father's plea to the jurisdiction and general demurrer.  The court entered an &quot;Order on Application for Adoption&quot; reciting that &quot;after hearing evidence the court is of the opinion that . . . the natural father of said minor has wantonly and wilfully failed to comply with the order of the Superior Court of Cobb County, Georgia, . . . to make weekly payments for the support of said child, for a period of more than twelve months, therefore the consent of said party is not necessary in order that the adoption be consummated . . . the objection of . . . the natural father . . . is overruled and denied and it is ordered that adoption proceedings proceed as the law provides.&quot; To the three orders, overruling the plea to the jurisdiction and the general demurrer and denying the objections to the adoption, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the father excepts.  </SPAN></P>

The father then filed a plea to the jurisdiction on the grounds of improper venue and lack of consent, and a demurrer. The trial court overruled the plea to the jurisdiction and the general demurrer and denied the objections to the adoption. On appeal, the court held that: (1) under Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 74-401, venue was proper in the county where the stepfather resided; and (2) the consent of both parents prior to the adoption was required, and the exception thereto did not apply because the father had not been adjudicated for wilful and wanton nonsupport; however (3) the failure to effect service on the father was harmless error because he did not seek a continuance or decline to participate in the trial of his objections to the adoption.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mrs. Irene Murdock filed her petition in Richmond County Superior Court against Revlon, Inc., for damages allegedly caused by injuries she received while using the product of the defendant, a manufacturer of cosmetics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The petition alleged that the plaintiff was employed as a beautician in a beauty salon to give manicures, facials and shampoos to the patrons of the salon; that in said employment she used and applied the defendant's products on the salon's patrons; that her employer purchased from a wholesale distributor and promoter of the defendant's products some bottles of the defendant's nail polish together with a smaller empty table service bottle; that such bottle was manufactured by the defendant for the purpose of having the polish from the larger bottles poured into it for use at the manicure table, which was a necessary and integral step in the use and application of the polish on the salon's patrons; that just after the package containing three bottles of polish and the empty bottle were opened prior to the plaintiff's use of it as hereinafter described, she picked&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  up the service bottle and, following the written directions furnished by the defendant and included in the purchase, shook the bottle to mix the polish and make it suitable for application; that while thus shaking the bottle in a normal and mild manner, the bottom blew out and the bottle exploded and violently propelled all of the glass in the bottom of the bottle to her left hand, inflicting described injuries and resulting in various damages to the plaintiff; that the plaintiff's injuries would not have occurred if said bottle had not been defective and had had sufficient strength to withstand the mild shaking given by the plaintiff as directed by the defendant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The petition further alleged that the defendant knew its wholesaler would resell the product to beauty salons and that it would be used by the various beauticians employed therein throughout the United States; that the defendant put the bottle on the market generally to be distributed and then used by the plaintiff and persons similarly situated with the implication and warranty that the use of the bottle was safe.</SPAN></P>

She filed her action against the manufacturer, who filed a general demurrer, which was overruled. The manufacturer appealed the trial court's decision. Upon review, the court reversed the trial court's judgment. The court held that in view of the language used in Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 96-307, the court could not conclude that it was the legislature's intent to extend implied warranties to every consumer or user of a product, unless such individual was also a purchaser. The court stated that because the beautician was not a purchaser, or even the ultimate consumer, of the product causing her injury, she could not rely upon the implied warranties mentioned in &sect; 96-307, and, as such, her petition was subject to the general demurrer, which should have been sustained.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The plaintiff brought action against the defendant in the Superior Court of Bulloch County, Ga., to recover on a judgment it obtained against the defendant in the State of Texas.  To the plaintiff's petition the defendant filed his answer, demurrer and special plea of nul tiel record, alleging that the judgment obtained in Texas is void for want of jurisdiction of the defendant by the Texas court.  The record discloses that the plaintiff obtained a judgment for the unpaid balance of a note against the defendant, maker of the note, in the State of Texas.  The petition in the action brought in the State of Texas against the defendant alleges that he is a resident of Statesboro, Ga.  In that action service of process was made upon the defendant pursuant to an act of the legislature of the State of Texas which provides: &quot;Any . . . nonresident natural person that engages in business in this State . . . shall be deemed equivalent to an appointment . . . of the Secretary of State of Texas as agent upon whom service of process may be made in any action, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  suit or proceedings arising out of such business done in this State, wherein such . . . nonresident natural person is a party or is to be made a party . . . For the purpose of this act . . . any nonresident natural person shall be deemed doing business in this State by entering into contract by mail or otherwise with a resident of Texas . . .&quot; Service was made upon the Secretary of State of Texas, and notice to that effect was mailed to and received by the defendant.  Thereafter, judgment by default was taken against the defendant.  The defendant signed the note and conditional-sale contract on which the action was founded in connection with the trading of an automobile.  It does not appear from the plea whether the defendant signed the note in Texas or mailed it to Texas from Georgia.  The court entered its order sustaining the defendant's plea of nul tiel record, and it is to this ruling that the plaintiff excepts.  </SPAN></P>

The creditor obtained a default judgment against the debtor in the State of Texas to recover on a note that secured an automobile. Personal jurisdiction over the debtor in the Texas court was based upon Texas' statutory authority to service of process through the Texas Secretary of State upon nonresidents that did business in Texas. The debtor did not conduct any business in Texas. The debtor's only connection with Texas was to mail the note to the creditor in Texas. The creditor then filed an action to enforce the Texas judgment against the debtor. The debtor filed a special plea of nul tiel record on the ground that the Texas court did not have personal jurisdiction to enter the default judgment. The trial court sustained the plea of nul tiel record. The creditor claimed on appeal that the Texas court had jurisdiction over the debtor. The court rejected the creditor's claim. The court found that the debtor's single contact with the State of Texas by mailing the note did not establish that the debtor was doing business in Texas for purposes of establishing personal jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Y. Albert &amp; Son sued Mrs. Eula Fields in the Civil Court of Fulton County upon contract seeking payment of $ 167.20 principal plus $ 16.40 interest and cost, the same constituting an unpaid balance on the purchase of a carpet.  The judge, after hearing evidence in the case, rendered judgment for the plaintiff, whereupon the defendant tendered an appeal to the Appellate Division of the Civil Court of Fulton County.  Thereafter, the appellant dismissed her own petition and then petitioned for writ of certiorari to the Superior Court of Fulton County, which was sanctioned on March 10, 1960, returnable to the May term.  The plaintiff moved for dismissal on the grounds that certiorari would not lie to the superior court from the judgment of the civil court, where the amount of the suit is less than $ 300, unless the judgment is first appealed to the appellate division of said court, and because the plaintiff failed to give notice as provided for in Code &sect; 19-212.

The buyer's counsel argued that sufficient notice was given in a letter written by him to the seller's counsel and informing him that the original judgment was superseded by the petition and writ of certiorari. The court agreed with the seller and held that the buyer's failure to give 10 days written notice of the sanction of writ of certiorari and also the time and place of hearing was fatal because it was not waived or prevented by unavoidable cause. The court noted that the mere putting of counsel on notice that the writ of certiorari has been sanctioned could not suffice as a substitute for the notice required concerning the time and place of hearing.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mrs. Ivylyn O. Perry sued Marell Farms, Inc., Maryland Casualty Company, and Clarence Dunagan to recover attorney's fees allegedly due the plaintiff for representing the defendant Dunagan in a workmen's compensation case.  The petition was in two counts.  The defendants, Marell Farms, Inc., and Maryland Casualty Company, filed general and special demurrers to the plaintiff's petition as well as an answer.  The case was placed on the trial court's calendar &quot;for disposition,&quot; and on the date such case was set the defendants were not present and were not represented by counsel and upon their failure to announce ready for trial the plaintiff's motion to strike their answer was sustained and the case proceeded to trial at such term before a jury, and a verdict was returned for the plaintiff.  Thereafter, the defendants Marell Farms, Inc., and Maryland Casualty Company, at the same term but more than 30 days after the verdict and judgment, filed a motion which as amended prayed for a rule nisi to issue, that the judgment and verdict be vacated and set aside, that the judgment be arrested as provided by Code &sect;&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  110-702, and that the motion be considered and entertained as an extraordinary motion for new trial under the provisions of Code &sect; 70-303, and a new trial be granted the defendants.  Thereafter, the plaintiff's demurrers to the defendants' foregoing motion were overruled and the former verdict and judgment, as well as the judgment striking the defendants' answer were vacated and set aside.  The plaintiff assigned error on the judgments adverse to her in a writ of error addressed to this court.  This court transferred the writ of error to the Supreme Court inasmuch as the verdict rendered against the defendants was on a count of the plaintiff's petition which had attacked certain statutes as being unconstitutional and which relied on the allegations that such statutes were unconstitutional in order to authorize a recovery.  The Supreme Court ( Perry v. Maryland Casualty Co., 216 Ga. 93, 115 S. E. 2d 102), returned the writ of error to this court because it did not appear that any judgment had been rendered by the trial court as to the constitutionality of a State law.  </SPAN></P>

The attorney's motion to strike the answer was sustained, and the jury rendered a verdict in favor of the attorney. A motion for new trial was filed. The trial court vacated and set aside the verdict and judgment, as well as the striking of the answer. The court held that no brief of the evidence was necessary under O.C.G.A. &sect; 70-301.1 (1947) in the motion for new trial because the question to be considered did not require a brief of the evidence. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in construing its local rules to find that the case had not been properly set for trial. The trial court erred, however, in failing to pass upon a demurrer to the allegation of unconstitutionality, which was not an issue that could be resolved by the appellate court. Moreover, the absence of a defendant was not a proper ground to dismiss a valid plea or answer. A new trial was necessary.</SPAN></P>

On April 23, 1959, the plaintiff filed its motion for summary judgment based on its petition, its and the defendant's depositions and affidavits and other documentary evidence.  On May 12, 1959, the plaintiff offered an amendment to its petition which was allowed by the court and subsequently filed in the clerk of the superior court's office on May 14, 1959.

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rube Chronister filed an action for damages against the City of Atlanta in the Superior Court of Fulton County, which, as amended, alleges that in 1929 the defendant commenced operating the Atlanta Municipal Airport; in 1947 the plaintiff purchased a tract of land adjacent thereto on which is located his dwelling house; in 1952, the defendant constructed a new southwest runway which terminates approximately 500 yards from the northeast boundary of his property; the airplanes operating from this runway continually fly directly over petitioner's home at altitudes of 50 to 100 feet, which interferes with his reasonable use of his property, is a hazard to life and limb, has caused impairment of the health of himself and family, and is imminently dangerous to the plaintiff and his family.  The defendant's negligence is alleged as follows: &quot;The said City of Atlanta exercises general supervision and control of said Atlanta Municipal Airport by and through a paid official of the City of Atlanta designated as Airport Manager, and through the Aviation Committee of the Board of Aldermen of the City of Atlanta&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  . . . The City of Atlanta permits and allows the use of such southwest runway by the various airlines in the foregoing manner, and has failed and refused to exert its supervisory power and control over the airlines in such a manner as to prohibit flights in the above manner by the various airlines operating from said airport, such operation constituting a continuing nuisance.&quot; Various general and special demurrers were filed.  The trial court sustained the general demurrers and dismissed the petition, to which judgment exception is taken.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The city commenced to operate a municipal airport in 1929. In 1947, the property owner purchased a tract of land adjacent to the airport. In 1952, the city constructed a runway contiguous to the boundary of the property owner's land. The trial court sustained the city's demurrer to the property owner's action alleging that the city refused to exercise its supervisory power and control over the airlines using its facilities in such manner as to prohibit them from making improper flights at low altitudes over the property owner's land. On appeal, the court reversed the trial court's order and ruled that the property owner was entitled to redress from the city for any use of the air space above his land that resulted in injury to him or his property. The court rejected the city's argument that because the airport was subject to federal regulation, the city had no power of control over the manner that aircraft used the runway facilities provided by the city. The court concluded that the fact that the location and altitude of landing operations was subject to federal control did not determine whether the city violated the rights of a surface owner by such flights.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On January 11, 1958, the State Highway Department of Georgia commenced a proceeding in the Superior Court of Tift County to condemn for public purposes certain property of Reid Wilson and others.  Assessors were appointed on February 1, a hearing held on February 6, and an award entered and filed in the superior court on the same date, awarding the condemnee $ 12,140.50 as the value of the property plus consequential damages of $ 19,591.34 and finding no consequential benefits.  On February 14, 1958, the State Highway Department filed its appeal to the jury pursuant to the provisions of Code &sect;&sect; 36-601 and 36-1110.  Judgment for the condemnee was entered by the court on February 24.  On February 26, the sum of $ 31,731.84 was tendered into court for the benefit of the condemnees.  On May 5, a motion by the condemnees to take down the tender was made and granted.  On May 20, a motion to dismiss the appeal on the ground that at the time of filing of the appeal no tender or payment of the amount in question had been made.  A motion to strike the vital paragraphs of this motion&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  was made and denied, and the court then entered up judgment dismissing the appeal, and these judgments are assigned as error.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff in error State Highway Department of Georgia sought review of a judgment of the Superior Court of Tift County (Georgia), which dismissed an appeal of an assessor's condemnation award for defendant condemnee on the basis that the State failed to comply with a condition precedent to appeal by first tendering the amount of the award.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The State objected to the requirement for tending the award as a condition of appeal. On review, the court concluded that, based on case law and the constitutional law on condemnation, the trial court did not err in imposing the requirement. The court concluded that the issue was controlled by a case precedent that was binding on the State. The court read the case as holding that the Georgia Constitution required that there be such a prepayment before there was any taking at all, which meant not only physical appropriation but a legal taking as well, as first evidenced by the filing of the condemnation proceedings, or by any act where a property owner was deprived of some substantial interest in property. The court indicated that when an award of the assessors was returned, it was subject, under O.C.G.A. &sect; 36-508, to become a judgment by a tribunal competent in law to fix the rights and liabilities of the parties to the proceedings. From that moment on, the court declared, the condemnor, meaning the State, had no justifiable excuse for refusing to abide the prepayment provision of the Georgia Constitution.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the trial court did not err in overruling the petition for certiorari. The court found that the constitutional attack was too vague and general to raise any question as to the constitutionality of the ordinance insofar as it might have contravened the due-process clauses of the state and federal constitutions. It followed that the trial court did not err in overruling the certiorari insofar as it sought to raise the constitutionality of the ordinance under the state and federal due-process clauses.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant lumber company appealed a judgment of the Superior Court of Fulton County (Georgia), which overruled the company's affidavit of illegality filed in response to a fieri fascias writ issued by plaintiff city for the collection of a sewer assessment. The trial court ordered that the levy proceed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The company contended that an ordinance adopted pursuant to the city's charter requiring abutting land owners to pay the cost of sewers was violative of Ga. Const. art. I, &sect; 1(3) providing that no person shall be deprived of life, liberty, or property without due process of law. The company also contended that the ordinance violated U.S. Const. amend. XIV for failure to afford a defendant in fieri facias any notice and an opportunity to be heard. The court noted that the U.S. Supreme Court, contrary to the Supreme Court of Georgia's holding that challenges to the constitutionality of a statute were required to particularize the challenged provisions, had held that a general attack upon an ordinance as a whole as being unconstitutional was sufficient to draw in question the constitutionality of the ordinance under the U.S. Constitution. The court concluded that the allegations of the company's affidavit were sufficient to raise the question as to the constitutionality of the city charter under the Fourteenth Amendment. Because the pleadings raised a question as to the constitutionality of a state law, the Supreme Court of Georgia had exclusive jurisdiction of the case.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Whether the employee was entitled to workmen's compensation benefits from his county employer was based on whether the county was subject to the state's Workmen's Compensation Act in accordance with O.C.G.A. &sect; 114-101.

App.), which had held that because of changes in constitutional and statutory enactments, counties were subject to the Workmen's Compensation Act. Though the original statute included municipal corporations and political subdivisions in coverage, it was declared unconstitutional until Walker. In 1945, it was made permissive for counties to provide workmen's compensation, with statutory authority to levy taxes to pay for it. The issue was whether subsequent statutory amendments reinstated the original act as to all counties or just those of a certain size. The court held that O.C.G.A. &sect; 114-101, having been declared unconstitutional as to counties, was to that extent void, and until reinstatement by express legislative enactment, counties other than those of a certain size did not come within its provisions.</SPAN></P>

E. 2d 389), an action in which the Clerk of the Superior Court of Floyd County sought to recover the fees he had paid into the county treasury of Floyd County under the act placing him on a salary in lieu of fees, held that the trial court erred in sustaining a general demurrer to the petition.  Thereafter, after the judgment of this court was made the judgment of the trial court, the plaintiff's demurrers to the defendant's answer came on to be heard, and the trial court overruled certain of such demurrers, and on the trial the jury returned a verdict for the county, which verdict was made the judgment of the trial court.

Both the amended motion for new trial and the motion for judgment non obstante veredicto were denied and it is to these judgments that the plaintiff excepts, as well as to the judgment overruling certain of his demurrers to the answer, and to a judgment of the trial court passing on a demurrer filed by the defendant to an amendment to the plaintiff's petition filed after the judgment of this court was made the judgment of the trial court.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Dixie Construction Company of Georgia, Inc., filed in the Superior Court of Chatham County its affidavit of illegality together with eventual condemnation money bond to the entry of levy on personalty and sales tax fi. fa. issued by the State Revenue Commissioner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The parties stipulated the following facts: On March 17, 1951, the Dixie Construction Company of Georgia, Inc., defendant in fi. fa., entered into a contract with the Florida-Georgia Tractor Company of Jacksonville, Florida, for the purchase and sale of two tractors and a motor grader.  The net purchase price of the equipment was $ 59,187.08.  The equipment, which was the subject of the aforesaid purchase, was delivered by the seller, Florida-Georgia Tractor Company, to the purchaser, Dixie Construction Company of Georgia, Inc., at Savannah, Georgia, on April 17, 1951.  The equipment was purchased by Dixie Construction Company of Georgia, Inc., for use and consumption within the State of Georgia, and, at all times after it was delivered, was used by the Dixie Construction Company of Georgia, Inc., in Georgia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No sales&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  tax was collected or returned by the Florida-Georgia Tractor Company on the said sale, and no sales or use tax return or remittance of the use tax with regard to the said purchase was ever made by Dixie Construction Company of Georgia, Inc.  On July 28, 1954, a proposed assessment of additional tax, penalty and interest on the purchase was made and mailed to Dixie Construction Company of Georgia, Inc.  On the 23rd day of August, 1954, Dixie Construction Company of Georgia, Inc., duly entered its protest to the proposed assessment and requested a hearing before the Commissioner of Revenue.  No sales and use tax return was ever filed by Dixie Construction Company of Georgia, Inc., for the month of April, 1951.  Counsel further stipulates that, except for the month of November, 1951, taxpayer has regularly filed sales and use tax returns for each and every month thereafter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The case was heard without the intervention of a jury and the trial judge entered an order finding against the affidavit of illegality.  It is to this ruling the defendant in fi. fa. excepts.  </SPAN></P>

The court concluded that the controlling question in the case was whether the amendment would affect a sale that had taken place less than three years prior to the passage of the amendment. The court determined that the 1953 amendment of &sect; 92-3447 (a) had the effect of extending the statute of limitation as to the collection of the use tax, and the trial judge did not err in ruling against the affidavit of illegality.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tort; cattle killed by train.  Before Judge Lilly.  Thomas Superior Court.  August 1, 1956.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As counsel for the plaintiff concedes that the substance of the pleadings is correctly set forth in the brief submitted by counsel for the defendant, we shall more or less follow that statement in setting forth our statement of facts.  The plaintiff filed his action against the defendant in the Superior Court of Thomas County alleging that the defendant, between 6 p. m. and 7 p. m. on July 16, 1953, was negligent in killing certain cattle belonging to the plaintiff on the defendant's right-of-way in Thomas County to the plaintiff's injury and damage in the sum of $ 8,300, the alleged value of six head of cattle alleged to have been killed.  The plaintiff alleged that the defendant was negligent in failing to keep a lookout ahead, in failing to see the cattle on the tracks, in failing to blow the whistle or ring the bell to warn the cattle, in failing to reduce the speed of the train or bring it under control or do anything else to avoid striking the cattle.  The plaintiff alleged that it was daylight at the time the cattle were killed and that the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  railroad track was straight and unobstructed in view for one mile.  The plaintiff alleged that a fence post about the northeast corner of his pasture on the south side of the railroad gave way and fell, leaving an opening in the fence through which the plaintiff's cows went out and onto the tracks and right-of-way of the defendant, that during the morning of that same day, the plaintiff had inspected the fence and no post was down nor was there any opening in the fence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defendant filed its general demurrer to the petition and one special demurrer based upon the ground that the petition did not allege whether Thomas County was a &quot;fence&quot; or &quot;no-fence&quot; county.  The defendant filed its answer either denying or negativing every paragraph of the petition.  In addition, the defendant affirmatively alleged that Thomas County was a no-fence county, that the plaintiff's cattle were trespassing on the defendant's right-of-way, that its only duty was not to wilfully and wantonly injure the cattle after discovering their presence, that it had no reason to anticipate the presence of such cattle, that the sole proximate cause of any injury and damage to the plaintiff's cattle was the negligence&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of the plaintiff in failing to keep the cattle enclosed and off the defendant's right-of-way.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defendant's demurrers were overruled and error is assigned here upon that judgment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the trial of the case it was stipulated that Thomas County is a county having adopted the stock law as provided in chapter 62-5 of the Code of Georgia of 1933, which law was in full force and effect at the time of the killing of the cattle for which suit was brought.  The jury found in favor of the plaintiff for the sum of $ 7,175 and judgment was rendered accordingly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defendant's motion for a new trial, based upon the usual general grounds and 11 special grounds, was denied, and error is assigned here on that judgment.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant railroad company sought review of a decision of the Superior Court of Thomas County (Georgia), which overruled the railroad company's demurrers and denied the railroad company's motion for a new trial in a negligence action. Appellee cattle owner had brought the action against the railroad company alleging that the railroad company was negligent in killing certain cattle belonging to the owner.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The issue before the court was the degree of care is owed by a railroad company in the operation of its trains to livestock on its tracks and right-of-way in a no-fence county. The railroad company argued that under the provisions of O.C.G.A. &sect; 62-501 the owner of livestock was required to fence his cattle, and in a no-fence county cattle coming upon the right-of-way of the railroad company were trespassers, which changed the railroad company's duty from one of ordinary care to avoid injuring cattle on its right-of-way to a duty not to wilfully and wantonly injure cattle upon its right-of-way after it has discovered their presence. On appeal, the court held that, generally, the stock law, known as the no-fence law, did not change the degree of negligence from ordinary negligence to wilful and wanton negligence. The fact that the damage alleged was in a locality where the stock law was in operation could be considered along with all the other facts and circumstances of the case to be determined by the jury as to whether the railroad was liable. The court held that the trial court did not err in overruling the general demurrer or in denying the motion for new trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The citizen claimed that she had mistakenly paid in commission fees and that the county received the benefit of her fees which, in equity and good conscience, it could not retain. She did not seek payment from the county but rather sought the repayment of money already had and received by the county. A county official already paid himself the commissions and refunded the money to the county treasurer. However, the county refused to repay the citizen and claimed that it was not liable to any suit unless made so by statute, pursuant to Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 23-1502. The court found that, under the prior caselaw, a suit for money had and received, where it was against equity and good conscience for the one receiving it, including a county, was not based on a contract or a statute. Therefore, the court rejected the county's argument and found that although the money was paid through a mistake of law, with full knowledge of all the facts, it could be recovered because the county could not in good conscience retain it. The court found that the trial court committed reversible error in sustaining the demurrers and dismissing the petition. Accordingly, the court reversed the judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The individual sought damages for injuries suffered in a collision with a train due to the company's negligence. The company claimed that the individual was not entitled to recover damages because, by the exercise of ordinary care, he could have avoided any negligence. The civil court charged the jury that the burden shifted from the company to the individual. The civil court entered judgment for the individual on the jury's verdict and overruled the company's amended motion for a new trial. On appeal, the court reversed the individual's judgment by finding that the civil court erred in overruling the company's request for a new trial. As the jury could have mistakenly inferred from the charge that the burden of proof in the case was at that time on the company, the erroneous charge constituted reversible error. The burden of proof always remained with the individual and the burden of procedure or the burden of introducing evidence was all that could shift back to the individual once the company introduced some evidence to rebut the prima facie presumption of the company's negligence established by the individual's proof of injury from the train collision.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Damages.  Before Judge Smith.  Clinch Superior Court.  March 7, 1955.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Furman Wilson filed an action for damages against the Georgia, Southern &amp; Florida Railway Company in Clinch Superior Court, based on the alleged wrongful death of the plaintiff's son.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The petition was in two counts.  Count one, as finally amended alleged: that the defendant operated a railroad in Clinch County, Georgia, and that its track ran through a community known as Headlight in that county, at a point where the tracks were straight and had no obstructions for several miles which would prevent the operating personnel from seeing clearly up and down the tracks at this point; that Furman Wilson, Jr., was the plaintiff's son who at the time of his death was 21 years of age without living mother, wife or children; that the deceased son suffered severe attacks of asthma which sometimes rendered him helpless; that on January 13, 1952, he was overcome with such an attack while on a well beaten path across the railroad 75 feet north of a public crossing in Headlight; that the path had been continuously used by the public with knowledge and without disapproval of the defendant; &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  that the employees neither reduced the speed of the train nor gave any warning and ran over and killed the plaintiff's son.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Count two was the same as count one except it placed the plaintiff's son two hundred feet west of the crossing, and alleged wilful and wanton negligence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The witness for the plaintiff testified in reference to the pathway referred to in the petition as a crossing, that it had been generally used for a considerable time by the public and that the defendant had indicated no disapproval of this use.  One witness dated the use of the pathway from World War I.  The defendant's witnesses testified that the path did not exist at the time the plaintiff's son was killed; the defendant's employees particularly denied that they had observed it being used by anyone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It appears from the plaintiff's testimony that his son was 21 years old at the time he was killed; his mother did not survive him; that he had never been married, and had a stated earning capacity.  The plaintiff further related that his son had suffered with an asthmatic condition all his life, that when a severe attack seized him it would choke him down and that he had to stop wherever he happened to be; &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  before his departure from home on the day of his death he was choking with asthma; that he used Vick's salve in obtaining relief from such attacks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The plaintiff gave evidence that certain articles carried by his son on the day he lost his life, namely his shoes, a rope and a bottle of Vick's salve were found on the pathway where the plaintiff contended the train struck him.  Witnesses testifying in behalf of the defendant testified that these articles were discovered after the tragedy about one-half mile from the crossing at Headlight, and approximately that distance from where the plaintiff claimed that contact between his son and the engine was made, at which point there was no pathway.  There was evidence that the railroad track from the direction from which the train was proceeding to the pathway where the plaintiff maintained his son was killed, was level and straight for approximately three miles.  The evidence was conflicting as to whether the day was clear or hazy.  The plaintiff testified positively that the day was clear and one of the plaintiff's witnesses swore it was &quot;kinder hazy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The plaintiff testified that he lived about three hundred fifty to four hundred yards&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  or farther from the locale of the pathway; that from the location of his home he could hear the whistle and bells of the engines when they approached the crossing at Head-light and the pathway in question; that on the occasion of his son's death the whistle of the train was not blown nor its bell rung as the engine traveled toward the crossing and pathway.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The engineer in charge of the defendant's locomotive on the occasion under investigation testified that when coming in sight of the place where the young man was killed that the train was traveling from forty-five to fifty miles per hour; that when he first observed the object on the track ahead that later turned out to be the plaintiff's son he was not able to discern what it was at a distance of two hundred to two hundred fifty yards, but when the engine approached closer to the object he thought it might be a piece of a cow with buzzards eating it; he testified as the examination progressed that he took the object to be a faulty belt which frequently fell from trains and lay on the tracks; that these belts were about eight inches wide and fourteen feet long; that at the point where he first observed the object, which he later&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  discovered to be a man, he would have been unable normally to stop the train before striking the man; that when in about one hundred to two hundred fifty feet from where the engine did strike him, he was able for the first time to determine that the object on the track was a man; that he did everything that was possible to prevent running over the man; that he applied the locomotive's brakes, rang the bell and sounded the whistle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another engineer in the defendant's service, who was the only other person on the engine at the time, corroborated the first engineer's testimony as to the speed of the train, the sounding of the going, and the application of the brakes.  He further testified that when at a distance of three hundred fifty to four hundred yards from the deceased he first saw him, he thought that the object ahead was a pulley belt of the description testified to by the other engineer; that the belts did frequently fall and remain on the tracks, and he further related that when in about two hundred to three hundred feet of the object he too discovered that it was a man; that he then apprised the engineer who was operating the engine of that fact, and the latter at the same&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  time applied the brakes, and sounded the whistle.  The engine was a General Motors diesel, and there was evidence that both engineers were qualified and experienced in handling a locomotive of that kind.  The evidence contained other details that are not important to the decision of the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The case went to the jury on the issue of simple negligence and a verdict was returned for the plaintiff.  The defendant filed a motion for a judgment notwithstanding the verdict and a motion for new trial on the general grounds and amended it by adding 13 special grounds.  The trial judge denied each of these motions, the defendant excepted and the case is here for review.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The evidence is not set out in detail in this statement of fact for the reason that so much of it as is necessary to a clear understanding of the rulings made is extensively discussed in the opinion.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The victim suffered severe asthma attacks that sometimes rendered him helpless. The parent alleged that a train ran over and killed the victim after the victim was overcome by such an attack while he was on a well-beaten path across a railroad track north of a public crossing at a community along the track. The parent also alleged that the path had been in continuous use with knowledge and without objection by the railroad and that the railroad's employees neither reduced the train's speed nor gave any warning. The court held that the trial court properly charged the jury in the language of O.C.G.A. &sect; 94-1108 as to the shifting of the burden of evidence, as distinguished from the burden of proof. The trial court properly instructed the jury that if it believed the railroad's employees did violate a public-crossing law, it could consider that fact in its determination of whether their negligence caused the employee's death.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Petition to legitimatize child.  Before Judge Davis.  Walker Superior Court.  June 11, 1955.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On July 24, 1954, John D. Day (hereinafter called the plaintiff), filed his petition in the Superior Court of Walker County, alleging that he is a resident of Walker County; that he is the father of an illegitimate female child, three years of age, born on March 18, 1951, in Hamilton County, Tennessee, and now residing in Fulton or DeKalb County, Georgia, whose name is Daphne Virginia Bennett; that the mother of said child is Barbara Jean Bennett (hereinafter called the defendant); that the mother of said child is now in life and residing in Atlanta, Georgia, and that the plaintiff desires that the name of said child be changed from the name Daphne Virginia Bennett to the name Daphne Virginia Day; and he prays that said child may be legitimatized by the name last mentioned.  The petition so filed was verified by the plaintiff on July 24, 1954, and a notice by the plaintiff was attached to the petition, directed to the defendant, advising of the filing of said petition to the August term, 1954, of Walker Superior Court, and reciting that the application would be heard at the August term, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  1954, of said court on August 16, 1954, at 10 o'clock a. m.  Following the petition appears the order of Hon. Freeman C. McClure, Judge Superior Courts, Lookout Mountain Circuit, dated August 13, 1954, ordering that a copy of the petition and order be served upon the mother of the child, the defendant, and that said petition be heard at the courthouse in Walker County, Georgia, on August 23, 1954, at 5 o'clock p. m.  Service of the petition and order upon the defendant on August 18, 1954, is shown by the affidavit of Bernard W. Harper.  By order of August 21, 1954, the court granted the defendant until September 4, 1954, to file demurrers, pleas, and objections in said cause and set same for hearing on September 24, 1954 at 5 o'clock p. m.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On August 27, 1954, and before any trial or hearing in said cause, the defendant filed her plea to the jurisdiction of the court, asserting therein: that she is the natural mother of the child named in said cause, and that the Superior Court of Walker County, Georgia, ought not to have or take cognizance of said suit because at the time of the commencement of same, on July 24, 1954, and thenceforth, the said defendant resided in the County of DeKalb, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Georgia, and is now a resident of said County of DeKalb and is not a resident of the County of Walker; and that the Superior Court of DeKalb County, Georgia, has jurisdiction of this case, and the Superior Court of Walker County has not, for the further reason that the child, Daphne Virginia Bennett, the subject for which the petition in said cause has been brought to legitimatize, was at the time of the filing of said suit and is now a resident of DeKalb County, Georgia, and the Superior Court of DeKalb County, Georgia, has jurisdiction of said child, and the Superior Court of Walker County, Georgia, has not.  The plea to the jurisdiction was duly verified by the defendant and duly served upon opposing counsel, as shown by the certificate of service attached thereto.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the same date of August 27, 1954, the defendant also filed her plea in abatement to the petition filed in said cause, asserting in said plea that she is the natural mother of said child; that the petition should abate for the reason that an action has been filed by Mr. and Mrs. H. L. Hatton for the adoption of the minor child, which proceeding is pending in the Superior Court of DeKalb County, Georgia; that the defendant&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  has heretofore and in connection with said adoption proceedings given her consent to the same, and temporary custody of said child has been heretofore awarded to the said Mr. and Mrs. H. L. Hatton; and that the mother of said illegitimate child is entitled to exercise all parental power as to said child under the provisions of Georgia Code &sect;&sect; 74-203 and 74-405; and since her consent has been given as aforesaid and in connection with said adoption proceedings, pendency of same is a bar to this proceeding to legitimatize said child, filed subsequently to the filing of said adoption proceedings.  The plea in abatement further asserts that the child is a resident of DeKalb County, Georgia, and that the superior court of said county in which said adoption proceeding is pending has jurisdiction thereof.  The plea in abatement concludes that the Superior Court of Walker County, Georgia, should not try the petition of the defendant to legitimatize said child for the reasons stated; and that same should be abated until the final judgment and decree upon said adoption proceeding pending in the Superior Court of DeKalb County, Georgia.  The plea in abatement is duly verified by the defendant, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and service thereof was perfected in accordance with the certificate of service attached thereto.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the same date the defendant filed her answer, objecting to the granting of the prayers of the petition.  The objection as so filed by the defendant prayed that the prayers of the petition be denied, and that he not be permitted to legitimatize said Daphne Virginia Bennett, and that her name not be changed to Daphne Virginia Day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In support of her objection to the legitimation of her child by the petitioner, the defendant alleged in her answer that she is the natural mother of Daphne Virginia Bennett, and by reason of such relationship is entitled to file her objections and be heard in this cause; and without admitting the paternity of the child by the plaintiff, the answer avers that the petition of the plaintiff to legitimatize the daughter of the defendant is not filed in good faith, but is fraudulently brought, and that he has no parental interest in said child.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The answer makes numerous detailed averments of unfitness and fraud upon the part of the plaintiff, which may be summarized in part as follows: that the plaintiff is a married man 62 years of age, of intemperate habits, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  frequently engaging in adulterous relationships with other women, violent and abusive in conduct, unfit to have the custody or control of a 3-year-old female child, addicted to the excessive use of intoxicants, a professional gambler convicted of the offense of illegal enterprises, who will leave no estate for said child to inherit; that plaintiff has brought his petition to legitimatize said child in bad faith and fraudulently as a part of a scheme to gain control of said child in order that he may, through the mother's love and affection of said child and concern for her welfare, force the defendant to renew her cohabitation and adulterous relationship with him; that he has not contributed anything toward the support of said child, has denied his paternity of the child, and, while cohabiting with the defendant, refused upon request to render said child legitimate.  The answer alleges at length numerous facts and specific acts upon the part of the plaintiff in support of the foregoing averments.  The answer further alleges that the defendant, having separated from the plaintiff, is living an upright and moral life and adequately providing for the support of said child from her earnings&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  as a waitress; and that she is a fit and proper person to have the custody of the child, and to have the child bear her name until such time as the child may be adopted by fit and proper adoptive parents; that Mr. and Mrs. H. L. Hatton of DeKalb County, Georgia, have instituted adoption proceedings in the Superior Court of DeKalb County, Georgia, for the adoption of said child; and that they have temporary custody of the child under those proceedings pending the final order of adoption.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On September 24, 1954, said case came on for a hearing before the court, and after argument of counsel an oral motion was made by counsel for the plaintiff to dismiss the plea to the jurisdiction and to dismiss the plea in abatement filed in said cause by the defendant; and said plea to the jurisdiction and said plea in abatement were each, by orders dated September 24, 1954, dismissed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To the orders sustaining the plaintiff's oral motions to dismiss said plea to the jurisdiction and said plea in abatement the defendant excepted and by her bill of exceptions excepts to said rulings of the court; and the questions raised by the assignments of error on the court's order sustaining the motion to said&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  plea to the jurisdiction and on the order sustaining the motion to the plea in abatement are now before this court for review.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On said date of September 24, 1954, the case proceeded to trial on its merits before Honorable Freeman C. McClure, judge of said court, in accordance with the provisions of Code &sect; 74-103.  A jury trial was not waived by objector nor was trial by a jury dispensed with by agreement of the parties or by agreement of counsel for the parties, but same proceeded to hearing before the court without a jury, under the provisions of said Code section, which makes no provision for a jury trial in such cases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Upon said hearing and at the conclusion of the evidence submitted by the plaintiff and at the conclusion of the evidence submitted on behalf of the defendant, the court, upon oral motion of the plaintiff, continued the hearing to a subsequent unspecified date in order to enable the plaintiff to obtain additional evidence in the form of depositions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By order dated October 29, 1954, the court set said matter for conclusion in a hearing thereon for November 20, 1954, at 10 o'clock a. m., and on said date the plaintiff presented additional evidence in the form of&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***9]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  depositions taken in said cause, at the conclusion of which the court entered its final order, judgment and decree denying the prayers of the plaintiff to legitimatize the child, and taxing the costs in the case against the plaintiff.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On December 9, 1954, the plaintiff filed a motion for new trial upon the following grounds: (1) Because the decision of the court is contrary to evidence and without evidence to support it.  (2) Because the decision is decidedly and strongly against the weight of the evidence.  (3) Because the decision is contrary to law and the principles of justice and equity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The foregoing proceedings were held before Honorable Freeman C. McClure, Judge of the Superior Court, Walker County, Georgia.  On January 1, 1955, the said judge was succeeded as Judge of the Superior Court of Walker County, Georgia, by Honorable John W. Davis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On May 10, 1955, the plaintiff filed his amendment to the original motion for new trial, setting forth several special grounds alleging error in excluding certain testimony offered on behalf of the plaintiff regarding plaintiff's character 20 years before this trial, and in excluding part of the deposition of a witness for the plaintiff&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***10]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  which was excluded by the court because of the refusal of the witness to submit to complete cross-examination.  The full and complete grounds of the motion as amended are set forth in the record specified in this case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The plaintiff's motion for new trial came on for a hearing before Honorable John W. Davis, at a subsequent date, and at said hearing, prior to consideration of said motion for a new trial by the court, the defendant made an oral motion in open court as follows: &quot;Defendant, Barbara Jean Bennett, moves to dismiss petitioner's motion for a new trial and amendment to motion for new trial upon the grounds that same is not the proper procedure, a direct bill of exceptions being the proper procedure.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By order dated June 11, 1955, Honorable John W. Davis denied the defendant's motion to dismiss the motion for new trial, filed by the plaintiff.  To this order denying the defendant's motion, the defendant excepted and in her bill of exceptions assigns the order denying said motion as error.  By order dated June 11, 1955, Honorable John W. Davis, entered the following order: &quot;The motion for new trial in the above-styled matter is granted.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defendant assigns error upon the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***11]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  rulings of the court overruling her plea to the jurisdiction, overruling her plea in abatement, and overruling her motion to dismiss the motion of the plaintiff for a new trial, and this cause is now before the Court of Appeals upon those assignments of error.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The issues of law involved are: (1) whether or not the court erred in overruling the defendant's plea to the jurisdiction; (2) whether or not the court erred in overruling the defendant's plea in abatement; (3) whether or not the court erred in denying the defendant's motion to dismiss the motion for a new trial filed by the plaintiff; (4) whether or not the court abused its discretion in granting a first new trial.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The father filed an action in his county of residence to legitimize the child.

The trial court denied the father's petition to legitimize the child. The father filed a motion for a new trial and the mother objected. The trial court granted the motion for a new trial and the mother appealed. The appellate court rejected the mother's argument that a statute relied upon by the trial court to determine jurisdiction was unconstitutional because the issue of unconstitutionality was not raised in the trial court. The court found that because neither party requested a jury trial, it was not error for the trial court to rule on the facts and law. The court found that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in granting the father's motion for a new trial because the father presented evidence that supported his claim to legitimize the child and it was possible that, because of a change of judges in the trial court, the new judge felt that the father's petition should have been granted.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trade of barbering was regulated by the state code, which created the State Board of Barbering Examiners. The city enacted ordinances to further regulate the trade within the city. One city ordinance required a barber to obtain an annual permit from the city. The trial court found the barber in violation of that ordinance, but on appeal, the court reversed. The court held that the city ordinance, in attempting to regulate a trade already under state regulation, came within the constitutional inhibition that no special law was to be enacted in any case for which a provision had been made by an existing general law. The permit was not a mere occupation tax imposed by the city as a revenue measure. The city had no charter power to require payment of the fee in question, and the ordinance under which the fee was imposed was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The facts indicated that there was no extreme necessity and great urgency for the Housing Authority to exercise the right of eminent domain without first providing for just compensation for the property owner. Thus, the Housing Authority was without authority of law to enter into the estate of the property in issue without proper condemnation proceedings, and the property owner was not required, under the law, to surrender the possession of its estate without first requiring the Housing Authority to condemn the property under the proceedings provided for condemnation under Georgia law. However, both parties had an agreement by which the Housing Authority took possession of the property and the property owner moved out. The parties had a right to make the agreement, but the agreement left the amount of just compensation to be determined thereafter. The parties, however, could not agree on just compensation. The court held that the property owner set out a valid cause of action. The claim was based on the proposition that the Housing Authority took the property owner's land without paying adequate compensation therefor, contrary to Ga. Const. art. I, &sect; III, para. I, O.C.G.A. &sect; 2-301.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is a damage suit involving the collision of two motor vehicles driving in the same direction.  Richard J. Hopper, plaintiff in the court below (the defendant in error here), we shall hereinafter call the plaintiff.  Charles W. Wade we shall call the defendant.  The plaintiff was driving in what is generally known as a house trailer, which the plaintiff himself was operating.  The defendant's motor vehicle was a truck driven by an agent of Wade.  The two vehicles were driving in the same direction, on U. S. Highway No. 41 in Houston County, Georgia.  The defendant's truck was traveling behind the plaintiff's vehicle.  The collision took place, according to the plaintiff's version, when the vehicle of Wade negligently attempted to pass the vehicle of the plaintiff.  According to the defendant's contentions, the collision occurred when the plaintiff's vehicle was bumping and swerving on rough pavement and the house trailer came loose from the motor-vehicle portion of the house trailer, and the defendant's vehicle did not strike the plaintiff's vehicle but, on the contrary, the plaintiff's vehicle struck&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  that of the defendant.  The plaintiff and the defendant were nonresidents of the State of Georgia.  The suit was brought in the Superior Court of Houston County.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To the petition, as amended, the defendant filed a plea to the jurisdiction and in bar subject to his general and special demurrers to the petition, and to the answer to the petition, and a cross-action embraced in the answer, respectively.  The court overruled the plea to the jurisdiction and the demurrer.  To these judgments the defendant filed exceptions pendente lite.  A verdict for $ 7,500 was returned in favor of the plaintiff.  The defendant filed an amended motion for new trial, which was denied.  He assigns error, in exceptions pendente lite, on his pleas to the jurisdiction and in bar, on the exceptions pendente lite overruling his demurrer, and on the judgment denying his amended motion for new trial.

The evidence permitted the jury to find against defendant under the law of comparative negligence. The court rejected defendant's claim that the charge to the jury on comparative negligence should have been amplified. Moreover, there was no error by the superior court in not charging the jury on the principle of impeachment with respect to a document offered and admitted for that purpose, because there was no appropriate written request to limit the use of the document. The court concluded that the damage award was not based upon a breach of contract; it was for the loss of earnings caused by the negligence of defendant. As a result, the tort claim for damages was not limited in the same fashion as damages sought under a contract, and the evidence by plaintiff as to lost wages was acceptable.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Action for refund of sales tax.  Before Judge Atkinson.  Bibb Superior Court.  May 8, 1953.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cherokee Brick &amp; Tile Company, a corporation, brought an action against the State of Georgia and Charles D. Redwine as the State Revenue Commissioner for a refund of sales and use taxes.  It alleged in its petition, as finally amended, substantially the following: The plaintiff is entitled to recover from the defendant $ 3,761.79, which is the sum of the sales taxes illegally collected from the plaintiff.  The plaintiff was and is engaged in the business of making, fabricating, and processing brick and clay products.  During the period from April 1, 1951, through January 31, 1952, the plaintiff used 771,397 thousand cubic feet of natural gas.  On or about February 23, 1952, the plaintiff paid to the State Revenue Commissioner, under protest, $ 3,765.73, which was the tax, at the rate of three percent, on the entire 771,397 thousand cubic feet of gas used by the plaintiff during the period indicated, less an allowance for footage used pursuant to a contract with Macon Natural Gas Company, which contract was entered into prior to the passage of the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Sales Tax Act.  This allowance amounted to $ 164.07 and was three percent of the purchase price of the gas sold to the plaintiff pursuant to the contract.  Of the total amount of gas used by the plaintiff for the indicated period, 775,000 cubic feet of such gas was used by the plaintiff for general heating purposes.  The sales tax on this amount so used came to $ 3.94, which, when deducted from the amount of taxes paid, leaves $ 3,761.79, which is the amount of the refund sought.  The plaintiff is not seeking to recover the tax of $ 3.94 on the gas used for general heating purposes.  Of the 771,397 thousand cubic feet of gas used by the plaintiff, 770,622 thousand cubic feet of it was used by the plaintiff in its brick kilns in the following manner: The gas was ignited and the flaming gas burned over, around, and in direct contact with the raw clay and clay products being made by the plaintiff for sale to its customers and in such a manner that nothing intervened between the flaming gas and the clay and clay products.  The effect of the flaming gas, burning at a temperature of from 2,000 to 2,100 degrees Fahrenheit, was to cause the raw clay to be changed through physical and chemical&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  reactions so as to convert the raw clay into brick and clay products.  The gas used in such manner was an industrial material used directly by the plaintiff in fabricating, converting, and processing articles of tangible personal property for resale, and the sale and use of such gas was, therefore, exempt from the Georgia Sales and Use Tax under section 3 (c) 2 of the Retailers and Consumers Sales and Use Tax Act (Ga. L., 1951, pp. 360, 365).  The plaintiff at all times measured, and kept records of, the number of cubic feet of such gas used in its kilns, and the cost of that gas was a direct manufacturing cost and was so treated in the plaintiff's books and cost-accounting records.  Under generally accepted principles of cost accounting, the treatment of such cost as a direct manufacturing cost was correct.  On May 22, 1952, the plaintiff filed with the State Revenue Commissioner a claim for the refund of such tax of $ 2,761.79, a copy of which claim was attached to and made a part of the petition.  On July 17, 1952, the Revenue Commissioner denied the claim for refund.  If the act approved February 25, 1953 (Ga. L. 1953, pp. 194-195), should be construed as having any adverse effect&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  upon the right of action of the plaintiff as set out in the petition, it would deprive the plaintiff of rights which were vested in it prior to the enactment of that law, and the law, so construed, would be unconstitutional and void as being in violation of article I, section III, paragraph II of the Georgia Constitution of 1945 (Code, Ann., &sect; 2-302), which provides: &quot;No bill of attainder, ex post facto law, retroactive law, or law impairing the obligation of contracts, or making irrevocable grant of special privileges or immunities shall be passed,&quot; in that the law so construed would be an ex post facto law, a retroactive law, and a law impairing the obligation of contracts.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Banks County, acting by its named Commissioners of Roads and Revenues, filed its petition in the Superior Court of Banks County against the Solicitor-General of the Piedmont Judicial Circuit, the Clerk of the Superior Court and a former Sheriff of Banks County, alleging that the respondents have, between December 31, 1944, and December 31, 1951, come into possession and retained sums totaling $ 30,404.47 (of which $ 4,250.97 came from sales of condemned automobiles, and the remainder from fines and forfeitures), belonging to the petitioner, and seeking a rule nisi requiring the respondent officers to show cause why such money should not be paid over to Banks County.  The respondents filed separate demurrers, pursuant to which the plaintiff filed certain amendments.  The Judge of the Superior Court of Banks County disqualified himself, and with the approval of counsel representing all parties the case was referred to the Judge of the Superior Court of the Western Circuit.  On the date of the hearing, the respondents filed a joint demurrer based on&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  several general grounds and numerous special grounds.  This latter demurrer was a renewal also of all the grounds of the three separate demurrers filed on behalf of each of the respondents.  On the hearing the trial court sustained the general demurrer without stating the particular ground or grounds thereof that were being sustained.  He did, however, file a memorandum opinion setting forth his reasons for sustaining the general demurrer.  He also provided in his order that the special demurrers were not determined.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the judgment sustaining the general demurrer and dismissing the petition the plaintiff assigns error.

In doing so, the court held that the allegations constituted a cause of action under &sect; 27-2921. Also, trial court was in error in its assumption that the county was not a proper party. Thus, the petition did not need an amendment naming a bank, acting as the county treasurer, as usee. The county, by amendment, merely perfected its petition so as to designate its proper official to receive the money on its behalf, but did not, as the trial court mistakenly concluded, step aside and make the county treasurer the party plaintiff in its stead. Further, the demurrer on the ground that the amendment to the petition converted the action into a mandamus proceeding was without merit. Also, the trial court had jurisdiction over the parties because the action could have been brought in the county of residence of either of the officers under O.C.G.A. &sect; 2-4904.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pursuant to a resolution of the Commissioners of Roads and Revenues of DeKalb County under the Revenue Certificate Law of 1937, as amended, the State of Georgia, on November 25, 1952, filed a petition against DeKalb County, seeking a validation of certain revenue-anticipation certificates, in the sum of $ 12,000,000, sought to be issued by DeKalb County for the acquisition and construction of truck and railroad freight terminal facilities, the structures to contain about 2,000,000 square feet of storage space and to be located on a tract of land consisting of approximately 120 acres lying adjacent to a line of the Seaboard Railway and between two main highways in DeKalb County.  Hearing of the rule nisi was set for December 8, 1952.  The county filed an answer praying for judgment in favor of such validation.  On December 8, the intervention of F. W. Beazley Sr., a warehouseman, also a citizen and taxpayer of DeKalb County, was filed, and the hearing on the rule nisi was continued until the morning of December 9.  The intervenor moved&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  for a continuance, which motion was overruled.  After hearing evidence the trial court entered judgment in favor of validation of the revenue certificates.  The intervenor thereafter filed his bill of exceptions directed to the Supreme Court, assigning error on the failure of the trial court to grant the continuance and on the judgment validating the certificates.  The Supreme Court transferred the case to this court.  The bill of exceptions assigns error as follows: (1) on the failure of the trial court to grant a continuance on motion of the intervenor; (2) because the resolution of the county commissioners, setting out the purposes for which the bonds are sought to be issued, is in violation of pertinent provisions of the Constitution of the State of Georgia; (3) that it is unconstitutional as tending to create a monopoly; and (4) because the evidence elicited on the hearing shows the project to be wholly unreasonable, unsound, and impracticable.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Intervenor warehouseman appealed an order of the DeKalb Superior Court (Georgia) entering judgment validating the revenue certificates and denying the warehouseman's motion for a continuance in an action in which plaintiff Commissioners of Road and Revenues of DeKalb County (Georgia) requested the certificates from defendant DeKalb County (Georgia) to acquire and construct truck and railroad freight terminal facilities.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The intervenor argued that the trial court erred in failing to grant a continuance, that the resolution violated the Georgia Constitution and created a monopoly, and that the evidence showed that the project was unreasonable. On appeal, the court affirmed. The trial court had wide discretion in granting continuances and it did not abuse its discretion in denying the continuance. The statute authorized the building of a certain number of masonry structures and the court found that the structures were a terminal within the meaning of O.C.G.A. &sect; 87-802(a)(2) even though the term was undefined. The word terminal was given the same significance as the other structures mentioned in the statute and it was evident that the general assembly intended the construction of something that produced revenue. The undertaking by DeKalb County was in keeping with the word terminal. The resolution did not have the effect of creating a monopoly and provided that all leases were to be for reasonable and fair rentals. The State made a prima facie case that the project was unreasonable and the intervenors did not carry the burden of presenting evidence to rebut that presumption.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">E. E. Washburn brought suit against A. B. Foster, Sheriff of Fulton County, and the surety on his official bond, seeking to recover $ 10,000, which the plaintiff alleged he had deposited with the sheriff in order to obtain the release of one Fred Martin, who was in the custody of the sheriff on January 5, 1945, to answer a charge of misdemeanor in the Criminal Court of Fulton County.  The petition alleges, in substance: that an appearance bond of $ 15,000 was required by the sheriff as bail for Martin, and he required in addition to an appearance bond, which was duly executed and approved, that $ 15,000 as a cash bond be turned over to him; that the plaintiff put up with the sheriff a cash bond of $ 10,000; that Martin appeared in court as required by said bond and was convicted on January 15, 1945, and after his conviction it was necessary for him to make a supersedeas bond, to be approved by the Clerk of the Criminal Court of Fulton County, in order to secure his release from the custody of the defendant sheriff pending a review of his case by the appellate courts&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of this State; that the plaintiff and others signed a certiorari or appeal bond for Martin, which was approved by the Clerk of the Superior Court of Polk County on February 1, 1945, and, on February 3, 1945, by the Clerk of the Criminal Court of Fulton County, who accepted the certiorari bond; that the plaintiff authorized the defendant Foster to pay the $ 10,000 to the Clerk of the Criminal Court of Fulton County, and the defendant Foster accepted the assignment and agreed to do so, but he failed to deliver the money to the Clerk of the Criminal Court of Fulton County and failed to pay the money to the plaintiff; that thereafter, on October 22, 1947, Martin was arrested to serve the sentence imposed and, as a result, the appeal bond was exonerated and became null and void.  The prayers of the petition are for process and for judgment against the defendants for $ 10,000 with interest from the time the money was deposited with the defendant Foster.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defendants demurred to the petition upon the ground that it failed to set out a cause of action against either of them, and that any claim the plaintiff might have had against them was barred by the statute of limitations.

The payor authorized the sheriff to pay the money to the Clerk of the Criminal Court. However, the sheriff failed to do so. The payor sought to recover the money turned over to the sheriff with interest. The court reversed the judgment. The court found that under the allegations of the petition, the sheriff at the time the suit was instituted held the money sued for as trustee for the payor, who was the legal owner of the same. The court held that the allegations of the petition were sufficient to show that the sheriff accepted the money under color of and by virtue of his office. Clearly, the sheriff had no right to require a cash bond or a deposit of money in lieu of bail or in addition to bail, and his action in so doing rendered him and his sureties liable on his official bond to anyone aggrieved.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reconsidered the present case and found that some of the language in the original opinion should be somewhat modified. The court ruled that it was a legal absurdity that the payment by a tortfeasor was a condition precedent to subrogation under O.C.G.A. &sect; 114-403 (amend. 1937). Consequently, the court ruled that it was just as much a legal absurdity that payment by the tortfeasor was made a condition precedent to a proceeding by the employee against the tortfeasor. A recovery in that proceeding (which proceeding, after payment by the tortfeasor, was impossible) was made a condition precedent to an employer's, or an insurance carrier's, reducing the amount of compensation by the amount of &quot;net damages recovered&quot; in that proceeding. Therefore, if the employer, or the insurance carrier, in the present case was entitled to either reduce or to discontinue compensation, it was so by virtue of apply the principles stated in the cases cited in the original opinion in the present case, that the law as it existed prior to the invalid amendment of 1937 remained in full force.

Defendant contended that the evidence was insufficient to form the basis of the conviction, as it appeared that the prosecutrix was an employee of the firm and had worked for it for stated intervals of time on credit; that her services for the intervals in question had been fully rendered before the checks were issued; and that the checks therefore represented items of account rather than checks given for a cash consideration. The court agreed with the argument and reversed defendant's conviction. The evidence failed to show an intent to defraud.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dempsey S. Brown, Bruce Brown, Mrs. O. L. Allen, and Mrs. Tom Harper applied to the superior court for partition of a described tract of land, containing 185.42 acres, more or less, and they alleged: that they were tenants in common with Willie H. Leggitt, Virginia Leggitt, and Woodrow W. Brown, each owning a one-seventh undivided interest in said land; that no provision had been made as to how said land was to be divided between the co-owners thereof; that the whole title to the said land was vested in the applicants and the named defendants as the sole surviving heirs at law of Amory C. Brown, their brother, who died intestate on October 21, 1948; that the applicants and the defendants are all sui juris and under no disabilities; that, on December 6, 1948, the court of ordinary entered an order declaring that no administration on the estate of Amory C. Brown was necessary; that, by virtue of said order, the applicants are estopped to administer the estate of their deceased brother for the purpose of making distribution among his heirs at law; that the interest of the cotenants in said land is unrepresented, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  there being no one in active charge of the same; that, on October 28, 1947, Amory C. Brown encumbered said property with a deed to secure debt to Mutual Benefit Life Insurance Company for a loan of $ 5000 principal, said deed providing for payments of $ 250 on November 1 of each year from 1948 to 1967, with interest at 4% per annum on the unpaid principal; that, on November 1, 1950, the unpaid principal will be $ 4500, and there will be due on said date a principal instalment of $ 250, and interest of $ 179.74; that the 1949 and 1950 taxes on said lands have not been paid and no return of the property has been made for these years; that no accounting of the rents and profits to the several cotenants has been made since the death of Amory C. Brown; that it is impossible to make a fair and equitable division of the property by metes and bounds by reason of the improvements thereon, and because the value of the entire property would be depreciated by such a division; that the applicants have given notice in writing at least twenty days before the date of this application of their intention to make the same, the notice having been duly served on Willie H. Leggitt, Virginia Leggitt, and&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Woodrow W. Brown; that the applicants present their title deeds for examination, and desire that the property be partitioned between the cotenants by a sale thereof by commissioners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Virginia Leggitt and Willie H. Leggitt demurred to this application on the grounds: (1) that Code &sect; 85-1511, under which the application was brought, is unconstitutional in that it deprived the demurrants of their rights to a trial by jury of the issue of whether a division in kind should be made; (2) that it was not alleged that Mutual Benefit Life Insurance Company, holder of a paramount title to the property as evidenced by the alleged deed to secure debt, had been notified of the application or made a party thereto; (3) that the allegations as to the necessity for partition by sale are conclusions of the pleader unsupported by the facts alleged; and (4) that no cause of action is set forth.  This demurrer was overruled, and the demurrants excepted pendente lite.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The court appointed three commissioners to ascertain whether a division by metes and bounds or by a sale of the lands and division of the proceeds would be more beneficial to the parties at interest.  Virginia Leggitt and Willie H. Leggitt&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  also objected to the return made by the commissioners, on the grounds: (1) that no lawful statutory partition could be made without joining Mutual Benefit Life Insurance Company as the holder of an encumbrance superior to the rights of the applicants; and (2) traversing the return of the commissioners by alleging that a division in kind would be practicable, provided the rights of the insurance company were properly represented in the proceeding.  These objections were overruled, and the objectors excepted pendente lite.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After reciting that the three commissioners appointed had made their report to the court that a fair and equitable division of the lands in question could not be made by metes and bounds, by reason of the improvements made thereon, that the value of the land would be depreciated by such a division, and that it would be impossible and impracticable to divide the land into separate equal tracts, and further recommending that the land be sold and the proceeds divided among the common owners as their interest might appear -- the court ordered that the described property by sold by the commissioners after advertisement; that the rights or interests of all parties be remitted&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to the proceeds arising from the sale, at which sale the parties were authorized to bid; that no deed would be made to the purchaser until the same should be confirmed by the court, at which time the parties interested were required to show cause why such confirmation should be granted or refused; that a copy of the order be mailed to Mutual Benefit Life Insurance Company; and that its lien be paid off in full from the proceeds of the sale of the property.  Viriginia Leggitt and Willie H. Leggitt excepted to this judgment, and assigned error thereon by reason of the antecedent rulings on their demurrer and their objections to the commissioners' return, and because the judgment was based upon fatally defective pleadings, without having made Mutual Benefit Life Insurance Company a party to the proceeding.  </SPAN></P>

The trial court also overruled the railroad's amended motion for new trial. Judgment was rendered against defendants in the sum of $ 45,925.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In his suit, the passenger claimed that the joint and concurring negligence of defendants was the proximate cause of the passenger's injury and damage. The court found that the trial court erred in instructing the jury that when the passenger made out his prima facie case the burden shifted to the railroad. The charge required the railroad, not merely to introduce some evidence contrary to the acts of negligence testified to on behalf of the passenger, but to establish absolutely that the railroad, through its servants, exercised ordinary care and diligence. The railroad was also required to sustain its contention that the sole proximate cause of the passenger's injury was the negligence of the taxicab driver. The error was not cured by the subsequent charge because it assumed a situation where the passenger did make out a prima facie case and erroneously informed the jury in effect that in such circumstances the burden of proof shifted to the railroad. Further, the trial court erred in instructing the jury that recovery would be defeated only if the passenger failed to establish the negligence and that such negligence was the proximate cause of the injury complained of.</SPAN></P>

However, while the trial court was authorized to hold defendant guilty of 238 separate contempts, they were all based on only one culpable intent. As such, there was one contempt coupled with that culpable intent, and 237 other technical violations. The sentence of the trial court over and above the maximum fixed for the first offense for each of the remaining 237 technical violations totaling the equivalent of one other maximum offense was an abuse of judicial discretion and so cruel and unusual as to contravene Ga.

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">J. D. Ferguson brought suit against C. N. Ivy in the Civil Court of Fulton County under the provisions of the Housing and Rent Act of 1947 as amended, seeking treble damages and alleging that he was a tenant of the defendant between the dates of November 8, 1947, through October, 1949; that he had paid to the defendant rental in the amount of $ 50 per month; that the maximum lawful rental effective during the above period as established by the Housing Expediter is $ 35 per month; that he is entitled to treble the amount of overcharge for a period of 23 1/2 months, or a total of $ 1057.50 plus attorney fees.  There was no demurrer to the petition, nor did the defendant plead the bar of the statute of limitations.  The evidence on the trial of the case showed that on October 5, 1949, the Office of the Housing Expediter passed an order decreasing the maximum rent allowable on such housing accommodations from $ 50 per month to $ 35 per month on the grounds stated in &sect; 825.5 (c) (1) of the Controlled Housing Rent Regulations (Federal Register, September 17, 1949) as follows: &quot;The maximum rent for housing accommodations&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  . . is higher than the rent generally prevailing in the Defense Rental Area for comparable housing accommodations on the maximum rent date.&quot; This order was made retroactive to November 1, 1947, under the provisions of &sect; 825.4 (e) providing in part as follows: &quot;Where housing accommodations are changed on or after April 1, 1948, by a substantial increase or decrease in dwelling space, the maximum rent for the housing accommodations resulting from such change shall be the first rent charged after such change.  . . And provided further, That the rent received for any rental period commencing on or after the date of the first renting shall be received subject to refund to the tenant of any amount in excess of the maximum rent which may later be fixed by an order under &sect; 825.5 (c) (1) or (6).  Such amount shall be refunded within 30 days after the date of the issuance of the order unless the refund is stayed in accordance with the provisions of Revised Rent Procedural Regulation 1 or Rent Procedural Regulation 2 (Part 840 of this chapter).  The order entered by the Expediter shall fix the maximum rent retroactively to the date of first renting after such change.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trial judge directed&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  a verdict in favor of the plaintiff for treble damages in the amount of $ 1057.50.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff tenant filed suit against defendant landlord under the provisions of the Housing and Rent Act of 1947, seeking treble damages and alleging that he had paid to the landlord monthly rentals over a nearly two-year period which were more than the maximum lawful rental rate as established by the Housing Expediter. The Fulton Civil Court (Georgia) directed a verdict in favor of the tenant for treble damages. The landlord appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The order of decrease in the case involved &sect; 825.4(e) of the Controlled Housing Rent Regulations. Thus, the first rent charged was the lawful maximum rent, subject to review by an area rent director, but until reviewed and fixed by him, it remained the legal rent. The monthly rent complained of, being the first rent charged after the housing accommodations had been improved, was the maximum rent prior to the date of the order of the area rent director reducing the maximum rent. As such, the landlord prior to the date of the order of the area rent director received no rent in excess of the maximum. Thus, the trial court erred in awarding the tenant treble damages. The court further held that the order complained of was void. It directed the landlord to refund rents collected by him from the tenant at a time when he was legally receiving the proper maximum rent, the first rent charged after the tenant took possession and after the landlord had made substantial improvements in the house, the landlord having occupied the same for more than 24 months prior to renting it to the tenant.

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This case arose out of a collision between two automobiles.  Mrs. Mary Hinson McKiernan, whom we shall call the plaintiff, brought suit in Habersham Superior Court against Mrs. Naomi Grant, whom we shall call the defendant, for total damages of $ 5,000, $ 1,500 for damage to her automobile, and $ 3,500 for physical injuries and pain and suffering.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The petition alleged that as the plaintiff, on January 6, 1949, was driving her automobile on U. S. Highway No. 23, in a northerly direction, about one mile south of Gainesville, Ga., the defendant, who was driving in the opposite direction, suddenly and without warning turned the automobile she was driving to the left, crossed the center line of the highway and struck the plaintiff's automobile with such force that both automobiles were knocked off the road and onto the shoulder of the plaintiff's right-hand side of the road.  As statutory negligence the plaintiff alleged the defendant's failure to turn her automobile to the right of the center of the highway when meeting the plaintiff's automobile, and her failure to give the &quot;left-turn&quot; signal.  She also alleged&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  common-law negligence of the defendant in failing to keep a lookout ahead, and in failing to grant her the right of way in that the impact occurred on the plaintiff's right-hand side of the highway.  The petition set forth particulars of the damage to the plaintiff's automobile, and the extent, nature and result of her personal injuries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defendant filed her plea and answer in the nature of a cross-action and alleged the negligence of the plaintiff as the proximate cause of the collision.  She admitted that the highway south of the point of the collision is practically straight for a distance of from six hundred to seven hundred feet, but that there is a hill, the top of which is from two hundred and ninety to three hundred feet south of the point of the collision, and that the top of this hill is the first point at which an automobile approaching from the south comes into view of one driving in a southerly direction at the place of the collision.  She alleged the following statutory negligence of the plaintiff: Driving at a speed of from sixty to sixty-five miles an hour, and further alleged, &quot;The collision occurred in a restricted school speed zone.  The speed limit at this point&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  was reduced to a rate of thirty-five miles per hour, and said restricted school speed zone was called to the attention of plaintiff and the general public by signs conspicuously posted on the highway some three hundred feet and six hundred feet south of the point of collision.&quot; She further alleged that after giving the &quot;left-turn&quot; signal, she slowed down her automobile and was in the act of turning across the highway into a by-road when she saw the plaintiff's automobile come over the top of the hill at an excessive speed and in the emergency thus created by the plaintiff she did not attempt to complete the turn, but stopped her automobile in a position protruding slightly across the center line of the highway, endeavoring thus to avoid being struck by the plaintiff's automobile.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She further alleged in paragraph 24: &quot;Adjacent to the point of collision in said highway, there was a filling station on the west or plaintiff's left side of said highway, and that portion of the southbound traffic lane of said highway which remained unobstructed, the paved shoulder of the highway and concrete apron of said filling station afforded plaintiff with at least fifty feet of paved area, unobstructed&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and clear of traffic in which to turn to her left and pass the automobile operated by defendant, had she been driving her automobile at a lawful rate of speed and had had said automobile under control.&quot; In paragraph 25, she alleged: &quot;Adjacent to the point of collision in said highway, there was a filling station on the east or plaintiff's right side of said highway, the shoulder of said highway and apron of said filling station having an all-weather surface, and that portion of the northbound traffic lane of said highway which remained unobstructed, the surface shoulder of the highway and surfaced apron of said filling station afforded plaintiff with from fifteen to twenty feet of surfaced area, unobstructed and clear of traffic in which to turn to her right and pass the automobile operated by defendant, had she been driving her automobile at a lawful rate of speed and had had said automobile under control.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Briefly summarized she alleged the following negligence of the plaintiff: Excessive rate of speed of from sixty to sixty-five miles an hour; driving in a restricted speed zone at such speed and in excess of thirty-five miles an hour; failure to maintain a proper lookout; failure&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to have her automobile under control; failure to turn either to her right or to her left as specified in paragraphs 24 and 25 quoted above; in failing to reduce the speed of her automobile under the circumstances alleged; in failing to sound her horn.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The complainant claimed that the car accident was caused by the driver's negligence. The driver claimed that it was the complainant's speeding that caused the car accident. The court held that the driver was liable. The driver waived the issue of the constitutionality of the law establishing a speed limit as having been unconstitutional under Ga. Const. art. III, &sect; 1, para. 1, because the issue was not raised before the trial court at the earliest opportunity. The trial court did not have to charge the jury regarding the alleged negligence per se of the complainant for her having sped through a school zone under O.C.G.A. &sect; 68-301(c) because neither party fell within the class protected by &sect; 68-301(c). Thus, the mere fact that the complainant sped through the school zone did not mean that the complainant was negligent per se. While the trial court should have given a jury instruction that the driver acted reasonably under emergency circumstances, the error was harmless because the instruction would have helped the complainant, not the driver.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By virtue of an order passed by Judge Ralph H. Pharr, one of the judges of the superior court of the Atlanta Judicial Circuit, Hon. Paul Webb, Solicitor-General of said circuit filed a citation for contempt against Charles M. Kenimer Jr.  The petition contained two hundred and thirty-eight counts.  Preceding the first count were the following allegations: &quot;On the 9th day of November, 1948, in the case of Mrs. Muriel Moran Kenimer, now Senter, vs. Charles M. Kenimer Jr., No. A-1255, Fulton Superior Court, the said Charles M. Kenimer Jr., filed an application and petition asking that he be awarded the custody of Betty Ann Kenimer, minor daughter of said parties, who was then in the lawful custody and possession of her mother, said Mrs. Muriel Moran Kenimer, now Senter, and residing with her mother in Clarke County, Georgia, all of which appears of record in said case.  2. Thereafter, as further appears of record in said case, the mother of said child filed a plea to the jurisdiction of the Superior Court of Fulton County, which plea was resisted by said Charles M. Kenimer Jr., and it was adjudged and determined&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  in said court, His Honor Edgar E. Pomeroy, Judge thereof then and there presiding, on January 10, 1949, that the Superior Court of Fulton County had jurisdiction of the question of the custody of said child.  3. Thereafter, as further appears of record in said case, said Charles M. Kenimer Jr., filed in said court, on the 14th day of January, 1949, a motion and petition praying that a custodian be appointed for said child pending the litigation, which motion and petition duly and regularly came on for hearing before said court, His Honor Ralph H. Pharr, Judge thereof then and there presiding, on the 28th day of January, 1949, all as appears of record, said child then being, as aforesaid, in the lawful custody and possession of her said mother in Clarke County.  4. On said last mentioned hearing on January 28, 1949, upon said petition for the appointment of a custodian, the court entered an order and judgment thereon denying the application of said Charles M. Kenimer Jr., for an order changing the custody of said child from her said mother to a custodian named by the court, pending the determination of the question of permanent custody then in issue; further providing in said order&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  that said Charles M. Kenimer Jr., be allowed to visit his said child on Saturday, February 5, 1949, and on alternate Saturdays thereafter between 9:00 a. m. and 4:30 p. m., and that said Charles M. Kenimer Jr., be allowed on said occasions to take said child in his automobile for such visits, provided on such occasions he was accompanied at all such times during such visits by either Dudley Cook, Esquire, or Durwood T. Pye, Esquire, his attorneys, who, as the court provided in said order, were charged, as officers of the court, with the trust in so accompanying said Kenimer of seeing that said child was returned to the home of her said mother by 4:30 p. m. on each day of visitation, said Kenimer being by said order given like right of visitation on Sunday, February 13, 1949, and on alternate Sundays thereafter under the conditions above stated; the court further providing in said order that the mother of the child was directed to have the child dressed and prepared to accompany her father on the day of each such visitation; all of which appears of record in said case.  5. On Saturday, February 5, 1949, the said Charles M. Kenimer Jr., accompanied by one of his said attorneys, Durwood&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  T. Pye, Esquire, went to the home of the mother of said child in Clarke County, and carried the child from Clarke County to the home of the child's paternal grandparents, Mr. and Mrs. Charles M. Kenimer Sr., 557 St. Charles Avenue, Northeast, Atlanta, Fulton County, Georgia, for the first visit provided for under the terms of said order of January 28, 1949.  6. While at said 557 St. Charles Avenue, Atlanta, Fulton County, Georgia, on February 5, 1949, the said Charles M. Kenimer Jr., wilfully took, removed and spirited said child away, with the purpose and intention of removing the child beyond the jurisdictional limits of the State, and thereafter carried her beyond the jurisdictional limits of the State of Georgia, and beyond the jurisdictional limits of the United States of America, and failed and refused to return said child to the home of her mother in Clarke County, Georgia, on Saturday, February 5, 1949, as required by the order and judgment of said court so to do, and failed and refused to return said child to the home of the mother of the child and to the custody and possession of said mother, as required by the order of said court so to do, each and every day thereafter until&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and including October 1, 1949, all in violation of and in contempt of the orders, judgments and authority of said court, and for the purpose of preventing the effectual exercise of the jurisdiction of the court which he had invoked on the question of the custody of said child; contrary to and in flagrant disobedience of the authority, orders, judgments and jurisdiction of said court, and contrary to the good order, peace and dignity of the State.  7. Thereafter, said Superior Court of Fulton County, His Honor Ralph H. Pharr, Judge thereof presiding, conducted an investigation into the matters set forth in paragraph 6 above, witnesses being examined under oath, and on October 6, 1949, issued an order directing the Solicitor-General of the Atlanta Judicial Circuit to institute proceedings relating to the contempt of said Charles M. Kenimer Jr., which order is hereby attached.  8. Said Charles M. Kenimer Jr., is hereby, by the authority of the State, and the State's Solicitor-General, Atlanta Judicial Circuit, and by the authority of said court, charged and accused with the following separate and specific several acts of wilful contempt, each as set forth in the following counts, to wit:&quot; &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Count one is a follows: &quot;Charles M. Kenimer Jr., is charged with contempt of the Superior Court of Fulton County in that he did, in Fulton County, Georgia, on February 5, 1949, the date herein alleged being an essential averment as to this transaction, take, remove and spirit away the child, Betty Ann Kenimer, from 577 St. Charles Avenue, Northeast, Atlanta, Fulton County, Georgia, and failed and refused thereafter on said day to return said child to the home of the mother of said child, Mrs. Muriel Moran Kenimer Senter, in Clarke County, Georgia, in violation of the order of this court of January 28, 1949, in said case, requiring him to so return said child to the custody of the mother; and in that he did on February 5, 1949, the date herein alleged being an essential averment as to this transaction, remove the child, Betty Ann Kenimer, without the jurisdictional limits of this State, for the purpose of interfering with and impeding the effective exercise of the jurisdiction of the Superior Court of Fulton County respecting the determination of the custody of said child invoked by him in said case of Mrs. Muriel Moran Kenimer, now Senter, vs. Charles M. Kenimer Jr., No. A-1255, Fulton&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Superior Court.&quot; The other two hundred and thirty-seven counts are the same as count one except that each deals with the failure to return the child on a specified day.  In response to the citation the respondent filed the following answer: &quot;1. The defendant admits all of paragraph 1, with the exception of the allegation that his daughter, Betty Ann Kenimer, was in the lawful possession and custody of her mother on the date named therein.  He denies the allegation that Betty Ann Kenimer was in the lawful custody and possession of her mother.  2. Paragraph 2 is admitted.  Answering this paragraph further, defendant says that the plea to the jurisdiction was decided adversely to Mrs. Muriel Moran Kenimer (now Senter) and that she had filed in this court exceptions pendente lite to the judgment of the court against her plea to the jurisdiction, and this question is subject to final determination if and when the case should ever reach an appellate court.  3. The defendant admits paragraph 3, with the exception that said child was then in the lawful custody and possession of her said mother, which he denies.  4. Paragraph 4 of plaintiff's petition is admitted.  5. Paragraph 5 of plaintiff's&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  petition is admitted.  6. Paragraph 6 of plaintiff's petition is denied.  7. Paragraph 7 of plaintiff's petition is admitted.  8. Paragraph 8, and each count set forth therein is hereby denied.  9. This defendant says that on the 5th day of February, 1949, he removed his said child from the backyard of his parents' home in Atlanta, Georgia, and beyond the jurisdiction of the State of Georgia, and that on the 1st day of October, 1949 he returned to the State of Georgia, and that on the 2nd day of October, 1949 his attorneys called the Solicitor-General of Fulton County, Georgia, and that he surrendered himself and his daughter to the Solicitor-General at Augusta, Georgia on the night of October 2, 1949, and that on the 3rd day of October, 1949 he returned to Atlanta, Georgia in company with the Solicitor-General, and his daughter was delivered to her mother in the Fulton County court-house on said date.  10. This defendant denies that he is, or has been in contempt of court.  He says that this case originated in this court on petition brought by Mrs. Muriel Moran Kenimer for divorce against him.  Pending the final disposition of said case, this defendant and the said Muriel Moran Kenimer&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***9]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  entered into a written agreement as to a settlement of alimony and the custody of their minor daughter, Betty Ann Kenimer.  This written agreement was ordered filed as a part of the record in the case and is recorded in the clerk's office of this court in Minute Book 245, page 198, and when the final decree was entered in said case on September 18, 1947, his former wife was granted a divorce, his disabilities were removed and the written agreement as to alimony and the custody of the child was made a part of the final decree in said case.  This final decree is recorded in Minute Book 51, page 57, in the clerk's office of this court.  This agreement, which was made a part of the final decree in said case, provided in part as follows: 'It is further understood and agreed between the parties hereto that the custody of the said minor daughter, Betty Ann Kenimer, shall be vested jointly in both parties hereto, defendant paying all bills for the support, maintenance and education of said minor daughter, and in the event either or both of the parties hereto remarry, then it is agreeable that the court determine the custody of said minor daughter upon proper application of either party.' 11. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***10]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  This defendant says that the only orders in this case after the original decree was the order signed by Judge Frank A. Hooper on the 28th day of December, 1948, which order is recorded in Minute Book 262, page 256, and the order signed by Judge Ralph H. Pharr on the 28th day of January, 1949, recorded in Minute Book 251, page 57, and that under the original decree of this court, the order of Judge Frank A. Hooper and the order of Judge Ralph H. Pharr, he was vested with joint control and custody of his minor daughter and that under these orders he had a right to remove her from the jurisdiction of this court.  12. Therefore, this defendant says that he is not guilty of contempt of this court and he here and now pleads not guilty under the petition for a rule and every count thereof.&quot; The respondent also filed the following demurrers: &quot;1. The petition, on its face, shows that this defendant has not violated the order of the court dated January 28, 1949, signed by Judge Ralph H. Pharr and referred to in paragraph 4 of the petition, or of any other order of this court, for the reason that said order charged Dudley Cook and Durwood Pye with the responsibility of returning Betty Ann Kenimer&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***11]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to her mother on the dates of visitation set out in said order, and not this defendant.  2. The petition, on its face, shows that the alleged removal and keeping of Betty Ann Kenimer beyond the jurisdiction of this court is not and was not at any time contrary to the said order referred to in paragraph 4 of the petition on which the rule in this case is based.  3. Counts 2 to 238, inclusive, set forth no grounds as basis for contempt proceeding on the part of the court, for the reason that the petition on its face shows that if any contempt, as alleged, has been committed, the petition and the 238 counts contained therein charge the defendant with but one contemptuous act or the continuance of the same contemptuous act for the period of 238 consecutive days and, under the law, there can be no separate punishment for each continuous day.  4. The petition nowhere alleges that the defendant has actual notice of the court order alleged to have been violated, and is therefore fatally defective.  5. The petition as a whole and no count thereof sets forth any facts which would authorize this defendant to be adjudged in contempt of the court.  6. The petition, on its face, shows that if this&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***12]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  defendant has committed any act amounting to contempt, it would be a civil contempt, and this defendant has now purged himself of any alleged civil contempt by having surrendered his daughter.  7. The petition and the prayer thereto seeks to induce the court to violate paragraph 9, section 1, article 1, of the Constitution which prohibits excessive fines and the infliction of cruel and unusual punishment.  8. Counts 2 to 238, inclusive, should be stricken for the reason that they show on their face that they are a repetition of the alleged acts in count 1, and show no new or separate ground for contempt.&quot; The respondent also filed a motion to quash the citation &quot;for the reason that the said citation or information seeks to carve out of one alleged offense two hundred and thirty-eight offenses, which is contrary to law.&quot; The court on October 21, 1949, overruled the demurrers and the motion to quash, to which judgments no exceptions were taken.  After hearing evidence the court adjudged the respondent in contempt for each of the two hundred and thirty-eight days and ordered that he be punished by imprisonment in jail for five days on each count and pay a fine of $ 50 on each count.  Respondent&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***13]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  filed a motion in arrest of judgment, as follows: &quot;1. That the evidence adduced in the trial of said contempt proceeding, taken as a whole and construed in the light most favorable to the prosecution, establishes at most but a single offense of contempt as charged in the first count of said citation.  2. That all of the sentence imposed by the court in excess of a single term of imprisonment of twenty (20) days and a fine of two hundred dollars ($ 200) is null and void, and each and every day of imprisonment, and each and every dollar of fine imposed upon any count or counts of said citation numbered from two (2) to two hundred thirty-eight (238), inclusive, are null and void, contrary to law, and in contravention of the rights of this defendant under the Constitution and laws of the State of Georgia and of the United States of America.&quot; The motion in arrest was overruled on November 15, 1949, to which judgment exceptions pendente lite were filed.  The respondent filed a motion for a new trial and an amendment thereto containing eleven grounds.  The motion for a new trial as amended was overruled.  The exceptions in this court are to all of the foregoing judgments of the judge except&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***14]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the judgments overruling the respondent's demurrers and motion to quash.  The specific exceptions to the judgment imposing the fines and imprisonment are as follows: &quot;(a) The judgment was in excess of the limits imposed by the Constitution and laws of Georgia for punishments for contempt; (b) the judgment was not supported by the evidence in that the evidence established at most but a single contempt terminated and not repeated, and the evidence did not therefore support the sentence imposed; (c) the judgment was so excessive as to be unreasonable and an abuse of judicial discretion; (d) said judgment imposes cruel and unusual punishment upon the defendant contrary to the Constitution and laws of the United States and of the State of Georgia.&quot; </SPAN></P>

The court, however, reversed defendant's sentence, holding that the trial court's sentence of defendant on each count amounted to an aggregate sentence that constituted cruel and unusual punishment in violation of Ga.

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">J. R. Boyett and Eugene Moody filed, in the Superior Court of Pierce County, their motion to withdraw pleas of guilty entered for them to an accusation charging them with the offense of simple larceny (hog stealing), and to vacate and set aside the sentence and judgment of the court entered thereon for the reason that they were deprived of due process of law, and the benefit and right of counsel to represent them in entering the pleas of guilty.  A rule nisi was issued setting the motion for hearing at a designated time and place.  Upon the hearing, and after the introduction of evidence by both the applicants and the State, the prayers of the motion were overruled and the applicants appealed to the Supreme Court, which transferred the case to this court for determination since the writ of error presented no question requiring a construction of a constitutional provision nor attacked any statute as being unconstitutional.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Upon a call from a sheriff, a solicitor general went to the courthouse and told defendants that they were being charged with stealing a hog. The solicitor general asked defendants if they wished to enter a plea of guilty, and defendants indicated that they did. At a hearing on their motion to withdraw their guilty pleas and set aside the judgment of conviction, defendants adduced evidence related to the events that occurred prior to the killing of the hog, such as their arrests and their alleged confessions. Defendants contended that they never intended to enter pleas of guilty and that they did not steal the hog in question. Defendants alleged that they simply wished to resolve the matter and dispose of the case and that they did not realize what was occurring at the time they entered their pleas even though their appointed counsel was with them. On appeal, the court held that the superior court did not abuse its discretion in overruling defendants' motion; the superior court was the judge of defendants' credibility upon their motion, and it found that no officer of the superior court held out any representations or inducements to defendants at the time of their pleas.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The losing gambler argued that after the passage and approval of 1949 Ga. Laws 1827, providing for a trial by a jury of six in the trial court that tried the case, the trial court ceased to be a constitutional city court and a writ of error did not lie directly from that court to the court. The winning gambler contended on appeal that the verdict was not authorized by the evidence. The court denied the motion and affirmed the judgment. The court stated that under the constitutional provisions concerning the enactment of local laws and precedent applying them, the act providing for a trial by six jurors in the trial court was not in fact law at all and had never been so and the court had to deal with it accordingly, even though the court was powerless to declare the law unconstitutional. The court determined that the motion to dismiss the writ of error had to be denied. The court observed that it was within the province of the jury to resolve the conflicts in the evidence and that by the verdict those conflicts were resolved in favor of the losing gambler. The court stated that the verdict was authorized by the evidence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Declaratory judgment; from Toombs Superior Court -- Judge Humphrey.  May 3, 1948.  (Application to Supreme Court for certiorari.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">C. W. Findley and others, citizens and taxpayers of the City of Vidalia, filed a petition in Toombs Superior Court in behalf of themselves and other citizens and taxpayers of said city, against the City of Vidalia and J. B. McCrary Company Inc., for a declaratory judgment and other relief.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The material allegations of the petition of the plaintiffs were: that on March 3, 1948 the defendant municipality and the defendant corporation entered into a contract for the construction of certain extensions and improvements to the waterworks system in the municipality; that the municipality failed to comply with certain charter provisions in taking corporate action with respect to said contract, which provisions were set forth in the petition; that the contract was executed by the mayor and clerk of the municipality pursuant to the action of the city authorities in a regular meeting held on March 3, 1948, at which all members of the city council were present, said action being the unanimous adoption of a motion that the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  city enter into a contract with McCrary Company authorizing it to proceed with the contemplated improvements to the waterworks system of the city: that the &quot;ordinance or resolution&quot; was not published as required by the charter, and the city had not asked for or sought competitive bids on the work to be done before the execution of the contract; that the contract was null, void and ultra vires because (a) the ordinance or resolution authorizing the execution of the contract was not sufficient to constitute corporate action by the mayor and council in that the terms of the contract were not set out in the resolution, (b) the ordinance or resolution was not published before its introduction and passage, (d) said contract was contrary to public policy in that the municipality had surrendered to the McCrary Corporation its authority and duty to make contracts in its behalf in the purchase of materials and machinery used in the construction work, and (e) was contrary to public policy in that it was entered into without competitive bidding.  It was alleged that the work had not been done under the contract, that if the city was permitted to carry out said contract it would involve the incurring&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of illegal debts and spending of sums illegally to the detriment of the plaintiffs as citizens and taxpayers, and that the plaintiffs had no adequate remedy at law and this was a proper case in which the courts should declare the rights and liabilities of the municipality with respect to the contract to the end that the plaintiffs be afforded relief from uncertainty and insecurity respecting their rights as citizens and taxpayers.  The prayers were (a) that the court declare the contract to be null, void and ultra vires, (b) that both defendants be enjoined from carrying out any of the provisions of the contract until a final adjudication as to its validity or invalidity, (c) that the municipality be enjoined from paying any money to the McCrary Company or doing any other thing in performance of the contract, and for process and such other and further relief as may seem meet to the court.  The plaintiffs amended by alleging that the contract was null and void because McCrary Company had a dual interest therein under its fee for supervision and payment for the use of certain machinery to be furnished by it, and the payment of salaries to supervisory personnel, and because there was&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  no fixed and certain maximum liability on the city.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The City of Vidalia demurred generally to the petition and McCrary Company demurred generally and specially.  Upon the hearing it was admitted by counsel for the plaintiffs in open court that the city had in its treasury $ 200,000 derived from the sale of revenue-anticipation certificates issued pursuant to law for the purpose of constructing the extensions and improvements to the city's waterworks system.  The court sustained the general demurrers of the defendants and dismissed the petition and the plaintiffs have excepted to that judgment.  </SPAN></P>

Plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief regarding a contract for the construction of certain extensions and improvements to the waterworks system in the city.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiffs admitted at the hearing that the city had in its treasury $ 200,000 derived from the sale of revenue-anticipation certificates issued pursuant to law for the purpose of the extensions and improvements. On appeal, the court held that dismissal of the petition was proper. If the contract was illegal or invalid, plaintiffs had a remedy at law or equity, and declaratory judgment was improper. The contract was made pursuant to a former action of the city properly taken under the Revenue Certificate Law of 1937, Ga. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 87-88, and the validation of the revenue certificates made the former action of the city conclusive upon it, its citizens, and its taxpayers. The making of the contract was appropriate corporate action not requiring the passage of an ordinance. Finally, when the contract was construed in its entirety, the fact that the company was both an agent and a contractor thereunder did not void the contract. Municipal officers were presumed to have acted legally, and there was substantial doubt that the contract contravened public policy.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defendants filed a plea in abatement assigning numbers of grounds for the alleged invalidity of that portion of the city ordinance sought to be applied to them.

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defendants further contend in their said pleas in abatement that the tax of $ 10 per day, sought to be imposed upon them as itinerant photographers, is void as being an arbitrary discrimination between an itinerant photographer engaged in interstate commerce and a local resident photographer, and by its terms seeks to prevent such business in interstate&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  commerce from competing with such business of the resident photographer.</SPAN></P>

D. for any balance due; that the corporation reserved the right to accept or reject any order sold by its agent, and the customer had the right to refuse to purchase or&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  order any further finished photographs; that the Bennett transaction went according to this plan as far as it got; that the plan herein outlined applied to any and all customers of the corporation in Gainesville; that the part played by the defendants herein in the Bennett transaction is the extent of their duties and services to the corporation in their transaction of the usual business of the corporation; that neither of the defendants had obtained any license from the plaintiff and neither had paid the license tax prescribed by sec. 5, item 141; that each of them declined to obtain a license or pay the license tax; that the corporation had not obtained any license or paid the $ 50 tax provided for in sec. 5, item 141 (a); that seven persons are permanently engaged in the photography business in the City of Gainesville, of which only one employs a canvasser; and that the remaining six operate from a fixed place of business.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was further agreed that the mayor and police officers of the City of Gainesville would testify substantially as follows: that in recent years transient photographers have imposed upon the police authorities there additional burdens by fraudulently obtaining&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  money from the local citizens in payment of photographs and not delivering the same; that the ordinance complained of was enacted by the proper authorities of the plaintiff as a police regulation for the protection of the citizens of said city; that non-resident photographers doing business in said city, including the defendants, were equipped with portable paraphernalia which could be packed and moved in five minutes; and that upon some occasions non-resident photographers are represented in said city by a photographer and a canvasser or canvassers, or either, without any equipment and with no fixed place of business.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Upon this agreed statement of facts the trial court denied the prayers of the plea in abatement, and by agreement the defendants were tried before the court on the same statement of facts.  Counsel for the defendants moved that the court find the defendants not guilty based on the agreed statement of facts, upon a number of grounds including one that a conviction would be an unconstitutional enforcement of said ordinance against the defendants in violation of the interstate-commerce clause of the Constitution of the United States and contained in art. I, sec 8, par. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  3, hereinbefore quoted.  The trial court overruled the motion and convicted each of the defendants, fixing their punishment at the maximum penalty provided for by the ordinance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defendants appealed the cases by certiorari, based on their contentions as herein outlined and as having been insisted upon in the recorder's court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the hearing the judge of the superior court overruled the certiorari, and this judgment is assigned as error.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In separate cases, plaintiff City of Gainesville charged defendant photographers of violating Gainesville, Ga. Code of Ordinances &sect; 5, item 141 B by engaging in the business of itinerant photographers without having procured a license. The photographers were convicted in the Superior Court of Hall County (Georgia) and their appeals by certiorari were overruled. The photographers sought review of the judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The photographers contended that the ordinance was invalid as being in violation of the Commerce Clause of the Constitution of the United States, U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 8, para. 3, because it discriminated against and imposed an undue burden on such commerce. The court agreed and affirmed the judgment. The provision of the ordinance requiring the photographers taking orders for pictures, before starting to work, to register with the police department, was urged by the City as conclusive evidence that the ordinance was a police measure. However, the tax imposed by the ordinance on a resident photographer of the city was $ 15 per year, while that imposed on itinerant photographers was $ 10 per day. The court held that the difference in taxes was of such magnitude that it could hardly be classed as other than discriminatory. Only undue or discriminatory burdens upon commerce were forbidden. Since the photographers' business amounted to interstate commerce, the ordinance put an undue burden on it and was offensive to the Commerce Clause.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Awtry &amp; Lowndes Company contracted to buy the building and land of the Standard Club on Ponce de Leon Avenue in Atlanta for use as an undertaking establishment, and filed, with the Board of Zoning Appeals of Atlanta, its petition for a permit to establish and operate such a business on the premises.  Upon protest by the Yaarab Temple of Atlanta against the grant of the permit, the Board of Zoning Appeals denied the application, and on petition and writ of certiorari the finding of the board was affirmed and the certiorari was overruled by the Superior Court of Fulton County.  To this judgment Awtry &amp; Lowndes excepted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A city planning plat of the Ponce de Leon Avenue area, which was introduced in evidence, showed that the property on the north side of Ponce de Leon Avenue from Peachtree Street to Ponce de Leon Park is zoned for business under Class U-3, and that the Standard Club property is located at about the middle of this distance; but that the property on the south side of Ponce de Leon Avenue, opposite the Standard&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Club, is classified as U-2 for hotels and apartment houses.  The pertinent parts of the Atlanta zoning ordinance, as shown by the record, are hereinafter set out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A Class U-6 use may not be located within the present limits of the City of Atlanta.  A Class U-7 use may be located only on special permit as provided in the following sections.&quot; City Code of Atlanta, &sect; 93-209.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Use district exceptions: (a) the board of zoning appeals may in a specific case, after public notice and hearing and subject to appropriate conditions and safeguards, determine and vary the application of the use district regulations herein established in harmony with their general purposes and intent as follows: . . . (3) Permit in a use district any use deemed by the board to be in general keeping with the uses authorized in such district; . . . (5) Permit the location of a Class U-7 use in any use district provided such use in such location will in the judgment of the board of zoning appeals substantially serve the public convenience and welfare and will not substantially and permanently injure the appropriate use of the neighboring property.&quot; City Code of Atlanta, &sect; 93-210.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Class U-3 is a business zone&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  providing for the following uses: bank; office; studio; telephone exchange; wholesale sales office or sample room; oil-filling station; fire station; ice-delivery station; retail trade or shop for custom work or the making of articles to be sold at retail in the premises; restaurant; theatre; moving-picture show; billboard or advertising sign; garage or repair shop for motor vehicles; hand laundry; electric substation; storage in bulk of, or warehouse for, such material as building material, contractor's equipment, clothing, cotton, drugs, drygoods, feed, fertilizer, food, fuel, furniture, hardware, ice, machinery, metal, oil and petroleum in quantities less than tank car lots, paint and paint materials, pipe, rubber, shop supplies, tobacco or wool; streetcar barns; and any use not included in any other class, provided such use is not noxious or offensive by reason of the emission of odor, dust, smoke, gas or noise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Uses included in Class U-7 are: crematory, cemetery, sewage-disposal plant, refuse dump, undertaking establishment, markets established upon vacant lots or parts of lots, being places where produce is sold from cars or wagons or upon the lots named, and church.  Uses for&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  these and other classifications are set forth in the City Code of Atlanta, &sect; 93-203.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The petitioner introduced as witnesses in its behalf: C. C. Styron, Chief of the Atlanta Fire Department, who testified that it would be in the public interest for Awtry &amp; Lowndes to move from their present location on Cain Street, which is within the interside fire limits and is a congested one-way street near a fire station, to the site of the Standard Club, outside of the interside limits; Herbert T. Jenkins, Chief of the Atlanta Police Department, who testified that it would relieve the traffic situation if the funeral home moved from Cain Street, because much congestion was caused by funerals being held in that locality; W. C. Wallace, who owns the property to the east of the Standard Club, conducting a hotel and tourist home thereon, and who testified that he would much prefer to have the funeral home located on the Standard Club property because it would increase the attractiveness of his business and make the occupancy of his rooms more desirable to have the quiet of the undertaking establishment rather than the past noise and interference of the Standard Club and the future noise of the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Shrine; J. D. Erwin and Mrs. E. W. Adams, both neighboring property owners, who testified that they preferred to have the funeral home as neighbors rather than either the Standard Club or the Shrine; Mrs. W. C. Wallace, who testified that they (the neighboring property owners) did not want the Shrine to come in and run the neighborhood with their power and influence; Dr. Paul James, Pastor of the Baptist Tabernacle, which has a Student Center across the street from the Standard Club, who testified that the Baptist Student Committee favored having the mortuary locate in the Standard Club property; J. W. Awtry and Frank Lowndes, who testified that the funeral home conducted most of its activities in the daytime, though once or twice a year they might have a funeral at night, that the Shrine conducted most of its activities at night, that the Shrine would not bother the funeral home, and that the funeral home had no objection to having the Shrine next door.  The petitioner also introduced a petition from substantially all the neighboring property owners endorsing the funeral home's acquisition of the property, and a letter from Marvin Thomas, Captain of Traffic of the Atlanta Police Department, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  stating that the traffic problem in the vicinity of Awtry &amp; Lowndes' establishment on Cain Street had become acute as a result of funerals being held there, and that it would be of great benefit in clearing up this problem if they were to move.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Shrine introduced as witnesses A. S. Happoldt, Potentate; W. C. Harris, second in command of the Yaarab Temple; Roy Mather, Barnes Sale, Dr. Ben Holtzendorf, and Louis P. Taylor, all Past-Potentates; and Frank A. Cundell, member of the Shrine, all of whose testimony showed in substance that the Shrine in Atlanta was composed of something more than 5000 members; that the Shrine, before purchasing, had carefully selected the property adjacent to the Standard Club as a location where their activities would be the least objectionable; that the Shrine had been negotiating with the Standard Club for the purchase of the property in question, and was still willing to buy it, but the club had contracted with Awtry &amp; Lowndes; that the Shrine was planning to erect a Temple on their property, but it had not yet obtained a permit, preferring to wait until they had procured the Standard Club property and submit their plain in final form in their petition&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  for a permit; that the Shrine is a fun-loving organization, engaged in charitable work, and conducting four ceremonials or parades each year, in which they use their bands; that their activities were principally at night and were confined to the early and reasonable hours of the evening; that they were afraid that their parades, band practices, and festivities would interfere with the operation of the funeral home, particularly on the days of parades, and that their activities would be objectionable to those in bereavement at the loss of one of their family and would condemn the Shrine in the eyes of the public, in addition to the fact that the members of the Shrine, as gentlemen, would be constrained, by their respect for the dead, in their use of their own property; and that, while the Shrine had been located next door to Awtry &amp; Lowndes on Cain Street for some twenty years without either interfering with the other, the members could not see having a funeral home located next to the new Temple and would not invest their money in the Temple under that circumstance.  </SPAN></P>

The undertaking business was lawful, and, because no zone was designated for it, it had an equal right with other business to locate in an area appropriately zoned, where it was uncontradicted that such location would substantially serve the public convenience and welfare, and where it was not shown that it would substantially and permanently injure the appropriate use for which the property had been designated by the zoning officials.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The regents entered a contract with the stockholders for the purchase of a radio station. Subsequently their application for a license to operate the station was denied by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) as contrary to the public interest and inconsistent with provisions of the Federal Communications Act of 1934, 47 U.S.C.S. &sect; 151 et seq. The regents ceased payments for the purchase of the station, claiming that they were excused as a matter of law and of fact from further performance of the contract by reason of the impossibility of their performing the same because of an act of law. The trial court ruled in favor of the stockholders. On appeal the court affirmed the trial court's decision. The court held that the FCC was without power to take any action that had the effect of nullifying the obligations of the parties to the contract. The court noted that, while the FCC had the power to protect the public interest by refusing licenses, the Act was not intended to place matters of a private nature before the FCC. The right of the FCC to refuse a license did not excuse the regents from performing the contract, which was of a private nature and otherwise fair and valid.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The mothers each brought an action against the hotel for damages for the deaths of their children resulting from a hotel fire. The mothers alleged acts of negligence based upon common law as well as negligence per se in violation of state law and city ordinances. The hotel filed demurrers to the mothers' petitions. The trial court sustained part of the demurrers and overruled others. The mothers and the hotel appealed. The court ruled that where there were cases pending in the supreme court containing the same material allegations as to negligence per se and common law negligence as contained in the mothers' petitions, the supreme court's decision was binding. Thus, in conformity with the supreme court's decision, the trial court properly overruled the demurrers as to negligence per se based upon state law and city ordinances and erred in sustaining the hotel's demurrers as to the allegation of common law negligence. Finally, there were four allegations that were not a part of the supreme court's decision, and the trial court properly sustained the hotels' demurrers on the ground that the statutory provisions on which the four other allegations were based were unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The mother's complaint alleged that her son was killed by the negligence of the carrier.

The court determined that the administrator was properly made a party under Ga. Code &sect; 105-1307. The court found that under Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 68-509, the carrier and its insured were properly joined in the same action, regardless of the fact that liability of one was in tort and the other in contract.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Claimant employee was injured while doing work for his employer. He filed a claim with the Georgia Board of Workmen's Compensation. He also filed suit against defendants, those involved with the injury he sustained. The Board determined that the injury was compensable. The Superior Court of DeKalb County (Georgia) affirmed the Board's award. The insurer sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The employee's action against defendants were for the same injuries covered by the Board's award. The insurer argued that its payments to the employee should be reduced or eliminated because of the employee's settlement with defendants. The court held that (1) the Board's compensation award to the employee was affected only when a judicial recovery was obtained, so the employee's award was not reducible by the amount paid under the settlement; (2) the terms of the agreement between the employee and the insurer were not fulfilled by a recovery of judgment; (3) the Board did not approve any agreement whereby the insurer was relieved of its obligation to the employee because of the settlement; and (4) the employee's request for attorney's fees on the ground that the insurer's appeal was meritless was denied.</SPAN></P>
