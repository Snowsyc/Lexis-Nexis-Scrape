VI, &sect; 4. Wis. Stat. &sect; 17.03(10) stated that any public office was vacant upon the occurrence of any other event that was declared by any special provision of law to create a vacancy. Under Wis. Stat. &sect; 66.906, any participating employee that reached 65 was to be retired at the end of the month in which that age was reached. The former register had voluntarily elected to come under the provisions of the Wisconsin Retirement Act. The court agreed with the trial court's determination that where the retirement of an employee or a public officer was mandatory upon the occurrence of certain circumstances it followed logically that upon the occurrence of those circumstances there was a vacancy in the office occupied by him under Wis. Stat. &sect; 17.03. The court rejected the contention of the former register that his withdrawal of his election to be included in the retirement fund had been effective.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 348.15(3)(b) (1957) by transporting a trailer that exceeded the maximum weight limit. Prior to imposing sentence, the trial court certified the question whether &sect; 348.15 was unconstitutional because it imposed an excessive fine under the facts and circumstances of the case.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested while towing a caterpillar machine that he used in construction and land clearing. The fines for violating Wis. Stat. &sect; 348.15 (1957) were graduated according to the amount of the overload, as declared in Wis. Stat. &sect; 348.21(3)(b), par. 1. Defendant argued that the statutorily mandated fine violated Wis. Const. art. I, &sect; 6 because it was beyond his ability to pay. Prior to certification, the trial court found that defendant would be forced out of business if he had to pay the fine, that the caterpillar was not divisible and could not have been transported in multiple trips, and that the load was not being hauled for profit. The court held that &sect; 348.15 was not unconstitutional, and that the fine scale based on the weight of the overload instead of the violator's financial status did not shock public sentiment or violate the judgment of reasonable people. The court held that the fine was to be measured by the offense sought to be prevented rather than defendant's ability to pay. The court noted that Wis. Stat. &sect; 348.25 provided for excess load permits, and that defendant knew of that provision and failed to take advantage of it.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant City challenged a judgment of the trial court (Wisconsin) in its action challenging the incorporation of respondent Town into a City. The City had initiated annexation proceedings over the Town, but the proceedings had not been pursued. The City had attempted to annex territory and the Town attempted to incorporate into a fourth-class City unto itself.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The annex noticed territory was part of the Town and the City, which claimed some territory from the Town, adopted the ordinance. The City further contended that in accordance with Wis. Stat. &sect; 62.07, public notice had been given by posting, that a petition was circulated, and that a copy of the posted notice was published in a newspaper of general circulation. The trial court found for the town and, on appeal, the court reviewed the record, which showed that the annexation proceedings had not been pursued for nearly two years after notification and the passage of the ordinance. The court held that territory could not be exempted from a competing consolidation by the irresponsible posting and pursuit of an annexation that was not completed within a reasonable time, and that the incorporation of the Town was such a competing consolidation. Further, the court held that the period of almost two years having elapsed, the attempted annexation was no bar to the incorporation. Finally, the court held that because the Town was not annexing any of the City's territory, it was not a real party in interest under Wis. Stat. &sect; 260.13 and lacked standing to challenge the incorporation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner, a prison inmate, sought a writ of habeas corpus. The inmate alleged that the manner in which the Wisconsin State Department of Public Welfare interpreted the good conduct sentence reduction provisions of Wis. Stat. &sect; 53.11 was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate was given consecutive sentences by separate courts in two counties. The State Department of Public Welfare interpreted the provisions of Wis. Stat. &sect; 53.11 regarding the reduction of sentences for good behavior to mean that the inmate's sentences were to be treated as separate sentences in computing his good time credits and determining his conditional release date. The Department required the inmate to serve both consecutive sentences, less good time earned, before he became eligible for conditional release. If the inmate had received the same sentences from the same court, however, the Department would have treated the sentences as a combined sentence, and the inmate's conditional release date would have been 11 months earlier. The court rejected the inmate's argument that the Department's interpretation of the statute was an unconstitutional, discriminatory, and invalid classification for the same crime, and that it provided for different punishment for the same crime. The court held that good time sentence reductions were a matter of grace when applied prospectively and could be repealed by the legislature.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court noted that if the authority was an independent public corporate body, it was not a municipal corporation within the meaning of Wis. Const. art. XI, &sect; 2, which required a jury verdict of necessity in condemnation proceedings for private property. The court determined, however, that the relationship between the authority and the city was such that the constitution required a jury verdict in condemnation proceedings initiated by the authority. The court noted that the city had the power to control the activities of the authority to so great a degree as to deprive the authority of independence, including that the authority's determination of the necessity of taking a particular piece of private property was wholly dependent upon decisions of the city council. The court concluded that Wis. Stat. &sect; 66.431(5)(b)&nbsp;unconstitutionally authorized that the city could make a final decision that private property must be taken for a public purpose without the concurrence of a jury. The court found, however, that due to the statutory presumption of severability, the determination of the invalidity of portions of the statute did not establish the invalidity of the act as a whole.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Town of Wilson enacted an ordinance in 1950 that prohibited parking house trailers outside an approved camp without a permit. The ordinance was adopted under Wis. Stat. &sect; 60.297(1)(c), (2) (1949), which defined trailer camps and empowered town boards to regulate them. A second ordinance was passed in 1954. The landowner argued that he could not be convicted under the 1954 ordinance because he had lawfully parked a trailer on his property prior to the effective date of the 1954 ordinance. The court held that: (1) even if the landowner's use of his premises prior to the effective date of the 1954 ordinance was unlawful, he had acquired no right to continue such use; (2) whether or not the 1950 ordinance applied to individual trailers parked outside a trailer camp, the Town was empowered by Wis. Stat. &sect; 60.18(12) to regulate individual trailer sites; and (3) the Town had not improperly denied the landowner's application for a permit under the 1950 ordinance because the application was made by another person on the landowner's behalf, and there was evidence that the landowner intended to evade the ordinance by selling off strips of land to owners of trailers.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Burning automobile bodies was an essential part of plaintiffs' salvage process. Witnesses testified that this burning produced offensive and nauseating smells impairing their health and comfort, as well as smoke and soot. The trial court concluded that a county smoke ordinance preempted and voided the city ordinance, City of West Allis, Wis., City Code &sect; 6.11. Reversing, the court held that the preemption provided by Wis. Stat. &sect; 59.07(53) extended only to the quantity and quality of smoke produced; because the county ordinance did not regulate the discharge of gases and fumes, the city ordinance was valid on that point. The court held that the prohibition of burning auto bodies was a permissible exercise of the city's police power and was permitted by state statutes,&nbsp;Wis. Stat. &sect;&sect; 66.052(1), 175.25(1), and 62.11. The ordinance's requirements that a plat of the surrounding area be submitted in order to obtain a permit and that the operations of the salvage business be set back from the road by 750 feet or separated from the road by a building were not arbitrary or unreasonable.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The insured and the passenger gave false statements to the police and the insurer stating that the insured was driving. However, the passenger and the insured had switched places prior to the collision. At the time of the collision, the insured reached over and grabbed the wheel and applied the brake. Affirming the denial of summary judgment, the court held that the evidence that the false statements were consciously or deliberately made was so definite that there was no issue to submit to a jury. If the false statements were used for impeachment purposes at the trial, they would be material and the insured would have breached the cooperation clause; however, the possibility of future impeachment was insufficient to require a finding of breach at the summary judgment stage. A question of fact existed as to whether the insured received certain letters from the insurer's attorneys and therefore whether he failed to cooperate in verifying the answer. The insurer's filing of an SR-21 with the state motor vehicle department did not bar it from relying upon its defense of breach of the cooperation condition, because it had no knowledge of the breach at the time the SR-21 was filed.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 153.10 applied to opticians as well as optometrists, but that to permit such a prescription to be translated into eyeglasses which were the product of poor material and craftsmanship by opticians interested in underselling their competitors was to defeat the purpose of the statute. The court held that the language of &sect; 153.10 in no way indicated that proof of fraud was necessary to spell out an offense under its price advertising prohibition. The court further found that Wis. Stat. &sect;&sect; 153.10 and 153.11 were constitutional because a prohibition of advertising the price of lenses or complete eyeglasses was a reasonable and valid exercise of the police power. Finally, because the prohibition of truthful advertising was a proper exercise of the state's police power and the federal government limited its control to the field of false advertising, Wis. Stat. &sect; 153.10 was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, brokers and salesmen, sought review of a decision of the Circuit Court for Dane County (Wisconsin) that suspended their brokers' licenses and remanded the action to respondent, the Wisconsin Real Estate Brokers' Board, for re-determination of whether to suspend respondent realty company's license.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Board decided to suspend a realty company's broker license along with its brokers and salesmen. The Board suspended the licenses for varying amounts of time. The circuit court affirmed in part, but it remanded the action against the realty company for re-determination. The court affirmed in part, modified in part, and reversed and remanded in part. The court held that it was not mandatory that license of a corporate broker be suspended or revoked merely because such discipline was invoked against one of its offending employees or officers. The court opined that, because of hardship that such a suspension was likely to impose upon its innocent employees and stockholders, the realty company's license should not be suspended unless the Board deemed it absolutely necessary to protect the interests of the public. The Board's order in imposing a one month's suspension of license as to one offender and a four months' suspension of license as to another for the identical misconduct was so discriminatory as to be capricious within the meaning of Wis. Stat. &sect; 227.20(1)(e).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city sought to build an airport on property that included appellants' property. Appellants filed suit filed, asking for an injunction to enjoin respondents from entering their property and removing the buildings and topsoil and challenging the constitutionality of the proceedings. Respondents contended that the appeal procedures found in the condemnation statute,&nbsp;Wis. Stat. &sect; 114.33, provided the exclusive remedy for their challenge. On appeal of the Commission's demurrer, the court held that the request for an injunction was proper because appellants could suffer irreparable harm if the property was razed before their appeal of the award of compensation was completed. The trial court had jurisdiction to pass on the merits of the constitutional issues. Appellants contended that a jury was required to determine the necessity of the condemnation. Wis. Const. art. XI, &sect; 2, which provided for such a determination, did not apply. The Commission, acting on behalf of the city, was authorized under Wis. Stat. &sect; 114.33 to institute condemnation proceedings for an airport without a jury determination. The general condemnation authority included condemnation proceedings for an airport.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The insurer executed an SR-21 form and filed it with the motor vehicle commissioner. In the form, the insurer stated that its insured was the owner of a truck involved in an accident, that the named driver was the operator of the truck, that the insurer had issued an automobile liability policy as defined in Wis. Stat. &sect; 85.09, that the policy was in effect on the date of the accident, and that the insurance applied to both the owner and the operator. The driver of the other vehicle involved in the accident filed suit against the insurer, which unsuccessfully sought summary judgment. On appeal, the court affirmed, finding that because it certified to the commissioner that its insurance policy applied to and covered the operator, the insurer could not deny coverage. The insurer claimed that the rights of the parties were to be determined by the law of the state where the contract was made, Illinois. The court disagreed, finding the parties' rights were governed by the laws of the state where the contract was performed, Wisconsin. The court then held that because Wisconsin permitted a direct action against an insurer, the insurer's motion for summary judgment was properly denied.</SPAN></P>

The lower court entered judgment for the legatees and the heirs appealed. The court reversed the judgment and remanded the cause for further proceedings to determine the intent of the testatrix under the familial situation created by the murder. The estate passed to the husband in a constructive trust and consideration had to be given to the intent of the testatrix to determine if the legatees should receive the estate, in which case the children of the husband would benefit by his crime, or if the estate should pass to the heirs, which would be as if the testatrix died intestate and her will would, in essence, be judicially revoked without any authority, statutory or otherwise.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to the decedent's will, the widow was to receive $ 300 per month, which included $ 160 per month provided by the antenuptial agreement. The trial court found that the provision made for the widow by the antenuptial agreement was taxable. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment. The court found that the $ 160 per month provided by the antenuptial agreement was a transfer by will and hence taxable since the will recognized and implemented the antenuptial agreement. The court held that it was clear that the right to receive the $ 160 per month was taxable as a transfer by the intestate laws of the state under Wis. Stat. 72.01(1) since it was a right acquired by contract in lieu of dower, as that language was used in Wis. Stat. &sect; 72.24(5). The court noted that the contract specified that it was in full satisfaction of her dower rights. The executor's argument that the tax was unconstitutional was without merit. The court held that the uniformity provision of Wis. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 1 was not violated since the tax on property passing to widows pursuant to antenuptial contracts gave similar treatment to all who were similarly situated.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant clerk complained of an order of the Circuit Court for Milwaukee County (Wisconsin), which found that inaction of the approving authority was not capable of reversal, affirmance, or modification on appeal and that, there being no adequate remedy under Wis. Stat. &sect; 236.11(2), mandamus lay to compel the clerk to certify the approval of a plat.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A plat was neither approved nor rejected within the 60-day period; the time was not extended; there were no unsatisfied objections filed. Given those circumstances, Wis. Stat. &sect; 236.11(2) required that the plat should have been deemed approved. What was required of the clerk was simply the ministerial act of certification, and mandamus lay to compel such act. The question whether &sect; 236.11(2) was unconstitutional did not arise because the court could not assume that the plat violated any ordinances; the only permissible assumption was that the plat did comply with municipal requirements; otherwise it would have been rejected. Certification by the clerk under &sect; 236.11(2) was required because the approving authority failed to act within the 60 days. The situation presented by the petition was one of inaction. There was no action of the approving authority from which an appeal could have been taken, no action or decision that the court on appeal might reverse, affirm, or modify. There being no adequate remedy under the statute, mandamus lay to compel the clerk to certify the approval of the plat.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant municipality sought review of a judgment from the Circuit Court for Racine County (Wisconsin) in favor of respondents, owners of a trailer park, finding that the owners had acquired vested rights to operate 47 trailer spaces, in spite of a municipal ordinance limit of 25, because they had fully completed 23 spaces and partially completed 24 other spaces at the time the ordinance was adopted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The municipality contended that the court was mistaken in its conception of vested rights to a nonconforming use. It was undisputed that the original 24-space parcel was discontinued as space for trailers. Its equipment was removed and the property developed for other uses. The owners did not attempt to operate trailers there nor did they claim a right to do so. They attempted to transfer their right to operate 47 trailer spaces in that location to another locality. The court held that their nonconforming use was not ambulatory. They could not shift it to property, which they acquired after the passage of the ordinance. The right was to continue the use of a property, which use had already been undertaken at the time when the law was changed. This principle would have protected the owners in continuing their development and use of the 24 spaces under construction. But they did not have a vested right to operate a 47-space trailer camp wherever they pleased. This was not a continuance of the use of property already undertaken at the date of the ordinance but was an attempted extension of the nonconforming use to new property.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court's judgment, and remanded with directions to grant the municipality the relief demanded by the complaint.</SPAN></P>

The annexation had a large impact on the tax base of the school districts involved, and they were therefore entitled to test the propriety of the annexation, at least when authorized by the electors at a district meeting. The court vacated the annexation in case no. 225 because the annexation proceeding proposed to take noncontiguous territory. Area 2-C was completely separated from areas 2-A and 2-B. The court rejected the districts' challenges in case no. 224, specifically rejecting any claim concerning the sufficiency of the annexation petition, procedural irregularities, and the effect of an error in the first order that was corrected by the school boards. All steps in Wis. Stat. &sect; 40.075 and &sect; 40.14(2) were taken, and the boards were authorized to correct an erroneous description in the first order.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The town's amended ordinance zoned the entire town residential, with a provision that industries and trades that were not commonly known as objectionable and obnoxious could have been admitted with the town board's approval. The ordinance excluded the use of premises for maintaining a junkyard. The operators subsequently established a salvage yard. The town brought an action against the operators, and the trial court dismissed the action. The court affirmed the judgment and held that the ordinance was invalid on its face because it created a residential district of the entire area of the town regardless of its character. The failure of the ordinance to have created non-residential districts, to have defined boundaries and established standards for their regulation and use, violated the rules governing the making of classifications in the exercise of the police power. The court noted that ordinances, in so far as they classified as residential property, which did not have residential value, were unreasonable, unconstitutional, and void. The town was largely agricultural land. Nothing characterized it as residential and the area of the operators' property was unfit for such use.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The railroad company challenged a city ordinance. The trial court found that: the time limit of five minutes set by the ordinance was reasonable and necessary and the ordinance was valid; such obstruction of public travel was not due to an accident nor to contingency wholly beyond control of the operators of the train; the ordinance was passed for and was necessary for the safety, health, and welfare of the public; and the ordinance did not constitute an unreasonable burden upon interstate commerce. The city moved to strike from the record in each case all material except the complaint, warrant, proof of service, findings of the trial court, judgment, and certificate of the clerk to the return. The motion was granted. The court reasoned that with no bill of exceptions it could not consider the company's recitation of alleged facts nor the conclusions drawn where they differed from the findings or are not supported by any finding. The court held that it could not speculate as to the possible existence of facts which would cast doubt upon the validity of the ordinance.</SPAN></P>

The probate court held in favor of the attorney, and the executor of the decedent's estate appealed. In affirming the judgment of the probate court, the court concluded that the attorney's claim was not barred because the two-year period of limitations set forth in Wis.

The proponent claimed that Wis.

In affirming the judgment for the State, the court held that it did not have to address the constitutionality of the statute. The court held that the decedent accepted the benefits conferred by &sect; 45.37; thus, he, and those who claimed through him under his will, were thereby precluded by waiver from questioning the constitutionality of &sect; 45.37(3)(a).

Defendant indicated that he would sell the officer some &quot;hotter stuff&quot; if he became a regular customer. After several visits to the shop, the officer purchased some of the &quot;hotter&quot; stuff. When the police officer observed that the purchased books and playing cards were obscene, defendant was arrested. After defendant's suppression motion was denied, defendant was convicted of selling obscene materials. The court affirmed, holding that defendant committed each and every act essential to the offense charged. Defendant's contention that the offense was the product of the police officer's creative activity could not be sustained. Defendant's statement of selling the &quot;hotter stuff&quot; to his best customers indicated that the sale to the police officer was not an isolated transaction, but that defendant had engaged in such activity in the past. Defendant was not &quot;entrapped&quot; into the crime. Although it was error to rule on entrapment at a motion to suppress before trial, the error was not prejudicial.</SPAN></P>

He appealed the denial, asserting that the Wisconsin official map statute, and the city ordinance establishing the official map, were unconstitutional as amounting to a taking of his property without just compensation.

Additionally, the savings clause in the statute protected the applicant from substantial damages if the permit was to be denied, and if an applicant were substantially injured he had the right to secure review by certiorari. Wis. Stat. Ann. &sect; 62.23 (6), was held to be a valid exercise of the police power and was constitutional.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant city appealed from an order of the Circuit Court for Milwaukee County (Wisconsin) denying its motion for summary judgment dismissing three causes of action by which plaintiff village challenged as invalid its consolidation of an area within the village. The village appealed from a denial of its motion for summary judgment on causes of action for a declaration that its annexation of the area preempted and invalidated the consolidation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court rejected the village's contention that Wis. Stat. &sect; 66.02, did not authorize a city to consolidate with a town and, therefore, the city's incorporation of an area within the town was invalid. The statute was not ambiguous and, absent a constitutional provision clearly limiting consolidation to like entities, consolidation of the city and an area within a contiguous town was permissible. Prior consolidation of a part of the town lying between the city and the area it sought to consolidate did not preclude the city from annexing the area: &quot;town&quot; as used in &sect; 66.02 referred to that portion of the town that remained a functioning unit of government, excluding previously-annexed areas. A provision in the consolidation ordinances that existence of the town represented by the consolidated area was to cease did not invalidate the consolidation. Wis. Stat. &sect;&sect; 59.07 (22) and 60.05, which provided for vacation and dissolution of towns by action of the county board did not preclude dissolution of a town by adoption of consolidation ordinances under Wis. Stat. &sect; 66.02. In any event, the ordinance provisions of the ordinance that the town would cease to exist were severable.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment denying the city's summary judgment motion was reversed as to two of the causes of action, with directions to grant summary judgment dismissing those two causes of action. The judgment was affirmed insofar as it denied summary judgment on the third of the causes of action, and the other orders were affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The motorist commenced the action against the company by substituted service of summons and complaint on the commissioner of motor vehicles, which the commissioner mailed to the company at its home address all in conformity with the provisions of Wis.

Stat. &sect; 85.05(3) (1951), which provided the method for service of process on foreign autos, had been repealed. Section 85.05(3) was later replaced with &sect; 85.05(6) on November 26, 1953. In affirming, the court found that though &sect; 85.05(3) was repealed before the accident, it was re-created in substance by the passage of &sect; 85.05(6) and was retroactively applicable to an accident that occurred in the interim. The court concluded that service of process against the company made upon the official designated by the state to receive such service, with notice thereof sent to the company as the statute prescribed, was good service upon the company and resulted in jurisdiction in personam. The trial court correctly denied the company's motion to set aside and vacate the service of process and to dismiss the action.</SPAN></P>

The state department of public welfare demurred, and the trial court overruled the demurrer, ruling that Wis. Laws of 1955, ch. 404, was invalid because it violated Wis. Const. art. XI, &sect; 3a. The state department of public welfare appealed. In reversing, the court concluded that no violation of Wis. Const. art. XI, &sect; 3a, occurred because Wis. Laws of 1955, ch. 404, did not authorize a conveyance by the state to any other person or entity but merely provided for a transfer of property from one department of the state to another.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State challenged the circuit court's decision authorizing the City to build a recreational facility on a state-owned lake. The State contended, among other things, that the legislature did not authorize construction of a building of the size and character proposed, that the proposed building would serve a local rather than a state public purpose, and that the City should pay for the use of the lake bed. The court rejected the State's arguments and affirmed the circuit court's decision. 1931 Laws 301 clarified that the legislature's establishment of a dock line in 1927 granted the City authority to construct parks, playgrounds, bathing beaches, municipal boathouses, piers, wharves, public buildings, highways, streets, pleasure drives, and boulevards within the area between the subject lake's shore and the dock line. There was no conflict between the proposed building's purposes and the purposes authorized by the 1931 act, as the building was related enough to the use and enjoyment of the lake to be within the scope of the term &quot;public buildings&quot; authorized by the act. Further, the grant of revocable permission to use the lake property did not require the City to pay for the use.</SPAN></P>

The court opined that the employer had the burden to show that the truck was disabled pursuant to Wis. Stat. &sect; 85.19(8), and that its evidence was inconclusive. Thus, the jury's finding that the employer's driver was negligent was proper. However, the court held that a new trial was required because the jury erred in absolving the truck driver from negligence as to both lookout and speed. Further, the special verdict should have inquired as to whether the truck driver was causally negligent as to management and control. Finally, Wis. Stat. &sect; 85.09(5)(d) was not unconstitutional as construed by the trial court, and the insurer's filing of form SR-21 with the Wisconsin Commissioner of Motor Vehicles was a conclusive admission against its interests. Thus, an exclusion in the employer's policy did not apply.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment of the trial court and remanded the matter for a new trial not inconsistent with the opinion.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Proposed intervenor milk co-operative sought review of a judgment of the Circuit Court for Dane County (Wisconsin) that was rendered in favor of respondent milk company and denied the co-operative intervenor status in the company's action against the State that challenged the constitutionality of Wis. Stat. &sect; 100.22, which attempted to impose relatively uniform prices for diary products throughout the state.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The co-operative represented 728 dairy farmers who sold milk, cream, or butterfat to the milk company. The co-operative also asserted that the company's attempt to have &sect; 100.22 declared unconstitutional was an attempt to lower prices in certain communities, which &quot;required&quot; the co-operative to intervene in the company's action against the State. The trial court denied the co-operative's action for intervention and the court affirmed. The court noted that Wis. Stat. &sect; 260.19 provided that persons who were not parties to an action and had such interests that required them to be parties for their protection could be ordered by the trial court to be brought into the action. The trial court found, and the court agreed, that while the co-operative had a general interest in the company's action, it was not a sufficient interest to entitle them to be made parties to the action. The court pointed out that the State's attorney general was charged with defending the constitutionality of the statute on behalf of all the people, including the co-operative's members, and held that it could not perceive how the co-operative's interests &quot;required&quot; that it be made a party.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment of the trial court. The court noted that the fact that the widow would receive less at her husband's death if he had disposed on his personal property in the form of a trust than she would have received under a will was not indicative of fraud on the widow. The court held that the trust was not testamentary simply because the testator reserved to himself during his lifetime the income therefrom and the right to revoke, amend, alter, or modify the trust instrument in whole or in part. The court noted that the reservation of such powers was permitted by Wis. Stat. &sect; 231.205. The court further noted that the donor did not retain the power to deal with the trust as he pleased; his control over the investments was limited to approval or disapproval of the trustee's recommendations. Finally, the court disagreed that holding this trust instrument a valid inter vivos trust was to open the door to fraud upon the widow. The court noted that in establishing the trust, the donor provided that his widow should receive the entire income from its assets, almost $ 12,000 yearly, and the right to invade the corpus should her needs require it.</SPAN></P>

According to the court, even if the circuit court had been deprived of jurisdiction over subject matter by the section, it had been held many times that the constitution was not thereby violated. The court saw no distinction between jurisdiction over subject matter and jurisdiction over the person. The court did not, however, agree with the judge that the issue was one of jurisdiction, but rather one of venue. In addition, the court noted that an express guaranty of equal protection of the laws was found only in the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States, but since early days had been read into the Wisconsin Constitution.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trailer-park owners asserted that the parking-permit fee was a constitutionally impermissible property tax. The city argued that the fee was a valid excise tax. The trial court held that the parking-permit fee was a property tax, and that a flat tax could not be levied upon trailers that differed in value. The trial court noted that under Wis. Const. art. VIII, &sect;1, that where a property tax was levied there could be no classification which interfered with the substantial uniformity of rate based upon value. The court reversed and remanded. The court held that the parking-permit fee was an excise tax. The court noted that the fee did not apply to unoccupied trailers kept in the city but used elsewhere, or held for sale. The court held that when the trailers' were occupied, the burdens of supplying municipal services were placed on the community. It was difficult to collect a property tax on the trailers because of their mobility, and because of the trailers' mobility it was proper to levy an excise tax upon them. The court held that &sect; 66.058(3) only required that the tax be reasonably fixed after consideration of cost, and that the figure not be arbitrary.</SPAN></P>

The court held the residents were not estopped from challenging the constitutionality of the one sentence of the ordinance. The court reasoned if the portion of the ordinance limiting the number of trailers was found to be unconstitutional, the remainder of the ordinance would still be workable. Further, the court held that although it recognized the general rule that the residents were not permitted to enjoy the benefits of an ordinance and escape its burdens by attacking the validity, an exception to that rule also existed. The court noted that the residents were permitted to attack a separate and severable provision of the ordinance, particularly if they received no benefits under that provision.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Before the court were several certified questions of law by the trial court , including whether it was unconstitutional to admit into evidence an alcohol-blood test made on defendant while he was unconscious, without his consent, and while he was not under arrest.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court concluded that an analysis of a party's bodily fluids against his will in a criminal case and explanatory testimony thereon by an analyst did not violate the party's privilege against self-incrimination within the meaning of Wis. Const. art. I, &sect; 8. Furthermore, the court concluded that the receipt into evidence, over defendant's timely objection, of the results of an alcohol-blood test made on blood taken from him while he was unconscious or semi-conscious, without his consent, and while he was not under arrest, violated the prohibition against unreasonable search and seizure contained in Wis. Const. art. I, &sect; 11. The court noted that defendant was not placed under arrest for more than a week after his blood was taken, which indicated that the result of the blood analysis supplied the probable cause. In addition, the court found that the admission of the test results into evidence would also violate U.S. Const. amend. XIV. As such, the court remanded the cause for further proceedings according to law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant claimed that Wis. Stat. &sect; 97.61(2) was unconstitutional. Affirming the trial court's judgment, the court held that defendant had failed to overcome the strong presumption of constitutionality of the statute by any proof. The court found that defendant failed to prove, as alleged, that food coloring was not harmful or deceptive. The court noted that there was no proof as to the kind or amount of artificial coloring added to the food at issue. The court determined that it could not take judicial notice of issues related to food coloring or food quality, which defendant claimed were matters of common knowledge. The court decided that the statute was constitutional because it did not establish clearly beyond a reasonable doubt that there was no basis for its enactment. The court concurred in the trial court's finding that coloring fruit could disguise and conceal damaged and unripe fruit. The court noted that the color of certain foods was an important factor in determining its quality.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant city appealed a decision from the Circuit Court for Milwaukee County (Wisconsin), which overruled its demurrers to plaintiff town's and cross-defendant town's complaint and denied the city permission to plead over in plaintiff's claim challenging the consolidation of the city with other towns. Cross-defendant school district appealed the decision sustaining the city's demurrer to its cross-complaint.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At issue was whether the first in time annexations of defendant towns by plaintiff were rendered ineffectual by the ordinances for consolidation by the city and one of the defendant towns. Under the established rule of priority the four annexations by plaintiff had precedence over the consolidation and were not disturbed thereby. The authority for consolidation was found in Wis. Stat. &sect; 66.02, for annexation in Wis. Stat. &sect; 62.07. The court found no legislative intent to give consolidations preferred status over annexation or incorporation. Thus, the court recognized and preserved the pre-existing rights obtained by plaintiff through the institution of annexation proceedings. However, the prior annexation proceeding did not render the consolidation wholly invalid. Thus, the consolidation with the town which had also passed an ordinance of consolidation with the city was valid. The court then considered the effect of the annexation proceedings on the school district and found that the consolidation did not operate to detach territory from the high-school district. The city could participate in a joint school district which included outside territory.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the order overruling the city's demurrers to the complaint challenging its consolidation. The order sustaining the city's demurrer to the cross complaint of the school district was reversed, with direction to enter a declaratory judgment that the boundaries of the high-school district were not changed by the consolidation.</SPAN></P>

Petitioner claimed that requiring petitioner to give evidence in public of its trade secrets, which petitioner was seeking to protect in its pending circuit court action, would destroy their value. Since an appeal from final judgment would come too late for effective redress, the court had jurisdiction over petitioner's request. The court found that Wis. Stat. &sect;&sect; 256.14 and 252.155, which required public trials, were not violated by the taking of testimony in camera since such requirement was subject to certain inherent powers of the court to limit the public nature of trials in certain respects where the administration of justice required it.

On the day before the two-year statute of limitations was to expire, the insurance company informed the guardian that he had not served the driver and owner of the truck that caused the injury.

The trial court denied the motion. The court affirmed holding that (1) although the attempt to serve the notice by placing it in the hands of a process server was not the equivalent of actual service and did not meet the requirements of &sect; 330.19(5), the insurance company could be estopped by its conduct from taking advantage of the failure to comply with the statute; (2) if the guardian gave control of handling and adjusting the claim to the insurance company, the company became the agent for the guardian; and (3) the guardian's reliance on the insurance company's assurances that no attorney was needed for the settlement could estop the insurance company from claiming the statutory defense.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Conceding that a prior decision was against them, plaintiffs contended that &sect; 330.19(5) should have been read in conjunction with Wis. Stat. &sect; 330.40 and that such reading when applied to the circumstances of the instant case compelled the conclusion that the service was timely. The court noted that since that prior decision, neither statute had been amended in any respect material to the issue in the present case. The prior decision had held that the provisions of &sect; 330.40 had reference only to the requirements of the law which limited the time for the commencement of an action and that the statute contained nothing which indicated that the legislature intended that by its provisions those of Wis. Stat. &sect; 330.19(5) were to be affected. That decision had further held that the provisions of &sect; 330.19(5) required more than that an action be commenced to excuse the failure to give notice; they required in plain language that if the failure were to be excused, the complaint had to be actually served within the two-year period. The court concluded that it was bound by the prior decision because to do otherwise would be to legislate by judicial action.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The injured party brought an action against the minor and an insurer. The injured party effected service on the minor but did not serve the guardian ad litem for the minor.

The minor later sought to dismiss the action because the injured party had failed to serve process on the guardian ad litem as required by Wis. Stat. &sect; 262.08(2). The trial court dismissed the action for failure to serve the guardian ad litem. The injured party asserted that service was not necessary because after reaching the age of majority the minor had ratified the appearance by the attorney in the case.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The accused claimed that trial courts were directed not to pass upon the constitutionality of statutes so he could not have had a trial within the meaning of Wis. Const. art. I, &sect; 7, unless he could test the law's constitutionality. Statutes were presumed to be constitutional and the exercise of the power to declare laws unconstitutional was to be avoided if possible. The inference that the accused drew from this language was the major premise upon which his argument was based. If the inference was faulty, then his argument would fail. The language did not justify an inference that a trial court could not pass upon the constitutionality of a statute. That question was presented to the district court and passed upon by it. Any error in holding the statute to be constitutional was judicial and not jurisdictional. The relator had an adequate remedy by appeal of any error is committed in the district court. If the relator were convicted in the district court and sentenced to imprisonment, he could test the statute's constitutionality by a writ of habeas corpus. Therefore, the circuit court was correct in quashing the application for the writ of prohibition and also the temporary order.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the town asserted that &sect; 66.03 did not apply to a situation in which a portion of a municipality was annexed to an already existing municipality. It also argued that the trial court erred in allowing the village an apportionment of its assets because the village was barred by laches, and that the trial court erred in its judgment because it included taxes and fees collected by the town after the date of annexation. The court held that &sect; 66.03(2) specifically provided for the application of &sect; 66.03 in every case of annexation, including those in which the annexation was to an already existing municipality. The division of assets and liabilities was not barred by laches because the town failed to show any unreasonable delay or prejudice to it.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant city sought review of an order of the Circuit Court for Waukesha County (Wisconsin), which gave judgment to respondent, a gravel pit owner, in the owner's action challenging the constitutionality of the city's zoning ordinance. The trial court found that the language of the ordinance did not establish sufficient guidelines with which to judge the owner's application for a permit to operate a gravel pit in an agricultural district.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city's zoning ordinance allowed a number of uses in an area zoned for agricultural use, including operation of a sand and gravel pit. However, such usage was subject to the approval of the city's board of supervisors. The owners, who operated their pit without a permit, challenged the constitutionality of the ordinance. On appeal, the court reversed because the ordinance was constitutional. The court held that the preamble of the act could be considered in determining the intent of the act. That preamble set out the purposes of the ordinance: to conserve land values, avoid congestion, and promote public health and safety. The ordinance's requirement that the board consider the location and plan of operation of a proposed use required the board to take the preamble considerations into account when making their decision. Therefore, the board did not have unlimited discretion. Provision for a public hearing did not give neighboring property owners the power to decide whether a particular use should be allowed. The ordinance's failure to require a permit for other uses did not render the classification for sand and gravel pits improper because the other uses were not identical.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In an action instituted by respondent county welfare director, appellant, a son of a recipient of old-age assistance, sought review of an order of the County Court of Eau Claire County (Wisconsin), which ordered the son to pay to the county welfare department the full amount required for the support and maintenance of his mother.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The son contended that if he was responsible for supporting his mother, then Wis. Stat. &sect; 49.22(1)(d) rendered the mother ineligible for old-age assistance. On appeal, the court held that there was no merit to the son's contention under circumstances where the son continued to contest orders requiring him to contribute to his mother's support. Because the son failed to prepare a bill of exceptions, the court was unable to review objections concerning a prior order. The court determined that the petition prepared by the district attorney was properly signed by the county welfare director because the information in the petition was obtained through the director's investigation. The fact that the mother's other children were not made parties to the proceeding did not deny the son equal protection of the laws because there was no indication that the other children were able to contribute to the mother's support. The court concluded that the order directing payment of $ 75 or such other sum as may be required to maintain the mother was so indefinite that it was void. The court further noted that only payments for less that full support could be made payable to the county welfare agency.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The joint committee developed a plan to reorganize the school district. Under the plan, a town and a village were annexed. The residents filed an action objecting to the joint committee's order.

The court affirmed, holding that the trial court did not err in determining that the joint committee had not exceeded its power. All members of the joint committee had jurisdiction on all phases of the plan under Wis. Stat. 40.03 (1953), and the joint committee was a de jure governmental unit. The right of the joint committee members to title to their office could be tested only in a quo warranto proceeding, so the court was precluded from considering the issue. The residents were not denied equal protection by the classification of areas in the school district. Wis. Stat. &sect; 40.807(2) was not arbitrary or discriminatory, and Wis. Stat. &sect; 40.809 (1953) was also constitutional. Because Wis. Stat. &sect; 40.303 (1951) was repealed and did not exist when the proceedings for the territory involved were instituted, the residents' contention that the joint committee did not comply with &sect; 40.303 was without merit.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The newspaper wrote an article about plaintiff, who often carried picket type signs in the city; his appearance in court on a disorderly conduct charge; and his promise not to carry the signs again. Plaintiff commenced a defamation action against the paper. The trial court found in favor of the newspaper, and plaintiff appealed. The court held that, while plaintiff claimed that a picture printed of him behind bars was defamatory, the fact that the picture portrayed plaintiff was asserted as the truth in his pleadings. The newspaper's statement that it was only on plaintiff's promise that he would not carry any more signs was not libelous because it was the truth; plaintiff was not under any court order to stop carrying the signs. A patrolman's statement that plaintiff's sign could cause a riot if it were read by people who did not know him did not insinuate that plaintiff was mentally incompetent. Other statements in the article were substantially true. Thus, the statements contained in the article were not libelous. If any of them were offensive, their truth was asserted in plaintiff's own pleading. Thus, the newspaper was not liable to plaintiff.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant city treasurer appealed an order from the Circuit Court, Milwaukee County, Wisconsin. The city treasurer challenged the validity and constitutionality of Wis. Stat. &sect; 38.25. Section 38.25 provided additional benefits to petitioner retired city teachers.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city treasurer argued that &sect; 38.25 was void because it granted extra compensation to public servants after their services were rendered and to public contractors after the contracts had been entered into in violation of Wis. Const. art. IV, &sect; 26. The term &quot;public officers,&quot; as used in &sect; 26, referred to officers paid out of the state's public treasury. No similar provision applied to county or city contracts. The court held that it was proper for city officials that had power to contract with employees to agree to cancel existing contracts and to provide for a compensation increase while employment contracts were in effect. The teachers and annuities qualifying under Wis. Stat. &sect; 38.25 were not the kind of servants or contracts covered by Wis. Const. art. IV, &sect; 26. The court held that expenditures authorized under Wis. Stat. &sect; 38.25 satisfied a moral obligation, which provided the necessary consideration. The expenditures were for a public, not private, purpose. Section 38.25 was intended to promote the state's educational interests. There was no constitutional requirement that compensation under &sect; 38.25 had to operate uniformly throughout the state. Section 38.25 was valid.</SPAN></P>

The firefighter commenced an action against the chief on the basis that the council did not have the power to enact the ordinance. The trial court found for the chief and the firefighter appealed. The court held that under Wis. Stat. &sect; 62.11(5) the common council had management and control over the city's public service. The rule and the ordinance bore a rational relationship to the maintenance of an efficient fire department because they insured that the members of the department would be at all times in physical condition to perform their duties as firemen if called upon to perform them. A fireman was subject to call for duty 24 hours a day and he was potentially on duty at all times during his off-hours. It might be an interference with the privacy of the members to deny them the right to spend their off time as they saw fit; but the right to work for the public was a privilege which might be granted on any conditions which the public agency might impose consistent with the law and public policy.</SPAN></P>

The court rejected the contention that the application of &sect; 72.15(9) violated public policy.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">By the demurrer respondent, state budget and accounting director, challenged the constitutionality of 1955 Wis. Laws ch. 144, which provided means whereby the state building commission, the University Board of Regents, and the Board of Regents of the State Community Colleges could construct and finance buildings for the use of the state and the validity of the action taken or proposed thereunder by the state agencies as asserted in the complaint.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent argued that 1955 Wis. Laws ch. 144 was unconstitutional because it allowed the state building commission and the governing bodies of the universities and the community colleges to assign or pledge to pay rentals, thereby loaning the credit of the state contrary to the state constitution. The court held that the provisions were not unconstitutional. The only purpose of Wis. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 3 was to prohibit the state from acting as a surety or guarantor of the collateral obligation of another party. Under the contracts in question, the results of the assignment and pledging were not to require the state to pay the obligations of the building corporations, but merely to require it to pay its rental obligations to the lenders rather than to the building corporations. The state neither undertook to pay nor did it become legally bound to pay any debts of the building corporations incurred by them for adding improvements to the properties involved. The assignment and pledging of the state's rental obligation did not create a state debt, and that by consenting to such arrangement the state did not loan its credit, contrary to the constitutional provision in question.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An automobile dealership entered into a franchise agreement with the automobile manufacturer that provided for termination at any time at the will of either party by 60 days' written notice. The franchisor sent the franchisee a notice to terminate, and the franchisee brought an action seeking to enjoin the termination. The lower court sustained the demurrer of the franchisor, and the franchisee sought review. On review, the court examined Wis. Stat. &sect; 218.01 (3)(a), in effect at the time of the termination. The court found that the statute was regulatory and did not lead to the conclusion that the legislature intended to prohibit unfair cancellation of sales contracts. The statute simply stated that a manufacturer who engaged in such a practice was subject to penalty under the prescribed administrative procedure. The court found no declaration of public policy in the statute. The court concluded that the franchisee could not resort to the penalty provisions of a regulatory statute to sustain an action in equity seeking to invalidate a term of a contract into which the franchisee entered voluntarily.</SPAN></P>

The bank commissioner argued that the Wisconsin Collection Agency Law, Wis.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The solicitors were independent contractors who were provided lists of delinquent accounts by a foreign collection agency. The collection agency also provided the solicitors with instruction sheets on how they were to work and how commissions would be paid, and it provided them with a solicitor's manual. The only control that the solicitors had over their work was as to the time and manner of traveling. The solicitors objected to the imposition of the licensing fee under &sect; 218.04 by the bank commissioner. The trial court found in favor of the solicitors, holding that if a person or corporation was engaged in interstate commerce, that fact of itself rendered such person or corporation immune from state regulation. The bank commissioner appealed, and the court reversed, holding that the trial court relied on discarded doctrine. The solicitors were sufficiently under the direction of the collection agency to show that their true relationship was one of principal and agent. Accordingly, the collection agency and its solicitors were subject to the provisions of &sect; 218.04. Section &sect; 218.04 was not under any condemnation arising from restrictions burdening interstate commerce.</SPAN></P>

The Circuit Court for Milwaukee County (Wisconsin) entered judgment for the authority.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In their complaint, the tenants contended that the authority's resolution violated rights as guaranteed by First Amendment of the United States Constitution and Wis. Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 3, 4. The authority argued that because the tenants possessed no vested right to continue to occupy their apartments, it was subject to no restrictions in choosing the persons it desired as tenants of its housing project. On appeal from the trial court's entry of judgment for the authority, the court found that the authority lacked the power to adopt the resolution. Specifically, the resolution, which impinged upon the tenants' First Amendment rights, could not be justified on the basis of combating a threat of danger to the successful operation of the public housing project, which could have resulted by tenants bent upon overthrowing the government. In fact, the authority failed to show any threat. Because the possible harm that resulted in suppressing the tenants' First Amendment freedoms outweighed any threatened evil posed by the occupation of the housing project by members of subversive organizations, the resolution, which was adopted pursuant to the Gwinn Amendment, was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

The prayer of the petition for the writ was that the school district's claim be allowed as filed. To comply would have required the court to substitute its judgment for that of the committee, required the court to exercise the discretion which was granted exclusively to the committee, and required the court to determine as an original proposition that the school district was entitled to more than it was allowed based on alleged discrimination. The court was powerless to grant the relief requested by the school district. The court did not pass upon the issue of whether the committee acted properly in disposing of the claims, but stated that the school district failed to show that it had been aggrieved by the committee's action.

An award of compensation was akin to a judgment, and the same reasoning applied. The claimant was not entitled to have her rights to compensation enlarged after the same were fixed by the award, at the expense of the city, and Wis.

The trial court ruled in defendant's favor and the State appealed, contending that the conviction was final when it was rendered, and therefore the State was within its authority to revoke defendant's license. On review the court noted that &sect; 85.08(25) seemed inconsistent with &sect; 85.08(25a), mandating the restoration of a defendant's license if said defendant's license is reversed. The court held that, while there seemed to be an inconsistency, it would the wrong interpretation of the statute to conclude that the conviction was not final until the appeal was rendered. The court analogized the finality of the conviction with the finality of other judgments, holding that the conviction was final when the trial court had exercised all the powers confided to it and had made an adjudication of guilt.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 180.847(1).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff sold goods to a retailer pursuant to an agreement requiring the sales of merchandise in Wisconsin at prices set by plaintiff so as to gain for plaintiff the benefit of the Wisconsin Fair Trade Act. Plaintiff contended defendant sold one of plaintiff's watches at a below list price in violation of the Act. On appeal, the court held that the trial court erred when it dismissed the case based on plaintiff's failure to obtain a certificate of authority to conduct business in the state. Plaintiff did not allege that it performed any act within the state and there was no allegation that the retailer or defendant was plaintiff's agent, so sales made by them did not constitute the transacting of business within the state by plaintiff. Therefore no certificate was necessary. The allegation that defendant sold a watch made by plaintiff for $ 55 of which defendant had notice that the minimum resale price was $ 71 established the wilful and knowing requirement for a violation of the Act. Dismissal was too harsh a penalty for plaintiff's failure to serve a copy of its appellate brief upon opposing counsel and its failure to include an appendix so a sanction of $ 25 was imposed.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 103.535 because there was no labor dispute between the store and the union or its members. The union's acts constituted a &quot;secondary boycott&quot; by exerting coercion on the retail store, even though the union's activities were directed against the manufacturer of stockings sold by the store and not against the store itself because the business of the retail store was adversely affected by the picketing. The picketing was a sanction on the store, which was merely a third party to the dispute between the union and the manufacturers.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants contended that the Commission exceeded its authority in scheduling hearings on its own motion. The court affirmed the judgment, finding that the requests for hearings were made by that applicant and the fact that the Commission's form of notice of hearing bore the notation that it was upon its own motion did not change the facts. Appellants next contended that Wis. Stat. &sect; 102.16(1) limited the Commission's right to modify an award to one year thereafter. The court found that appellants in writing agreed to eliminate the word &quot;compromise&quot; and to have their agreement with the applicant considered as a stipulation of fact. Because the word &quot;compromise&quot; was eliminated by act of the parties and the question of the extent of liability still remained undetermined, the court concluded that there was no final award on a compromise. Finally, the court determined that there was credible evidence, competent and material, to sustain the finding that as a result of his injury the applicant sustained permanent bodily disability equal to 40 percent of total permanent disability.</SPAN></P>

The employment agency contended that the Commission's decision was arbitrary and that the statute was invalid.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Commission denied the employment agency a license to operate on the grounds that existing agencies were sufficient to supply the needs of employers. The employment agency sought review and the trial court affirmed the decision. On review, the employment agency argued that such discretion in the Commission amounted to the power to prohibit rather than regulate business under the applicable statute. The court, after careful consideration of due process concerns regarding the regulation of business under various laws permitting state agencies to issue licenses, concluded that broad discretionary powers given to the Commission to regulate employment agencies based on the needs of the public did not amount to the power to issue arbitrary and capricious decisions. The court also concluded that the Commission's decision was supported by sufficient evidence in the record because an applicant did not have to show a dissatisfaction by the public with the service presently available, only that the Commission considered both the quality and the quantity of the service rendered and whether or not that would be improved by the grant of additional permits.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant property owner disputed an order of the Circuit Court for Milwaukee County (Wisconsin), which denied a motion for summary judgment with respect to condemnation proceedings for street improvement instituted by respondent City of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, under the provisions of the Kline Law, 1931 Wis. Laws 275. The issues included whether notice of the public hearing required by 1931 Wis. Laws 275, &sect; 5(3) had to be given to property owners.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The condemnation proceeding as to the owner's property had reached the point where a jury determination would be made. It was conceded that none of the affected owners received notice of the hearing. On appeal, the court held that the hearing under ch. 275, &sect; 5(3) was legislative in character not quasi-judicial. The only requirement was that the hearing be public, which meant open to the general public. The court did not believe that the legislature intended to require notice to property owners for a hearing at which the first tentative report of the board of assessment was to be considered. For one thing, it could not necessarily be determined at that stage who the interested owners were. The property owner's claim that such a construction rendered the Law unconstitutional had already been decided against him in a prior decision of the court approving a holding of the Illinois Supreme Court. After considering the title of the resolution adopted by the common council directing the institution of condemnation proceedings to acquire the land, the court held that the resolution was not fatally defective nor was the notice of lis pendens filed with the register of deeds insufficient.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court held that (1) the objective of the ordinance, to protect or preserve property values, was embraced within the term &quot;general welfare,&quot; (2) the village could validly exercise police power by enacting zoning ordinances with objectives of preserving property values, (3) the terms &quot;neighborhood&quot; and &quot;substantial&quot; in the statute were not impermissibly indefinite, (4) just because some discretion was accorded to the board to determine the limits of a neighborhood, as applied to a particular applicant's property, the ordinance was not rendered void, and (5) the ordinance constituted a valid exercise of the village's police power and its provisions were not too indefinite or ambiguous.</SPAN></P>

There had been publication of the ordinance, official and otherwise, in newspapers of general circulation in the respective communities affected by the consolidation consideration.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The bank submitted that the complaint was defective because it did not plead acceptance of its offer or that there was consideration for its promise of employment. The court found no problems along these lines with the formation of the contract but focused instead on Wis. Stat. &sect; 310.25, which established that the contract was contrary to public policy. The material part of that statute directed that when a corporation was named as executor of an estate, the nearest of kin who received any interest in the estate or the party receiving the largest amount from the estate was to name the attorney to represent the estate in all proceedings. In essence, the bank did not have the power to make the contract. The court went on to hold that the statute was not unconstitutional. While the statute gave different powers to and imposed different restrictions on different executors depending on whether they were individuals or corporations, the separate classification rested on a substantial difference in the practice of corporations on the one hand and individuals on the other, and such classification was not unreasonable or void for an illegal discrimination.</SPAN></P>

The Civil Court of Milwaukee County (Wisconsin) entered an award for the passenger and the transport company sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The passenger's negligence claim was based on the company's failure to equip the trolley bus windows with safety glass instead of plate glass. On review, the court held that the passenger failed to make out a case of negligence against the company because there was no evidence that it was customary for other carriers operating trackless trolley buses to equip them with windows made of safety glass. Although Wis. Stat. &sect; 85.063(1) (1951) provided that motor vehicles manufactured after January 1, 1936 and trackless trolleys manufactured after January 1, 1952 were to be equipped with safety glass, trackless trolley buses were specifically excluded from the definitions of &quot;vehicle&quot; and &quot;motor vehicle&quot; contained in Wis. Stat. &sect;&sect; 85.10(1)-(2) (1951). Because the trackless trolley bus in which the passenger was riding at the time of her injury was manufactured and placed into operation in 1936, Wis. Stat. &sect; 85.063(1) (1951) was clearly inapplicable. The statutory classification limiting the application of &sect; 85.063(1) to motor vehicles and excluding streetcars, railway cars, and trackless trolleys had a sound basis and thus was not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court determined that the circuit court had lacked jurisdiction over the case and that the union should have filed its application with the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) rather than the court. Although the union contended that the state had jurisdiction over the case under Wis. Stat. &sect; 111.06(1)(c), (2)(b), which were analogous to provisions of the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA), the court determined that the state had no jurisdiction over an unfair labor practices case because &sect; 10(a) of the NLRA, 29 U.S.C.S. app. &sect; 160(a), gave jurisdiction to the NLRA. Moreover, the employer's activities made it clear that the case involved an unfair labor practice, lying expressly within the scope of the NLRA giving jurisdiction to the NLRB.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of an order of the Circuit Court for Milwaukee County (Wisconsin), which found that respondent city could, under the Blighted Area Law, Wis. Stat. &sect; 66.43, acquire by eminent domain and assemble areas that were blighted for the purpose of redevelopment and could use its credit or expend tax funds in acquiring blighted areas incidental to redevelopment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant contended that the acquisition of land under the Law was not for such public use as was contemplated by Wis. Const. art. I, &sect; 13. The court disagreed, finding that the program was for a public use, not only with respect to the elimination of the blighted condition, but also with respect to efforts in preventing recurrence. The controlling motive was the safeguarding of the public's health, safety, and welfare. That the property could be in public use or ownership for a short duration of time was not consequential. The city could acquire and assemble areas to carry out the purposes of the statute and could contract with respect to property acquired under authority of it and lease or sell such property to private persons or redevelopment corporations. The city could validly lend its credit for the purposes and uses authorized by Wis. Stat. &sect; 66.43. The legislature properly left to the city the administration of the program because the conditions and standards were definite, adequate, and reasonable. Finally, the failure of the Law to provide notice of hearing or opportunity to appeal from the city's determinations did not constitute a denial of due process of law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant building inspector appealed from orders and a judgment of the Circuit Court for Milwaukee County (Wisconsin), which issued a writ of mandamus to compel the inspector to issue a building permit for the erection of respondent conference's private high school after the inspector refused to do so based on an ordinance that prohibited private high schools in certain areas.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city passed an ordinance pursuant to Wis. Stat. &sect; 62.23 that allowed public schools and private elementary schools in certain residence districts, but did not allow private high schools. The inspector refused to issue a building permit to the conference because the conference planned to build a private high school within a residence district. The conference claimed that the ordinance was unconstitutionally discriminatory. The court rejected those claims, found the ordinance made a valid distinction, and upheld the inspector's refusal to issue a permit. The distinction to allow public high schools, but to not allow private high schools, in residence districts promoted the general welfare of the community. A public school was open to all that lived in the district and wanted to go there. A private school was not open to the community as a whole and excluded certain people. Thus, it did not provide the same benefit to the community as a public school. The court could not say that such a distinction was arbitrary or unreasonable, and found that such distinction bore a fair, substantial, reasonable, and just relation to the promotion of the general welfare of the community.</SPAN></P>

The attorney general, on behalf of the Director, based his contention of unconstitutionality solely on the grounds that a refund of such registration fees violated the prohibition against use of public funds for a private purpose.The court found, however, that a legislative act providing for a refund of taxes was valid if there existed a moral obligation to support it. The legislature had declared that the registration tax was passed as a result of inadvertence. The court concluded, therefore, that a moral obligation existed, based upon the mistake of the legislature in inadvertently deleting the long-prior-existing exemption extended to small trailers not used for hire, and that such moral obligation justified the making of the exception. Consequently, the court held that &sect; 20.492 was constitutional and valid, and that the making of such refund did not constitute an appropriation of public funds for a private purpose.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">With respect to the State's claim that the inheritance tax was due upon the transfer of property through the testator's will at the time of death, the trial court found in favor of the executors, who argued that the will should have been probated due to a will contest. The court reversed the judgment and held that Wis. Stat. &sect; 72.01(1), which imposed the inheritance tax, placed it upon any transfer of property by will or intestacy from any person dying possessed of the property while a resident of the state. The tax was on the transfer of the property at the time of the death of the testator. While Wis. Stat. &sect; 318.31 provided for a compromise agreement of a will by the will contestants, the computation of the inheritance tax had to have been made upon the entire legacy the moment it was transferred in its entirety to the legatee inasmuch as there had to have been a transfer of the entire legacy from the testator to the legatee before the whole or any part of it was yielded up. The court concluded that the transfer to have been taxed was the transfer made by the will, and the attorneys' fees of the contestants of the will were not deductible as expenses of administration.</SPAN></P>

The funds in question had not been added to or subtracted from for over 20 years by the corporations and the bondholders' protective committee that had deposited the funds and therefore the funds were presumed to have been abandoned under Wis.

Stat. &sect; 220.25 was construed to escheat trust funds, not withstanding the trustee's protest, the beneficiaries' constitutional right to due process would be violated. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court found the statute specifically mentioned trust companies and that the trust company's protest did not rebut the presumption of abandonment. The court found that no owner was deprived of due process given that the law allowed the rightful owner to file suit after the property escheated to the state in order to prove ownership and thereby regain the funds.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The town board enacted an ordinance that required a permit to operate a stone quarry in an agricultural district.

Although there was a large commercial rock quarry in operation in an industrial area in the town, the ordinance did not apply to the quarry, nor did it apply to the operation of sand pits, gravel pits, clay beds, or to the recovery and sale of any other mineral. The court held that the ordinance was void because the classification made therein was improper, in that it was not based upon substantial distinctions that made operations of stone quarries in an agricultural district really different from other mining operations within the agricultural district, nor from those in an industrial district.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff Wisconsin resident brought an action for declaratory judgment in the name of the State of Wisconsin against defendant Wisconsin Secretary of State, seeking a determination that 1953 Wis. Laws ch. 550 was unconstitutional in so far as it changed the apportionment of Brown County, Wisconsin, because it was a second redistricting and apportionment within the same federal census period in violation of Wis. Const. art. IV, &sect; 3.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following the United States census of 1950, the Wisconsin legislature enacted 1951 Wis. Laws ch. 728 (Rosenberry Act), apportioning and districting Brown County. After the city government of Green Bay, Wisconsin, changed its ward boundaries and created new wards, the legislature enacted 1953 Wis. Laws ch. 550 to correct errors in apportionments in six counties. The court held that 1953 Wis. Laws ch. 550, in its application to Brown County, was an apportionment of the county's assembly districts for the second time since the United States census of 1950 and was void as a violation of Wis. Const. art. IV, &sect; 3, which provided that after each federal enumeration, the legislature was to apportion and district anew the members of the senate and assembly. The passage of the Rosenberry Act exercised and exhausted the power of the legislature to redistrict during the interval after the 1950 census except in the cases of districts whose boundaries did not observe the constitutional mandate. The Secretary's contention that the 1953 legislature retained power to redistrict areas already districted in conformity to the constitution by the Rosenberry Act could not be sustained.</SPAN></P>

Const. art. XI, &sect; 3. In affirming the judgment, the court found that all of the property to be included in the new district would benefit by the establishment of the proposed storm-sewer district. The statutes under which the town board acted were constitutional and the town board proceeded in accordance with the provision of the law and within its jurisdiction. There was no valid claim that the town sanitary district was created for the purpose of evading the constitutionally imposed debt limit. Therefore, when the power to create town districts and the power to borrow money and issue municipal obligations was used in strict conformity with legislative standards prescribed in the statutes, there could be no unconstitutional delegation of power. None of the previously organized districts had exercised the power of installing storm-water sewers. There was, then, no actual conflict between any previously created district and the new, town-wide district.</SPAN></P>

He took two two-year leaves of absence to serve as the undersheriff. The former sheriff was then elected sheriff, a non-civil service position. The former sheriff argued that he was still covered by the civil service system. The court held because Racine, Wis. Ordinances &sect; 8(e) provided for the granting of temporary leaves of absence to a deputy sheriff upon request, the only way a deputy could maintain his civil-service status during a period when he served in a non-civil-service position was by applying for and receiving such leave. The former sheriff made no application for leave for the period during which he was to be sheriff. To construe Wis. Stat. &sect; 59.21(1) as granting civil-service rights to one who chose to abandon them would render it unconstitutional as effecting a legislative appointment. The former sheriff acquired civil-service status in the office of deputy sheriff in conformity with the ordinance; but in failing to maintain that status, he lost it and was in no different position than one who never had it.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The motor carriers argued that because the ton-mile tax was imposed as partial compensation for the maintenance, repair, and construction of the public highways of the state, the commodity exemption contained in Wis. Stat. &sect; 194.47(5) contravened the legislative purpose and resulted in an arbitrary and unreasonable classification and a denial of the equal protection of the laws. The court reversed the judgment, explaining that proper and reasonable discrimination between classes for taxation purposes in order to promote fair competitive conditions and to equalize economic advantages was lawful. The court noted that a state did not deny the equal protection of the laws merely by adjusting its revenue laws and taxing system in such a way as to favor certain industries or forms of industry. The court found that the commodity exemption was based on a finding that it would have been of direct economic benefit to the agricultural population and, as a result, to the citizens of the state as a whole. The court opined that Wis. Stat. &sect;&sect; 194.47 to 194.49 (1951) as applied to the operation of motor carriers' vehicles were not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employer/carrier moved for a rehearing in a workers' compensation case relating to compensation for the loss of an employee's hearing occasioned by industrial noise. Two issues of constitutionality were raised for the first time in the briefs submitted to the court. The court noted that questions involving the constitutionality of a provision of the Workmen's Compensation Act not previously raised could not be considered when urged for the first time on appeal. The court noted that a loss of hearing due to occupational disease was no longer a scheduled injury, but, if occasioned by accident or sudden trauma, it was. Before the amendment to Wis. Stat. &sect; 102.52, regarding loss of hearing, there was no distinction made by the legislature between loss of hearing due to industrial noise and that due to trauma. Therefore, a hearing loss incurred prior to the amendment was covered by the schedule established for compensable disability, regardless of the cause of the hearing loss.

Its terms disclosed an intent and purpose to make it possible to reengage teachers who had left the service and to induce them to hold themselves available for reemployment, thereby giving to the public the benefit of their experience and supplying a source to draw upon in a period when there existed an alarming shortage of qualified persons.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The police officer was disciplined pursuant to a resolution passed by the common council. The police officer sought to enjoin enforcement of the resolution, arguing that it deprived him of equal protection and due process and that it was a bill of attainder. On appeal of the trial court's denial of the police officer's request, the court ruled that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to issue the injunction. The court held that the resolution was not void as an unconstitutional interference by the common council with the functions of another branch of city government. There was also no violation of the officer's due process or equal protection rights because the resolution only directed the chief of police to set the statutory program in motion. Because the officer had not acquired immunity, requiring him to account for his actions did not deprive him of any guaranteed rights. Finally, the trial court did not err in determining that there was no issue of material fact to be tried. A court could not investigate the motives of those who enacted legislation. There was no error in refusing to declare the resolution null and void.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The homeowners filed an action against the county for damage caused by the county's failure to maintain an drainage easement as required by the grant of easement. The homeowners also alleged that the county was guilty of actionable negligence, because the county's efforts at snow removal obstructed the flow of water through the ditch. On appeal, the court held that the provision in the grant of easement was invalid and unenforceable because the county could not expend public money for the private purpose of maintaining the easement on the homeowner's property; any attempt to do so would be unconstitutional. Regarding the county's liability under the theory of negligence, the court held that the county was not liable for the obstruction of the natural flow of surface waters in connection with highway improvement. The court also found that the county was not liable under Wis. Stat. &sect; 88.38 because the effect of the ditch initially was to cause the surface waters to flow in a different direction. The court denied the homeowners' motion to dismiss because it found that the county board had ratified the appeal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The county took three tax deeds upon tax sale certificates it issued to the taxpayer. At the time the certificates were issued, the statutes afforded a minor owner, such as the taxpayer, the right to redeem at any time during his minority and within one year thereafter. On appeal, the issue was whether the taxpayer's right of redemption was covered by the statutes as they existed at the time of the issuance of the certificates or by the statutes as subsequently changed and amended. The court held that because 1939 Wis. Laws ch. 453 contained no expression of legislative intent that it was retrospective, it was prospective only in effect so as not to affect the then existing redemption rights of minor owners. The fact that the county held tax deeds instead of tax sale certificates did not bar the taxpayer from redeeming within one year after becoming of age. The limitation imposed by Wis. Stat. &sect; 75.27, as amended in 1949, had no application to the taxpayer's cause of action because of the provision in Wis. Stat. &sect; 75.28(1), as amended, that the limitation did not apply where the land had been redeemed.</SPAN></P>

VIII, &sect; 10 regarding acquiring, developing, and preserving forests. The court issued the requested writ, concluding that the statutes did not provide that the funds be used for forestry purposes or for any other particular purpose. The court also reasoned that contributions went into the towns and the counties' treasuries and were used as the respective governing bodies saw fit. The court further determined that the judicial branch could not interfere wit the legislature's decision to issue the appropriation that the voucher represented, that the taxes to fund the appropriation were levied and collected for that purpose, and that the director was obliged to audit and to approve the payment. The contributions were designed to compensate the counties and the towns for the loss of the tax base that the forests represented and there was no evidence that the contributions were not for a public purpose.</SPAN></P>

The petition of the state of Wisconsin prays for (1) a peremptory writ of mandamus commanding respondent E. C.

In granting the writ and declaring ch. 186 valid, the court held Wis. Stat. &sect; 15.96 had not unconstitutionally delegated legislative powers to the Commission because its authority had not gone beyond fact finding and into legislative policy making. The court also held the turnpike corporation, which was to be formed under ch. 186, Laws of 1953, would not be an agency or instrumentality of the state even though its end result would be the construction of highways to which the state had title. Moreover, the court held ch. 186 provided the machinery for establishing a number of turnpike corporations, and it was therefore not violative of Wis. Const. art. IV, &sect; 31's prohibition against special or private laws. Finally, the court held ch. 186, Laws of 1953, had not created an unconstitutional state loan to a corporation, violated due process, or permitted condemnation of excess lands.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city passed an ordinance to require the installation of a bathtub or shower in certain apartments.

The court stated that the ordinance was not based upon a substantial distinction which made one class really different from another or which bears reasonably upon the object to be sought.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged an order from the Circuit Court for Dane County (Wisconsin), which found him guilty of disorderly conduct in violation of Stoughton, Wis., Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court's finding that defendant was guilty of disorderly conduct, holding that the trial court's refusal to instruct the jury on self-defense was prejudicial error. Self-defense was a proper subject for instruction because the issue was raised by the evidence offered by defendant. In order to answer the question submitted in the verdict, the jury had to decide if defendant acted in self-defense; thus, he was entitled to an instruction on that issue. However, the court concluded that the prohibition against fighting in the city ordinance was not so vague as to be unconstitutional. The common and ordinary meaning of the word &quot;fighting&quot; was sufficiently definite so as to be understood with reasonable certainty by persons of ordinary intelligence. The City did not unlawfully enlarge upon the definition of &quot;disorderly conduct&quot; in Wis. Stat. &sect; 348.35, nor did the prohibition against fighting create a crime. The ordinance provided for a forfeiture, and only upon failure to pay was defendant liable to imprisonment. The complainant, a private citizen, was a proper party to make an affidavit for a warrant on behalf of the City under Wis. Stat. &sect; 301.10(4).</SPAN></P>

Defendant, the Wisconsin Secretary of State, counterclaimed that the Act violated U.S. Const. art. IV, &sect; 4 and also contended that area recognition deprived citizens of the equal protection of the laws contrary to the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant submitted that the Act violated U.S. Const. art. IV, &sect; 4 by denying to Wisconsin a republican form of government. Defendant also contended that area recognition, and particularly the recognition given by the Act, deprived citizens of the equal protection of the laws. The court concluded that a separate submission was required of the amendment changing the boundary lines of assembly districts. The court considered that a constitutional change in the individuals to be counted was not a detail of a main purpose to consider area in senate districts but was a separate matter, which had to be submitted as a separate amendment. The court held that there had been no valid submission to or ratification by the people of the proposed amendment and therefore the Act, which relied on the amendment for its own constitutionality, was declared unconstitutional and void. Plaintiff's complaint had to be dismissed and the declaratory judgment, which he sought, denied. The invalid Act did not repeal or supercede the Rosenberry act and the latter remained the law under which the Secretary was required to issue the call for elections until replaced by some other valid apportionment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant taxpayers brought an action against respondent city, claiming that their tractors were exempt from taxation under Wis. Stat. &sect; 70.111(9). The city filed a demurrer to their complaint.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayers alleged that it was the legislative purpose to encourage dealers to carry large stocks of farm equipment and that the exemption of Wis. Stat. &sect; 70.111(9) was intended to aid this purpose. They also alleged that local assessors had generally regarded tractors as exempt. The taxpayers contended that their tractors, which fell within the description of a power-drawn machine, were exempt. The court upheld the order of the trial court, which sustained the demurrer. The language of &sect; 70.111(9) did not suggest that the legislature meant to exempt the pulling power, either animal or mechanical, in addition to the object being drawn. Otherwise, the statute would not have used the descriptive words &quot;horse or power drawn.&quot; Because the legislature put the mechanical power plant on a parity with the horse in its description of the exempt machinery, the only meaning the court could reasonably give to the statutory language was to say that the legislature intended to limit the exemption to machinery that had no power of its own but that was moved by an independent force. The court added that such distinction between groups of farm machinery was not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

The trial court's sentence was outside its discretion and the sentence so pronounced was not merely error but was void. Contrary to defendant's argument, the court's order of remand requiring the trial court to sentence defendant with the penalty provided by statute did not violate defendant's constitutional rights under Wis. Const. art. I, &sect; 8. Where defendant's sentence was void and could not stand, the imposition of the correct sentence under the authority of Wis. Stat. &sect; 251.17 was not unconstitutional as subjecting defendant to being twice put in jeopardy for the same offense. Resentencing did not put defendant in jeopardy twice, nor did it constitute a second punishment for the same offense.</SPAN></P>

The presiding judge mistakenly concluding that his order extending the time for settling the bill of exceptions was erroneous and void.

Respondent first argued that aspirin, milk of magnesia and camphorated oil were proprietary medicines, the sale of which was not regulated by the statute. The court ruled, however, that the substances were not proprietary medicines within the meaning of the statutes. Respondent then argued that Wis. Stat. &sect; 151.06(1), which defined a drug as an article listed in certain publications intended for use in the diagnosis and treatment of disease, violated the Wisconsin Constitution as an unlawful delegation of legislative authority to private organizations to compile the publications. The court ruled that the statute was not unconstitutional. This case did not involve the delegation of legislative powers. The publications referred to were not produced in response to any delegation of power, legislative or otherwise, by the statute, but were published independently of the statute and not in response to it.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 85.09(5). The action against defendant was dismissed on the ground that &sect; 85.09(5) was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After being involved in an accident, defendant's license was suspended without a hearing when he failed to post a security under &sect; 85.09(5). When defendant refused to surrender his license, he was charged with a misdemeanor. Defendant moved to dismiss the charge, claiming that &sect; 85.09(5) was unconstitutional because it took away a privilege and a right given to a particular person without due process of law. The trial court dismissed the charge. The State appealed. In reversing, the court held that defendant, as the party challenging the constitutionality of a law, had the burden of proving that &sect; 85.09(5) was unconstitutional, which he wholly failed to prove. The court further held that driving a car upon public highways was a privilege and not a property right; thus, it was subject to reasonable regulation under the State's police power in the interest of public safety and welfare. Accordingly, &sect; 85.09(5) was not unconstitutional and did not deny defendant his right to due process because the suspension of the license of a driver for failure to post security was reasonably justified by a compelling public interest of protecting the public from financially irresponsible drivers.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state administered a fund under Wis.

The minority applied for life insurance, and the commissioner brought suit alleging that he was permitted to deny the application on the basis that members of the minority's race had a higher mortality rate than other races and thus were uninsurable. The commissioner offered no proof in support of his inference that the higher mortality rate among persons of the minority's race was the result of some inherent difference between them and other races. The trial court ruled that Wis. Stat. &sect; 210.05 did not prevent the commissioner from insuring persons of the minority's race. The court held that when state law required the commissioner to grant a life insurance policy to state residents, he was required to treat all applicants alike. He was not authorized under his rule-making powers to exclude all persons of the minority's race without absolute proof that their length of life was shortened solely because of their color or race. The commissioner failed to show that the racial classification was the only one that would achieve the purposes of &sect; 210.05.</SPAN></P>

The court noted that this was not a case where the verdict had been reported erroneously. The court then reviewed, pursuant to Wis. Stat. &sect; 274.12(2), and rejected, defendants' claims of error. First the court held that the absence of some of the defendants when the verdict was received was not a source of prejudice or violative of their rights, because they were away from court of their own free will. Next the court held that though the complaint and information were not couched in the language of Wis.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner attorney general filed a petition for a peremptory writ of mandamus. Before the court was the constitutionality of Wis.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The attorney general argued that &sect; 42.535 was not forbidden by the state constitution because the benefits it provided were merely restoration or preservation of economic value of the compensation already granted. He also claimed that the additional benefits did not need to be regarded as compensation at all and were not payments made upon any contract. The court held that the effect of &sect; 42.535 was to grant extra compensation to public servants after the services were rendered and to public contractors after the contracts were entered into, in violation of Wis. Const. art. IV, &sect; 26. The teachers' contracts for retirement benefits were contracts with the State, and the compensation provided therein could not thereafter be increased by the legislature when the teaching was over. The court found it unnecessary to its decision to determine whether there was unconstitutional discrimination in limiting Wis. Stat. &sect; 42.535's benefits to those teachers who had retired before June 30, 1951, and who, on that date, were either actually receiving retirement benefits or had applied for them. The court concluded that &sect; 42.535 was void because it conflicted with Wis. Const. art. IV, &sect; 26.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the words &quot;maintain&quot; and &quot;maintained&quot; as used in Wis.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, the owner of an equitable interest in real property, appealed a judgment of the Circuit Court for Milwaukee County (Wisconsin) in favor of defendant Town of Greenfield. The dispute involved the application and validity of a municipal ordinance that was passed into law after the owner had acquired his equitable interest.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The ordinance in effect when the owner acquired his equitable interest permitted automobile trailers and house cars to be kept immediately adjacent to dwellings, with only one such item per realty unit. The owner put a house trailer adjacent to the house on the subject realty. Thereafter, the Town passed a new ordinance that prohibited trailers, except for those in licensed trailer camps and those for display or sale. On appeal, the court noted that, generally, a nonconforming use existing at the time that a zoning ordinance went into effect could not be prohibited or restricted by statute or ordinance if it were a lawful business or use of property and was not a public nuisance or harmful in any way to the public's health, safety, morals, or welfare. The court held that, because the ordinance had been adopted after the owner's acquisition of the trailer, the ordinance could only be applied prospectively. The owner had a vested right to continue to use his trailer on his own realty for private dwelling purposes. Had the court not construed the ordinance as prospective, it would have been required to find that the ordinance was unconstitutional as applied to the owner.</SPAN></P>

Therefore, the court held that the matter had to be remanded to the Commission to make findings on the question of the possible violation of such public rights by the construction of the proposed dam.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The amicus curiae filed a brief on behalf of dairy farmers, alleging that allowing the sale of a product containing dairy, but not ice cream or sherbet, would be disadvantageous to farmers because it would decrease the demand for their dairy production. The court noted, as an initial matter, that the sale of a product that would be available to people who, for whatever reason, did not or could not enjoy ice cream might actually increase the demand for dairy products. Further, the court held that, while it might be disadvantageous to the dairy industry to allow the product, because the product was stipulated to not be deleterious to health, to regulate it on the basis of its effect on the dairy farmers would not be a valid use of the State's police powers. The court reasoned that a state regulation could not be allowed to stand if it elevated one industry over another without a consideration of the primary purpose of legislative acts, to relieve citizens against oppressive acts where the primary purpose is not the protection of the public health, safety, or morals.</SPAN></P>

The notice required by Wis.

The court held that the procedure provided for by Wis. Stat. &sect; 75.521 and the notice required by &sect; 75.521(3)(c) met constitutional requirements for due process of law. In proceedings for the levy and collection of taxes, due process requirements did not mandate that notice and hearing were legally essential for the validity of judicial tribunals' proceedings and judgments.

The trial court determined that the wife's administrator took the wife's personal property and the heirs at law her realty. On appeal, the court affirmed. No estate, in trust or otherwise, passed to the slayer upon the death of the slain. The court found no merit in the contention that it was unconstitutional to prevent the acquisition by a murderer of property which he claimed to have acquired as a result of his crime. Because the husband could not deprive the wife of her right to hold as joint tenant by his illegal act, the right remained in existence and became operative when the husband died. Though the wife died, under these circumstances her status as joint tenant continued in her administrator and heirs at law; and when her husband died and his life interest in the property ended, her joint tenancy became her estate of inheritance in the entire property. There was thus nothing for the husband's administrator and his heirs at law to take.</SPAN></P>

The court denied the request of petitioners and held that respondents' failure to apportion upon the effective date stated in the statute did not invalid the statute. The court analyzed the plain intent of the statute and determined that the provisions enabled a new apportionment at the earliest practicable period and that the power of the legislature to apportion was continuing and did not lapse if not exercised by respondents at the first general session of the legislature. The court found that the duty or apportionment was a continuing one and, if it was not discharged at or within the time prescribed, the duty rested upon succeeding general assemblies.The court stated that upholding the validity of the act was more likely to result in attainment of the constitutional objective of an apportionment based on the 1950 census as intended than if the court invalidated the statute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant taxpayers, in disputes with respondent Department of Taxation, complained of judgments of the Circuit Court for Milwaukee County (Wisconsin), which held that they were not entitled, under the provisions of Wis. Stat. &sect; 71.04(4), to deduct from the gross income reported by them in their individual income-tax returns dividends received from an investment company.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayers looked to the doctrine that intangibles might be taxed at their business situs, as distinguished from the legal domicile of their owner, to support their claim to deduct the investment company dividends from their gross income. The taxpayers argued that the entire income of the investment company, whose sole business was that of an investment company, arose from various types of transactions dealing in securities, so that the use of those securities by the corporation in its business might be said to have been localized in Wisconsin, with the result that such securities had a business situs in the state where such business was carried on. The court found, however, that Wis. Stat. &sect; 71.02(3)(e), which had ascribed a business or commercial domicile in Wisconsin to a foreign corporation that transacted its principal business in this state, was absolutely void ab initio and, by its repeal as unconstitutional, the legislature had accepted that interpretation. The court, therefore, was foreclosed from taking a position that sec. 71.02(3)(e) might be construed to be valid as to one fact situation and invalid as to another.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owner challenged the county's enforcement of its zoning ordinance that banned his proposed commercial use of the land. The trial court found for the county and the court affirmed. The court held that the ordinance was not invalid because under Wis. Stat. &sect; 327.04 the passage of three years after the time a zoning pamphlet was published made the pamphlet prima facie evidence of the zoning law. The property owner's evidence that the county clerk did not have the zoning map was insufficient to show that the law was not validly enacted. There was evidence of the town's approval of the ordinance to support its validity and a proper public hearing had been held. The town had no power to withdraw from the county's zoning ordinance once it had passed the law. The regulation of property for the health, safety, and welfare of the public through zoning was a proper exercise of the county's police power and state statutes established such power of the county. The claim that the property owner was entitled to continue his grantor's prior nonconforming use failed because there was no such prior nonconforming use.</SPAN></P>

IV, &sect; 26 and was void insofar as it affected the compensation of 12 government officials, including the director and state highway, industrial, and public service commissioners.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The provisions of 1951 Wis. Laws ch. 97 increased the compensation of the director, the state auditor, the director of the department of securities, and members of the state highway commission, industrial commission, employment relations board, and the public service commission on and after May 1, 1951. Relator contended that the Legislature was improperly motivated in passing the act. The court held that none of the provisions of 1951 Wis. Laws ch. 97 violated the constitutional prohibition of Wis. Const. art. IV, &sect; 26 against increasing the compensation of any public officer during his term because the existing terms of the officers involved expired on the effective date of the act, May 1, 1951, and the offices thereupon became vacant. Then, new terms were created and new appointments were provided for and the salaries were changed by the Legislature before the new appointments were made. Although the citizen sought to have the court investigate the motives of the legislature in passing the act, the court held that such judicial inquiry into the motives of the Legislature was improper.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent, a foreign corporation, brought an action against appellant, the Wisconsin Department of Taxation (Department) based on the Wisconsin privilege dividend tax law, Wis.

The Department appealed from a judgment of the circuit court (Wisconsin), which found that certain expense of withholding tax would not have exceeded the amount of the privilege dividend tax so paid by the corporation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The foreign corporation was licensed to operate in Wisconsin, and did business in Wisconsin and in many other states. The issue on appeal was whether privilege dividend taxes, paid by a corporation from corporate funds of the corporation and not withheld from stockholders, were deductible by the corporation as an ordinary and necessary business expense in the computation of its state income tax. The board of tax appeals found, among other things, that the certain expense of withholding the privilege dividend tax from dividend checks would not have exceeded the amount of the privilege dividend tax so paid, and that the certain and uncertain expense of withholding the tax would have exceeded the privilege dividend tax so paid. The circuit court reversed the finding that the certain expense of withholding the tax would not have exceeded the amount of the privilege dividend tax so paid and affirmed the other findings of the board. On appeal, the court held that a corporation paying a dividend tax from its own funds could not treat the tax as an ordinary and necessary expense in computing its income tax.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Section 60.29(18m) provided that any town that failed to establish a fire department of its own or contract with another for fire protection was liable for the services of any fire department in fighting a fire in the town. The town asserted that the statute was an unconstitutional delegation of legislative powers and functions to private persons. The trial court sustained the town's demurrer to the claim by the fire department for services rendered. The court held that the statute was constitutional. The court explained that because fire was an emergency, it was ridiculous to say that only a proper legislative or governing body could exercise the discretion necessary to determine whether the services of a fire department were required in a given circumstance. The court stated that a private citizen could make this determination. The court also held that the statute did not compel the expenditure of public funds for private purposes because the law fell within the general police power.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The objector sued defendants, challenging the city's payment to a worker for work performed, and the trial court granted defendant's motion for summary judgment. After the court reversed the summary judgment order, Wis. Stat. &sect; 66.295 (1949) was amended and made retroactive to allow cities to pay for public improvements that were done in good faith by workers who had no legally enforceable claim. The city council then passed a resolution to pay the worker, and defendants filed an answer setting forth &sect; 66.295 (1949) as a defense. The trial court denied the objector's demurrer. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that because the objector's suit involved the enforcement of a public right and not the objector's private rights, the legislature had the power to annul the court's judgment. Thus, the retroactive provisions of &sect; 66.295 (1949) did not violate the objector's due process rights under U.S. Const. amend. XIV. Because the council's resolution was passed after the court's initial judgment reversing the order granting summary judgment, the judgment reversing the summary judgment was not res judicata.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, a humane officer and a humane society, appealed a judgment and order from a trial court (Wisconsin), in favor of plaintiff regents of a state university, on the university's suit to find that Wis. Stat. &sect; 174.13(2) (1949) applied to defendants. Defendants alleged that Wis. Stat. &sect; 174.10, referred to in Wis. Stat. &sect; 174.13(2) (1949) was vague and that the &sect; 174.13(2) (1949) was a taking under Wis. Const. art. I, &sect; 13.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A university sued a private humane society and its humane officer to have the society give its stray dogs to the university for research as required by Wis. Stat. &sect; 174.13(2) (1949). The trial court entered judgment for the university. On appeal, the court affirmed and held as follows: Wis. Stat. &sect; 174.10, which was referred to in Wis. Stat. &sect; 174.13(2) (1949), adequately and clearly defined unclaimed or unredeemed dogs. Thus, Wis. Stat. &sect; 174.10 was not void for vagueness. Wis. Stat. &sect; 174.13(2) (1949) referred to any humane officer and Wis. Stat. &sect; 174.13(5) (1951) expressly imposed a penalty on any humane society that did not comply with Wis. Stat. &sect; 174.13(2) (1949). Thus, &sect; 174.13(2) (1949) applied to both defendants. Because the society did not obtain any property rights in stray dogs merely by taking custody of the dogs, U.S. Const. amend. XIV does not protect the society in keeping dogs that did not belong to it, and Wis. Stat. &sect; 174.13(2) (1949) was not an uncompensated taking under Wis. Const. art. I, &sect; 13. Because the capture and impounding of stray dogs is important for the public welfare, Wis. Stat. &sect; 174.13 is a valid exercise in the state's police power.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, defendant claimed that he was entitled to a mistrial because he was prejudiced by the grand jury's failure to maintain the secrecy of its proceedings where two special investigators assisting the prosecutor were allowed in the grand jury room during grand jury sessions. Additionally, he claimed that the prosecutor erred in commenting in the jury's presence that the grand jury had indicted defendant. In affirming, the court held that the secrecy of grand jury proceedings was for the benefit of the jurors and the public, and not defendant. Furthermore, the two investigators were never present during deliberations of the jury when the voting of indictments was being considered. Accordingly, defendant had no right to a mistrial because he failed to show that his rights were prejudiced by the investigators' presence in the grand jury room. Finally, the prosecutor did not err in stating to the jury that defendant had been indicted by the grand jury. Under Wis.

The court held that the body that made the initial determination that the property was needed by the city, a Board of Assessment comprised of a realtor, a civil engineer, and a property owner, was an impartial body. The court further held that the landowner's right to a trial de novo, to challenge the Board's decision, was not effectively taken away by the requirement that the landowner post a cost bond on appeal. The court stated that cost bonds were required in many similar actions and had been upheld as constitutional.

The court rejected the administrator's contention that the claimant acted gratuitously based on the near relationship and the common home of the claimant and the deceased. The court held that presumption was overcome by uncontradicted testimony. The court rejected the administrator's claim that the value of the services was improperly calculated. However, the court did agree with the administrator that the claimant was limited to recovery for two years of services under Wis. Stat. &sect; 330.21(5) (1949). The court rejected the claimant's argument that the statute was unconstitutional because a provision excepting professional fees from the limitations period was arbitrary and unreasonable. The court explained that even if the provision regarding professional fees was unconstitutional, the remainder of the statute was still valid. The court concluded that the award to the claimant must be modified to reimburse her for two years of service only.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant contended that because respondent was adopted by the second husband of her mother after the death of her father, who was the decedent's nephew, respondent was removed from the decedent's line of descent and inheritance. The court agreed and reversed the judgment. It held that pursuant to Wis. Stat. &sect; 322.07(1), the legal status of respondent was changed by the order of adoption so that in legal effect she became the child of her mother and the mother's second husband, and as such she had no claim upon the estate of the decedent, her biological father's aunt. The court reasoned that the express reservation of the right of inheritance by the adopted child from its natural parents in Wis. Stat. &sect; 322.07(4) reinforced the sweeping effect of Wis. Stat. &sect; 322.07(1) to deny such right from other natural kin.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The grocer was granted immunity under Wis. Stat. &sect; 93.17 for testifying in an investigation before the Wisconsin Department of Agriculture regarding the grocer's advertising or selling certain merchandise below cost. Such activity by the grocer constituted a violation of Wis. Stat. &sect; 100.30. The State sought and was granted an injunction prohibiting the grocer from advertising or selling merchandise below cost. The grocer argued that the policy of &sect; 100.30 was in error, that &sect; 100.30 was an arbitrary and unreasonable exercise of the State's police power, and that he was immune pursuant to the earlier grant under Wis. Stat. &sect; 93.17. On appeal, the court determined that lacked the ability to determine the social value of a statute's objectives. The court found that &sect; 100.30 was not an arbitrary and unreasonable exercise of the State's police power as &sect; 100.30 did not forbid all sales below cost, but only those made with the intent of committing unfair or harmful trade practices. The court concluded that the grocer's immunity applied only to criminal prosecution or administrative fines or forfeiture and did not apply to the State's injunction action.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The county sought an injunction against the town after it began ticketing cab companies for not having a license from the town. The cab companies had a contract with the airport for the transporting of passengers to and from the airport facilities. The town argued that the county exceeded its authority in the exercise of its controlling power with relation to ground transportation within the airport. The town's claim of excess of authority is based upon regulations of the county and the contracts entered into by it with the airplane companies that used the facilities of the airport. The court upheld the trial court's judgment that the county had the exclusive right to manage the field, including the right to regulate the ground transportation to be furnished to airline passengers arriving at and departing from the airport. Also, the court concluded that such right included the entrances to and exits from the field. The court held that the town's ordinances were void because they attempted to deprive the cab companies of their property rights without due process of law.</SPAN></P>

The court concluded that the referendum procedures outlined in &sect; 925-18, which required the submission of the proposition to a vote of the electors of the area to be annexed, were part of Wis. Stat. &sect; 926-2 (1898), granting the city the authority to annex land. The manner in which the city's annexation power was to be exercised was prescribed by Wis. Stat. &sect; 925-18 (1898); thus, the city was required to proceed in conformity with that statute and hold a referendum. The failure to do so was fatal to the validity of the ordinance. Because the court had already determined that the ordinance was void, it did not consider the question of whether it was unconstitutional under Wis. Const. art.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with larceny after he stole a suit. He entered a plea of nolo contendere, and the trial court sentenced him under the repeater law. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that defendant's plea was a waiver of proof. The record showed that the trial court knew the contents of the information, and there was nothing that tended to overcome the presumption of regularity in the trial court's proceedings. The trial court correctly applied Wis. Stat. &sect; 359.13 (1947) because &sect; 244, ch. 631, Wis. Laws 1949 expressly excepted provisions altering penalties from its application to pending cases. This exception had the effect of preserving the 1947 repeater law for any crime committed before July 1, 1950. There was ample evidence that defendant had been previously sentenced to imprisonment in a county jail by a court of another state. Defendant was therefore subject to the sentence imposed by the trial court under the repeater law. In connection with the repeater law, the fine imposed by Wis. Stat. &sect; 343.17 was construed as a sentence of imprisonment because defendant was committed to the county jail until the fine was paid.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">As part of its numbered findings, the Board made two findings that were to the effect that there was a work slow-down and reduction in production by the employees that was effectuated by them based on action taken by the membership of the union at a union meeting. It was contended that those findings were not supported by competent, credible evidence as required by Wis. Stat. &sect; 111.07(7). The court rejected the contention, recited the statements of two witnesses, and noted evidentiary exhibits that showed a substantial loss of production. Credibility was to be assessed by the Board. The court rejected the contention that the slowdown did not violate the union contract. The court held that the word &quot;unauthorized,&quot; as used in Wis. Stat. &sect; 111.06(2)(h), which gave a definition of &quot;unfair labor practices,&quot; did not apply to more than the taking of property; thus, engaging in any concerted effort to interfere with production except by leaving the employer's premises in an orderly way to go on strike was an unfair labor practice that was not authorized under the union contract.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer failed to make state income tax returns. The assessor made doomage assessments of income taxes against him. The trial court concluded that the taxpayer resided within the state for the purposes of liability for income taxes because he spent, in the aggregate, more than seven months of each of the income years in the state. The taxpayer appealed, alleging that the days that he was physically absent from the state should have been computed in the time he spent in the aggregate within the state. The court held that the record amply supported the finding that weekend business and pleasure trips outside the state were included in the time the taxpayer spent in the state because he always intended to return to his headquarters in the state. The court held that the taxpayer waived the issue of whether &sect; 71.01 was unconstitutional because he did not assert the claim until he filed a motion for rehearing after all of the issues had been determined in the trial court. The court held that another case, which established the invalidity of the statute in regard to the taxation of a corporation and not a natural person, did not excuse the taxpayer's failure to raise the issue.</SPAN></P>

Stat. ch. 111, subch. III.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The restraining order required the union and the negotiating committee to take immediate steps to notify all the striking employees to resume working. After service of the restraining order in the afternoon of the day the strike began, the committee arranged a conference with company officials to settle the strike. Following all-night negotiations, an agreement was reached and the strike ended. On review, the court held that the language of the restraining order was direct and unambiguous in commanding that the committee take immediate steps to notify all striking employees, which it failed to do. However successful the negotiations were, the committee was not exonerated for its failure to comply with the requirements of the order. The public utility anti-strike law, Wis. Stat. ch. 111, subch. III was a proper legislative enactment and was not preempted by the Federal Labor Management Relations Act of 1947, 29 U.S.C.S. &sect; 141 et seq., which had no provision prohibiting a state, in the exercise of its police power, from protecting itself against strikes or lockouts in public utilities which would imperil the health and safety of its citizens.</SPAN></P>

The trial court granted appellant's demurrer ore tenus on the ground that the petition failed to allege that the ordinance imposed a duty to issue permits, allowed the developer to amend its petition, and entered a judgment for the developer. On appeal, the court affirmed. The trial court was within its discretion and the requirements of Wis. Stat. &sect; 269.44 in allowing the amendment. It corrected a technical failure of the petition, and appellant was not prevented from fully answering. Further, it was not error to not apply the ordinance retroactively. The language of the ordinance did not clearly state that it was to be retroactive, and the developer, who had already performed work on the project, and would be unreasonably injured by a retroactive application. The evidence showed that the developer's project was in keeping with the surrounding use, and thus supported the trial court's finding that the ordinance, as applied to the developer, would be arbitrary and unreasonable.</SPAN></P>

The trial court entered judgment for the city. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that because Wis.

Stat. &sect;&sect; 66.067 required the city to comply with Wis. Stat. &sect; 66.066 only with respect to the manner in which the funds for the construction of the hospital was to be raised, which the city did. Because the city was acting in its proprietary capacity in the operation of the hospital, the city had the same right as a private business to contract with the entity to operate the hospital for the city. Because nothing was pledged for the payment of the principal and interest of the bonds except the hospital property and the rentals paid by the entity, the indebtedness on the bonds was not an indebtedness of the city. The city's contractual duty to pay the entity an annual amount for running the hospital created a debt only for each annual amount each year. Thus, the bonds did not violate Wis. Const. art. XI, &sect; 3.</SPAN></P>

The trial court held that that plaintiff's complaint was deficient as to allegations of illegal conduct, yet issued a partial order restricting the manner in which defendants conducted their meetings. Defendants moved for demurrers of the trial court's decision, arguing that plaintiff failed to submit a proper complaint because it made conclusions concerning the meetings based on lawful events.

The trial court rejected their arguments. The union and its members sought review of that decision, which was affirmed. On appeal, the court found that the legislation applied to the members who were employed by public utilities. Moreover, neither &sect; 7 nor &sect; 13 of the NLRA, 29 U.S.C.S. &sect;&sect; 157, 163, conferred an absolute right upon employees to engage in every kind of strike or other concerted activity. Because those provisions had no impact on the right to strike as it existed under other laws, a state had the ability to prohibit strikes and to make a violation thereof criminal. Similarly, neither the Federal nor Wisconsin Constitutions conferred upon employees an absolute right to strike. Therefore, Wis. Stat. &sect;&sect; 111.50-.65 to the extent that it prohibited the members from striking or otherwise acting in concert with regard to work stoppages was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, an association of gasoline dealers, was the subject of an inquiry by the State. The State instituted an action for violations of price fixing statutes and prevailed. Accordingly, the corporate charter of the appellants was to be revoked. The appellants submitted that there were exemptions under statute for legitimate promotion purposes which they indicated were applicable. On review, the court looked at the statutes in question and, according to their plain meaning, prohibited the conduct engaged in by the appellants. The argument pertaining to the statutory language relied on by appellants was without merit and therefore the decision was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State alleged that defendant expended money to provide food to the friends of legislators at the legislators' request. Defendant argued that the lobbying statutes were so vague as to constitute a denial of due process under the federal and state constitutions and that the requirement of filing a sworn statement of expenses and obligations incurred in connection with lobbying activities under Wis. Stat. &sect; 346.245 had to be confined to expenditures made while promoting or opposing legislation. Defendant also argued that there was a failure to add the complainant to the district attorney as a party plaintiff. The trial court rejected defendant's arguments and the court affirmed. The court held that the lobbying statutes were not vague and that the purpose of the reports required by &sect; 346.245 was to ensure disclosure to the State and prevent unfair lobbying practices. The reporting requirements were not limited to those expenditures made to members of the legislature, but pertained to their friends as well. Although a verified complaint to the district attorney was required by Wis. Stat. &sect; 346.21(2), there was no requirement that the complainant be joined as a party.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants contended that since the building of private roads was closely allied with a public purpose, Wis.

In particular, they contended that the act of connecting the public highway system with an individual dwelling by means of a private drive is indistinguishable in principle from the act of connecting any municipal utility, water, gas, electricity, sewer, or telephone with that individual premises and unless the latter activity can be clearly and completely distinguished, then the presumption of the constitutionality must prevail and &sect; 86.106 must be valid. Upon review, the court found that &sect; 86.106 resulted in the appropriation and expenditure of public funds for a private purpose without any direct advantage accruing to the public and would authorize municipalities to engage in private business. Thus, it was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

The Commission contended that the operator, having a compensation insurance policy, could not attack the constitutionality of Wis. Stat. &sect;102.07(5) (1941).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The operator did not hire, pay, or regulate the fees of caddies. He knew that players used caddies and that boys were on the course seeking employment as caddies from patrons, who paid the caddy for his services. When appellant caddy acted as a caddy, he was never paid except by the person for whom he caddied. Apparently, the only conversations he had with the operator were to the effect that he was told he would have to get a labor permit if he wanted to caddy. The caddy was injured while engaged as a caddy for a patron of the course. He applied for workmen's compensation as an employee of the operator as provided in &sect; 102.07(5). The court held that &sect; 102.07(5) was unconstitutional, as violative of due process of law, in that it attempted to set up a relation of employer-employee that was absolutely contrary to fact and that the operator was within his rights in raising the question of the constitutionality of the act.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant town sought review of a decision of the Circuit Court for Milwaukee County (Wisconsin), which upheld a city ordinance that allowed an annexation to respondent city of a parcel of land that was located in the town.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the annexation, there remained a 4.62-acre tract of land in the town that was connected to the town only by a strip of land that was about 675 feet long and varying in width from 30 to 72 feet. The parcel was used as a trailer camp. The town contended that the ordinance was invalid because its effect was to destroy the contiguity of the town. Further, the town contended that Wis. Stat. &sect; 62.07, in its operation, conferred upon the common council of the city the power to change the boundaries of assembly and senate districts and was, therefore, unconstitutional. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that the word &quot;adjacent,&quot; as used in Wis. Stat. &sect; 926-2 (1898), was synonymous with the word &quot;contiguous,&quot; which was used in Wis. Const. art. IV, &sect;&sect; 4, 5. According to the court, the trial court properly found that the territory that was annexed was one entire area adjacent and contiguous to the existing boundaries of the city. That was the test of the validity of the ordinance. In addition, the court held that the argument with regard to the constitutionality of Wis. Stat. &sect; 62.07 was misplaced because the annexation was not made pursuant to that statute.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants contended that they were seriously hampered in collective bargaining by Wis. Stat. ch. 111, subch.

On review, the court held that, upon the record, it could only determine whether or not the act was a valid and constitutional enactment because the constitutional question was not brought directly in issue by the facts involved and could not be determined on a hypothetical question or upon assumed facts. There was no question that the legislature had the power to declare that there should be such a law because the public had a vital interest in the continued operation of essential public utility services and the law was enacted for the benefit and protection of the rights of the public. Further, the legislature properly fixed the limits within which the act was to operate, including sufficient standards to guide arbitrators appointed under the act, as provided in Wis.

On review, the court held that, as the record had no evidence of facts to the contrary, it assumed the existence of facts which justified the necessity for enactment of Wis. Stat. &sect; 85.02(1)(c). It was evident that the legislature had in mind the necessity of established permanence and stability of an applicant and his business in order to eliminate or minimize the evils and mischief of a fly-by-night operator. It was within the province of the legislature to determine that the protection afforded by enacting &sect; 85.02(1)(c) was necessary to abate such evils.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Proceedings begun October 1, 1947, by Business Brokers Association, Inc., a Wisconsin corporation, Henry Zastrow, doing business as Lincoln Appraisal Co., Harvey R. Bitter, doing business as American Business Co., Stewart H. Ingram, doing business as United Appraisal Co., and Edward J. Winslow, doing business as The Winslow Co., to restrain William J. McCauley, district attorney for Milwaukee county, Harvey L. Neelen, Judge of the district court of Milwaukee county, August C. Schmidt, clerk of the district court of Milwaukee county, and F. E. Altendorf, Oscar A. Swenby, J. S. Miller, and Elliott N. Walstead, members of the Wisconsin Real Estate Brokers' Board, from enforcing the provisions of secs. 136.19 to 136.36, Stats., inclusive, which regulate 'business opportunity brokers' on the ground that the statutes are in violation of the 'equal protection of the law' and 'due process of law' provisions of the state and federal constitutions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plaintiffs are business opportunity brokers in the city of Milwaukee and they brought this action to enjoin the enforcement officers from carrying out the provisions of secs. 136.19 to 136.36, Stats., inclusive, requiring business opportunity&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  brokers to be licensed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The pertinent provisions are as follows:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'136.19 * * * Definitions.  * * *</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'(2) 'Business opportunity broker' means any person, firm or corporation, not excluded by subsection (3):</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'(a) Who for another, and for commission, money or other thing of value, sells exchanges, buys or rents, or offers or attempts to negotiate a sale, exchange, purchase or rental of any business, its good will, inventory, fixtures or an interest therein; or</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'(b) Who is engaged wholly or in part in the business of selling business opportunities or good will of an existing business or who is engaged wholly or in part in the business of buying and selling, exchanging or renting of any business, its good will, inventory, fixtures or an interest therein.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'(3) The term 'business opportunity broker' does not include:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'(a) Receivers, trustees, administrators, executors, guardians or other persons, appointed by or acting under the judgment or order of any court; or</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'(b) Public officers while performing their official duties; or</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'(c) Any bank, trust company, savings and loan association, or any land mortgage or farm loan association organized under the laws of this state or of the United&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  States, when engaged in the transaction of business within the scope of its corporate powers as provided by law; or real estate brokers holding a license issued by the Wisconsin real estate brokers' board; or</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'(d) Employes of persons, companies or associations enumerated in paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) when engaged in the specific performance of their duties as such employes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'(4) 'Business opportunity salesman' means anyone who is employed by a business opportunity broker to perform any act authorized by sections 136.19 to 136.36 to be performed by a business opportunity broker.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'136.20 Brokers licensed.  No person, firm or corporation shall engage in or follow the business or occupation of, or advertise or hold himself or itself out as or shall act temporarily or otherwise as a business opportunity broker or business opportunity salesman in this state, without first procuring a license therefor as provided in sections 136.19 to 136.36.  Licenses shall be granted only to persons who are trustworthy and competent to transact the business of a business opportunity broker or business opportunity salesman in such a manner as to safeguard the interests of the public, and only after satisfactory&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  proof thereof has been presented to the board.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'136.22 * * * (2) In determining competency, the board shall require proof that the applicant for a business opportunity broker's license or a business opportunity salesman's license has a fair knowledge of the English language, a fair understanding of the general purposes and general legal effects of bills of sale, chattel mortgages, conditional sales contracts, the provisions of the bulk sales law, leases, and a general and fair understanding of the obligations between principal and agent as well as of the provisions of sections 136.19 to 136.36.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plaintiffs contend that these provisions are unconstitutional because they do not give plaintiffs the equal protection of the laws and deprive them of their property without due process of law.  This claim is based on the contention that in exempting the persons and corporations in sec. 136.19(3)(a) through (c) the legislature has made an unconstitutional classification.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On October 1, 1947, the trial court issued an order to the defendants to show cause why they should not be enjoined from enforcing these provisions and issuing a temporary injunction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defendants filed a general demurrer&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to the complaint.  The Attorney General representing the Wisconsin Real Estate Brokers' Board moved that the action be dismissed as to Business Brokers Association, Inc., because it appeared on the face of the complaint that it was not a real party in interest and for change of venue to Dane County pursuant to sec. 261.01(9), Stats., because the action was in fact against the Wisconsin Real Estate Brokers' Board.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trial court granted the motion to dismiss as to Business Brokers Association, Inc., because it was not a real party in interest but denied the motion for change of venue.  It ruled that the classification in the statute was a valid one and sustained the demurrer with leave to plaintiffs to amend their complaint within twenty days or the court would dismiss it with costs.  On April 23, 1948, judgment dismissing plaintiffs' complaint was entered. Plaintiffs appeal.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff business opportunity brokers appealed a judgment dismissing the brokers' complaint to enjoin defendant county officials from enforcing Wis. Stat. &sect;&sect; 136.19 to 136.36, inclusive (the statutes). The brokers alleged that the statutes violated their equal protection rights by classifying the brokers in a separate class and by exempting real estate brokers from the licensing requirement.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Wis. Stat. &sect; 136.19(3) exempted certain corporations and persons, including real estate brokers, from the definition of business opportunity broker, and Wis. Stat. &sect; 136.20 required that the brokers be licensed. Certain brokers sued county officials to enjoin enforcement of the statutes, and the trial court dismissed the complaint. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that the brokers' business was sufficiently distinct from other businesses to warrant a separate classification. The classification was germane to the statutes' purpose of regulating the brokers who had previously been unregulated, and those exempted in Wis. Stat. &sect; 136.19(3) were regulated by other statutes. The requirements in Wis. Stat. &sect; 136.22(2) for a broker were similar to the requirements for a real estate broker's license. The line of demarcation between a broker and a real estate broker was distinct although there would be instances when a real estate broker could sell real estate with a business on it. Therefore, the statutes did not deprive the brokers of the equal protection rights, and Wis. Stat. &sect;&sect; 136.19 to 136.36, inclusive, were constitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner taxpayer filed an original action against respondents, the secretary of state and the candidates for justice of the state supreme court, claiming that the legislature unconstitutionally amended the election process when it changed the election law to require a run-off election for the office of the supreme court when no single candidate received more than half of votes that had been cast.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An election was to be held for the office of justice of the supreme court. The legislature discovered that there would be an unprecedented number of candidates for that office and established a run-off election if no candidate received more than half of votes that had been cast. The taxpayer filed suit, claiming that the legislature improperly amended the election law. The court held that candidacy in an election was not an inherent right, and the legislature could provide a run-off election in order to obtain a consensus for a candidate. The court also stated that while it was true that the right of a qualified elector to cast his ballot for the person of his choice could not be destroyed or substantially impaired, the legislature had the constitutional power to say how, when, and where his ballot shall be cast. Further, the court determined that the run-off election did not violate the electors' right to choose a candidate because the electors could still cast a ballot for a candidate at the initial election. The court upheld the legislature's right to enact a run-off election and dismissed the taxpayer's action.</SPAN></P>

The court concluded that to permit appeal from the acquittal would have violated fundamental principles upon which the constitutional prohibition of double jeopardy was grounded. The court stated that the decision by the trial court could only be reviewed under &sect; 358.12 (8) if it was asserted that the error committed by the trial court consisted of rejecting all of the State's evidence so there was left no evidence of guilt, or if the trial court ruled the evidence insufficient to support the finding of guilt. The court determined that in view of the clearness with which the trial court demonstrated its purpose and intent to acquit, the circumstance that there were no issues of fact in the case did not warrant a conclusion that the trial court's error was procedural and therefore the court had no power under &sect; 35.12 (8) or Wis.

The court determined that it had jurisdiction because the owners proceeded strictly in accordance with Wis. Stat. &sect; 62.23(7)(e) and because the doctrine of res adjudicata had no application to the exercise of the power of an administrative body. On the merits, the owners contended that under the provisions of City of Madison, Wis., Ordinance &sect; 16.18(V)(B)(3), the Board had the power to authorize a variance and erred in not doing so. The court affirmed the judgment, finding that authorization of a variance in a particular case was a determination made by the Board in the exercise of its discretion. The court found that when the Board acted within its powers and its action was not arbitrary or capricious, there was no violation of the owners' constitutional rights.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State appealed an order of the County Court of Milwaukee County (Wisconsin), which allowed respondent taxpayer, a decedent's estate, to deduct the normal inheritance tax from the federal credit allowed under I.R.C. &sect; 813(b) and to deduct the 30 percent emergency tax imposed by Wis.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decedent, a Wisconsin resident, died, leaving property in two additional states. The taxpayer argued that in computing the amount due under Wis. Stat. &sect; 72.50, the emergency tax imposed by Wis.

The taxpayer alleged that if the Wisconsin tax was so computed as to exceed the maximum federal credit allowed, it was unconstitutional. The court reversed, holding that the tax had to be determined in accordance with the State's computation and that the emergency tax could not be deducted from the federal credit. The court found that in reading the state statutes in the order of their enactment, there was a legislative intent to impose an additional tax by Wis. Stat. &sect; 72.74(2) after deduction of all taxes previously allowed by Wis. Stat. &sect; 72.50.

Stat. &sect; 326.12 and specifying papers and record to be produced under the subpoena. The stockholders filed a motion to suppress the subpoena, which was denied. The stockholders, alleging that they were aggrieved and injured and without remedy by appeal, invoked the superintending control of the court. In denying relief, the court held that two important elements were to be considered by the court as having an important bearing upon the propriety of exercising original jurisdiction and superintending control including the absence of any other adequate remedy and the fact that unless the court intervened petitioner would suffer great and irreparable hardship. The court found that examination of the petition indicated nothing more than an attempt to make an original action in the court serve the office of an appeal. The court noted that the stockholders made merely a general statement that they were aggrieved and that to permit an original action under these circumstances would amount to automatically substituting such an action for the appeal, which the statute denied.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 348.412 (1945) for publishing the name of a female victim of an assault. The trial court held that &sect; 348.412 was invalid. On review, defendant alleged that &sect; 348.412 was so vague and indefinite that it violated due process. The court noted that &sect; 348.412 was intended to prevent the publication of information respecting the victim of an assault such as that described in &sect; 348.412 and thus to save the victim embarrassment, offensive publicity, and aid in the punishment of the offender. The court stated that &sect; 348.412 prohibited the publication of the name of the victim and the publication of information, which of itself or by reference furnished the means of identification. The court held that having in mind the purpose of &sect; 348.412 it was considered that the words &quot;publish the identity of a female&quot; meant that the name or other means of ready identification of the female should not be published. The court found that because the words &quot;the identity of a female&quot; were certainly more definite and certain than the words &quot;political purposes,&quot; that &sect; 348.312 did not operate to deprive defendant of due process by reason of vagueness.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A provision in the union's contract with the employer stated that all employees in good standing at the time the agreement was signed shall remain members of the union in good standing as a condition of employment. An employee refused to pay his dues and was terminated. The Board reinstated the employee after ordering the employer to cease from encouraging membership in the union by any discrimination in respect of the hire or tenure of its employees. The court rejected the employer's contention that the Board was without jurisdiction for the reason that the National Labor Relations Board in supervising the election for bargaining agent and certifying the union as such had so intervened in the labor relations of the company. The mere certification of a union as a bargaining unit in a particular plant was not such a general assumption of jurisdiction over all of the employment relations of the company as would oust the state board of all jurisdiction. The court upheld the Board's order concerning back pay because the penalty was likely to prevent an employer from committing future labor practice violations, and this served the purposes of the National Labor Relations Act.</SPAN></P>

The Circuit Court for Milwaukee County (Wisconsin) denied the employer's motion for summary judgment and the employer appealed from the order.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee alleged that the employer failed to pay for time of travel on the premises to and from the place of work, for a change of clothes, and for cleaning up, as time worked under the Act. The employer filed a summary judgment motion based on the passage of the Portal to Portal Act of 1947 (the Act of 1947), 29 U.S.C.S. &sect; 251 et seq. The employee opposed the motion on the ground that the Act of 1947 was unconstitutional. The court held that the trial court erred in refusing to pass on the constitutionality of the Act of 1947. Due deference to the principle of comity between courts moved the court to accept the federal courts' unanimous ruling that the Act of 1947 was constitutional and to order the complaint dismissed. The court held that there could be no recovery under the Act of 1947 for the activities alleged because they were not covered by custom, contract, or practice when performed and the court was without jurisdiction to compensate them. The court held that it would have constituted a great hardship and denied the employer its rights under Wis. Const. art. I, &sect; 9, to submit it to the expense of a trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Wis. Stat. &sect; 20.02(13)(a) was enacted for the purpose of appropriating tax money for the purpose of providing housing for veterans. At issue was whether &sect; 20.02(13)(a) violated Wis. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 10, which prohibited the state from contracting any debt for internal improvement. The court found that the enactment could not be justified as a public purpose because it did not treat all veterans equally. The legality of the enactment depended on whether it satisfied a public need. However, the court noted that the activities of providing housing were consistently considered to be works of internal improvement. Notwithstanding the housing shortage, the court rejected the State's argument that the constitutional prohibition should be treated as more elastic or ignored altogether. When the State appropriated money to be used in the construction of houses for a certain class of its citizens, it was engaging in works of internal improvement. The Wisconsin constitution did not permit the State to be a party to carrying on such works. Therefore, the court declared that &sect; 20.02(13)(a) was in contravention of the constitutional prohibition.</SPAN></P>

Thus, the court held that a more tailored order should be entered on remand. Additionally, the court held that the restriction on discussing adult issues was unconstitutionally vague and on remand the prohibited adult issues should be described with sufficient certainty.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The circuit court entered a six months domestic abuse injunction against respondent husband. Petitioner wife appealed contending that the circuit court erred when it refused her request for a two-year injunction and when it declined to order the sheriff to assist in placing her in physical possession of her residence. The court found that Wis. Stat. &sect; 813.12(4)(c) (1997-98) established that a domestic abuse injunction was effective for the period of time petitioner requested. Petitioner requested a two-year injunction and the circuit court was required to grant relief for two years or not at all. There was a reasonable basis for the legislature to treat parties in domestic abuse injunction proceedings differently than parties in other types of injunction proceedings. Section 813.12(6) required the circuit court, if it elected to grant an injunction and petitioner so requested, to direct the sheriff's assistance in placing petitioner in physical possession of her residence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, sanitary district, appealed from two orders of the circuit court, which determined that the Department of Natural Resources (DNR) had standing to challenge the constitutionality of Wis.

The DNR conceded that generally, a state agency cannot attack a statute's constitutionality; however, it argued that, in limited circumstances, a state agency can challenge a statute's constitutionality if it presents an issue of great public concern. The court held that the great public concern exception applies only to cases where a private litigant and a creature of the state are involved, and not to suits limited to creatures of the state. Thus, DNR did not have standing to challenge the constitutionality of the statutes, as no private litigants were involved.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant argued that Wis. Stat. &sect; 938.183(2)(a)2 was unconstitutionally vague, and also argued that the trial court erred in finding that he was not eligible for a juvenile disposition under the statute. The reviewing court concluded that constitutionality could not be challenged because appellant failed to raise the issue in the trial court. However, the court also concluded that the statute was ambiguous and, after applying the rules of statutory construction, affirmed the trial court's determination that appellant was not eligible for a juvenile disposition. Appellant's conviction for first-degree reckless homicide came under the statute because the charge of reckless homicide was one of the charges for which the adult court had original jurisdiction and, consequently, he could not be sentenced under the penalties available for a juvenile disposition, but was subject to adult sentencing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>

The record, however, contained no such judgment. The court assumed the appeal was from the circuit court's order revoking appellant's license for one year for his refusal to submit to blood-alcohol testing under the implied consent law. Appellant claimed the implied consent law was unconstitutional because it coerced appellant's consent to a search (via breath, blood or urine testing). But no consent was forced or coerced from appellant because he refused to take the test. Not having been forced to consent, appellant did not suffer any &quot;threatened or actual injury&quot; by &quot;coercion.&quot; Appellant did not suffer injury in fact from a coerced consent to blood, breath or urine testing when he never consented, and never underwent any such testing.

The court found the evidence the court received was not subject to the exclusionary rule and was, in any event, harmless; the city attorney had no conflict; plaintiff could not challenge the ordinance on vagueness grounds because it clearly proscribed his use of the trailer for storage; and no special inspection warrant was issued so the question whether it could be issued was not before the court.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs argued that under Wis. Stat. &sect; 11.04, respondent lacked authority to prevent their sending &quot;get out the vote&quot; postcards, because they did not expressly advocate a candidate. The court found that defendant members of elections board's power to regulate campaign contributions under Wis. Stat. &sect; 11.01(6)(a)1 and Wis. Admin. Code &sect; ElBd 1.42(2) was not limited. The court noted that if the postcards were mailed in coordination with a particular candidate, they were a reportable contribution. The court also rejected plaintiffs' argument that such a limitation violated their constitutional right to free political speech, reiterating that the content of the postcards was not the pertinent issue. Finally, the court rejected the argument that the terms &quot;consultation and coordination&quot; in the regulation were too ambiguous to provide adequate notice of the prohibition, noting that the terms were defined in case law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment, holding that defendant elections board could investigate whether the mailing constituted an &quot;in kind&quot; contribution, because defendant's authority to regulate campaign contributions was not limited, and that doing so did not violate plaintiffs' constitutional right to free speech.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent appealed an order committing him to the Department of Health and Family Services (DHFS) for institutional care, claiming that the order must be vacated because the DHFS failed to conduct an examination of his mental condition within six months after his &quot;initial commitment,&quot; which he asserted occurred in November 1996. The court concluded that the six-month period for re-examination under Wis.

The appellate court affirmed, holding that the amendment was not an ex post facto law, and that it did not violate equal protection or due process under U.S. Const., amend. XIV. The court said that the amendment was not intended to punish felons, but to maintain public confidence in government officials and therefore, it was not an ex post facto law.

The court held that the requirement of prompt judicial review had been met by administrative review provisions under Wis. Stat. ch. 68, contained in the ordinance. The public hearing provisions of Waukesha Municipal Code &sect; 8.195(3)(d), however, created a risk of indefinite delay by putting an applicant at the mercy of the licensing body, which was unconstitutional.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, mayor, city officials and agricultural property owners, appealed the dismissal of their constitutional challenge to Wis. Stat. &sect; 70.32(2r). The statute switched assessment of agricultural land from fair-market to use-based assessment by freezing all agricultural assessments at their assessed values during a transitional period. The assessments on plaintiffs' lands were higher than the neighboring comparables that were frozen at the lower amounts. Plaintiffs claimed the statute violated the uniformity clause of Wis. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 1. The court affirmed the dismissal on alternative grounds finding that plaintiffs failed to carry the initial burden in proving the statute's unconstitutionality by establishing by a preponderance of the evidence that their agricultural land was over-assessed and that other agricultural land was under-assessed.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from orders of the Circuit Court for Outagamie County (Wisconsin), which denied his motions to dismiss criminal nonsupport charges against him under Wis.

Defendant also alleged the lower court erred in determining that tax intercepts could not be considered as payments of his support obligation because they were not voluntarily paid.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was ordered to pay child support and failed to do so for separate periods of over 120 days. Defendant was charged with criminal nonsupport under Wis. Stat. &sect; 948.22. Defendant filed motions to dismiss the charges but they were denied. The lower courts also determined tax refund intercepts could not be considered as payments of his support obligations because they were not voluntarily paid. The court affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded, finding the statute criminalized the failure to pay arrearages even after the child for whom support was ordered attained the age of majority. The court held the statute did not distinguish between support and arrearages and the amount of support was not transformed by the course of time, the child turning 18, or its denomination. The court held the legislative intent of the statute was to deter nonsupport by permitting prosecution of cases involving arrearages, even after the child attained the age of majority. The court found that because defendant's tax refunds were intercepted and allocated to a given period, defendant could not be found to have failed to provide support for that period.</SPAN></P>

The statute did not distinguish between support and arrearages.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Criminal defendant appealed his convictions for burglary and related crimes, arguing that incriminating physical evidence and statements ought have been suppressed (defendant, an arsonist on parole, was initially stopped because he was observed near an arson scene), that he was denied statutorily authorized peremptory challenges, and that one of his pretrial statements was improperly excluded from evidence. State appellate court rejected his arguments, holding that (a) detaining parolees permissible so long as reasonable, and defendant's proximity to crime scene made stop reasonable; (b) defendant's consent to search his car was uncoerced, while his uncoerced waiver of his self-incrimination privilege made subsequent statements admissible (note also that predicate stop was lawful); (c) defense counsel waived additional peremptory challenges, and that waiver binds defendant absent ineffective assistance of counsel (not present here since prejudice unproven); and (d) defendant's hearsay statement properly excluded given lack of potential of jury confusion from excluding it.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a series of parole violations, an administrative law judge revoked petitioner's parole, and ordered forfeiture of twelve years of good time. The trial court denied petitioner's writ of certiorari, which had sought reversal of the revocation decision, and alleged good time calculation was flawed. On appeal, petitioner unsuccessfully argued he was denied equal protection by the court's refusal to allow him to file a pro se brief under Wis.

The court held petitioner admitted to the violations of parole, which occurred while he was already on an alternative to revocation for parole violation.

Defendant was placed on probation for five years.

Defendant appealed the revocation order, arguing that the executive branch had not initiated probation revocation proceedings pursuant to Wis. Stat. Ann. &sect; 973.10(2). The state agreed with defendant that the judiciary had no authority to revoke probation under Wis. Stat. Ann. &sect; 973.10(2), thus conceding that the legislative prohibition of judicial authority to administer and revoke probation did not unduly burden or substantially interfere with the judiciary's constitutional sentencing powers.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant novelty company sought review of a judgment of the Circuit Court for Waukesha County, Wisconsin, affirming respondent city's decision not to renew appellant's license to operate an adult-oriented establishment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant novelty company sold and rented sexually explicit books, magazines, videotapes, and other materials. Respondent city failed to renew appellant's operating license, and appellant sought review of the decision asserting that the municipal licensing scheme was unconstitutional. The appeal court disagreed. It explained that although City of Waukesha, Wis., Municipal Code (the Code) &sect; 8.195(3)(d) provided an applicant the right to a public hearing, that code section was constitutionally deficient. However, the court severed that part of the Code and reversed as to the severed part and affirmed as to the remainder of the Code. The court also held that respondent city had not violated due process, appellant was not deprived of an impartial administrative review, and respondent had issued adequate notice and reasonable sanctions. The sanction imposed was the only proper one considering appellant's numerous violations. Additionally, the court held there were sufficient grounds for nonrenewal of appellant's license. The Code contained specific guidelines for renewal, as noted in the Code, &sect; 8.195(7), (9), and (10), and appellant failed to meet many of these guidelines.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the decision not to renew appellant's operating license finding that almost all municipal code sections were constitutional. The grounds for non-renewal were sufficient, and there was no violation of due process. Notice was adequate, and sanctions were appropriate considering the evidence. The court reversed the provision about the right to a public hearing and severed it from the municipal code.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant driver sought review of an order from the Circuit Court for Milwaukee County (Wisconsin) finding appellant's refusal to submit to a chemical test, as required by Wis.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant's motor vehicle operating privileges were revoked for one year after he refused to submit to a chemical test of his blood when he was stopped for operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of an intoxicant. The appellate court affirmed the circuit court's order and rejected appellant's constitutional challenge of Wisconsin's Implied Consent Law (the statute), Wis. Stat. &sect; 343.305(4). Appellant contended that the statute understated the consequences of submitting to the test and overstated the consequences of refusing to submit to a chemical test. Appellant also argued that the statute failed to adequately inform drivers and thereby misled them into making an uninformed choice as to whether to submit to the test. The court rejected appellant's arguments and held that informing a driver that he may lose his driving privilege by refusing a chemical test was sufficient to satisfy the Due Process Clauses of the United States and the Wisconsin Constitutions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the order revoking appellant's motor vehicle operating privileges for one year where the state's implied consent law was constitutional because informing appellant that he may lose his driving privilege by refusing a chemical test was sufficient to satisfy the Due Process Clauses of the United States and the Wisconsin Constitutions.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 346.63(1)(a).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted and sentenced for his second, third, and fourth violations of operating a motor vehicle while under the influence (OWI). Defendant was charged with his second offense OWI, because he had a previous conviction within the past five years. Thereafter, defendant received his third and fourth OWI violations, in which defendant pleaded guilty but had not been sentenced. At the time of his sentencing, the court decided to sentence defendant on all three counts. The trial court utilized a penalty enhancement statute and sentenced defendant for his second offense as a fourth-time offender. Defendant appealed his sentences. The court reversed and remanded the lower court's sentence and reasoned that the trial court interpreted the statute incorrectly and did not properly administer the graduated penalty accordingly, and therefore oversentenced the defendant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs filed an action challenging the validity of portions of 1995 Wis. Laws 27. Plaintiffs sought a refund of taxes paid and a judicial declaration that the challenged provisions were invalid. Defendants' motions for summary judgment were granted. The court of appeals rejected plaintiffs' argument that the bill created a classification so limited in scope as to constitute a private law. Removal of plaintiffs' tax exemption did not violate Wis. Const. art. IV, &sect; 18. There was a rational basis for the classification. The bill dissolved the distinct class created by the exemption and placed all entities on the same footing regarding taxation. The purpose of the law was to level the playing field and to remove tax exemptions once entities such as plaintiffs were up and running. The classification was germane to the purpose of the law, and the class was open. The law applied equally to each member of the class because there were no exceptions within the class. Finally, the characteristics of the organizations affected by the legislation were sufficiently distinct from the characteristics of other organizations to justify different treatment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants appealed a final judgment from the Circuit Court for Milwaukee County (Wisconsin) declaring that, pursuant to Wis. Stat. &sect; 66.431(5)(a)3, plaintiff Redevelopment Authority of the City of Milwaukee (RACM) had the right to enter their properties, to conduct whatever inspections, surveys, appraisals, soundings or test borings were necessary for fulfillment of RACM's objectives pursuant to the Blight Elimination and Slum Clearance Act.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The lower court concluded that Wis. Stat. &sect; 66.431, which entitled plaintiff Redevelopment Authority of the City of Milwaukee (RACM) to enter defendants' properties &quot;in order to make inspections, surveys, appraisals, soundings or test borings&quot; was constitutional and granted an order for entry for those purposes. Defendants appealed. The court held that the statute was deficient. There was no requirement to demonstrate reasons for obtaining the order for entry, for entering after notice, for entering at reasonable times, nor for defining the scope of activity. As currently written, the statute, on its face, provided no guarantee of either a minimum warrant procedure or a constitutionally adequate substitute. Thus, to comport with the dictates of Camara, See, and Barlow, when a property owner refused access under the statute, and RACM exercised its right to obtain a court order authorizing entry for inspecting and testing, the opportunity must be provided to consider the necessity of the entry, the scope of the entry, the time, place and manner of the entry. The court read-in this requirement in order to construe the statute in a constitutional manner.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment below that held plaintiff had the right to enter defendants' properties, for the intended purposes, because the court was unable to ascertain whether the court below considered the basic requirements for a warrantless search prior to dissolving the injunction and granting the order for entry. The court reinstated the injunction, and remanded to the lower court.</SPAN></P>

Controlled drug buys were made from defendant. While attempting to execute a search warrant, an officer witnessed defendant driving away from his home. The officer stopped defendant and arrested him. Drugs were confiscated from the car. Defendant brought a motion to suppress the evidence, claiming a lack of probable cause existed. The trial court denied the motion. Defendant appealed his convictions. The reviewing court affirmed, holding the stop of defendant's car was proper where probable cause to arrest existed prior to defendant's driving away. A jury instruction regarding defendant's alibi was unnecessary where no real alibi evidence was submitted.
