<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Before the court were motions for temporary injunctions in four consolidated actions brought by petitioner members of a property owners' association to declare void and unconstitutional certain amendments to the Building Zone Ordinance of respondent Town of Brookhaven.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court disregarded any defects in the notice of public hearings because the president of the property owners' association and about 30 individual owners appeared at the public hearing and gave both oral and written protests. There was no prejudice to the owners by any technical infirmity. With respect to the publication and posting of the amendments, a different situation arose. Under the ordinance in effect at the time the amendment was adopted, amendments to the zoning ordinance did not become effective until after it had been published in a newspaper, twice, and posted in six public places for not less than 10 days. Concededly, the amendments were only published once and posted in one place. The ordinance, Town of Brookhaven, N.Y., Law &sect; 265, had since been amended to require only one publication and one posting; however, due to its effective date, the amendment did not serve to validate the action. Since the owners were only requesting a temporary injunction, it was not necessary to resolve the ultimate issues of fact. Enough was demonstrated to indicate a strong possibility that the owners would be successful to warrant temporarily maintaining the status quo.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court, in the exercise of its discretion, granted the motion for a temporary injunction in each case, provided the owner posted bond.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner medical society moved for permission to intervene in an action by plaintiffs, a humane society and others, against defendant Commissioner of Health of the State of New York. Plaintiffs sought a declaratory judgment that the Metcalf-Hatch Act, N.Y. Pub. Health Law &sect; 5-a, was unconstitutional and they sought to enjoin the Commissioner from acting under and pursuant to &sect; 5-a.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The society was the prime organization representing the interests of many hospitals, medical schools, research institutions, and laboratories in New York State in their interest in obtaining and use of animals for research purposes. The desperate shortage of research animals caused the society to strongly advocate the adoption of the Metcalf-Hatch Act, N.Y. Pub. Health Law &sect; 5-a. The society sought to intervene in the action for declaratory judgment as a party defendant pursuant to N.Y. Civ. Prac. Act &sect;&sect; 193, 193-b. Plaintiffs objected to the intervention of the society on the ground that it had no justiciable interest in the cause. The court granted intervention because the society, in its own right and as a representative of institutions sought to be benefited by the Act, was vitally interested in upholding the Act. The court noted that plaintiffs would not have been prejudiced by the intervention and that the action would not have been unduly delayed by the intervention. In fact, the court indicated that granting the motion might facilitate the final adjudication because of the society's long research and extensive knowledge of the facts that stimulated the enactment of the Act.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court grant the application for intervention.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Parties -- intervention -- action for judgment declaring that Public Health Law (&sect; 5-a), which permits use of stray animals for medical research, is </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">unconstitutional;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> application of society for medical research, which assisted in sponsoring </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">statute,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> for leave to intervene in action as party defendant granted under Civil Practice Act (&sect;&sect; 193, 193-b).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an action for a declaratory judgment that section 5-a of the Public Health Law, which permits the use of stray animals for medical research, is unconstitutional, the petition of a society for medical research, an organization which represented hospitals, schools, research institutions and laboratories in their efforts to obtain and use animals for research purposes and which assisted in drafting section 5-a and helped to influence its enactment, for leave to intervene as a party defendant, pursuant to sections 193 and 193-b of the Civil Practice Act, should be granted.  Petitioner in its own right and as a representative of institutions benefiting by section 5-a is vitally interested in upholding the statute, and it is the rule that all persons who may&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  be affected by a declaratory judgment should be joined as parties to an action for such judgment.  Plaintiffs will not be prejudiced and the action will not be unduly delayed. Under section 193-b of the Civil Practice Act it is not required that a proposed intervener shall have a direct personal or pecuniary interest in the subject of the action.  It is sufficient if he would be indirectly affected by the litigation in a substantial manner, and his claim or defense with respect to the subject matter of the litigation has a question of law or fact in common therewith.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff landowner filed an action against defendant Village of Huntington Bay, New York, seeking a declaration that the Zoning Ordinance of the Village of Huntington Bay was unconstitutional and void in as far as the landowner's property was concerned and to compel the Village to issue the landowner a certificate of occupancy for one family dwelling previously erected on the property.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A quarter acre of the landowner's property abutted the west side of a road. The property on the west side of the road was allowed to have one dwelling and appurtenances per one acre. The property on the east side of the road, nearest the landowner's quarter acre, was allowed to have one dwelling and appurtenances per quarter acre. The landowner's property was one and one quarter acres. The quarter acre was segregated from the one acre of property by a thirty-foot cliff. There was a dwelling on the quarter acre as well as on the one acre. The Village fined the landowner and the occupant of the dwelling on the quarter acre for violating the Ordinance. Upon review, the court determined that the Ordinance was invalid as to the landowner's property because the Ordinance permanently restricted the use of the landowner's property so as to constitute a taking without compensation. The court rejected the landowner's argument that the Ordinance on the whole was improperly adopted. The court concluded that the fine against the landowner and the occupant did not bind the court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employer discharged waitresses, who were members of the union. The employer filed a motion for a temporary injunction to restrain the union from picketing and interfering with its business. The union sought to dismiss the complaint. The trial court granted the employer's petition for injunction. The court denied the cross-motion to dismiss the complaint because the complaint upon its face set forth a good cause of action even thought it did not comply with the requirements of N.Y. Civ. Prac. Act &sect; 876-a. The court held that because the union picketed with the objective of forcing an employer to recognize it as the bargaining agent and the representative of employees who did not choose the bargaining agent, &sect; 876-a was not applicable. The court held that the employer was entitled to protection from disastrous and unfair economic pressure pending the determination of the action. The court found that &sect; 876-a did not give license for the performance of unlawful or disorderly acts by a union. The court held that the union was temporarily restrained from all but peaceful and reasonable picketing on behalf of the claim of the discharged employees to reinstatement.</SPAN></P>

The property owners argued that the action and resolution of the Board was illegal because it did not have the authority to pass the resolution for the City's taking of the property for private purposes and not for public use. The court granted the City's application for an order of condemnation because under N.Y. Gen. Mun. Law &sect; 72-k(1) the City was allowed to acquire real property that was necessary for or incidental to the clearance, re-planning, reconstruction, and neighborhood rehabilitation of substandard or unsanitary areas. In addition, under N.Y. Gen. Mun. Law &sect; 72-k(2), the City was authorized to sell property that had been acquired for the purposes set forth in N.Y. Gen. Mun.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff licensee sought a temporary injunction to enjoin defendant city officials during the pendency of the action from enforcing the tax on retail licensees of the State Liquor Authority imposed by New York City, N.Y., Admin. Code ch. 46, tit. F. The action was for a declaratory judgment and permanent injunction and asked that the city tax law be declared unconstitutional and void.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The licensee asked that the city tax law be declared unconstitutional and void. The licensee sought to enjoin the officials during the pendency of the action from enforcing the tax on retail liquor licensees. The court denied the injunction. The court held that the distinction for tax purposes between wholesale and retail dealers was previously upheld as not arbitrary. The court found that the law was not unreasonable, arbitrary, and discriminatory because the time of licensing was based upon the assumption that retail dealers in alcoholic beverages would have renewed their licenses from year to year. The court concluded that the law did not violate N.Y. Const. art. III, &sect; 16 because the reference in the local law to the Alcoholic Beverage Control Law was merely to show the amount of the tax and to make the detailed description of retail licensees more explicit. The court rejected the licensee's argument that the liquor license constituted a contract with the State and that the imposition of the tax impaired the obligation of the contract because the licensee did not have a contract with the State but was merely granted a license or a temporary permit to sell alcoholic beverages.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied the licensee's request to enjoin the officials during the pendency of the action from enforcing the tax on retail liquor licensees.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional law -- incorporation by reference -- taxation -- local tax on retail liquor sales -- (1) New York City local law imposing tax on retail liquor sales not arbitrary; claim that tax is less for some than for others overruled; tax of local law intended to apply for year but provision made for those in business for shorter time or whose liquor license not renewed -- (2) local law does not violate constitutional provision against incorporation by reference by fixing tax on basis of Alcoholic Beverage Control Law -- (3) liquor license is not contract; no obligation of contract impaired by tax -- (4) temporary injunction denied.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Local Law No. 58 of 1952 of the City of New York which imposes a tax on the privilege of selling liquor, wine or beer at retail for on or off premises consumption, is not unreasonable, arbitrary or discriminatory. The contentions that while the tax is imposed for a one-year period, plaintiff's license expires at the end of nine months of the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  tax year and that those who obtain their State license after March 1, 1952, will pay less tax for a full year than those who obtained their licenses prior to that date, are without merit.  The local law is based upon the assumption that retail dealers in alcoholic beverages will renew their licenses from year to year and where the renewal occurs the licensee will be in business for the full tax year. Provision is also made in the local law for the exceptional cases where the license is not renewed during the tax year or where, for some other reason, the business ceases during the tax year. Those who enter business and obtain their licenses after the tax year begins to run will pay for the proportion of the tax year that they engage in business, except that a minimum tax will, in any event, have to be paid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The local law does not violate section 16 of article III of the New York State Constitution which prohibits the incorporation of any existing law into another act by reference.  The reference in the local law to the Alcoholic Beverage Control Law is merely to show the amount of the tax and to make the detailed description of retail licensees more explicit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The argument&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  that the liquor license constitutes a contract with the State and that the imposition of the tax impairs the obligation of this contract, is untenable.  Plaintiff does not have a contract with the State but has been granted merely a license or a temporary permit to sell alcoholic beverages. Moreover, the rights granted by the issuance of the license to the plaintiff were accepted upon the terms and conditions which existed by reason of the provisions of chapter 278 of the Laws of 1947, as amended, which gave the city the right to impose the present tax.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Plaintiff has failed to make a sufficient showing to warrant a temporary injunction. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a proceeding under N.Y. C.P.L.R. 78, petitioner companies sought review of a determination by respondent Board of Estimate of the City of New York (board); sought to set aside that order; and sought an increase of the maximum average basic rental per month per room to an amount sufficient to provide sums for interest, amortization, and dividends under and pursuant to the terms of the parties' contract concerning a redevelopment project.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court initially noted that as the parties' contract was upheld as valid in a previous case, the conclusion necessarily followed that the rights and obligations of the city as well as the city's board with respect to the contract and its terms were those stated and agreed upon therein. The court further noted that the statute provided that the contract was to regulate rentals, not the board. In addition, the board already had acknowledged the companies' right to a six percent return on their investment in the housing redevelopment project. The court then found that the equitable consideration of the interest and plight of the tenants, which motivated the board in denying the companies' application, did not justify or warrant the application's denial. Nevertheless, such equitable consideration did warrant the efforts made by the board to ameliorate the hardship and plight of the tenants in seeking fair adjustment by arriving at a reasonable compromise of the increase with respect to the present tenants. Accordingly, the court granted the companies' application for an increase, subject to the saving modification agreed to by the companies as to the present tenants.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted the companies' application for an increase in rental amounts, with the exception of the modification agreed to by the companies as to the present tenants of the housing redevelopment project.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. In a proceeding under article 78 of the Civil Practice Act to annul a determination of the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  board of estimate of the City of New York and to require the board to grant the application of a housing redevelopment company and its parent company, an insurance company, to increase the maximum average basic rental per month per room in the housing project to an amount sufficient to provide sums for interest, amortization, and dividends under a contract between petitioners and the City of New York, it appears that petitioners entered into such contract with the city in 1943 respecting the acquisition of real property for, and the construction and operation of, the redevelopment project, pursuant to the Redevelopment Companies Law (L. 1942, ch. 845, as amd.).  Such law authorizes the board of estimate to negotiate and approve contracts by which private capital may be provided for rehabilitation of substandard areas, the city is authorized to grant partial tax exemption to such projects, a limited return of 6% of the total actual final cost of the project is to be assured to the redevelopment company during the period of the partial tax exemption, and section 8 of the law directs that the contract shall regulate the rents to be charged for rooms in the project.  The contract entered&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  into between petitioners and the city provided for a return to petitioner insurance company during the period of the partial tax exemption of 6% of the final cost of the project.  When the original agreement was entered into in 1943 the final cost was estimated at $ 60,000,000 and based thereon the contract provided a maximum average rental of $ 14 per month per room which was then believed sufficient to yield a 6% return on the estimated cost.  Before the project was ready for occupancy it became apparent that the final cost would exceed $ 90,000,000, and therefore a supplemental agreement was entered into in 1947 to increase the maximum average rental from $ 14 to $ 17 per month per room.  By the end of 1950 petitioners learned that the final cost of the project would be about $ 112,000,000.  Petitioners thereupon applied to the board of estimate that the contract be amended by increasing the maximum average rental from $ 17 to $ 21 per month per room, but the board refused to grant the application.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The city contends that one of the purposes of the Redevelopment Companies Law was to encourage private investment in &quot;middle-income&quot; housing. The purpose of the law, however, was&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  rehabilitation with tenancy not restricted to &quot;low-income&quot; groups, &quot;middle-income&quot; groups, or to any other class of tenancy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The contract entered into between the parties is valid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The provision embodying a 6% return upon the investment by petitioners in the project is valid and binding upon the parties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. The investment of petitioners is $ 112,210,057.64, which after audit by the city comptroller, has been accepted as correct by the board of estimate, and petitioners are entitled to a return of 6% on such investment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. Equitable consideration of the interest of the tenants which motivated the members of the board of estimate in denying petitioners' application did not justify such denial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. Proper action by the board of estimate on petitioners' application required a grant to petitioners of an increase of the maximum average rental per month per room to a sum sufficient to provide a 6% return on the investment.  Petitioners offered to the board of estimate, immediately prior to the denial of their application by the board, to keep the rent increases per month per room to the present tenants at $ 2.55 for three years and at $ 3 for the fourth year.  Had the board of estimate&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  thereupon taken the action required as a matter of law, conserving as best it could under the circumstances the interests of the tenants, it would have granted petitioners' application with the saving modification agreed to by petitioners in respect of the present tenants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. The court, in a proceeding under article 78 of the Civil Practice Act, on the proof presented may determine whether, in the exercise of sound discretion, it will grant an order or withhold it or direct modified relief.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The company set up an inter vivos trust in which it provided that the sole shareholder (the decedent) was to receive the income from the trust during his life. When decedent died, he was domiciled in Connecticut. His will was probated in that state. It was determined that the trust was part his estate for the purposes of federal estate taxation. At the time of the decedent's death, Connecticut had no statute dealing with the apportionment of estate taxes in the foreign jurisdiction, and therefore, the burden of the federal estate tax was on the residuary estate. Although later legislation was enacted that would have held the trust liable for estate taxes, Connecticut's highest court held that the statute could not be applied retroactively. Because that holding came from the highest court of the State that had adopted the law, the court was bound by it, and the trustees were not required to pay any portion of the federal estate tax; the decedent's estate was liable for the taxes. The court was not bound by a construction of the statute that was made by a federal court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that the trustees were not required to pay any portion of the federal estate tax or any penalty or interest in connection therewith and did not need to make any contribution to the decedent's estate.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayers filed a complaint against the city to enjoin the city from collecting certain taxes on their vehicles. The tax measure was enacted pursuant to 1947 N.Y. Laws ch. 278, &sect; 1, as amended by 1948 N.Y. Laws ch. 651. The taxpayers contended that the tax imposed on vehicles by the statute was invalid because it was in direct contravention of N.Y. Veh. &amp; Traf. Law &sect; 54. The court held that where two statutes could be otherwise reconciled, the general statute had to yield to the specific statute, particularly where the specific statute was a later one. The court concluded that because there was a conflict between the two statutes, the specific grant of power in the 1947 statute prevailed over the local statute found in &sect; 54. Finally, the court did not find that any unreasonable or unconstitutional classifications were created by the tax statutes at issue. The court denied the taxpayers' complaint for an injunction pendente lite and granted the city's motion to dismiss the complaint.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. By chapter 278 of the Laws of 1947 (as amd.), the Legislature authorized the City of New York to impose a tax &quot;on the use of passenger motor vehicles * * * owned by residents&quot;.  Pursuant to the authority thus conferred, Local Law No. 59 of the City of New York of 1952 was enacted and by its terms there was imposed a tax on any use of a motor vehicle owned by residents of the city upon the public streets of the city.  In this action attacking said local law on constitutional grounds, the city's motion to dismiss the complaint should be granted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The Legislature had constitutional and decisional authority to confer upon the city power to enact such tax.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Section 54 of the Vehicle and Traffic Law prohibits the imposition of local taxes for the use of public highways. Local Law No. 59 does not contravene section 54 since the enabling act (L. 1947, ch. 278) superseded the Vehicle and Traffic Law. The general statute, such as the Vehicle and Traffic Law, must yield to the specific statute which is a later one.  That the Vehicle&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and Traffic Law has been amended from time to time after the enactment of chapter 278 is immaterial, for the amendments were inconsequential and there is nothing contained in that law which can be construed to supersede the specific provisions of chapter 278.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The enabling act authorized the imposition of a tax on the use of an automobile, but makes no reference to the use of an automobile upon the highway. The Legislature intended by the enabling act to signify the use of a passenger vehicle on the public highways of the city and the omission of the words &quot;highways&quot; or &quot;streets&quot; is of no moment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Even if there is discrimination in the local law between residents and nonresidents, both of whom use the highways, the classification used in the local lawwas reasonable.  Normally, the city's streets are used more frequently by residents than by nonresidents. That there may be occasional cases where a nonresident vehicle makes greater use of the city's streets than vehicles owned by residents is not determinative and is insufficient to justify a holding that the classification is unreasonable and thus unconstitutional.  </SPAN></P>

The court stated that reasonable regulations with respect to dogs and other animals was a valid exercise of the state's police power. There was no showing that the language of the act was broad enough to permit improper application or that any such application was threatened or contemplated.

A motion for a temporary injunction is denied since the statute is not unconstitutional.  Under State law there is only a qualified property in dogs and other animals.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff moved for a temporary injunction to restrain enforcement of the city tax on the privilege of selling liquor, wine, or beer at retail for on or off premises consumption, which was imposed by N.Y.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff sought to restrain enforcement of the local law because it allegedly violated N.Y. Const. art. III, &sect; 16. The court found that the local law did not violate the provision because the reference in the local law to the Alcoholic Beverage Control Law merely fixed the amount of the tax, and it was not therefore required to be inserted into the local law itself. The court determined that the local law did not violate the home rule provisions of the State Constitution, the City Home Rule Law, or the City Charter because if the Control Law was ever amended, the city had the same power to amend the local law if it determined that a change was necessary. The city retained its full power to tax or not to tax for local purposes. The court found that the local law was clear and explicit. The court concluded that the allegation that the tax was an unlawful levy of an excise tax under N.Y. Const. art. XVI, &sect; 3 was untenable. The court held that the local law was constitutional and denied plaintiff's motion for a temporary injunction.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional law -- incorporation of law by reference -- taxation -- local tax on retail liquor sales -- (1) New York City local law imposing tax on retail liquor sales does not violate State Constitution (art. III, &sect; 16) proscribing incorporation of existing law in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">statute</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> by reference; reference to Alcoholic Beverage Control Law merely fixes amount of tax -- (2) home rule provisions not violated by local law -- (3) terms of local law explicit -- (4) claim that tax on New York County retailer more than on retailer in Richmond County and therefore discriminatory overruled -- (5) no contract obligation impaired by local law -- (6) tax is not unlawful levy of excise tax -- (7) local law constitutional and temporary injunction against tax denied.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Local Law No. 58 of 1952 of the City of New York which imposes a tax on the privilege of selling liquor, wine or beer, at retail for on or off premises consumption does not violate section 16 of article III of the State&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Constitution which proscribes incorporating an existing law in a statute except by inserting it therein.  The reference in the local law to the Alcoholic Beverage Control Law merely fixes the amount of the tax, thereby informing the taxpayer that it must pay 25% of the license fee it paid under the Alcoholic Beverage Control Law for the license issued to it, and without which it would neither be in business nor liable for the city tax.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The contention that the local law violates the home rule provisions of the State Constitution, the City Home Rule Law and the New York City Charter, based on the reasoning that the State Legislature may amend the Alcoholic Beverage Control Law and would thereby amend the city local law either by increasing or decreasing the amount of tax imposed, or by abolishing it altogether, is overruled.  Should this occur, the city council is likewise free to amend its law, if it so determines.  There is no infringement of any home rule provisions.  The city retains full power to tax or not to tax for local purposes.  It is given its power to levy this tax by the enabling act.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The terms of the local law are sufficiently explicit to inform those who are subject&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to it as to what conduct on their part will render them liable to any penalty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. A claim that the tax discriminates against plaintiff -- based on the fact that the State license fee in New York County is $ 1,200, and only $ 800 in Richmond County, so that under the local law plaintiff, who is in New York County, pays a city tax of $ 300 and a tavern in Richmond County pays a city tax of $ 200 -- is overruled.  Such a classification is valid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. A claim that the local law impairs the obligation of a contract between the State and its licensee arising out of the issuance of such license, even though the license cannot be revoked except for cause, is without merit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. A claim that the tax is an unlawful levy of an excise tax under section 3 of article XVI of the State Constitution is untenable.  This tax is an excise tax on the privilege of selling liquor, wine or beer at retail for on or off premises consumption, and not an ad valorem tax on the license nor an excise tax levied solely because of the ownership of intangible personal property. Nor is it a tax on income or gross receipts, neither of which is a factor in determining the amount of tax.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. Since Local Law No. 58 of 1952&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  is constitutional, plaintiff is not entitled to a temporary injunction. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant filed a motion to dismiss, pursuant to N.Y. Code. Crim. Proc. &sect; 330, the State's complaint that charged defendant with having unlawfully caused, suffered, and allowed dense smoke to be discharged from a stationary boiler, a violation of paragraph 1.1.1 of subdivision 1.1 of rule 1 of the Rules and Regulations of the Bureau of Smoke Control.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In support of his motion to dismiss, defendant argued that the Council of the City of New York, by enacting New York City, N.Y. Local Law 5 (1949), did not declare the emission of dense smoke to be a violation of law, but delegated to the bureau of smoke control the power to enact laws declaring what constituted a violation of law. According to defendant, the council unconstitutionally delegated its legislative function to an administrative body. Defendant further argued that only the bureau's rules and regulations declared the emission of dense smoke a violation of law, and thus constituted an attempt to exercise a nondelegable legislative power. The court held that the New York City, N.Y Admin. Code &sect; D26-1.0 provided for the adoption of rules and regulations by the board under its mandate and declared the punishment for violations. Therefore, the court held that the rule prohibiting dense smoke was issued by the board of smoke control pursuant to the constitutional command of the council and that it was a valid and substantive offense by enactment of the New York City, N.Y. Local Law No. 5 (1949), New York City, N.Y. Admin. Code &sect; D26-1.0.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Municipal corporations -- smoke control -- New York City council by Local Laws, 1949, No. 5 created board of smoke control, provided for control of smoke, and established penalties for violation of rules of board; no </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">unconstitutional</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> delegation of power to board of smoke control given; local law provides penalties for violation of rules of board of smoke control; board of smoke control has established regulations; regulations presumed reasonable; council, not board, has enacted law; in prosecution against defendant for emitting dense smoke, motion to dismiss complaint denied.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Local Law No. 5 of 1949 of the City of New York deals with smoke control, provides for the creation of a bureau of smoke control, and a board of smoke control, and declares violation of the rules of the board of smoke control to be punishable by fine or imprisonment or both.  The city council itself has enacted the offense and thereby exercised the substantive law-making power.  The substantive portion&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of the legislation is found in that part of the statute which declares the violation of the rules and regulations to be a crime and prescribes the punishment for such violation.  The rules and regulations adopted by the board of smoke control, pursuant to statutory direction, constitute a comprehensive scheme of regulation and control of air pollution. There is a presumption of the existence of facts establishing that these rules and regulations represent a reasonable exercise of the police power. Accordingly, the rule prohibiting dense smoke was issued by the board pursuant to the constitutional command of the council, and it is a valid and substantive offense by enactment of said local law. Accordingly, there has been no unlawful delegation by the council of the City of New York to the board of smoke control of power to enact laws.  In this prosecution against defendant for allowing dense smoke to be discharged from a stationary boiler used with a hoisting crane, defendant's motion to dismiss the complaint should be denied.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The publisher put out a magazine who's subject matter was ostensible the nudist culture. While it contained many pictures that showed nudists engaged in athletic activities, it also contained many pictures that showed frontal nude pictures of women in provocative position the magazine as well as on the cover each month. The commissioner of licenses issued a notice telling newsdealers that their licenses would be revoked if continued to sell the publisher's magazine. Subsequently, many newsstand operators were arrested for selling the publisher's magazine. The publisher brought an action for an injunction and challenged the constitutionality of N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 1141(1). The court found that the statute was constitutional as the definition of obscenity could be determined by community standards. It further held that the dominant purpose of the photographs was to attract the attention of the public by an appeal to their sexual impulse; thus, the arrests were proper. Additionally, the notice released by the Commissioner of Licenses did not constitute a prior restraint within the constitutional prohibition.</SPAN></P>

The commissioner warned all such newsdealers, under penalty of suspension or revocation of their licenses, not to display or sell two periodicals published by two nudist sunbathing, nonprofit New Jersey corporations.  Those magazines contain photographs glorifying nudism, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and their covers always contain such photographs.

Perhaps the commissioner should amend his warning to state so definitely.

On motion, that verdict was set aside and a motion for direction for defendant granted. Plaintiff argued that the motion directing the verdict exceeded the powers of the court because in the state of proof a verdict could not be directed at any time. N.Y. Civ. Prac. Act &sect; 457-a provided that the court could direct a verdict when it would be required to set aside a contrary verdict for legal insufficiency of evidence. The court found that the words &quot;legal insufficiency of evidence&quot; included insufficient evidence to sustain the burden of proof. Where the evidence was sufficient to go to the jury, a verdict could not be directed. The evidence was insufficient to go to the jury if there was none that ought reasonably to satisfy a jury that the fact sought to be proved was established.

The court granted the club's motion. The court determined that the complaint alleged the making of the determination and final order of the district's board after the required public hearing, but the evidence proved that the order had subsequently become null and void after the petition was dismissed at the direction of the appellate court, and no further determination and final order as provided for in N.Y.

Thus, the court ruled that the plan for the construction of a reservoir no longer existed and the district was not entitled to maintain condemnation proceedings against the club to acquire lands owned by it for construction of the reservoir.

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. In an action by plaintiff, Black River Regulating District, for a declaration that it is entitled to acquire lands owned by defendant and necessary for construction of a reservoir to control the flow of water on the Moose River, it appeared that plaintiff had, pursuant to statute (Conservation Law, art. VII-A, now art. VII), prepared a plan for the development of a reservoir on the Moos e River and that the determination of the board to construct the reservoir was made after a required public hearing.  Thereafter defendant brought a proceeding to review such determination and the determination was confirmed by the Appellate Division, Fourth Department ( </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Matter of Adirondack League Club </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">v.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11"> Board of Black</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11"> Riv. Regulating Dist.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 275 App. Div. 618, 92 N.Y.S.2d 256). The 1950 Legislature, however, amended section 445 of the Conservation Law to provide that no reservoir, except for municipal water supply, should be constructed in Hamilton or Herkimer Counties on the Moose River by any river regulating board.  Upon appeal to the Court of Appeals from the confirmation by the Appellate Division, the Court of Appeals reversed such confirmation, and ruled that the 1950 amendment had completely disposed of plaintiffs' plan and directed dismissal of the proceeding to review on the ground that the issues were moot (301 N. Y. 219, 93 N.E.2d 647). Accordingly, when the petition to review the final determination of the board was dismissed by Special Term as directed by the remittitur of the Court of Appeals, the final plan of the board directing the construction of the reservoir was disposed of by implication of law as well as the language of the court.  The contention that the amendment of the Conservation Law (&sect; 445) is unconstitutional and that in a condemnation proceeding to be instituted by plaintiff, defendant could raise all questions as to the necessity and validity of the proposed taking, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  is rejected, for defendant would be deprived of an opportunity to have the Court of Appeals pass upon the questions raised by it in the proceeding to review the final order of the board as provided in section 454 of the Conservation Law and article 78 of the Civil Practice Act.  When a statutory right is given a party affected by the final determination of a board, the court may not deprive the party of such a right.  The documentary evidence and official records conclusively prove that the determination of plaintiff board became null and void upon dismissal of the proceeding to review pursuant to the direction of the Court of Appeals and in contemplation of law no plan for the construction of a reservoir on the Moose River now exists and plaintiff is not entitled to maintain condemnation proceedings against defendant to acquire lands for construction of a reservoir.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Accordingly, plaintiff may not prosecute this action for the purpose of obtaining an advisory opinion as to the constitutionality of the amendment of section 445 of the Conservation Law, for there is no justiciable issue presented.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The individual plaintiffs have no legal capacity to test the constitutionality of&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the amendment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Since the documentary evidence and official records prima facie establish defendant's defense and plaintiffs have failed by affidavit or other proof to impugn said documentary evidence and official record, defendant is entitled to summary judgment dismissing the complaint in this action for a declaratory judgment. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners, a civil service employee individually and on behalf of other similarly situated employees and a civil service employees membership corporation, instituted a proceeding under N.Y. Civ. Prac. Act art. 78 to compel respondent Director of the Budget of the State of New York to approve a determination reallocating the employee's salary position. The Director filed a motion to dismiss.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Director claimed that his action in disapproving another administrative official's reallocation of the employee's position from grade G-8 to grade G-9 was not judicially reviewable and that petitioners failed to plead facts raising any issue as to the propriety of the Director's action. Noting that there was nothing in the New York Civil Service Law or any other law that exempted the Director's acts from review, the court declined to determine whether it was prohibited from substituting its judgment for the Director's until it had the benefit of the Director's answer. As to the sufficiency of the petition, the court determined that the employee alleged facts that, taken as true, entitled the employee prima facie to the relief he requested and ordered the Director to answer the petition. The court further determined that all of the questions could be determined and full relief accorded to the employee and others similarly situated without the corporation's intervention. The court concluded that there was no reason to permit the corporation to participate in the proceeding.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Civil service -- reclassification -- review of denial of reclassification -- (1) action of State Budget Director in denying approval of change of grade of civil service employee subject to review if arbitrary; question can be determined only after answer to petition to review filed; proceeding not dismissed where Budget Director claimed his action not reviewable -- (2) petition sufficient in law since allegations of fact show that denial arbitrary -- (3) membership corporation of civil service employees improperly joined as petitioner and proceeding dismissed as to it, where all questions may be determined without association's intervention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The State Director of Classification and Compensation changed the grade of a civil service employee upwards.  The State Budget Director disapproved of the determination relying on subdivision 1 of section 39-a of the Civil Service Law, which provides that a change of grade shall become effective on the first day of the fiscal year following approval by the Budget Director. A denial of approval by the Budget Director may be reviewed if arbitrary or capricious. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Budget Director may not obtain dismissal of a proceeding to review such determination before answer on the ground that his action is not reviewable. Only by the answer to the petition can it be determined that his action was not arbitrary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The petition alleges that the action of the Budget Director was arbitrary and that the facts found by the Director of the Classification and Compensation Division required the allocation of the position to a higher grade. Since these allegations are deemed admitted on a motion to dismiss a petition for insufficiency in law, the motion should be denied.  The petition states facts upon which petitioner is entitled prima facie to the relief sought.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. A membership corporation of civil service employees has improperly been joined as a party petitioner.  The individual petitioner sues on behalf of himself and all others similarly situated. All of the questions may be determined and full relief accorded to all those affected without the association's intervention.  The motion to dismiss the petition as to the corporate petitioner should be granted.  </SPAN></P>

After defendant charged the property owner with violating Rule 1(1.1), the property owner challenged the constitutionality of that Rule.

The court denied defendant's motion to dismiss the declaratory judgment action, finding that the patent importance and the propriety of full inquiry and investigation in the cause warranted the retention of jurisdiction. The court also found that the Rule seemed to fall within the objective outlined in New York City, N.Y., Local Law No. 5 (1949) for the regulation and control of emissions. With regard to defendant's defenses, the court held that the claims that adoption of the Rule was a proper exercise of administrative function, that defendant was a proper party, and that the Rule was valid and reasonable were sufficient to withstand challenge.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The special guardians objected to the constitutionality of &sect; 100(c) under which the common trust fund was created. The court dismissed the objections that were filed by the special guardians because &sect; 100(c) did not violate due process by failing to provide notice to infants and incompetents of the intention to invest moneys of prospective participating trusts in the common trust fund. The fact that &sect; 100(c) authorized a trustee to commingle trust funds without notice to the beneficiaries did not pertain to the constitutionality of &sect; 100(c) because in most cases infants and incompetents would have been unable to come forward after they had received the notices anyway. Section 100(c) did not permit self-dealing because N.Y. Banking Law &sect; 100(c)(4) required that the trust company's fund assets were kept separately from the trust company's own assets. Section 100(c) was not discriminatory when it authorized only corporate trustees to create common trust funds because &sect; 100(c) applied equally to all corporations that were known to handle multiple trusts.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Banks and banking -- common trust funds -- (1) that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Banking Law (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">&sect; 100-c</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">, subd. 9</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">) authorizes corporate trustee of common trust fund to commingle trust funds without notice to infants, incompetents and unknowns, does not go to its constitutionality, but relates to policy -- (2) similarly, subdivisions 8 and 10 of section 100-c which permit self-dealing by trustee involve matter of policy -- (3) failure of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">statute</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> to require &quot;documentary&quot; evidence of investments constitutes regulatory matter only and does not render statute unconstitutional -- (4) provision for period of time between decision to withdraw funds and time of actual withdrawal deprives no one of substantive rights -- (5) same is true as to provision for triennial accountings -- (6) </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">statute</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> is valid in limiting cotrustee's investment discretion to deciding whether or not to withdraw underlying trust assets from common trust fund -- (7) </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">statute</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> not discriminatory where, although it does not apply to all persons, it applies equally to all persons (corporations)</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> handling multiple trusts -- (8) objection that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">statute</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> discriminatory may not be made in this proceeding where no individual trustee claimed to be discriminated against is party hereto -- (9) </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">statute</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> not </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">unconstitutional</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> insofar as it authorizes funds of trusts created before enactment of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">statute</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> to be invested in common trust funds -- (10) participating shares in common trust fund constitute &quot;securities&quot; in which funds of trust may be invested -- (11) Surrogate's Court has jurisdiction of judicial settlements of common trust funds containing inter vivos trust funds -- (12) other objections relate to reasonableness of plan of operation under </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">statute</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> rather than to its legality; but provision in plan that cost of audit of common trust fund shall be chargeable to principal thereof relates to management costs which may not be charged against such fund (subd. 4) -- (13) affidavit of mailing of notices which incorporates by reference names and addresses appearing on filed list is regular -- (14) </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">statute</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> does not require as to said list statement of nature of interests of named persons -- (15) that name &quot;Hardenbrook&quot; was erroneously spelled as &quot;Hardenbreek&quot; in list does not make publication</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> defective -- (16) permission of State Banking Board for establishment of fund, and authorizations of Federal Reserve System and of State Banking Board permitting $ 50,000 investments, not required to be filed -- (17) objection that investment by participating trust now exceeds $ 50,000 value has become academic; amended subdivision 1 has increased limitation of investments to $ 100,000 -- (18) objections that under underlying wills more than one trust was created in amounts less than $ 50,000 but which aggregated more than $ 50,000, and that remainders of trusts may cause assets to be held later for one beneficiary, untenable; &quot;presently payable&quot; test approved -- (19) trustee was authorized to use nominee in its security transactions -- (20) filed list shows that notices of judicial settlement were mailed directly to beneficiaries -- (21) where trustee does not seek adjudication as to its right under underlying instruments to make investments in common trust fund and no decree entered thereon, beneficiaries not barred from raising such questions in judicial settlement proceedings in underlying trusts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. That subdivision 9 of section 100-c of the Banking Law authorizes the trustee&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of a common trust fund to commingle underlying trust funds in a common trust fund without notice to infants, incompetents and to persons whose names and addresses have not come to the knowledge of trustee does not go to the constitutionality of the statute, but goes to a matter of policy of the State.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Similarly, the objectant's claim in this accounting proceeding by petitioner corporation, as trustee of a common trust fund, that subdivisions 8 and 10 of section 100-c permit self-dealing by the trustee goes largely to a matter of policy, and not of constitutionality.  Such claim, however, is unfounded in view of subdivision 4 of the statute and judicial construction of the subdivision to the effect that the trustee must keep assets of fund separate from its own, and in its fiduciary capacity may not deal with itself or any affiliate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The failure of the statute to require so-called &quot;documentary&quot; evidence of investments and transfers and of other notices thereof may affect the opportunity for self-dealing, but does not amount to authorization thereof.  This is a regulatory matter only, and does not render the statute unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The statutory provision for a stated period&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of time between a decision to withdraw funds from the common trust fund and the time of actual withdrawal is for the protection of the beneficiaries and deprives no one of substantive rights.  It is proper, regulatory legislation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. The same is true with respect to the statutory provisions for triennial accountings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. Subdivision 1 of section 100-c requires the consent of the cotrustee to the investment of funds of the underlying trust into a common trust fund. However, the cotrustee's investment discretion in respect to the shares in the common trust fund evidencing the participation of the underlying trust assets is limited to deciding whether or not to withdraw such assets (subd. 5).  Although this is a departure from previous trust practice, changing times have indicated the need and wisdom thereof, and none can question the power of the Legislature to make a change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. Nor can it be said that the statute is unconstitutional as discriminatory because it authorizes only corporate trustees to create common trust funds, inasmuch as it does apply equally to all persons (corporations) known to be handling multiple trusts, wherein lie problems sought to be solved in part by the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  legislation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. Nor may such objection properly be made in this proceeding since no individual trustee against whom the statute is claimed to discriminate is a party to this proceeding and objecting herein, and neither of the two special guardians herein represents any such trustee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. Nor is the statute unconstitutional insofar as it authorizes funds of trusts created before the enactment of the statute to be invested in common trust funds, on the claimed ground that it authorizes impairment of contracts.  What constitutes proper investments for trust funds is determined by the law in effect when the investment is made.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">10. The participating shares in a common trust fund constitute &quot;securities&quot; in which funds of a trust may be invested.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">11. The Surrogate's Court has jurisdiction over judicial settlement proceedings of common trust funds which contain </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">inter vivos</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> trust funds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">12. Other objections relate to the reasonableness of plan of operation under statute, rather than to its legality.  The Banking Board had power to permit the accounting trustee to establish the present fund with provisions for its operation as stated in the filed plan.  However, the provision in the filed&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  plan that the cost of an audit of the common trust fund shall be chargeable against, and payable out of, the principal of such common trust fund contravenes the statute, for it relates, not to a judicial settlement proceeding, but to management costs, and such costs, under subdivision 4 of section 100-c of the Banking Law, may not be charged against a common trust fund by a trust company.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">13. The affidavit of mailing of notices which incorporates by reference names and addresses appearing on the list which was required to be filed by subdivision 12 of section 100-c and was in fact duly filed herein, is regular.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">14. The statute does not require, in respect to said list, a statement of the nature of interests of persons named and classification of paragraph (1) of subdivision 12 in which they fall.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">15. Where, due to a printer's error, the name &quot;Hardenbrook&quot; was misspelled as &quot;Hardenbreek&quot; in said list, does not make the publication defective, particularly since in the same clause the same family name is correctly printed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">16. There was no requirement that the permission of the State Banking Board to the trustee to establish the fund and the authorization of the Federal Reserve System&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and of the Banking Board permitting investments in the sum of $ 50,000 be filed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">17. The objection to the trustee's conduct of the fund in that, although the original investment by the participating trust was in the sum of $ 49,968.78, at the date of the account, the investment exceeds the value of $ 50,000, has become academic, since the amendment (L. 1951, ch. 215) of subdivision 1 of section 100-c has increased the limitation on participations to the sum of $ 100,000.  Nevertheless, a fair interpretation of the provision must fix the time of valuation at the date of the investment, and not require withdrawal in whole or in part solely by reason of a mere increment in capital value.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">18. Further objections involve underlying wills under which in each case more than one trust was created in amounts less than $ 50,000, but which aggregated more than $ 50,000 and all of such trusts have participated in the common trust fund. That the remainders of the trust may cause the assets later to be held for one beneficiary is immaterial, since the &quot;presently payable&quot; test has been adopted by the Banking Board and is judicially approved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">19. A common trust fund constitutes an express trust&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***9]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  within the meaning of section 25 of the Personal Property Law, and the trustee was authorized to use a nominee in its security transactions (Surrogate's Ct. Act, &sect; 231).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">20. The list filed herein pursuant to subdivision 12 of the statute shows that the notices of judicial settlement were mailed directly to the beneficiaries, and not to the beneficiaries of the trust in care of the petitioning trustee as contended by the objectants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">21. The accounting trustee made no attempt in its petition or account to show particular authority in each instrument creating the participating trusts under which the investment in the common trust fund was made and said trustee does not seek an adjudication as to its right under those instruments to make such investments.  If the decree entered herein is also silent on that issue, the beneficiaries on accountings in the underlying trusts will not be barred from having such issue determined.  Insofar as such questions are raised and determined in this proceeding, the adjudication here will be conclusive on all parties (Banking Law, &sect; 100-c, subd. 14); and the court determines in its discretion that under the statute it was proper for such questions&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***10]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to be raised herein.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In an original action, a motion was filed by plaintiffs, a number of highway motor carriers, for a temporary injunction enjoining defendants, as constituting the New York State Tax Commission, from enforcement of a road use tax known as the Weight Distance Tax, 1951 N.Y. Laws, ch. 74, based on vehicle tonnage and miles travelled, and a cross-motion was filed by defendants for a judgment on the pleadings.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A number of highway motor carriers sought a declaration that such tax was unconstitutional and sought an injunction restraining its enforcement. Among the highway motor carriers' claims were that the taxing statute imposed an undue and unreasonable burden upon interstate commerce, that it denied them equal protection, and that it constituted an illegal delegation of legislative powers in violation of the Constitution of the State of New York. The court found that, for a determination of such motions, it was necessary first to look at the statute. The court held that the tax, which was imposed upon road use measured by a ton-mile formula and which was applicable alike to interstate and intrastate commerce in an amount not shown to be unreasonable, did not constitute a violation of the interstate commerce clause of the United States Constitution. It was held that, in determining whether a classification set forth by the taxing statute was valid, judicial function was limited to an inquiry whether a classification had a rational basis. If it had, one affected by statute would not be heard to complain that another, who might also have been taxed, had been passed by.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied plaintiffs' injunction and granted defendants' motion for a judgment on the pleadings.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional law -- weight-distance tax on highway motor carriers -- (1) weight-distance tax on highway motor carriers constitutional; enforcement not restrained; judgment on pleadings granted in favor of State Tax Commission -- (2) since tax is compensation for road use, although formula inexact, and is applicable to interstate and intrastate commerce, it does not violate commerce clause of Federal Constitution (art. I, &sect; 8) -- (3) exclusion of vehicles of 18,000 pounds or less from tax based on legislative findings, proper -- (4) since omnibuses subject to another tax, exclusion of omnibuses from weight-distance tax proper -- (5) exception in favor of trucking vehicles of farmers proper -- (6) exemption of vehicles used exclusively within limits of city, village or commercial zones proper -- (7) by exempting vehicles used within limits of zones established by Public Service Commission, Legislature referred to presently</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> existing, well-defined zones established by said commission; law therefore does not contain </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">unconstitutional</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> delegation of legislative functions to administrative body -- (8) exemption of such zone traffic was not </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">unconstitutional</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> incorporation of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">statute</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> by reference.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The weight-distance tax imposed upon interstate and intrastate public and private highway motor carriers by chapter 74 of the Laws of 1951 (adding sections 501-515, incl., to Tax Law), is constitutional, and a motion of plaintiffs, highway motor carriers, for a temporary injunction to restrain its enforcement should be denied and a motion of defendants, constituting the State Tax Commission, for judgment on the pleadings should be granted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The State has the power to levy a tax upon vehicles as compensation for the use of highways, and such power is not barred by the commerce clause of the United States Constitution (U. S. Const., art. I, &sect; 8).  The tax must be laid upon road use rather than the privilege of doing interstate business, it must not discriminate against interstate commerce, and it must not exceed reasonable compensation for the privilege granted.  The formula employed by the State to exact reasonable&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  compensation is sufficient if it is a rough approximation equating the tax to the privilege conferred.  Where the tax is truly compensatory of road use, a carrier cannot complain that the proceeds are commingled with the general funds of the State.  The court cannot say that a tax upon road use measured by a ton-mile formula, applicable alike to interstate and intrastate commerce and in an amount not shown to be unreasonable, constitutes a violation of the interstate commerce clause of the United States Constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The exclusion of vehicles of 18,000 pounds or less from the tax is rational.  While there is a difference of opinion whether the true measure of road damage is gross weight or axle load, the legislative decision thereon may not be judicially disturbed.  There was evidence available to the Legislature that smaller vehicles, by their license fees and gasoline taxes, meet their just share of the burden of highway maintenance to an extent not borne by heavier vehicles.  It has not been shown that the line drawn at 18,000 pounds lacks substantial basis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Since another statute taxes carriers of persons on the basis of gross receipts (L. 1951, ch. 601), the Legislature&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  could properly exclude omnibuses from the operation of the weight-distance tax, which is more appropriate to cargo carriers. The existence of another tax, especially where the same taxes carriers of persons as distinguished from carriers of goods, is a good ground for exemption.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. The exception in favor of trucking vehicles of farmers was proper.  The use of highways by farmers in connection with their agricultural products in contrast to that of commercial carriers may be infrequent and incidental.  Moreover, the Legislature is authorized to make a distinction in favor of farmers to the end that fiscal burdens may be borne in accordance with its conception of policy and justice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. The exemption of vehicles used exclusively within limits of city, village or commercial zones is proper.  Such exemption is not accorded for mileage within such limits if such mileage is part of a larger use.  Moreover, the Legislature may well have determined that local taxes and regulations amply cover such traffic. Its conclusion not to interfere with or duplicate municipal efforts in this field cannot, therefore, be said to be without reasonable basis.  The fact that traffic within such zones uses&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  city streets primarily, and State highways but slightly, and the practical difficulty of keeping records in such cases warrants upholding such exemption.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. The law (Tax Law, &sect; 503, subd. 2, par. [a]) exempts vehicles &quot;used exclusively within the limits of any zone established by the public service commission&quot;.  The zones so referred to are those which have been defined and were in existence at the time of the enactment of the law and were delineated pursuant to article 3-B of the Public Service Law.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff City of New York filed motions for an order pursuant to N.Y. R. Civ. Prac. 113(6), striking out two answers by defendant property owner, for summary judgment, and for judgment on the pleadings in the City's action in rem to foreclose unpaid tax liens pursuant to New York City, N.Y., Admin. Code ch. 17, tit. D.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The City filed an action to foreclose unpaid tax liens on two parcels of the owner's property. The owner filed objections and affirmative defenses, answering separately for each parcel. The court denied the City's motions for summary judgment and judgment on the pleadings, holding that the moving affidavit failed to set forth that the City believed that there was no defense to the action, and the City had failed to reply to the owner's counterclaim. However, if the procedural defects were not fatal, the owner's position could not have been sustained on the merits. The mere general denials contained in each answer were ineffective to raise a triable issue. Neither the answer nor the affidavits read in opposition to the motion affirmatively alleged that the taxes had been paid or that the property was not subject to tax. Moreover, the answer to the owner's objection with respect to the absence of a statutory provision for a public judicial sale was that knowledge of the applicable statute was imputed to the defaulting property owner. The right of redemption existed only as permitted by statute. Furthermore, taxes were not subject to counterclaim or setoff on the part of the taxpayer.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied the motions and discussed defenses presented for the guidance of the owner.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Taxation -- tax liens, tax sales and tax titles -- (1) in action in rem by City of New York to foreclose unpaid tax liens, defendant alleges as defense that Administrative Code of City of New York (ch. 17, tit. D) providing for foreclosure in rem is </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">unconstitutional,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> and counterclaims for use and occupation of her property by plaintiff; plaintiff's motion for summary judgment denied where moving affidavits fail to set forth plaintiff's belief that there is no defense to action and where no reply to counterclaim filed -- (2) general denials in answers insufficient to create issues of fact in view of presumption of validity contained in Administrative Code (&sect; D17-11.0) -- (3) title D of chapter 17 of Administrative Code constitutional; defense challenging constitutionality stricken -- (4) counterclaim against city stricken; no setoff on part of taxpayer exists against claim for taxes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. In an action in rem by the City of New York to foreclose unpaid tax liens pursuant to title D of chapter 17 of the Administrative Code of the City of New York, defendant, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  in addition to general denials, alleges as an affirmative defense that title D of chapter 17 is unconstitutional in that it does not provide for a judicial sale and in that it deprives an owner of his property without due process of law, and alleges a counterclaim to recover for the reasonable use and occupation of her property by plaintiff city in storing thereon vehicles and other equipment.  Plaintiff is not entitled to summary judgment where the moving affidavit fails to set forth, as required by rule 113 of the Rules of Civil Practice, that plaintiff believes that there is no defense to the action and where plaintiff has failed to reply to defendant's counterclaim.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Were the procedural defects not fatal, summary judgment should be granted, for section D17-5.0 of the Administrative Code provides for the filing of a verified list of delinquent taxes in the office of the County Clerk containing the information required by the section.  Such filing constitutes and has the same force and effect as the filing and recording in such office of an individual and separate notice of pendency of action and as the filing in the Supreme Court of such county of an individual and separate complaint&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  by the city against the real property therein described to enforce the payment of delinquent taxes. Moreover, section D17-11.0 contains a presumption of validity and then states that a defendant alleging any jurisdictional defect must particularly specify in his answer such jurisdictional defect and must affirmatively establish such defense.  Accordingly, the mere general denials contained in each answer were ineffective to create triable issues.  Neither the answers nor the affidavits read in opposition to the motion affirmatively allege that the taxes have been paid or that the property was not subject to tax.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The provisions of title D of chapter 17 of the Administrative Code are analogous to the provisions of title 3 of article VII-A of the Tax Law which has been held constitutional.  Accordingly, title D of chapter 17 is constitutional and a defense challenging its constitutionality should be stricken out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The counterclaim for reasonable use and occupation of defendant's premises against the City of New York is insufficient, for taxes are not subject to counterclaim or setoff on the part of the taxpayer.  The taxpayer may litigate any claims against the municipality by&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  separate independent proceedings.  </SPAN></P>

In a time of emergency, such as sickness, accident, fire or other catastrophe, a road over which automobiles and fire apparatus could travel safely, had to always be available, otherwise great suffering, property damage and even loss of life could result. Thus, &sect; 280-a was substantially related to the public health, safety and general welfare of the community wherein it conditioned a building permit upon a street or highway giving access to such proposed structure being duly placed on the official map or plan and being suitably improved to the satisfaction of the town board or planning board.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff dog owner sought a judgment declaring that N.Y. Agric. &amp; Mkts. Law &sect; 115, pertaining to the night quarantine of dogs, was unconstitutional and restraining its enforcement against her. Defendants, the Commissioner of Agriculture and Markets of New York and the Chairman of the Columbia County Board of Supervisors, moved for judgment on the pleadings dismissing the complaint.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to &sect; 115, which provided that the Commissioner could by order require that all dogs in any town, city or county be securely confined between sunset and one hour after sunrise, a commissioner's order was made applicable to all of Columbia County. The dog owner contended that &sect; 115 violated the due process clauses of the federal and state Constitutions and unlawfully delegated legislative power. The court held that: (1) due process did not preclude a use of the inherent police power of the State to protect the health and welfare of the many, even at the expense of a few; (2) the regulation of dogs under the police power had long been recognized and sustained; (3) the Commissioner's powers under &sect; 115 to quarantine dogs at night was entirely constitutional; (4) the dog owner's argument that the portion of &sect; 115 permitting destruction of any dog in violation of such order was obnoxious to due process was unavailing because the statute provided for notice of the quarantine, which was sufficient; and (5) the statute only conferred authority and discretion in its execution, which was not an unlawful delegation of legislative power.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied the dog owner's motion for a temporary injunction and granted defendants judgment on the pleadings.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional law -- night quarantine of dogs --</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">(1) </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Agriculture and Markets Law</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> (&sect; 115</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">) authorizing Commissioner of Agriculture and Markets to order night quarantine of dogs in any county is constitutional exercise of police power -- (2) due process not violated by authorization to peace officer to shoot on sight dog at large in violation of order; notice of quarantine is sufficient -- (3) no </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">unconstitutional</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> delegation of legislative power given commissioner by permitting him to fix time and place where quarantine to be effective.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Section 115 of the Agriculture and Markets Law provides for the night quarantine of dogs and authorizes the Commissioner of Agriculture and Markets by order to provide for such quarantine in any county.  Pursuant to the section, the commissioner issued an order applicable to Columbia County.  The power of the commissioner under section 115 is constitutional.  Dogs are property subject to the police power. The night quarantine is a valid and reasonable exercise of the police power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The portion of section 115 which authorizes a peace&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  officer to kill on sight any dog at large is not a violation of due process.  The statute provides for notice of the quarantine and such notice is sufficient.  A strange dog in the nighttime bent upon mischief is an elusive animal, and the Legislature in its wisdom cannot be said to have acted arbitrarily and capriciously in mandating destruction rather than capture.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The statute does not unconstitutionally delegate legislative power to the commissioner.  The statute is complete on its face and does not provide for rules and regulations to be made by anyone.  It merely leaves to the commissioner the fixing of time and place -- when and where -- the statute shall become effective. The statute confers discretion in its execution and that is not an unlawful delegation of legislative power. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants filed an application to dismiss the indictment against them. One defendant was charged with the possession of a revolver after his previous conviction of a crime, while his codefendant was likewise charged with the unlawful possession of the same firearm, in violation of N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 1897(4) and N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 1898-a.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, along with their girlfriends, while sitting in an automobile owned by one defendant, were approached by a police officer and questioned about a complaint filed about a woman screaming. One of the girlfriends accused one defendant of getting fresh with her. The officer drove defendant's car to the police station with the girls inside, while defendants followed in a police car. After questioning defendants for 45 minutes, the police searched defendant's car and discovered the revolver. The court determined that defendant's car was left unattended in the police station's lot with the windows rolled down during the 45 minute preceding the discovery. The basic issue involved was one of law in which the circumstance of the entire case created a hypothesis of innocence that was equally consistent with that of guilt. Where the proof fell below the standard of rebutting the presumption of innocence, and of proving guilt beyond a reasonable doubt to warrant a conviction, as required by N.Y. Code Crim. Proc. &sect; 389, a question of law was presented and the case could not be submitted to the jury for a verdict. The court was required to direct a verdict of acquittal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court dismissed the indictment filed against defendants.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- illegal possession of firearms -- presumption of guilt from finding revolver in automobile -- (1) Penal Law (&sect; 1898-a), providing that presence in automobile of weapon is presumptive evidence of its illegal possession by persons found therein at time weapon found, is constitutional -- (2) presumption not applicable to defendants who were not in physical occupancy of automobile at time weapon discovered -- (3) hypothesis of defendants' innocence from facts in case would require court to direct acquittal; indictment dismissed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Section 1898-a of the Penal Law which provides that the presence in an automobile of a weapon shall be presumptive evidence of its illegal possession by the persons found in the automobile at the time the weapon is found is constitutional.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Such presumption is not applicable to defendants where they were not in physical occupancy of the car at the time the weapon in question was discovered by the police some forty minutes after defendants had been brought into the police&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  precinct house.  Defendants were not in constructive occupancy of the automobile.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The circumstances of the entire case create an hypothesis of innocence that is equally consistent with that of guilt. Under the facts of this case, as agreed upon by the defense and prosecution, upon a trial of the indictment a trial jury would not be permitted to speculate on the guilt or innocence of defendants when their guilt could not possibly be proved by the People beyond a reasonable doubt, and it would be the court's duty to direct a verdict of acquittal (Code Crim. Pro., &sect; 389).  The indictment against defendants should be dismissed.  </SPAN></P>

An employee of defendant failed to transport the used cups to defendant's plant and, instead, burned the cups on the open beach on federal property. Defendant was thereafter charged with violating &sect; 181. Defendant filed a motion for acquittal, arguing that it could not be liable for the employee's acts, that the acts were not committed within the jurisdiction of the state, and that the statute was vague and indefinite. The court rejected the arguments, denied the motion, and found defendant guilty. The court first held that the state had jurisdiction because the employee's acts caused danger to life in the state. Second, the court held that &sect;181 provided enough information to be reasonably applicable to varying fact situations. Third, the court held that the fact that the employee departed from the usual routine in the disposition of the dangerous poison cups was not a defense for defendant.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The corporations initiated the declaratory judgment action and contended that the Commissioner illegally assessed charges to them for the use of the city's sewer system. The court held that the corporations were required first to appeal to an administrative body prior to initiating the declaratory action. The court determined that because the social aspects of a water supply system and sewer service system were analogous and because enabling legislation of both followed the same pattern, the legal aspects of rental charges for such services were pari passu. The court held that charges for both water and sewer service fees were valid levies placed by the Commissioner. Under N.Y. Civ. Prac. Act &sect; 473, an action for declaratory judgment was a discretionary remedy that could have been withheld if existing forms of action were reasonably adequate. The court found that the corporations had an adequate remedy at law and that their prayer for relief failed to comply to the requirements of N.Y. R. Civ. Prac. 211.

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Municipal corporations -- sewer rent -- (1) declaratory judgment is proper remedy for determining constitutionality of local laws imposing sewer rent on plaintiffs, ice manufacturers -- (2) ice manufacturer whose premises are mortgaged has no standing to complain that lien of sewer rent superior to mortgages previously recorded where mortgagees not parties to action -- (3) claim that sewer rent and method of fixing such rent unreasonable, overruled; question one of contract; if sewer used, plaintiffs must pay rental fixed -- (4) whether city should have chosen better method of raising funds for construction of sewage treatment plants presents question of legislative wisdom, and not judicial question -- (5) allegation that yield of sewer rentals will exceed purpose of enabling </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">statute</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> is conclusion; law accomplishes legitimate purpose and is constitutional -- (6) complaint alleges consumption of 95% of water and return into sewers of 5%; rental based on one third of water tax, claimed unfair to plaintiffs; local laws, rules and regulations provide special administrative and judicial procedure for industrial users such as</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> ice plants; such procedures give plaintiffs opportunity to be heard and for judicial review; allegation in complaint that no adequate remedy at law exists negated; declaratory judgment not needed where such procedure affords relief -- (7) since complaint lacks prayer that sewer rental be 5% of regular rent and, although complaint contains allegations sufficient to raise issue that sewer rent improperly applied, issue not litigated; complaint dismissed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. An action for judgment, declaring that Local Laws, 1950, No. 67 (Administrative Code, &sect; 82d9-9.1) and No. 102 of the City of New York, which impose a sewer rent on plaintiffs, who are manufacturers of ice, are void and unconstitutional, is a proper remedy.  Although rule 212 of the Rules of Civil Practice vests discretionary power in the courts, where the constitutionality of a statute is involved the remedy of relief by declaratory judgment is especially applicable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Since the mortgagees of the real property belonging to one of plaintiffs are not parties to the action, said plaintiff has no standing to claim that the imposition of the sewer rental created a lien senior to mortgages executed earlier and that such was an impairment&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of the obligation of contract in violation of section 10 of article I of the United States Constitution.  Whether it is a lien senior to the mortgages does not concern plaintiff.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Plaintiffs' claims, that the particular charges fixed by the commissioner, the method of fixing them, and that any charge at all are unreasonable, are overruled.  There is no element of deprivation here or even of taxation but merely one of contract into which plaintiffs might or might not enter.  They could use the sewer or not, as they chose.  If they used it, they were required to pay the rental fixed by the city.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The argument that the city might have chosen a different and better method for raising the funds necessary to defray the cost of constructing sewage treatment and disposal plants, presents a question of legislative wisdom in the choice of a plan and not of its legality which alone is the subject of judicial interpretation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. The allegation that the dollar yield of the rent charge will be far in excess of what is required contrary to the limited purposes of the enabling statutes is conclusory, is unsupported by anything in the pleadings, and is prophesy rather than fact.  The law is designed&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to accomplish a legitimate purpose. There is no constitutional infirmity in the statutes on any of the grounds raised by plaintiffs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. The complaint alleges consumption by one plaintiff of 95% of water as an industrial user with a return of only 5% of the water to the sewer. It is claimed that one sixth instead of one third of the water tax would be a fair and reasonable basis for fixing the sewer rental charge.  The law, rules and regulations of the commissioner of water supply, gas and electricity together make special provision for industrial users such as ice manufacturers, whose manufacturing processes use up the water and return only the unconsumed part to the sewer. The commissioner is authorized to make such investigation and to hold hearings as he deems necessary in order to find a proper basis for the rental charge to be made to industrial users, and to notify the user of his determination.  The user may then demand a hearing, after which hearing the commissioner shall notify the user of his final determination.  His determination may then be reviewed under article 78 of the Civil Practice Act.  These procedures insure plaintiffs an opportunity to be heard.  The allegation&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of the complaint that plaintiffs have no adequate remedy at law is completely negated.  Under such circumstances the court should not take jurisdiction.  It is undesirable to permit a party to seek a declaratory judgment before his case is heard by an administrative agency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. Since the prayer for relief does not seek a determination of the issues as to whether plaintiffs' sewer rent should be 5% or some other percentage of the standard sewer rent of one third of the water tax and even though there still remain in the complaint sufficient allegations to state a cause of action on whether the standards laid down by the statute have been applied properly or fairly, an issue which plaintiffs have a right to raise, it cannot be litigated in this action for declaratory judgment. This is especially so since the plaintiff has no adequate remedy at law and the prayer of the complaint for relief does not encompass the request for judgment on this issue.  The complaint should be dismissed.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The stockholder claimed that the amendments were against both Ohio and New York public policy and that they illegally attempted retroactively to alter vested rights belonging to the stockholder at the time the amendments were adopted. The court held that the stockholder did not substantiate its contentions that the amendments violated either Ohio or New York law. The court pointed out that the very case the stockholder cited for the contention that restrictions imposed on the stock's alienability were invalid was authority to the contrary. The court noted that the questioned by-law interposed no permanent impediment to transfer, providing only for an option in the directors for 30 days as a reasonable opportunity to dispose of stock to persons deemed desirable as holders. The court concluded that the corporation's pre-emptive right could be exercised only in a case where the stockholder desired or was required to sell and, in that event, he was guaranteed the fair cash value of the stock as determined by a court. The court rejected the stockholder's contentions that the by-laws violated the Uniform Stock Transfer Act and that the penalty provided by an Ohio statute was exclusive.</SPAN></P>

Under the constitutional provision, membership in any pension or retirement system of the state or of a civil division was to be a contractual relationship, the benefits of which were not to be diminished or impaired. The court held that, under the local law, a retiring member was required to give 30 days of notice of his impending retirement and was required to file his application with the Trustees. The court also found that the Trustees had the authority to deny a pension if the retiring member's term of office was forfeited prior to the retirement date. The court determined that it was not permitted to construe the words of the constitution in exactly the same manner as it would construe the words of a will. The court held that it was required to seek the meaning, which the words would have conveyed to an intelligent, careful voter.

The court held that the property owner was entitled to judgment as demanded because the evidence was insufficient to show that the ordinance was needed for the protection of public morals, public safety, or public health. The ordinance was an unwarranted intrusion on the private ownership of property and deprived the property owner of the appropriate use and enjoyment of his land.

The constitution only demanded that the statute should not be unreasonable, arbitrary, or capricious, and that the means selected should have a substantial relationship to the object sought to be attained. The court found that the ordinance at issue was reasonable and that its enforcement method did not conflict with guaranteed constitutional rights. The ordinance limited parking to one hour to keep traffic moving, to minimize traffic congestion, and to eliminate traffic dangers. To allow parking for a shorter period than the one-hour maximum encouraged motorists to limits their parking. Parking on city streets was a privilege and the ordinance fixed reasonable limitations, along with reasonable enforcement methods. The ordinance did not usurp any constitutional rights.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner New York State Superintendent of Insurance filed a complaint with the court that requested the dissolution of respondent fraternal benefit society's corporate existence pursuant to N.Y. Ins. Law &sect; 511(e) on the basis that the corporation's further transaction of business would have been hazardous to its policyholders, to its creditors, and to the public because the society was dominated by Communists and had revolutionary goals.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found that the right of the Communist party to function as a political party was not an issue before the court. The court held that the issue was whether the society, which was a political group, could properly organize itself in the guise of a fraternal benefit society and carry on its political activities using the facade of its insurance functions. The court found that the corporate existence of the society could not properly continue because when the insurance function of the corporation was subjected to a competing political objective, a hazard was created to the corporation's insurance functions. The court held that immediate insolvency of the corporation was not required for liquidation under N.Y. Ins. Law &sect; 511(e). The court found that other financial hazards qualified the corporation for liquidation under &sect; 511(e). The court found that the Communist party's goals and activities were a sufficient financial hazard to the corporation because the political affiliation raised a serious threat of decline in membership and a serious threat to its financial structure. The court held that the political climate was an important factor in its determination.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Respondent corporation was organized in 1930 as a fraternal benefit society under the Insurance Law. Although solvent and carrying on fraternal, social and other altruistic purposes for the benefit of its members, it has so far departed from its charter as to become a political organization acting as a front for the Communist party of the United States and its charter should be revoked, its business liquidated, and its corporate existence dissolved pursuant to paragraph (e) of section 511 of the Insurance Law since it is in such condition that &quot;its further transaction of business will be hazardous to its policyholders, or to its creditors, or to the public&quot;.  (Pp. 966, 967, 968, 970.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. In connection with the hearing which was had before the court, the Superintendent of Insurance offered in evidence the action of the Attorney General of the United States in listing respondent as a subversive organization.  The court will not consider such listing as having any bearing upon the determination of the issues involved in this litigation since the action of the Attorney General did not constitute due process.  (P. 946.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Writings of most of respondent's officers printed in the official publications of respondent have a high probative value since their credibility is not open to challenge on the ground of personal or ideological bias or financial interest.  (P. 948.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The corporate officers, nine of the ten presently in office having been identified as members of the Communist party, were acting in the Communist party not solely in a personal capacity but were acting as officers of respondent.  The evidence showed that these activities of the officers represented no individual frolic of the officers, no sporadic excursion into social activities, no intermittent campaigns for social betterment, but did constitute an essential part -- a persistent and a consistent part -- of the corporate activity during the period in question.  The corporation cannot disavow such conduct nor responsibility for it on the ground that it was not authorized by formal resolution of the governing body.  (Pp. 960, 963, 965.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. The overwhelming weight of evidence indicates that the insurance and social reform activities of respondent served to lure with calculated design into the society a great mass of workers to expose&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  them to communist teachings and doctrines and bring them within the sphere of the Communist party.  (Pp. 964-965.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. The language of section 511 directing the Superintendent of Insurance to apply for an order dissolving a fraternal benefit society on the ground that its further transaction of business will be &quot;hazardous&quot; to its policyholders, creditors, or to the public was not intended to refer solely to imminent or actual insolvency arising out of the insurance operations.  The word &quot;hazardous&quot; in the statute, broadly construed, extends not only to the solvency of the society but to the details of the management, internal organization, practices and personnel.  Since it appears that respondent is dominated and controlled by the Communist party, that its responsible officers are active members of the Communist party, and that its assets are liquid, if the time arrives when there is a conflict between the interests of this country and the world of communism, it is not beyond the realm of reasonable probability that the funds of the society will be expropriated.  This then is a substantial financial hazard. Moreover should respondent be prosecuted under the Smith Act (U.S. Code, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  tit. 18, &sect; 2385) for its active participation in the program of the Communist party with full knowledge of its nature, a serious threat to respondent would arise by reason of a decline in membership and its effect upon respondent's financial structure.  (Pp. 968, 970, 972.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. Respondent was organized as a fraternal benefit society but the evidence shows that it exceeded or abused its powers.  In setting forth in its charter the usual purposes of a fraternal benefit society, respondent was perpetrating a fraud upon the State since the official publications announcing its formation indicated that it was a revolutionary group with a clearly prescribed political program.  Accordingly, respondent's charter does not contain a true statement of its purposes and the original filing was in violation of section 463 of the Insurance Law. (P. 974.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. The Superintendent of Insurance need not await conviction of respondent for violation of the Federal Smith Act or of the Criminal Anarchy Act of New York (Penal Law, &sect;&sect; 160-166) before proceeding under the Insurance Law. (P. 975.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. Violation of a Federal law subjects respondents to action by the Superintendent of Insurance, for under the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Federal Constitution (art. VI, cl. 2) a Federal law is as much a law of the State as any law enacted by the State itself.  (P. 976.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">10. In these proceedings, the court sits as a trier of the facts as presented by petitioner and respondent.  It is not limited to the allegations in the report of the examiner of the Department of Insurance or to allegations adduced at the hearing before the superintendent or to the superintendent's conclusions or recommendations.  Any valid objection to the content of the examiner's report on the ground of inclusion of material of questionable probative value was met by the amendment of the report after the hearing before the deputy superintendent. No evidence was considered which did not strictly conform to the rules of evidence.  All of the requirements of due process have been met.  (Pp. 976-977.)</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The States brought an action against defendant national bank to enjoin defendant from the use of the word &quot;saving&quot; or &quot;savings&quot; in its publicity and from holding itself out as a savings bank and to determine the constitutionality of N.Y. Banking Law &sect; 258(1).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State brought an action against defendant national bank in which plaintiff contended that N.Y. Banking Law &sect; 258(1) prohibited defendant from using &quot;saving&quot; or &quot;savings&quot; or their equivalent in its business or in soliciting or receiving deposits as a savings bank. Defendant had been using &quot;saving&quot; and &quot;savings&quot; in its business and it had solicited accounts by forms of publicity in which it used the words &quot;saving&quot; and &quot;savings.&quot; The State demanded a permanent injunction against defendant restraining it from using those words in its advertising and its business. The court tested the constitutionality of the statute against the statute that created defendant, the Federal Reserve Act, 12 U.S.C.S. &sect; 371. The court found the state statute was restrictive and it defeated the purposes for which defendant was created. Therefore, the court held N.Y. Banking Law &sect; 258(1) to be unconstitutional.

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Subdivision 1 of section 258 of the Banking Law provides that no national bank shall use the word &quot;saving&quot; or &quot;savings&quot; in its banking business or in any advertisement, and that no corporation other than a savings bank should receive deposits as a savings bank. The section further provides that any national bank violating the section should forfeit to the People of the State for every offense $ 100 for every day that the offense continues.  In an action by the People to enjoin a national bank from using the word &quot;saving&quot; or &quot;savings&quot; in its publicity and from holding itself out as a savings bank, the complaint should be dismissed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Section 371 of title 12 of the United States Code (Federal Reserve Act) provides that a national bank has power to solicit and receive &quot;savings deposits&quot;. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Since subdivision 1 of section 258 of the Banking Law is not in harmony with section 371 of title 12 of the United States Code, the State law must yield to the Federal law and the State law is declared unconstitutional (U.S. Const., art. VI).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. To prove that the public did not understand that the words &quot;thrift account&quot;, &quot;compound interest&quot;, and &quot;special interest&quot; had the same meaning as &quot;savings account&quot; and that &quot;savings account&quot; was understood for what it really was, defendant offered testimony as to a sample poll. Such testimony of the poll was properly received.  It is original evidence and not hearsay. A party endeavoring to establish the public state of mind on a subject, which state of mind cannot be proved except by calling as witnesses so many of the public as to render the task impracticable, may offer evidence of a poll. The evidence should include calling the planners, supervisors, and workers (or some of them) as witnesses so that the court may see and hear them; and should also include the work sheets, reports, surveys and all documents used in or prepared during the poll taking and those showing its results.  Such evidence of the poll in this instance draws conclusions&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  worthy of consideration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The evidence shows that defendant national bank could not function without &quot;savings deposits&quot;.  Crippling objections placed by a State statute against defendant bank amounts to impairment of defendant's banking business. Thus the prohibition of the statute against signs, printing, advertising or publicity containing the word &quot;saving&quot; or &quot;savings&quot;, restricts defendant in obtaining savings deposits and curtails the power granted it by Congress.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Subdivision 1 of section 258 of the Banking Law is not an exercise of police power in view of the fact that deposits (up to $ 10,000) in national banks are insured Federally the same as savings banks' deposits are insured (up to $ 10,000).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. Under the Federal Reserve Act the authority to receive &quot;savings deposits&quot; implies the power to advertise its right to receive savings deposits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. The contention that when Congress amended the Federal Reserve Act to empower a national bank to receive &quot;savings deposits&quot; such amendment was futile because national banks were receiving what actually were savings deposits by virtue of their authority to receive &quot;time deposits&quot; is overruled.  Congress intended by the amendment&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to remove any doubt as to the right of national banks to receive savings deposits. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff cemetery corporation filed an action in equity against defendants, town board of assessors and county treasurer, to remove a cloud on its title to real property occasioned by the issuance of assessments, pursuant to N.Y.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The corporation filed an equity action to remove a cloud on its title to cemetery property located in the town that was occasioned by assessments made under an unconstitutional statute. The court granted judgment for the town board and county treasurer dismissing the complaint because the corporation failed to prove its right to a property exemption. The court held that &sect; 4(6-a), which was conditioned on a designated census, had a valid and reasonable basis of protecting taxpayers in a sparsely populated county where there was no need to reserve excessively large acreage for cemetery purposes. The court applied the maxim of unclean hands to deny equitable relief because the corporation's financial manipulations demonstrated a lack of good faith and its activities were tainted with commercialism. The court found that the cemetery was a guise to cover an undertaking for profit, given evidence of the corporation's issuance of certificates of indebtedness for a palpably inadequate consideration, intimate relationship with profit-making corporations, and failure to follow the requirements of the New York Membership Corporations Law.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Cemeteries -- exemption from taxation -- (1) action in equity by cemetery corporation against board of assessors to remove assessments as cloud on title proper, since assessments claimed to be </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">unconstitutional;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> remedy of certiorari not exclusive remedy -- (2) in prior certiorari proceeding, assessment on property held to be illegal; findings in former proceeding not res judicata on issue of constitutionality where </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">statute</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> changed since prior proceeding -- (3) Legislature validly anchored tax exemption for cemetery property to population of a county as determined by 1930Federal census -- (4) evidence establishes that plaintiff was profit-making corporation; plaintiff not entitled to exemption from taxation; complaint dismissed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. An action in equity by the owner of cemetery property located in Putnam County against the board of assessors of a town to remove, as a cloud on title, allegedly illegal assessments on the property, is a proper remedy. Apart from the claim that plaintiff is a&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  legitimate nonprofit-making cemetery corporation entitled to tax exemption, plaintiff maintains that the assessments were made pursuant to an unconstitutional statute and that consequently the assessments are illegal. Under such circumstances the remedy of certiorari under the Tax Law ( &sect; 290 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">et seq.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">) is not the sole and exclusive remedy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. An earlier assessment against the cemetery property had been held to be improper in a certiorari proceeding. The findings in said proceeding are not </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">res judicata</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> here on the issue of constitutionality inasmuch as a substantial change in the statute occurred in 1939 between the date of the former proceeding and this one.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Subdivision 6-a of section 4 of the Tax Law, as amended in 1939, protects the taxpayers of a sparsely populated county, such as Putnam County, from a reservation of excessively large acreage for cemetery purposes by taking away, from the owner of cemetery property in such a county, exemption from taxation. Such statute is constitutional. It was reasonable for the Legislature to grant exemption to property in a county having a specified population according to the 1930 Federal census, irrespective of later population&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  changes in the county.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The evidence establishes that plaintiff was organized for the purpose of realizing pecuniary profit for the corporation, its directors, officers and transferees. The issuance and reissuance of certificates of indebtedness for inadequate consideration, the relation existing between plaintiff and other profit-making corporations, with interlocking directors and officers, the failure of plaintiff to follow the requirements of the Membership Corporations Law governing conduct of such corporations establish that the cloak assumed by plaintiff was a pretense to cover a commercial undertaking. Plaintiff has failed to sustain the burden of establishing its right to a property exemption by clear and convincing proof that it is not profit-making in character. Plaintiff comes into court with unclean hands and is entitled to no affirmative equitable relief. The complaint should be dismissed.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant executors sought review of an order of the New York State Tax Commission that fixed the estate tax to be paid for a decedent's estate.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When fixing the state taxes to be paid by the executors on a decedent's estate the Commission included in the gross taxable estate the assets of an inter vivos trust established by the decedent. The executors appealed, and the court affirmed. It was an established legislative policy of New York to conform its estate tax law, so far as possible, to the provisions of the federal estate tax law. In determining, therefore, the effect of provisions of the New York estate tax law similar to those of the federal estate tax law, it was the policy of the court to give great weight to the federal decisions construing comparable provisions of the federal statutes. A federal case construing a similar federal law pertaining to the taxability of trusts held that a trust fund was required to be included in a decedent's gross taxable estate, and the right to receive the income from the trust property reserved by the grantor was a property right which passed to the remaindermen upon the grantor's death.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the order fixing the estate tax.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Taxation -- estate tax -- inclusion of irrevocable trust made in 1930 in gross taxable estate -- (1) decedent created irrevocable trust in 1930, income of which payable to wife and, upon her death, income payable to decedent; upon death of survivor, principal was to be distributed to others, not including decedent or his estate; decedent died in 1947; New York estate tax appraiser in his report included trust assets in gross taxable estate; appeal of executors from pro forma order fixing estate tax denied -- (2) Tax Law (art. 10-C) governs trust created prior to enactment of article 10-C where settlor died after </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">statute</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> applicable -- (3) Supreme Court in 1949 in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Commissioner of Internal Revenue v.

Ed. 288)</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> decided that such trust should be included in gross taxable estate; Congress, by Technical Changes Act of 1949, relieved estate from Federal tax because of hardship; amendment to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Tax Law (&sect; 249-r</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">) conformed New York law to Federal law, but was made applicable to estates of persons dying after April 30, 1950; application of Church decision would require holding that</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> tax on trust became due on date of death in 1947; amended section 249-r inapplicable, decedent having died prior to April 30, 1950.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Decedent in 1930 executed an irrevocable trust agreement which gave the income to his wife for life and, upon her death, made such income payable to decedent during his life and directed that upon the death of the survivor, the principal of the trust was to be distributed to various individuals, not including decedent or his estate.  Decedent died on August 20, 1947.  The New York estate tax appraiser in his report included the assets of said trust in the gross taxable estate. The appeal of the executors from the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">pro forma</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> order fixing the estate tax should be denied and the order upheld.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Decedent having died in the year 1947, article 10-C of the Tax Law, by its express terms, is applicable to this trust, created in 1930.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. In 1930, the United States Supreme Court in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">May </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">v.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11"> Heiner</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (281 U.S. 238, 74 L. Ed. 826, 50 S. Ct. 286) held that a transfer by a decedent in trust reserving income to her, with remainder to her children, their distributees or appointees, was not a gift to take effect in possession or enjoyment at her death, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and such trust was therefore held not taxable under the Federal Revenue Act. Thereafter the Federal Revenue Act was amended to provide that a trust which reserved to the trustor for life the income from the property should be included in the gross estate.  New York enacted a comparable amendment to section 249-r of article 10-C of the Tax Law (eff. March 10, 1931).  Under such amended New York statute, the New York courts held that the legislation was prospective only and refused to include, in the gross taxable estate, assets of irrevocable </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">inter vivos</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> trusts with reserved life estates to the donors created prior to March 10, 19 31.  In January, 1949, in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Commissioner of Internal Revenue </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">v.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11"> Estate of Church</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (335 U.S. 632, 69 S. Ct. 322, 93 L. Ed. 288), the United States Supreme Court reversed itself and held that such a trust wherein the donor reserved the income for life should be included in the gross taxable estate. The court also held that possession or enjoyment took place upon death.  By the Technical Changes Act of 1949 (63 U.S. Stat. 894), in order to prevent hardship upon persons who had relied upon the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">May </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">v.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11"> Heiner</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> interpretation, Congress exempted&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the estates of persons creating such trusts who diedbefore January 1, 1950.  Decedent herein having died in 1947, there was refunded to his estate, under the Technical Changes Act, the amount of the Federal tax on the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">inter vivos</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> trust which had been included in the gross taxable estate under the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Church</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> decision.  New York thereafter amended section 249-r of the Tax Law by chapter 683 of the Laws of 1950.  Section 249-r, as amended, was intended to grant relief similar to that contained in the Federal Technical Changes Act, except that its application was limited to estates of decedents dying after April 30, 1950, in view of section 8 of article VII of the State Constitution which prevents the giving of money of the State to any private undertaking, and has been construed as forbidding any retroactive reduction of tax liability already accrued. The transfer here in question made in 1930, took effect in possession or enjoyment at the time of decedent's death in 1947, and the tax on this estate accrued at the time of decedent's death in 1947.  The assets of the trust are therefore taxable by New York.  </SPAN></P>

The revised rate schedule became effective under orders of the public service commission. The companies contended that the new rates were not as profitable as the prior rate, that they were prohibited from obtaining additional customers, and that this prohibition was violative of their constitutional rights. The court held that the companies did not set forth any contractual obligation on the part of the utility corporation to continue supplying them with electricity at the lower rates. The utility corporation was required by federal and state law to charge the rates prescribed by the effective rate schedules. Further, it was not a requirement of due process that there be a judicial inquiry before the discretion of an administrative body was exercised. The companies' grievance related to the reasonableness of the rates and that issue was one to be determined by the public service commission. Therefore, the application for injunctive relief was denied and the corporation's cross-motion to dismiss was granted.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The gasoline station owner had used the property as a gasoline service station as a continuous use for many years until the president of the gasoline station owner was in military service for several years. After the end of the war, the gasoline station owner attempted to re-rent or to sell the property for use as a gasoline station, but the property had become dilapidated. The gasoline station owner applied for a building permit to erect a gasoline service station. The village clerk denied the application because the area was zoned for residential single family dwellings under Village of Old Westbury, N.Y., Zoning Ordinance &sect; 301. The gasoline station owner appealed to the board, which denied the appeal after a hearing. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court found that normally for a nonconforming use to be resumed after a period of nonuse, the use must not have been abandoned. The court found that there was no affirmative act on the part of the gasoline station owner to constitute abandonment. The court concluded, however, that under &sect; 900(4), there was no requirement for abandonment and the court found the section to be constitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the order of the board, which affirmed the denial by the village clerk of a permit to erect a gasoline service station on the property of the gasoline station owner.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. A zoning ordinance of a village provided that a nonconforming use which had been discontinued for a period exceeding twelve months should not be resumed. Prior to 1942 petitioner had operated a gasoline service station as a nonconforming use in a residential area.  In 1942, by reason of the restrictions imposed on the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  use of gasoline by the war, petitioner and its tenants were unable to operate the station. After the war petitioner attempted again to use the land for a gasoline station. A hearing disclosed that the station has not been operated as such since 1942.  On this application by petitioner for an order directing the board of zoning appeals to issue a license to it to use the premises as a gasoline station as a nonconforming use, the denial of such use by the board of zoning appeals should be affirmed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The provisions of the zoning ordinance which abolish a nonconforming use after &quot;nonuser&quot; of twelve months is valid and constitutional, and the period of twelve months of nonuser is a reasonable one.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowner acquired the premises long after the Village adopted a zoning ordinance that prohibited gasoline service stations in the Village's business district or within 200 feet of the exit or entrance to a playground. The landowner applied to the Village's board of zoning appeals for a variance. After the variance was denied, the landowner sought a mandamus order on the ground that these provisions of the zoning ordinance were unconstitutional. The court determined that the Village's board of trustees had the power and authority to divide the Village into districts for zoning purposes and that the exclusion of gasoline service stations from business districts was a matter within the Village's police power because they presented an increased fire hazard. Noting a presumption that the ordinance was constitutional and that courts could not pronounce an ordinance invalid unless able to see that there was no real, substantial evil of public interest to be guarded against, the court declined to substitute its judgment for that of the Village's board of trustees and ruled that the challenged provisions of ordinance were not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner, a candidate for election, filed an application under N.Y. Civil Prac. Act art. 78 for an order cancelling an action of a village board of trustees that declared the candidate ineligible for election and restraining the board from taking any further action in relation to the election. The candidate sought an order that restrained respondent, a trustee-elect, from taking part in the matters and affairs of the board as a member.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The village trustees filed a motion to dismiss the petition and a motion to strike two paragraphs of the petition. The candidate alleged that at a village election for village trustees, he was one of the three highest candidates out of six who contended for the three offices. He alleged that following the election the board met as a board of canvassers and that, in addition, the board declared that the candidate was ineligible for election because he was not the owner of record of real property within the village. He alleged that he was an owner of record of real property within the village and that the trustee-elect was declared elected in his place. The court held that the trustees had no power to nullify the election of the candidate nor declare the election of the trustee-elect because the election returns did not show that the trustee-elect was elected and because the vacancies arose as a result of the expiration of the terms of the predecessors as village trustees. The court also held that the trustees' declaration that the candidate was ineligible could not be sustained because the court could not determine that the candidate was not eligible except by quo warranto.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Elections -- trustees of village -- eligibility of candidate for office -- (1) after election for three vacancies in office of village trustee, board of trustees met, and although petitioner was one of three receiving highest votes, board declared petitioner ineligible as not being property owner and declared one of respondents elected; duties of board of trustees acting as canvassers were ministerial; board lacked power to declare petitioner ineligible and to declare respondent elected -- (2) petition alleges that petitioner was owner of property; such allegation sufficient to show that petitioner &quot;owner of record&quot; of real property within Village Law (&sect; 42); question of eligibility of petitioner under section 42 cannot be determined in this proceeding but only in quo warranto proceedings -- (3) action of trustees in declaring petitioner ineligible not justified under </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Public Officers Law (&sect; 5</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">) -- (4) court has power to direct board of trustees to perform duties as board of canvassers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. A board of trustees of a village after an election wherein six candidates competed for three vacancies for the office of village&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  trustee declared petitioner ineligible for the office of trustee although petitioner received more votes than one of respondents and declared one of respondents elected to said office.  Under section 53 of the Village Law, the trustees of the village became a board of canvassers and had the duty of listing all votes cast for each office, the name of each candidate, the number of votes cast for each, and of determining which person by the greatest number of votes was elected to each office.  In so acting, the board of canvassers acts in a ministerial capacity only.  The board of canvassers had no power to nullify the election of petitioner and to declare respondent elected. The Legislature by fixing time limitations in the Village Law (&sect;&sect; 53-59) intended that the question of eligibility could not be determined at the meeting of the board of trustees held &quot;not later than eight o'clock in the evening of the next day after the election&quot;, but only after the village clerk &quot;within three days after the election&quot; has notified such person of his election and his requirement to file his oath of office and furnish proof of his eligibility.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The board of trustees was unauthorized to declare&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  petitioner ineligible under section 42 of the Village Law on the ground that he was not a property owner, in the face of the paragraph in the petition which alleged that petitioner prior to and after the date of the election was the owner of property within the village. While the petition does not allege that petitioner was at the time of his election &quot;an owner of record&quot; of title to real property in the village, such paragraph in the petition may be construed to mean just that.  The failure of the Village Law to state how record ownership of real property may be evidenced, which the Town Law (&sect; 23-a) does, indicates a legislative intention that evidence of record ownership under the Village Law should not be of the same character as that required under the Town Law. Accordingly in this proceeding, the court cannot determine that petitioner was not eligible to the office of village trustee. In the absence of any definition in the Village Law of what constitutes &quot;record ownership&quot; the assessment rolls may be deemed to be public records.  The question of eligibility under the Village Law (&sect; 42) cannot be determined in this proceeding, but only in quo warranto proceedings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  action of the trustees in declaring petitioner ineligible may not be justified under section 5 of the Public Officers Law which provides for holding over after expiration of term by an incumbent until his successor is designated or chosen.  Since there were three incumbents whose terms expired and six candidates contested for the three offices, it cannot be said that respondent was the incumbent of the office for which petitioner received a majority vote.  There being three vacancies, the court cannot determine who the incumbent is.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Since the trustees failed to perform the duty enjoined upon them by law as canvassers, this court must direct them to perform.  The court has jurisdiction both under article 14 of the Election Law and article 78 of the Civil Practice Act to compel election officers to perform their duties.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In an action of plaintiff, an apartment owner, for a declaratory judgment as to N.Y. State Residential Rent Law &sect; 7, the apartment owner filed a motion to strike out first and second affirmative defenses, as insufficient in law, in response to an answer filed by defendant, the State Rent Administrator, as Temporary State Housing Rent Commission, and in response to a cross-motion filed by defendant for an order granting judgment on pleadings.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The apartment owner argued that a state rent law exempting from control all housing accommodations built after February 1, 1947 was unconstitutional and void in so far as it may have applied to a vacant apartment in his house constructed prior to February 1, 1947. The court noted that the Federal Rent Control Statutes enacted in 1947 exempted accommodations completed after February 1, 1947 from controls of statutes. It was determined that the state government thereafter assumed duties of housing rent control, in a 1950 state statute, fixing maximum rental on houses and apartments unoccupied or occupied, which retained exemption based on February 1, 1947. The court found this was reasonable protection to landlords who built houses in reliance on the Federal Act and was not arbitrary and discriminatory. The Administrator's defense reciting necessity in public health and emergency for law and the appropriateness of law to meet the situation was necessary to show the reason for the Act and was a sufficient defense as against the motion to strike.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied the motion to strike of the apartment owner and granted the motion for judgment on pleadings of the State Rent Administrator.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional law -- landlord and tenant -- rent regulation -- (1) vacant apartments, as well as occupied ones, are validly subject to rent control (L. 1950, ch. 250) -- (2) housing accommodations erected after February 1, 1947, are validly exempted from State rent control (by L. 1950, ch. 250) -- (3) since landlord seeks judgment declaring </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">statute</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> unconstitutional,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> she need not go through procedure provided in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">statute</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> for protest to State Rent Administrator against regulation; complaint dismissed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Vacant apartments, as well as occupied ones, are validly and constitutionally subject to rent control during the declared public emergency in housing (L. 1950, ch. 250).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Housing accommodations erected after February 1, 1947, are validly and constitutionally exempted from State rent control (by L. 1950, ch. 250).  When, by that act, the State took over Federal rent control in 1950, housing&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  erected after February 1, 1947, was exempt under the Federal Housing and Rent Act of 1947; and the Legislature doubtlessly had in mind the protection of those landlords who in good faith had built houses in reliance on the Federal exemption.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Judgment on the pleadings is granted to defendant, the State Rent Administrator, dismissing the complaint in this action brought by a landlord for a judgment declaring the State Residential Rent Law unconstitutional in the above respects.  The defense that the statute is a reasonable exercise of the State's police power is sufficient.  However, since plaintiff attacked the statute itself, it was not necessary for plaintiff first to go through the procedure which the statute provides for a protest to the Administrator against a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">regulation</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.  </SPAN></P>

The court overturned defendant's conviction, holding that: (1) the intent of the framers of the ordinance was to prevent the littering of the village streets with circulars, cards, and handbills; (2) the true intent of the legislature in enacting the ordinance was to prohibit the distributing upon the streets of only handbills, circulars, or cards containing commercial advertising matter and the distributing upon the streets of any commercial advertising matter through any means whatsoever; (3) the ordinance in and of itself was valid; (4) in publishing and distributing the circular, defendant attempted to bring attention to her views on local politics; and (4) the ordinance did not apply to the circulars distributed by defendant, as they could not be considered advertising material.</SPAN></P>

Under previous laws, the company brought a successful action in which it was held that the company was not engaged in the sale of electric, telephone, or telegraphic service with the meaning of the then-existing tax laws.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">About 90 percent of the company's gross income was attributable to certain protective and alarm services it provided through the use of electric wires and impulses. The company brought an action to determine whether such income was thus taxable under N.Y. Admin. Code &sect; Q41-1.0. The company sought to recover a sum of taxes paid under protest, with interest, and to obtain declaratory and injunctive relief such that the company would not be required to make any further payments on the utility excise tax and to restrain defendants and their successors from attempting to enforce such tax against the company. The court held that in order to determine whether the services furnished by the company came within the meaning of the words &quot;telegraph service,&quot; as defined under &sect; Q41-1.0, the evidence regarding the devices and facilities used by the company tended to demonstrate the extent to which the services sold and furnished by the company required the use of electric or telegraph wires in the transmission of messages, signals, and alarms. The court thus concluded that the company was literally within the class of business activities subject to the utility excise tax.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied the company's request for declaratory and injunctive relief, dismissed the complaint, and entered judgment for defendants.

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. A local law was am ended in 1938 to impose a utility excise tax (Administrative Code of City of N. Y., &sect; Q41-2.0) upon persons furnishing or selling &quot;telegraph service&quot;.  The local law (Administrative Code of City of New York, &sect; Q41-1.0) defines &quot;telegraph service&quot; as &quot;any service requiring the use of electric or telegraph wires * * * in the transmission of messages, signals, alarms, * * *.&quot; Plaintiff's business is the protection of its customers' premises against burglary or unauthorized entry. It provides electric protective service in which plaintiff wires the premises to be protected so that on disturbance of the circuit an electric alarm signal is sent out to plaintiff's offices from which a guard is dispatched to ascertain the cause of the disturbance. A portion of the connecting wires either leased or owned by plaintiff runs under the streets of the city of New York.  Plaintiff's income is measured by the number of units wired for protection.  The services sold by plaintiff necessarily require the use of electric or telegraph wires for the transmission of messages, signals and alarms, and therefore&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  plaintiff is literally within the class of business activities subject to the utility excise tax.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Using propriety and justice as guides to the true legislative intent, since plaintiff has long enjoyed special rights and privileges in the use of public streets of defendant city for its electric wires, the 1938 local law was enacted by the legislature of the city to require corporations such as plaintiff to pay such utility excise tax.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The definition of &quot;telegraph service&quot; adopted in 1938 was intended to bring within the scope of the utility excise tax, businesses such as that conducted by plaintiff.  In view of the purpose and pattern of the utility excise tax to include those enterprises, whether utility or otherwise, which are in the nature of utilities because they profit from the use of public property, franchises, facilities or other special privilege, plaintiff, being in the nature of a utility, properly comes within that class of taxpayers defined by the utility excise tax as utilities and quasi-utilities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The tax is not invalid as based on an arbitrary classification.  Plaintiff's enterprise by enjoying special benefits and use of property belonging to the public&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  can hardly complain that a tax premised upon this characteristic is an arbitrary and invalid classification.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Section 20-b of the General City Law (added by L. 1937, ch. 321) empowered municipalities to adopt local laws imposing a tax such as was imposed by section 186-a of the Tax Law. Section 186-a of the Tax Law authorized a State utility tax in language identical with that contained in the New York City utility excise tax law prior to its amendment in 1938.  Plaintiff contends that since the courts have held that the local law prior to 1938 did not impose a utility tax upon it, section 20-b of the General City Law prevented the city of New York from adopting an ordinance which would extend its tax to an enterprise such as plaintiff's.  A review of the historical background leading to the adoption of section 186-a of the Tax Law and section 20-b of the General City Law shows that it was not intended and it was nowhere stated that the State's enactment served to freeze as of 1937 the tax on enterprises which could be taxed by municipalities. </SPAN></P>

Part of the building on these premises encroached upon a street laid out on a final city map but which did not yet exist. The grantee filed suit to recover damages for breach of covenant and the grantor filed a motion to dismiss. The grantor asserted that the deed was subject to all covenants and restrictions of record, that the grantee had knowledge of the existing incumbrance, and the grantee was charged with knowledge of the public records. The court granted summary judgment in favor of the grantee. It held that the easement of the public highway was neither a covenant or restriction of record, that neither party claimed to have actual knowledge of the easement, and that the grantee did not have constructive notice from the physical appearance because the street was not physically open, visible, and in use, and that the grantee was not charged with knowledge of prior grants or easements of record.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Defendants sold a parcel of real property, including a building thereon which encroached upon the street as laid out on a final map, under a full covenant and warranty deed. In an action to recover damages for breach of such covenants it appears that no permit was obtained from the board of appeals under section 35 of the General City Law and consequently the building as it now stands violates section 35.  Defendants' contention that section 35 is unconstitutional insofar as it deprives landowners of their rights in the bed of the street while they remained owners of the fee thereof should be rejected.  Since none of the parties has ever applied to the board of appeals for the permit mentioned in section 35, defendants are not in a position to question the constitutionality of the statute.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. No rights may be acquired under the building permit issued by the city's department of housing and buildings&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  since such permit was issued in violation of law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. A clause in the deed which provides that it was subject to the covenants and restrictions affecting said premises not violated by the existing building does not help defendants. The easement of the public highway pursuant to section 35 of the General City Law is neither a covenant nor restriction of record and even if it were, it is violated by the existing building.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. It is immaterial that plaintiff has not been evicted. An outstanding easement which materially impairs the value of the premises conveyed and interferes with the use and possession of some portions thereof is a breach of the covenant although there has not been a physical ouster from the actual possession of any portion thereof.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. A contention that the title is not unmarketable for the reason that a title company has insured the interest of a mortgagee is rejected.  Marketability is not determined by title companies but by the courts and an easement is an incumbrance which renders a title unmarketable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. Although an open and visible public highway would not be considered a breach of the covenant, here neither of the parties had actual knowledge of the easement&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  or constructive notice from the physical appearance of the premises.  The street is not physically open.  Plaintiff was not charged with knowledge of the public records including the official map of the city or with knowledge of prior grants or easements of record.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. Plaintiff is entitled to summary judgment, her damages being the difference between the value of the land without the servitude and with it.  The question of damages will be referred to an Official Referee or to a court and jury.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner private citizens applied for an order under N.Y. Civ. Prac. Act art. 78 to (a) compel respondent board of trustees to rescind the retirements of respondent detectives as deputy police commissioners and (b) direct the detectives to restore to the police pension fund payments that had been made to them after such retirement.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The detectives were members of the police force for more than 20 years when they each resigned their positions and were appointed deputy police commissioners. They each immediately applied for and were granted retirement with pensions for those new positions, pursuant to New York City, N.Y., Admin. Code &sect; B18-4.0. The citizens seeking to overturn the retirements claimed that the pensions for retirement as deputy police commissioners were improper gifts of public funds. In granting the petition in part, the court ruled that, by allowing immediate retirement upon receiving a promotion and increase in salary, &sect; B18-4.0(f) violated N.Y. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 1, which prohibited a municipality from giving public funds in aid of any individual. The statute provided an impermissible &quot;gift,&quot; that is, a voluntary transfer of money without consideration, and not a &quot;pension,&quot; because payments could not be for past service or meritorious work where the retirement was immediate. However, the proper remedy for restoration of the funds paid out was a taxpayer's action under N.Y. Gen. Mun. Law &sect; 51.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The petition was granted in part and denied in part, and the board was directed to rescind the retirements of the detectives as deputy police commissioners.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional law -- validity of pension provisions covering New York city deputy police commissioners -- (1) after twenty years' service, New York city first grade detectives resigned and immediately were appointed deputy police commissioners; each applied for retirement as commissioner and began to receive pension payments within 44 and 67 days respectively at half of salary of chief inspector which was more than full salary as first grade detective; pensions granted them pursuant to Administrative Code (&sect; B18-4.0, subd. f); subdivision funconstitutional since public funds given to individual in violation of State Constitution (art. VIII, subd. 1) -- (2) &quot;gift&quot; defined; &quot;pension&quot; defined -- (3) proceeding under Civil Practice Act (art. 78) proper since relief sought is to cancel invalid resolutions granting pension at half of chief inspector's salary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. First&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  grade detectives resigned after service on the police force of the city of New York for more than twenty years and were appointed, pursuant to subdivision f of section B18-4.0 of the Administrative Code, as deputy police commissioners.  Immediately upon being appointed, each applied for retirement and, pursuant to resolution of the board of trustees of the police pension fund, was granted an annual pension of $ 6,000, in one case within 44 days after promotion and in the other 67 days after promotion. Their salary as first grade detectives was $ 5,175 per annum.  Subdivision f of section B18-4.0 of the Administrative Code provides that any member of the police force who shall have performed duty on the force for twenty years and subsequently served as deputy police commissioner shall be retired and granted a pension allowed to a chief inspector on such date.  Subdivision c provides that any member of the force who shall have elected to contribute on the basis of retirement after twenty years as in the instant cases and who shall have performed service on the force for twenty years &quot;shall&quot; upon application be retired and granted an annual pension &quot;of not less than one half his full&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  salary&quot; at the date of his retirement from service.  Considering what has actually been done under subdivision f and what may reasonably be done under its authority, subdivision f is unconstitutional in that it violates subdivision 1 of article VIII of the State Constitution which prohibits a municipality from &quot;giving&quot; public funds to or in aid of any individual.  The statute cannot be regarded as a pension statute, for where a deputy police commissioner resigns almost immediately after appointment the periodic payments are not for past services or for meritorious work but are gifts of public funds without any consideration therefor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. A &quot;gift&quot; is a voluntary transfer of money or property by one to another without any consideration or compensation.  A &quot;pension&quot; is a periodic allowance made by a government to an individual or to those who represent him on account of past services or some meritorious work done by him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Since petitioners pray for an order directing the board of trustees of the police pension fund to rescind the resolutions retiring the detectives as deputy police commissioners at pensions of $ 6,000 annually, the proper remedy would appear to be a proceeding under&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  article 78 to compel the board of trustees to rescind the alleged illegal resolution especially where the question raised is one of public importance and concern.  Any private citizen has such an interest in the property and lawful administration of the police pension system as to enable him to maintain such proceeding and not be relegated to a taxpayer's action to prevent waste of public funds under section 51 of the General Municipal Law.  To the extent therefore that the petition seeks a rescission of the resolution, it is granted.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The issues raised were whether the commissioner had any authority to suspending the licenses of certain theatres because motions pictures shown at the theatres were personally offensive, and if so, whether the authority was capriciously or arbitrarily exercised. The court held that peace officers had no duties with respect to the content of films that had been licensed. Further, the court held that the commissioner was not the protector from affronts of a large portion of New York citizens or even of all of them. The court held that citizens could protect themselves first by ignoring the exhibition, and secondly, any individual could seek to have the board of regents revoke a theatre's permit. If a citizen could show that the license was granted through an abuse of power, the court would grant relief against such an abuse.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Theatres and shows -- revocation of license of theatre for exhibiting licensed motion picture -- (1) State Education Department exclusively has power to determine whether motion picture is sacrilegious; commissioner of licenses of city of New York lacks such power; suspension of license of theatre exhibiting licensed motion picture claimed to be sacrilegious by said commissioner vacated -- (2) peace officers must prosecute exhibitors of unlicensed films violating decency (Penal Law, &sect; 1141) but have no duties with respect to content of films already licensed (Education Law, &sect; 132).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Since the right to determine whether a motion picture is indecent, immoral or sacrilegious is vested exclusively in the State Education Department -- the Education Law (&sect;&sect; 120-132) providing complete regulations for review and license -- the commissioner of licenses of the city of New York was without power to suspend a license of a theatre which exhibited a motion picture licensed by the Education Department but found by the commissioner to have been blasphemous. A local law which purports to give such municipal officer regulatory&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  powers as to the content of films is unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Section 132 of the Education Law authorizes the Board of Regents to enforce part II of article III of the Education Law but does not relieve any State or local peace officer from detecting and prosecuting any violation of law. Although the Penal Law (&sect; 1141) forbids a criminal prosecution for the exhibition of a licensed motion picture, peace officers have duties in respect to films such as bringing to justice the exhibitor of an unlicensed film which offends against decency. They have no duties with respect to the content of films which have been licensed. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In plaintiff landlord's declaratory judgment action seeking to have declared unconstitutional the Residential Rent Law, 1946 N.Y. Laws ch. 274, defendant State Rent Administrator filed a motion to dismiss the complaint for legal insufficiency and for failure to state facts sufficient to justify the court's exercise of its discretionary jurisdiction. The landlord filed a cross-motion for judgment on the pleadings.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landlord raised a number of constitutional objections to the statute and regulations. The court held that her objections were devoid of merit. The court found that the legislature, after finding that a serious public emergency existed in the housing of a considerable number of persons in the state, concluded that landlords had to suffer a temporary restraint upon the right to withdraw their property from the rental market. The court further found that the legislature delegated to the State Rent Commission the authority to prescribe the mechanics for implementing its conclusion and that neither the delegation of the power, nor the manner in which the delegated power was exercised was unconstitutional. The court further found that the conditions imposed by the State Rent Commission in its regulations on the right of a landlord to obtain a certificate permitting him to withdraw occupied housing accommodations from the rental market were not objectionable.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied the landlord's motion and directed judgment on the pleadings be entered for the State Rent Administrator.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Landlord and tenant -- rent regulation -- constitutionality -- (1) declaratory judgment proper remedy to decree constitutionality of State rent law since no questions of fact involved -- (2) no </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">unconstitutional</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> delegation of power to State rent commission granted by sections of State Residential Rent Law (&sect; 4, subd. 2; &sect; 9, subd. 4) preventing landlords from withdrawing rental accommodations from market; manner of exercise of delegation of authority by commission not </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">unconstitutional</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> -- (3) judgment on pleadings granted in favor of State Rent Administrator on basis of motion therefor by plaintiff.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The remedy of declaratory judgment is appropriate in an action wherein plaintiff seeks to declare unconstitutional the State Residential Rent Law. A constitutional question is involved and there are no questions of fact.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Although a declaration of unconstitutionality of the entire law and regulations is sought, plaintiff's attack is principally against the provisions of the law and regulations preventing landlords&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  from withdrawing certain housing accommodations from the rental market (&sect; 4, subd. 2; &sect; 9, subd. 4; Regulations, &sect;&sect; 12, 59).  The delegation by the Legislature to the State rent commission of the authority to prescribe the mechanics for implementing the conclusion of the Legislature that landlords must suffer a temporary restraint upon the right to withdraw their property from the rental market renders neither the delegation of the power (&sect; 4) nor the manner in which the delegated power was exercised (&sect; 59) unconstitutional.  The conditions imposed by section 59 of the regulations on the right of a landlord to obtain a certificate permitting him to withdraw occupied housing accommodations from the rental market are not objectionable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The State Rent Administrator is entitled to judgment on the pleadings under section 476 of the Civil Practice Act and rule 112 of the Rules of Civil Practice on the basis of plaintiff's motion therefor.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner landlord commenced a summary proceeding to recover possession of respondent tenant's apartment for nonpayment of rent. The landlord claimed the tenant owed the higher amount of rent established under the Federal Housing and Rent Act of 1947 while the tenant claimed that the lower amount was due under the N.Y. Residential Rent Law, codified at 1950 N.Y. Laws ch. 250.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landlord brought a summary proceeding to recover possession of the apartment rented by the tenant for the tenant's nonpayment of rent. The landlord's action also demanded an award of the rent due by the tenant for the last month of the lease term. The landlord had applied for and received permission to raise the tenant's rent under the Act, and the landlord claimed the rental amount allowed under that application was due from the tenant. On the other hand the tenant asserted that the rent due was the lower amount authorized by the Law. The tenant had tendered that lower amount to the landlord, which the landlord refused to accept. The court entered judgment for the tenant on the issue of rent, finding that the lower amount was due and because the landlord had refused to accept that amount when tendered it was not longer entitled to the rent. The court held that under &sect; 21 of the regulations promulgated pursuant to the authority granted by N.Y. Residential Rent Law &sect; 4(2), 1950 N.Y. Laws ch. 250, where the maximum rent prescribed by the Act is higher than that set by the local laws of the city of New York, the lower ceiling shall prevail.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that the lower rent due under the state law prevailed over the higher amount due under the federal law. The court concluded that because the landlord refused to accept that lower amount as tendered by the tenant, a final order was entered for the tenant.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In summary proceedings to recover possession of an apartment for nonpayment of rent it appeared that tenant paid $ 46 per month up to January 26, 1949.  On July 1, 1949, the Federal Housing Expediter increased the maximum rent to $ 49.78 effective retroactively to January 26, 1949.  Although section 13-a of the State Residential Rent Law, which fixes the &quot;freeze&quot; date for New York City as March 1, 1949, was declared unconstitutional by the Court of Appeals (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Teeval Co. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">v.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11"> Stern</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 301 N.

Moreover, such decision rejected laws dealing almost exclusively with the prohibition of the collection of increased retroactive rent. Since the petition in this proceeding seeks rent for the current month only, it is apparent that the maximum rent of tenant's apartment for the month of August, 1950, was $ 46.  Since that amount was tendered and rejected by landlord, tenant is entitled to a final order. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner landlord brought an action under N.Y. Civ. Proc. Act art. 78 to restrain respondent New York State Rent Administrator from enforcing the maximum rent established by him pursuant to N.Y. Emer. Hous. Rent Control Law, 1950 N.Y. Laws ch. 250, on the ground that such law was unconstitutional insofar as it affected the landlord. The Administrator cross-moved to dismiss the petition both on jurisdictional and substantive grounds.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landlord was aggrieved by an emergency rent control measure. His petition raised a number of claims, but the court did not consider them because the relief sought by the landlord was in the nature of prohibition, and prohibition was not the proper vehicle for the relief sought. The Administrator's enforcement of the law was an administrative task, and the duty of setting maximum rents was a legislative function. Thus, the main prerequisite for the issuance of prohibition, relief from judicial or quasi-judicial action, was absent. Furthermore, prohibition was available only for action not yet completed, yet the administrative determination that the landlord complained of had already been adopted and promulgated.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Proceeding against body or officer -- enjoining enforcement of State rent law -- proceeding in nature of writ of prohibition (Civ. Prac. Act, art. 78) does not lie to restrain State Rent Administrator from enforcing State rent law and from establishing maximum rents for petitioner's housing accommodations since his functions not judicial or quasi-judicial but administrative and legislative.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A proceeding under article 78 of the Civil Practice Act in the nature of a writ of prohibition will not lie against the State Rent Administrator to enjoin the enforcement of the prohibitions contained in chapter 250 of the Laws of 1950, and to prevent his establishing the maximum rents for petitioner's housing accommodations. Prohibition does not lie, except to restrain judicial or quasijudicial functions (Civ. Prac. Act, &sect; 1284, subd 4).  Enforcing the law is an administrative task and fixing maximum rents is a legislative function. Moreover, prohibition is available only for action not yet contemplated and here the administrative determination as to the maximum rents has already been adopted and promulgated. In addition prohibition&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  is a remedy issued only in cases of extreme necessity where the applicant would be remediless without it and where the grievance cannot be redressed by ordinary proceedings at law or in equity.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with killing his wife. He advised his attorney not to assert an insanity defense at trial and was convicted. Subsequent to the jury's verdict, a defense attorney petitioned for a stay of proceedings so that defendant could be committed for a mental examination. The hospital found that defendant was insane and was incapable of understanding the charge and proceedings against him. Defendant was committed. When he was discharged, the trial court found that defendant was not presently insane and imposed the death penalty. Defendant sought a new trial on the ground of newly discovered evidence, asserting that during trial he was in such a state of idiocy or insanity as to be incapable of understanding the proceedings or making his defense. The State argued that the conviction was final. The court granted relief, declaring the murder trial a nullity. While defendant acted normally during trial, after the verdict he acted in such an unusual and rambling manner to place doubt that he was sane. Evidence from doctors showed that his condition was present during the trial and that the trial court therefore did not have authority to permit the trial to commence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court ruled in favor of defendant, holding that his original trial for murder was a nullity.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- insanity as defense -- (1) defendant convicted of murder in first degree in 1944; after jury brought in verdict, defendant harangued court in rambling manner; defendant committed to hospital for examination and found at that time to be insane; order made committing defendant to State hospital for criminal insane; in 1950, superintendent of State hospital found defendant had recovered sanity, and defendant brought to court for passing of mandatory death sentence upon him; defense attorney then moved for new trial on ground that in 1944 defendant incapable of understanding charge against him and of making his defense thereto; in view of all facts, court grants motion for new trial -- (2) court has power to entertain such motion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Defendant was convicted of murder in the first degree on November 1, 1944.  Prior to the trial he expressly enjoined his attorney from interposing a defense of insanity. After the jury had brought in its verdict defendant made a long harangue to the court in an unusual and rambling manner which was one of the circumstances which caused the court to commit defendant to a hospital for an examination as to his&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  sanity. The psychiatrists of said hospital found defendant to be insane. Thereafter, an order was made committing defendant to a State hospital for the criminal insane. Five years and two months after such order of commitment the superintendent of the State hospital certified that defendant was no longer so insane as to be incapable of understanding the charge against him.  Defendant was then returned to the court.  Thereafter and while hearings were being held to determine whether the court should confirm the report of the authorities of the State hospital, the doctors of the State hospital reversed their findings as to defendant's mental condition and once again found that he was insane. The court then appointed independent psychiatrists who found defendant to have suffered a manic depressive psychosis and also found that defendant had recovered sufficiently to enable him to understand the proceedings before the court.  The court then found defendant presently capable of understanding the charge against him and of making his defense thereto.  Defendant was brought before the court and the mandatory death sentence was pronounced upon him.  On the next day defendant's attorney&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  moved for a new trial on the ground that at the time defendant was placed on trial and all during the trial he was in such a state of insanity as to be incapable of understanding the proceedings against him or of making his defense.  A review of all the facts leads the court to the conclusion that the motion should be granted.  Defendant's behavior for a period of some six years and the opinions of the experts indicate that at the time of his trial his mental condition was such as to cast great doubt upon his capacity to defend himself properly.  The question of defendant's responsibility for the crime under section 1120 of the Penal Law is for a trial jury to pass upon, if defendant elects to interpose a defense of insanity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The Trial Court has the power to entertain a motion for a new trial on the ground that defendant was incapable of making his defense to the charge at the time he was tried.  The determination whether or not an insane person is capable of understanding the proceedings or making his defense rests upon the court and the full responsibility for deciding whether or not such person should be placed on trial or sentenced to any punishment or punished for a crime, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  is one that the court itself must assume.  </SPAN></P>

Defendant was charged with violating Amityville, N.Y., Ordinance art. II, &sect; 26, which prohibited the circulation of printed materials on the street.

Const. art. I, &sect; 8 and the First and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution. The court found that the ordinance did not apply to non-advertising material. The court held that if the ordinance were interpreted to apply to political and other literature, it would violate the constitutional guarantee of freedom of speech because it would prohibit a person lawfully upon the streets to impart information or opinion either through speech or by the distribution of literature. Although the constitutional guarantee was not unlimited, defendant's actions did not result in littering or the blocking of streets, which were proper areas for the village to regulate.</SPAN></P>

Although there was no evidence as to the intent of the village board at the time the ordinance was enacted, it cannot be assumed that the board intended to enact an ordinance in violation of constitutional rights. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent fathers were before the court in a prosecution for their alleged violation of the State of New York's compulsory education law, N.Y. Educ. Law &sect; 3212. The fathers' children attended a small, religious school that was not registered with nor recognized by the committee that supervised secular instruction in such parochial schools.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The children's primary curriculum was religious and they did not receive any formal or systematic instruction in the common branches of study required by N.Y. Educ. Law &sect; 3204. The fathers claimed that their religious belief prohibited all systematic, secular education of their children, a concept in conflict with the provisions of &sect; 3204. The fathers argued that, in view of their deep religious convictions, enforcement of the compulsory education law against them infringed on their religious liberty. The court noted that an infringement of the fathers' religious liberty did not necessarily mean that their constitutional rights had been violated. The court held that the fathers' religious convictions must yield to the public interest in compulsory education laws, which were universally enacted for the benefit of the country's children. The court concluded that the fathers' religious convictions could not interfere with the responsibility of the State to protect children's welfare.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that the fathers' constitutional rights had not been violated and, consequently, each of them was guilty of having violated the compulsory education law.

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Respondents whose children of school age do not attend schools in which secular subjects are taught but instead attend a religious school where they are taught by an instructor not possessing the minimum qualifications of a teacher for secular instruction required by the board of education of the city of New York and there do not receive any systematic instruction in the ten common branches and other courses of study required by section 3204 of the Education Law and where English is not the language of instruction, are guilty of violating the Compulsory EducationLaw (Education Law, &sect; 3212).  Respondents' failure to obtain secular education for their children constitutes conduct which is subject to regulation for the protection&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of society and although they oppose secular education on religious grounds they are not exempt from the obligations imposed by the Education Law. The secular law in such case of conflict takes precedence over the religious law where the interests of a democratic society clearly requires compliance with the secular law.  Religious convictions of parents cannot interfere with the responsibility of the State to protect the welfare of children.  The constitutional rights of respondents have not been violated.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, owners and/or drivers of taxicabs, filed a motion for an injunction pendente lite to restrain the enforcement of an ordinance passed by defendant city and of certain rules and regulations promulgated by the police department of that city, which regulated the operation of taxicabs within the city.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city enacted an ordinance which forbade taxicabs from cruising for passengers; the taxi drivers could pick up passengers that had called them, Long Beach, N.Y., City Ord. &sect; 8(d), but driving an empty cab on the roadways of the city was presumptive evidence of cruising, Long Beach, N.Y., City Ord. &sect; 2(e). Plaintiffs argued that the ordinance was null and void as an infringement of the State's exclusive control of the streets and highways and that rules and regulations of the police department, pursuant to the authority vested in it by the ordinance, were illegal or in contravention of State rule. The court disagreed and refused to grant an injunction. The court stated that there was no inherent or vested right to use public streets for hire. Such use was a privilege which could be granted by a city, subject to reasonable regulation, and was not in contravention of state rules. The court found that pursuant to the authority vested in it by N.Y. Veh. &amp; Traf. Law &sect; 54, the city had the power to enact a reasonable ordinance regulating the operation of taxicabs. The court held that a prohibition against cruising was within that power.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Municipal corporations -- regulation of taxicabs -- (1) city enacted ordinance prohibiting taxicabs from cruising on streets of city; motion for temporary injunction to restrain enforcement of ordinance denied since clear right to injunction insufficiently established by factual proof -- (2) municipality had power to prohibit cruising on streets under its charter and Vehicle and Traffic Law -- (3) on papers before court such regulation of taxicabs not unreasonable -- (4) regulations of police department were enacted pursuant to authority delegated by Vehicle and Traffic Law -- (5) ordinance formulated sufficient standard for guidance of police department in enacting regulations -- (6) regulations restricting places from which community riding permitted and prohibiting taxicabs from picking up passengers from designated bus stop not ultra vires -- (7) section authorizing suspension of license during investigation of charges constitutional.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. An ordinance of defendant city prevents cruising by taxicabs within such city.  Plaintiffs' motion for a temporary injunction to restrain enforcement by the city of such ordinance and of the rules&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and regulations of the police department of the city should be denied since the factual proof of a clear right to an injunction advanced by plaintiffs is insufficient.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. There is no inherent or vested right to use public streets for hire. Such use is a privilege which may be granted subject to reasonable regulation by a municipality pursuant to authority delegated to it by the State, here the charter of the city and the Vehicle and Traffic Law (&sect; 54, second par.).  The prohibition against cruising was within that power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. On the papers before the court such regulation of taxicabs is not on its face unreasonable although after development of the facts on the trial it may be that such unreasonableness may be demonstrated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The rules and regulations promulgated by the police department of the city pursuant to the ordinance are not illegal on the claimed ground that the charter of the city did not authorize the delegation of such authority to the police department. Although the authority to delegate is not contained in the charter, the Legislature gave such authority in the Vehicle and Traffic Law (&sect; 90, subds. 4, 6).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. The ordinance authorizes the police department to promulgate&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  such regulations &quot;as they may deem necessary for the proper conduct of the taxicab business, and to that end may promulgate rules and regulations as to cruising, use of streets and use of equipment and such other regulations as they may deem necessary and proper&quot;.  The standard therein set forth upon the basis of which the police department enacted the regulations was sufficient.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. Regulations restricting the places from which community riding is permitted and prohibiting taxicabs from picking up passengers from a designated bus stop are not </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">ultra vires</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> but within the city's power to regulate the conduct of the taxicab business.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. A section of the ordinance provides that the commissioner, the chief of police or acting chief of police may revoke a license for reasonable cause after a hearing at which the driver and owner may present proof and cross-examine witnesses.  It is also provided that such officers may in their discretion suspend any license during an investigation of charges of improper conduct by a driver or owner of a taxicab license. Such section is not unconstitutional.  No license may be revoked until after a hearing.  The suspension of a license during the investigation&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of charges of improper conduct is not an unreasonable method of obtaining that continued control of such drivers which is essential to the protection of the public.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff taxpayer brought an action against defendant, the New York State Tax Commission, for both declaratory and injunctive relief against the Commission with respect to an assessment of additional personal income tax against the taxpayer for the year 1946. The Commission filed a motion to dismiss the taxpayer's complaint for insufficiency.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The question arose whether the Commission, by virtue of the authority vested in it by N.Y. Tax Law &sect; 373, could arbitrarily make an additional assessment against a taxpayer for the sole purpose of extending the three-year statutory period within which it was required to determine the amount of tax due from the taxpayer. The court held that wide discretion had to be given the Commission in making an additional assessment or revising a return, but it could not be seriously contended that the Legislature ever intended to permit such action without any basis for so doing and for the sole purpose of procuring an extension of the Commission's time in which to make a different assessment. The court determined that the action of the Commission in making an additional assessment against the taxpayer after the latter refused to consent to an extension for the tax determination, was unjustified and arbitrary as no authority was granted so to do by the section in question. Accordingly, the additional assessment against the taxpayer was invalid and void. The court concluded that the complaint stated a cause of action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied the Commission's motion to dismiss.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Taxation -- income tax -- assessment of additional tax -- (1) complaint of taxpayer alleges that State Tax Commission without facts to support it and solely for purpose of extending three-year period provided in Tax Law (&sect; 373) within which amount of income tax might be corrected served notice ofassessment upon plaintiff; complaint further alleges that such action capricious and seeks declaration that Tax Law (&sect; 373) does not authorize such action by commission; Tax Law (&sect;&sect; 374-375) provides for manner of reviewing determination of commission fixing tax and states that such manner is exclusive; complaint states cause of action -- (2) while commission had authority to make estimate of taxable income on basis of information in its possession, it had no authority to make assessment without information for purpose of extending commission's time in which to make different assessment; commission may not circumvent three-year limitation contained in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">statute</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> by methods alleged in complaint -- (3) making of additional assessment against plaintiff invalid -- (4)</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> declaratory judgment proper remedy to determine authority of commission to make additional assessment under Tax Law (&sect; 373) -- (5) provision of Tax Law (&sect; 375) that said section furnishes exclusive remedy inapplicable since complaint alleges that commission not acting within section 373.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. A complaint by a taxpayer alleges that the State Tax Commission in order to secure an extension of the time within which to determine the amount of an additional income tax which might be due from said taxpayer, sent taxpayer a notice of additional assessment purporting to have been made pursuant to section 373 of the Tax Law and alleges that such notice of assessment was not based on information or facts in possession of defendant but was capricious and done solely to procure said extension of time at a date more than three years after the tax return was made.  Plaintiff therefore asks judgment declaring that the right asserted by defendant does not exist under section 373 of the Tax Law. Section 373 of the Tax Law provides that the tax commission may revise a taxpayer's return if incorrect or if a taxpayer fails to make a return and that the commission may estimate the taxable income and&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  assess the taxes due the State.  It then provides that the amount of tax due under any return must be determined within three years after the return is made.  Section 374 provides for the revision and adjustment of a taxpayer's return and for a hearing to the taxpayer with respect thereto.  Section 375 provides for the manner in which the determination of the tax commission shall be reviewed and it then provides that the remedy for review of a determination shall be the exclusive remedy to determine judicially the liability of a taxpayer for taxes.  The complaint states a cause of action. Jurisdiction of this action for declaratory judgment should be retained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. While discretionary power is granted the commission to make an estimate of the taxable income of a taxpayer from any information in its possession, where it is alleged that the commission had no basis whatever for its estimate of plaintiff's taxable return -- and on a motion attacking the complaint, the facts therein are admitted -- the commission was not authorized by section 373 of the Tax Law to make an assessment without any basis for so doing and for the sole purpose of procuring an extension of the commission's time&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  in which to make a different assessment.  The three-year limitation in the Tax Law benefits and protects the taxpayer and the commission should not be allowed to circumvent this provision by the methods alleged in the complaint.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The action of the State Tax Commission in making the additional assessment was unjustified and such assessment is invalid and void.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Declaratory judgment is the proper remedy to stabilize the uncertain jural relations between the parties as to the commission's authority under section 373.  Since it involves an interpretation of a section of the law not previously judicially construed, declaratory judgment is the proper remedy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. The provision contained in section 375 of the Tax Law stating that the section furnishes the exclusive remedy to a taxpayer does not apply unless the commission acts within the authority of section 373 of the Tax Law. Since plaintiff alleges that the commission is acting without jurisdiction in making the assessment, said provision does not apply.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Gen. Ordinance ch. 10, &sect; 1 required all peddlers to be licensed but permitted the issuance of a license only to a person who had been a resident of the City for at least six months. Albany, N.Y., Gen. Ordinance ch. 10, &sect; 4 prohibited vehicles from remaining on the public street for longer than five minutes while offering goods for sale, and Albany, N.Y., Gen. Ordinance ch. 10, &sect; 12 prohibited venders from engaging in business on certain streets within 300 feet of any school building. The seller contended that the enactment was discriminatory and unconstitutional in that the provisions discriminated against a nonresident who was not permitted to obtain a license thereunder and made an illegal distinction between a vender having a stated place of business in the City and one who had not such. The court held that regulations whose purposes were asserted to be in the public interest should be reasonable, adapted to cure a substantial evil and applicable to all persons similarly situated. Thus, it held that Albany, N.Y., Gen. Ordinance ch. 10, &sect; 1 was unconstitutional and invalid since it worked a discrimination against nonresidents of the City in favor of residents of the City.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Municipal corporations -- enjoining void ordinance -- (1) court assumes jurisdiction of action to declare </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">unconstitutional</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> ordinance of City of Albany prohibiting plaintiff from conducting ice cream vending business from trucks on streets, and will enjoin enforcement since plaintiff's business rights affected -- (2) section 1 of said ordinance which provides for licensing of peddlers but permits issuance of licenses only to persons resident in city for six months </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">unconstitutional</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> -- (3) plaintiff's complaint and affidavits show such </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">unconstitutionality</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> of ordinance as to warrant temporary injunction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. A court of equity will assume jurisdiction of this action to declare an ordinance of the City of Albany unconstitutional and will enjoin the enforcement of its provisions against plaintiff who sells at retail ice cream from trucks on the streets of the city of Albany, where its enforcement will affect plaintiff's property rights and work irreparable injury. The criminality of the act performed by plaintiff will not bar such relief where an injunction is necessary for the protection of one's property rights (General Municipal Law, &sect;&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  80).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Section 1 of said ordinance which requires peddlers to be licensed but permits the issuance of a license only to persons who have been residents of the city for at least six months is unconstitutional since it discriminates against nonresidents in favor of residents of the city.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Other provisions of the ordinance prohibit vehicles from remaining on the public street for longer than five minutes while offering goods for sale and prohibit the use of a horn or other instrument to announce the approach of a vehicle.  Still another provision prevents ice cream venders from doing business on certain named streets and parkways within 100 feet of any street intersection and 300 feet of any school building. By his complaint and supporting affidavits plaintiff has made a sufficient showing to question the constitutionality of such provisions on the grounds: (1) that the enactment is not fairly adapted to cure a real or substantial evil; (2) that the enactment bears no reasonable relation between the evil and the attempted remedy; (3) that it discriminates between persons having a place of business in the city and those who do not and (4) that it is an attempt to regulate the use&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of public highways which is reserved wholly to the State.  Such a showing justifies the granting, in the court's discretion, of plaintiff's motion for a temporary injunction to preserve the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">status quo</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> until the trial.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff town board sought an injunction to restrain defendant junkyard operators from operating a junk yard in noncompliance with a town ordinance, enacted pursuant to the provisions of N.Y. Town Law &sect; 136, requiring a six-foot fence around the junkyard if it was operated outside of a building. The operators had conducted business in the manner opposed prior to the enactment of the subject ordinance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">For approximately 10 years preceding the adoption of the town's ordinance, the operators had conducted a junk business on the land they owned, located on a triangular piece of land adjacent to two intersecting highways. Owing to the operators' refusal to erect a fence in conformance with the ordinance, they were denied a license, and the town sought to restrain their operations. In dismissing the town's complaint, the court found that the town was constitutionally empowered to adopt ordinances to regulate the conduct of a junk business in respect to matters that affected the public health, morals, safety, and general welfare. However, the court determined that aesthetic considerations were only to be given regard if recognized police power considerations were sufficiently present. In the instant case, the court concluded that the aesthetic considerations on which the regulations were based were insufficient to uphold the law's legality as a reasonable exercise of the town's police power inasmuch as the regulatory measure applied to the entire town. Thus, the enactment of the subject provisions of the ordinance was not within the town's power, rendering it unconstitutional and void.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A municipality cannot regulate junk dealers by adopting an ordinance under the guise of police power which is not reasonable and does not bear a relationship to the protection of public morals, health or general welfare. An ordinance enacted by plaintiff town which required that the premises of junk dealers be in enclosed buildings or enclosed with a solid board fence at least six feet high on all sides, is unconstitutional.  The sole purpose of the ordinance is to hide unsightly premises from the view of persons traveling along adjacent highways. Aesthetic considerations may be regarded in connection with recognized police power considerations and, if the latter are sufficiently present, the fact that considerations of an aesthetic nature entered into the reasons for the regulation will not render it invalid. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The aesthetic considerations on which the regulation here is based are not sufficient to uphold their legality as a reasonable exercise of the police power. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner parents filed an application pursuant to N.Y. Civil Practice Act &sect; 78 for a trial to review the constitutionality of N.Y. Educ. Law &sect; 3210 authorizing respondent Board of Education's (board) &quot;released time program&quot; for the dismissal of children from public school for religious instruction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The board established a &quot;released time program&quot; which permitted the dismissal of children from public school for religious instruction under certain conditions. Respondent coordinating committee, an organization wholly independent of the school system or of any particular religious organization, prepared and distributed the program's registration cards. The parents challenged the constitutionality of the program and N.Y. Educ. Law &sect; 3210 that authorized the program, claiming that a child whose parents did not choose any form of religious instruction could be classed as a dissenter and thereby humiliated. The court dismissed the parents' petition on the merits as a matter of law, holding that no issues existed in the pleadings that required a trial. The court determined that the statute and the program itself were constitutional under the First Amendment's freedom &quot;of&quot; religion, not freedom &quot;from&quot; religion. The parents' generalized allegation of the program's poor administration did not affect the constitutionality of the statute.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The &quot;released time program&quot; of religious instruction now in practice in the public schools of the city of New York and elsewhere throughout the State, as created by former section 625 of the Education Law (L. 1940, ch. 305; now Education Law, &sect; 3210) and by the regulations of the State Commissioner of Education promulgated pursuant thereto, is constitutional. To permit restraint as petitioner would have the court impose upon State and local educational agencies which are lawfully authorized to grant released time for those pupils who wish to take religious instruction would constitute a suppression of the right of religious freedom and would be a denial of a basic right guaranteed&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  by the American form of Government.

If there are maladministrations in particular instances in such released time program, particulars of which are not recited in the petition, such practices respecting administrative details do not affect the constitutionality of the statute. No triable issues are created by the petition with respect to the administration of the statute. If any particular teacher violates the regulations, ample machinery to prevent a particular instance of maladministration exists. Maladministration is not an issue because no record has been presented of an arbitrary or capricious ruling by respondents respecting any particular act of maladministration. None of the regulations adopted by the Commissioner of Education is arbitrary or capricious or unreasonable in law or in fact. A petition (Civ. Prac. Act, art. 78) to declare the &quot;released time program&quot; unconstitutional is dismissed on the merits as a matter&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of law.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Relator, a parolee, filed for a writ of habeas corpus against respondent, the Warden of the City Prison of the City of New York. The parolee claimed that his extradition under N.Y. Correct. Law &sect; 224 to Michigan for a parole violation was unlawful.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parolee was in prison in Michigan, which extradited him to New York on a parole of custody certificate to be tried for murder. The New York indictment was dismissed. Two years later, the Michigan court issued a parole certificate. During the parole term, the Michigan court issued a parole violation warrant against the parolee, whom the New York police arrested. New York State prepared to extradite the parolee back to Michigan pursuant to N.Y. Correction Law &sect; 224, which created a compact between the governor and all other states to provide for the residence of persons on probation or parole from one state in another. Upon compliance with its provisions, a harboring state was required to yield the parolee to the sending state. Whether the statute applied after the parolee had served his entire term was an issue to be determined by the Michigan courts. The parolee argued that the statute violated U.S. Const. art. IV &sect; 2 and similar state provisions. The court explained that it was appropriate to have more than one means of extradition and that the Constitutional provision itself was in the nature of a compact among all of the states that required the state's recognition.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied the writ of habeas corpus.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Section 224 of the Correction Law authorizes the Governor on behalf of the State to enter into a compact with all other States which shall sign the same compact. The general purpose&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of the compact is to provide for the residence of persons on probation or parole from one State in another and provides the conditions of such residence, for supervision and the like.  The section is constitutional.  It does not violate section 2 of article IV of the Federal Constitution providing for extradition since the constitutional provision does not purport to provide the only procedure for extradition. The constitutional provision is in itself in the nature of a compact between all the States and is a provision that this State must recognize.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Section 224 of the Correction Law sets forth the compact between Michigan and New York and provides that duly accredited officers of a sending State (Michigan) may at all times enter a receiving State (New York) and there apprehend and retake one on probation or parole. It further provides that the decision of the sending State to retake a person on probation or parole shall be conclusive upon and not reviewable within the receiving State.  It is conceded that the officer seeking relator is the duly accredited officer of the sending State and that relator is the person who is to be retaken. According to the statute therefore these&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  are the only questions to be decided in the receiving State.  The question of whether relator is presently on parole and has completely served his term in Michigan need not be reviewed within the receiving State.  If the procedure indicated in the statute is followed, the receiving State must yield the individual.  Beyond that the provision does not go.  There being no further question of fact, the writ is denied and relator is remanded for surrender to the officer of the State of Michigan.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff landowners sought a declaratory judgment that certain ordinances enacted by defendant city's common council were void and unconstitutional and that a certain lot be zoned in either a residence A district or a district R-I. The landowners also sought a determination of the parties' rights to the action, which parties included defendants, a city, a hospital, and the buyers of the hospital's land.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The hospital owned land placed in a single-family residence district of the A class. The buyers entered into a contract with the hospital for the purchase of the land, and the common council passed an amending ordinance changing the land's designation to a residence B district to permit the erection of an apartment house. No action was taken by the buyers under the amending ordinance, and the common council enacted an entirely new overall ordinance, which repealed the amending ordinance. Thereafter, the land contracted for purchase by the buyers was designated as a grouped multi-family structure, and the landowners brought an action challenging the validity of the amending and the overall ordinances. The court held that the validity of the amending ordinance was no longer a justiciable issue as the total repeal of that ordinance made the issue of its validity academic, and no action of any kind in reliance upon it was taken before its repeal. The court found that the overall ordinance did not grant a special privilege to the buyers and was not brought about by any improper motive or intent. The court thus concluded that such an exercise of the city's police power was proper.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted the buyers' motion to dismiss the first and second causes of the landowners' action regarding the validity of the amending ordinance. The court also granted the buyers' motion for judgment on the third and fourth causes of action and declared the overall ordinance constitutional and valid.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The question raised involved the validity and effect of N.Y. Rent &amp; Eviction Regs. &sect; 51(4), which provided that no tenant was to be removed or evicted in any action or proceeding pending on May 1, 1950 except after compliance with the regulations. The proceeding was commenced on April 14, 1950, returnable on April 25, 1950, and the parties appeared on the return day and adjourned the same to May 5, 1950 when the motions were made. The landlord contested the validity of &sect; 51(4) on grounds that the regulation was not authorized by the Residential Rent Law, 1950 N.Y. Laws ch. 250, and that the measure was retroactive and impaired a vested right. The court held that N.Y. Rent &amp; Eviction Regs. &sect; 51(4) was not authorized by the Residential Rent Law because the Residential Rent Law fell far short of containing an unequivocal declaration of an intent to confer power for the adoption of a retroactive regulation that impaired vested rights. Section 51(4) was invalid as an attempt to exercise power not conferred by law.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Subdivision 4 of section 51 of the Rent and Eviction Regulations -- promulgated by the Temporary State Housing Rent Commission pursuant to the New York State Residential Rent Law (L. 1950, ch. 250) -- which provides that no tenant shall be evicted in any proceeding&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  pending on May 1, 1950, except after compliance with the regulations and that a proceeding to evict is deemed to be pending if a warrant of eviction had not been executed on on before May 1, 1950, is invalid as an attempt to exercise power not conferred by law.  The last paragraph of subdivision 1 of section 12 of the Residential Rent Law provides that the commission may adopt rules necessary or proper for the control of evictions and that it may require that a certificate be obtained from it &quot;prior to the institution of any action or proceeding&quot; for the recovery of possession of housing accommodations.  Section 13 of the Residential Rent Law provides as to matters arising upstate that the commission may authorize the transfer to it of any &quot;pending&quot; application or proceeding initiated before the Office of Housing Expediter prior to May 1, 1950.  Such sections of the law do not contain an unequivocal declaration of intent on the part of the Legislature to confer upon the Temporary State Housing Rent Commission power to adopt a retroactive regulation impairing vested rights. The power of the commission to require or issue certificates came into being on May 1, 1950, the effective date&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of the act.  The Legislature confined its grant of power in relation to pending applications and proceedings only to those initiated before the Housing Expediter. The prior proceeding before the Housing Expediter ceased to be &quot;pending&quot; the moment the Expediter issued his certificate. Accordingly, where a landlord obtained from the Housing Expediter a certificate of eviction pursuant to which he commenced, prior to May 1, 1950, summary proceedings to recover possession of an apartment, it is unreasonable to require such landlord to procure a new certificate and thus subject him to the possibility of another waiting period. </SPAN></P>

The statute does not deprive landlord of property without due process of law (U. S.

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.  Section 72-j of the General Municipal Law (as amd. by L. 1949, ch. 453) authorizes a municipality to acquire land for the purpose of erecting parking garages or parking areas to be operated by said municipalities or for sale or lease to private individuals or corporations for such purposes.  Section 1 of chapter 453 of the Laws of 1949, declares the use to be a &quot;public purpose&quot;.  Section 72-j is constitutional.  While the Legislature has declared that an emergency exists in large cities with reference to parking and garage spaces and while a declaration with respect to public use is not binding on the courts, such a declaration is nevertheless entitled to great respect.  The Legislature's pronouncement&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  conclusively establishes the necessity.  In view also of conditions which obtain today, the taking of privately owned land for public parking and garage areas with the resulting alleviation of the traffic problem constitutes a taking for a public use.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Defendant municipality entered into a contract with an insurance company requiring the city to condemn certain land to effectuate the purposes of section 72-j of the General Municipal Law. The agreement provides that the insurance company will bid on expressed terms for a lease if the condemned property is offered for public auction by the city.  The agreement would require the insurance company to erect a garage thereon.  The statute permits the sale and leasing of condemned land to private individuals or corporations for garage and parking purposes.  The land is to be acquired by the city in its trust and not in it s proprietary capacity.  It may not therefore be used for any other use without specific legislative provision and such legislative provision is contained in section 72-j.  If upon completion of the project the public good is enhanced, it does not matter that private interests may be benefited.  The authority of defendant&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  municipality to make an agreement with the insurance company is absolute.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The degree of alleviation resulting from the improvement is immaterial so long as conditions are alleviated and then a public purpose is being served.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. That the specifications contained in the agreement will limit prospective bidders to corporations and individuals with large resources does not warrant enjoining the performance of the contract.  From the very nature of the improvement, it is desirable from the city's point of view that the lessee have ample means not only to erect but to maintain such an improvement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. The agreement provides for the creation of a park on the roof of the structure, the southern one half to be a public park maintained by the city and the northern part to be maintained by the insurance company.  Although no provision is made for the use of the northern portion by the insurance company exclusively, it must be assumed that none is in contemplation since the taking for such use would not be one for the public benefit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. The agreement provides for the renting of space in the garage to residents of the area and to transients.  Rents for the use of the garage are to be fixed. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The use by the public of the garage and the establishment of reasonable rents is provided for in section 72-j.  The right to fix these rents within the limitation of what appears to be a fair return to the lessee is retained by the city.  In computing these rents the return from the commercial space must be considered as part of the fair return to the lessee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. Subdivision 4 of section 72-j of the General Municipal Law defines &quot;public garage&quot;; the term elsewhere used in the section is &quot;public parking garage&quot;.  The definition is sufficiently broad to include not only the term &quot;public garage&quot; but also &quot;public parking garage&quot;.  Both storage and parking garages were in contemplation of the Legislature and the agreement has in contemplation both uses,giving broad latitude to the lessee with reference to the allocation of each use.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer filed the notice of protest within 10 days after the issuance of the deficiency notice. The taxpayer demanded a hearing and a refund. The comptroller denied the claim for a refund, but granted a hearing for the limited purpose of affording the taxpayer an opportunity to establish that it had complied with the statutory requirements for a review of the comptroller's determination. Following the hearing, the original determination was confirmed. A related test case was instituted as the result of an agreement between the City and the insurance companies affected, including the taxpayer. The proceeding resulted in an annulment of the comptroller's determination. The taxpayer filed the instant complaint and petition following that decision. The City and the comptroller conceded that the determination of the tax deficiency was illegal. However, the City contended that the taxpayer was not entitled to a refund because it failed to comply with certain provisions of the New York City Administrative Code. The court held that because the comptroller was without jurisdiction to issue the deficiency assessment, the exclusive remedy provisions of the Code were inapplicable.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Plaintiff-petitioner, an insurance company, paid under protest a business tax deficiency imposed by the City of New York upon its receipts from annuity contracts for prior years.  As a result of a test case the city comptroller's determination that such receipts constituted premiums was annulled. Although the provisions of&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the Administrative Code of the City of New York pertaining to the power of the comptroller to determine a tax deficiency provide for an exclusive method for the review of the determination, since the comptroller here was without jurisdiction or authority to issue the deficiency assessment, the &quot;exclusive remedies&quot; provisions of the Administrative Code are inapplicable and plaintiff properly brought this action for declaratory judgment and for money had and received.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Even assuming that such actions are prohibited by the &quot;exclusive remedies&quot; provisions of the Administrative Code, a letter sent by plaintiff to defendant constitutes an application for a hearing received by defendant within the statutory period within the Administrative Code (&sect; RR41-6.0), which is the &quot;exclusive remedies&quot; provision.  Such section makes the comptroller's determination final unless the taxpayer shall within thirty days &quot;apply * * * for a hearing&quot;.  Such section does not prescribe the form in which the application is to be made, whether written or oral, nor does it specify the language to be used.

The letter is in substance and effect an application for a rehearing.  It was not necessary that the letter use the words &quot;hearing requested&quot;.

Accordingly, defendant-respondent's motion to dismiss the complaint in the action and the petition in the proceeding under article 78 of the Civil Practice Act should be denied.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The company claimed that 1949 N.Y. Laws 346 was unconstitutional. The expressed purposes to be carried out by the Board of Equalization and Assessment were &quot;special purposes&quot; within N.Y. Const. art. V, &sect; 3 that provided that no new departments shall be created, but the Legislature shall not be prevented from creating &quot;temporary commissions for special purposes&quot; and the board as created to carry out such purposes is a &quot;temporary&quot; commission. Chapter 346 designated the board as a &quot;temporary state commission.&quot; The court determined that the board was therefore not a new &quot;department&quot; within the ban of the New York Constitution. The court found that a provision within the chapter that set the jurisdiction, functions, and powers of the board did not violate either N.Y. Const. art. 1, &sect; 3 or N.Y. Const. art. 3, &sect; 16. The court determined that making the state comptroller a member of the board of did not violate N.Y. Const. art. 1, &sect; 5.

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional law -- act creating State Board of Equalization and Assessment -- (1) act creating State Board of Equalization and Assessment (L. 1949, ch. 346) constitutional -- (2) board is not new department banned by Constitution but is &quot;temporary&quot; commission for special purpose -- (3) no unlawful delegation of legislative power in act -- (4) Constitution (art. V, &sect; 1) prohibiting Legislature from assigning to Comptroller administrative duties, excepting such as may be incidental to performance of his assigned functions, not violated by making Comptroller member of board -- (5) petitioner's rights not violated in conduct of hearing on grievance day and by board's determination -- (6) that State Tax Commission made tentative assessment does not entitle petitioner to final determination by such commission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. In a proceeding to review a determination of the State Board of Equalization and Assessment fixing an equalization rate applicable to a special franchise of petitioner, a utility company, for the year 1949-1950, petitioner challenges, by means of allegations in its petition, the constitutionality&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of chapter 346 of the Laws of 1949 which created said board.  Respondents' motion to strike such allegations from the petition is granted.  The statute is constitutional.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The expressed purposes to be carried out by the Board of Equalization and Assessment are &quot;special purposes&quot; within the Constitution (art. V, &sect; 3) which provides that no new departments shall be created, but the Legislature shall not be prevented from creating &quot;temporary commissions for special purposes&quot; and the board as created to carry out such purposes is a &quot;temporary&quot; commission.  The act itself designates the board as a &quot;temporary state commission&quot; and the time limit on its existence to April 1, 1952, stamps it as temporary. The board is therefore not a new &quot;department&quot; within the ban of the Constitution.  The act neither abolishes a department nor creates a new one.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Section 3 of chapter 346 of the Laws of 1949 transfers to the State Board of Equalization and Assessment &quot;all&quot; the jurisdiction, functions or powers of the State Tax Commission, the State Board of Equalization, and the Department of Taxation and Finance &quot;pertaining to or connected with the assessment and taxation of real estate&quot;.  No unlawful&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  delegation of legislative power in violation of section 1 of article III of the State Constitution is thereby made.  The functions, powers and duties assigned had long been performed by the three existing agencies and were clearly defined and well delineated.  The general description thereof buttressed as it is by the detailed specifications later enumerated in section 3, renders untenable any claim of unlawful delegation of legislative power by reason of ambiguity.  Due consideration has been given by the court to petitioner's claims of vagueness and of the unconstitutional incorporation by reference of provisions of existing laws (State Constitution, art IV, &sect; 16) in the last paragraph of section 3 of the act relating to the apportionment of taxes among counties under the certain articles of the Judiciary Law there enumerated. The Legislature was not required to set forth or repeat in the enactment the precise terms of all statutes which conferred the authority being transferred or to revise and amend each in order constitutionally to effect the change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Section 1 of article V of the State Constitution as amended in 1925 provided that the Legislature should define the Comptroller's&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  powers and duties &quot;but shall assign to him no administrative duties, excepting such as may be incidental to the performance of these functions.&quot; In making the State Comptroller a member of the State Board of Equalization and Assessment the act did not violate said section.  By that act, the Legislature created a board of three members to be appointed by the Governor and provided that any public officer should be qualified for appointment thereto.  It is this board which must carry out the duties and functions prescribed and not the members thereof individually.  There is, however, no existing inhibition, constitutionally or otherwise, against one occupying the office of Comptroller from performing other public services or from holding public office not incompatible with that of Comptroller.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Petitioner was not denied a hearing to which it was constitutionally entitled on grievance day.  A hearing was had.  It was conducted by two of the three members of the board.  Petitioner submitted evidence in support of its complaint addressed to both valuation and rate of equalization. The board's final determination was made by all its members.  Petitioner was not deprived of any rights&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  by such procedure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. The contention of petitioner that its assessment having been made tentatively by the State Tax Commission, not alone on the evidence before it but also upon the personal knowledge, judgment and experience of the members thereof, it was entitled to the benefit of such personal knowledge, judgment and experience of the Tax Commission members at the time of the grievance day hearing, is rejected.  Petitioner acquired no vested interest in the knowledge, judgment and experience of the State Tax Commission.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner, a Massachusetts corporation, appearing specially, filed a motion to vacate service upon it by registered mail, alleging that the arbitration clause on the reverse side of its agreement with respondent, a New York corporation, did not bind petitioner and that petitioner had not consented to New York jurisdiction. Respondent filed a cross motion to direct arbitration.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The arbitration clause in question was on the reverse side of an order form printed by respondent. Just above the signature line on the front of the order was an express statement that the order was subject to the terms on the reverse. The clause specified that the parties agreed to arbitrate any disputes in the State of New York, subject to the arbitration rules of the National Federation of Textiles, Inc. Petitioner alleged that it was unaware of the clause. The court held that the reference was in clear type and that it incorporated in plain language the clauses on the reverse side, thereby committing petitioner to their acceptance. The court also reasoned that the method of service followed the applicable arbitration rules and complied with the service requirements of N.Y. Civ. Prac. Act &sect; 1450. The court rejected petitioner's unsupported claim that &sect; 1450 was unconstitutional, holding that the law merely gave more complete expression to what the parties themselves fairly intended, which was that when petitioner agreed to arbitrate in the State of New York, it consented to jurisdiction of its courts.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied petitioner's motion to vacate service of the notice of arbitration and granted respondent's cross motion to direct arbitration.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Arbitration -- effect of arbitration clause on foreign corporation -- (1) foreign corporation not doing business in State upon whom notice of arbitration served may, under its special appearance to set aside service of notice and staying arbitration, challenge efficacy of arbitration clause -- (2) order form signed by petitioner as buyer had printed clause above signature referring to arbitration clause on reverse side; arbitration clause part of agreement and binding on petitioner -- (3) rules of arbitration body provided for service by registered letter outside State; petitioner's consent to procedure gave service by registered mail outside State, validity -- (4) Civil Practice Act ( &sect; 1450), providing that contract for arbitration in State deemed consent to jurisdiction of Supreme Court to enforce contract, constitutional -- (5) notice of arbitration not vacated; arbitration directed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Petitioner, a foreign corporation not doing business in this State, appears specially to vacate the service upon it by registered letter at its home office of a noticeof&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  arbitration given by a trade association under an agreement between petitioner and respondent.  Petitioner claims that the arbitration clause printed on the reverse side of the agreement is not binding and that in any case it has not consented to the jurisdiction of the New York courts over it.  Petitioner in its papers has not specified relief other than the setting aside of the service of the notice and the staying of arbitration under it.  Petitioner is not foreclosed from disclaiming an obligation under the arbitration clause. The only basis of jurisdiction over petitioner is the arbitration clause and, if it cannot be given effect, jurisdiction fails.  Accordingly, petitioner is entitled to challenge the arbitration clause.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Petitioner signed an order on respondent's printed form for the purchase of gabardine from respondent.  On the face of the form immediately above petitioner's signature it is stated that the order is given subject to terms on both sides of the order form &quot;which are hereby accepted by the buyer&quot;.  On the reverse side under the heading in bold faced type &quot;Provisions of Contract Covering Purchase and Sale of Finished Goods&quot;, there is contained a clause which&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  provides that &quot;All controversies arising out of or relating to the contract, or any modification thereof, shall be settled by arbitration in New York in accordance with the Arbitration Rules&quot; of the trade association.  Respondent states that the order was the twentieth contract between the parties on the same form.  Since the body of the order refers to the clauses on the reverse side and precedes the signature, such clauses are part of the agreement and bind petitioner, whether it knew of the clauses or not.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Since the clause provided for arbitration in New York in accordance with the trade association's rules and since the rules provided for service by registered mail without the State, petitioner consented to that procedure and to the form of service and such consent gave the service complete vitality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4.  Section 1450 of the Civil Practice Act by which a contract for arbitration in this State is deemed a consent to the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court to enforce the contract is constitutional.  The jurisdiction conferred by the section is not compulsory. Initially it springs from the voluntary act of the nonresident who by written contract has obligated itself to arbitrate&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  a controversy in this State.  When parties agree to arbitrate in a named jurisdiction they submit themselves to any procedure in that jurisdiction necessary to bring the arbitration to an effective conclusion.  The agreement then is a consent to the jurisdiction of the courts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Petitioner's motion to vacate the service of the notice of arbitration should be denied and respondent's cross motion to direct arbitration granted.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, a president of a teachers unions, a union local, and others, filed a motion to punish defendants, the Board of Education of the City of New York (New York) and a school superintendent, for contempt for violating a final judgment that enjoined the implementation of the Feinberg Law, 1949 N.Y. Laws ch. 360, which implemented N.Y. Civ. Serv. Laws &sect; 12a(c) and added N.Y. Educ. Law &sect; 3022(2) and N.Y. R. Brd. Regents ch. XV-B, &sect; 254 .</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners sought to have respondents held in contempt of court and punished for disobeying a court order that invalidated certain legislation and enjoined its enforcement. Respondents sought to question a teacher as to whether he was associated with the communist party. The teacher stated that such question was generally in violation of his constitutional rights and particularly in violation the prior judgment. Respondents contended that such question was asked pursuant to N.Y. Educ. Law &sect; 2523 rather than the invalidated legislation. The court denied the petition for punishment. The court found that respondents had the power to proceed against disloyal or unfit teachers notwithstanding the invalidity of the Feinberg Law. The invalidation of the Feinberg Law was not to be construed as in any way affecting the undoubted power of the State of New York and its administrative agencies to set up qualifications for school personnel. On the motion for contempt for violation of a prior judgment, the court could not adjudicate whether the question was proper under &sect; 2523, as that issue was not before the court and required an independent adjudication.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. A motion to punish a board of education and a superintendent of schools for contempt of court for alleged violation of a final judgment declaring the Feinberg Law (L. 1949, ch. 360) unconstitutional is denied.  The claimed violation is that after the entry of judgment, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the superintendent of schools commenced an inquiry of a teacher and asked of that teacher &quot;Are you now or were you ever a member of the Communist party?&quot; Movants have not sustained their burden of showing clearly that the specific provisions of the judgment of the court were disobeyed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The superintendent of schools acted under section 2523 of the Education Law which provides that persons employed in teaching in the schools &quot;shall hold their respective positions during good behavior and efficient and competent service.&quot; There was no subterfuge to circumvent the mandate of the court on the part of the superintendent in acting under section 2523.  In any event, it cannot be held that the superintendent was acting under the invalidated Feinberg Law. The board of regents has not issued a list of organizations found to be subversive. No hearings have been held, nor has any other action been taken as required by the Feinberg Law. The machinery of that law has not been invoked and concededly the present inquiry by the superintendent was instituted independently of the Feinberg Law and under the general provisions of the Education Law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. On this motion to punish for contempt, the legality&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of the inquiry made by the superintendent under section 2523 of the Education Law cannot be determined since it is beyond the scope of this application.  The superintendent's right to ask such questions under the Education Law must be the subject of an independent adjudication.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff County of Broome (New York) instituted an action for a judgment declaring an amendment to the New York Judiciary Law, provided for by 1949 N.Y.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The amendment added N.Y. Jud. Law &sect;&sect; 144-a, 144-b, which provided for additional compensation to supreme court justices of the third and fourth departments and also provided for the apportionment of the additional compensation among several counties. The court noted that there was no provision in the New York Constitution that specifically fixed the salaries of supreme court justices nor were supreme court justices specifically named in the New York Constitution as state officers. The court determined that the restrictions imposed by N.Y. Const. art. XIII, &sect; 12 did not control the compensation paid to supreme court justices and that N.Y. Const. art. VI, &sect; 19 was the controlling mandate. The court further determined that the matter of compensation for justices of the supreme court was left for the legislature, which was curtailed only by the restriction in N.Y. Const. art. VI, &sect; 19 that the compensation of justices could not be reduced during tenure of office. The court found that there was no violation of any constitutional provisions sufficiently established to warrant an adjudication that the legislation under review was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Judges -- compensation -- (1) Judiciary Law (&sect;&sect; 144-a, 144-b) provides that each justice of the Supreme Court in third and fourth departments shall receive additional compensation equal to one-half amount of additional compensation received by justices of the Supreme Court resident in second and ninth judicial districts, to come from each county in said third and fourth departments; sections constitutional -- (2) State Constitution (art. XIII, &sect; 12) prohibiting increase in compensation of State constitutional officers during terms of office inapplicable to Supreme Court justices -- (3) Constitution (art. VI, &sect; 19) does not fix salary of judges but restricts Legislature from reducing their salaries during office; action of Legislature (Judiciary Law, &sect; 144) in permitting City of New York to pay justices resident therein more than $ 18,000 paid by State, constitutional -- (4) Legislature granted $ 10,000 additional compensation to justices resident in ninth and tenth judicial districts in second department and imposed upon counties in said districts outside city of New York duty to pay judges resident in such counties such</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> additional compensation (Judiciary Law, &sect;&sect; 145, 146); proper therefore for Legislature to require counties in third and fourth departments to pay their justices one-half amount of additional compensation paid to justices in first and second judicial departments -- (5) </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">legislation</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> not improper delegation to board of estimate of city of New York of power to fix salaries of justices outside city limits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Chapter 814 of the Laws of 1949 added sections 144-a and 144-b to the Judiciary Law, which sections provide that each of the justices of the Supreme Court in the third and fourth judicial departments shall receive additional compensation equal to one-half the amount of the additional compensation received by each of the justices of the Supreme Court resident in the second and ninth judicial districts and that the State Department of Taxation and Finance shall pay the additional compensation in the first place and shall be reimbursed the amount thereof by counties in the third and fourth judicial departments.  The statute is constitutional.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Section 12 of article XIII of the Constitution which prohibits the increase of the salary of a constitutional State officer during his term&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of office is inapplicable to compensation paid to Supreme Court justices, for such section applies to those officers specifically named in the Constitution as State officers and Supreme Court justices are not within such category.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Section 19 of article VI of the State Constitution is the controlling section.  It does not fix a salary and restricts the Legislature from reducing the compensation of justices during their terms of office. Accordingly, when the Legislature (Judiciary Law, &sect; 144) allowed the City of New York to pay additional compensation to justices of the Supreme Court who are resident of the city, such legislation contemplated that said justices may receive more than the $ 18,000 paid by the State of New York.  Such legislation has never been regarded as unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Within the second judicial department are contained the ninth and tenth judicial districts and with respect to the justices in said districts residing without the city of New York, the Legislature (Judiciary Law, &sect;&sect; 145, 146) has given salaries equal to those paid to the justices residing in Kings County, New York City.  It was therefore not improper for the Legislature to grant additional&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  compensation to the justices of the third and fourth departments.  That the judges in the third and fourth departments have been allowed only one half the extra compensation is a matter within the Legislature's discretion and cannot be superseded by judicial pronouncement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Such legislation (Judiciary Law, &sect;&sect; 144-a, 144-b) does not empower the board of estimate of the city of New York to act beyond its existing powers, but recognizes that the board may act within the limits of the city.  It takes cognizance of the fact that the exercise of the power by the city creates a situation that calls for legislative intervention as to matters beyond the jurisdiction of the board of estimate. Such legislation is proper.  The fear of plaintiff, a county in the third judicial department, that its taxpayers will be thrust into bankruptcy because of generosity of the board of estimate of the city of New York toward the justices resident therein is without real foundation.  For more than twenty years such board has not granted the justices any increase in compensation.  </SPAN></P>

It noted that the constitutionality of &sect; 2147 had previously been upheld. The freedom of religion argument had been considered by another court and rejected. New York's Sunday closing law did not interfere with the religious liberty of any person, but was a restraint upon civil liberty within the State of New York's police power. It was constitutionally valid because it advanced the physical and moral well-being of the people of New York by prescribing a day of general rest from labor.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff attorneys brought an action to recover from defendant clients for legal services rendered and on an account stated.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A firm of attorneys was hired by the clients to obtain from the Office of Housing Expediter the certificates needed to authorize an increase in the rents due from the clients' tenants. The attorneys procured the desired certificates but were not paid by the clients. The clients asserted that rents still could not be raised because of the recent enactment of the Sharkey Law, New York City, N.Y., Admin.

The court found that the attorneys were entitled to judgment, ruling that they had completed performance under the contract.

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendants owners of apartment houses retained plaintiffs, a firm of attorneys, one of whom by previous experience was especially qualified in the field, to obtain an increase of rent from the Federal Office of Housing Expediter and agreed to pay them for their services.  The agreement then provided that &quot;Payment of the minimum fee is not contingent upon success and is to be made upon the execution of this retainer; and the balance upon receipt of orders&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  from the Housing Expediter increasing such rentals in said premises&quot;.  Through the efforts of plaintiffs, the Office of Housing Expediter issued certificates authorizing defendants to increase rents retroactively to February 14, 1949.  The Sharkey Law (Local Laws, 1949, No. 73 of City of New York), as validated by chapter 1 of the Laws of 1950, had the effect that, whereas at the time of the entry into the agreement only the certificate of the Office of Housing Expediter was necessary to enable the landlord to bring a proceeding to remove a tenant for nonpayment of increased rentals or to bring an action for such increased rentals, now the certificate of the New York City temporary city rent commission was necessary as well.  The enactment of the Sharkey Law was not such a frustration of the underlying purpose of the agreement that plaintiffs are not entitled to their fee for the performance by them of their portion of the agreement.  In this agreement, its essence did not depend on the happening of any event.  Payment was to be made to plaintiffs on &quot;receipt of orders from the Housing Expediter increasing such rentals in said premises&quot;, and plaintiffs were engaged &quot;to obtain an increase&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of rent from the Office of Housing Expediter&quot;.  Even assuming that the Sharkey Law was an intervening act of Government, it could not have been anticipated by defendants that it would make the procurement of an Office of Housing Expediter certificate of increase of rent illegal; it did not prohibit employment of counsel to facilitate issuance of such certificate; it did not prohibit defendants from accepting such services and paying for same and finally it did not render the certificate of the Office of Housing Expediter valueless.  The facts that one of plaintiffs was especially qualified to prosecute the applications in question and the clarity and conciseness of the language of the agreement result in a finding that plaintiffs were retained to facilitate the procurement of such certificates and without implied condition whatsoever.  Plaintiffs are entitled to judgment based on their contract.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The contractors were mechanics, lienors, having performed work and furnished materials pursuant to a contract made with the lessees of the premises. The contractors sought to foreclose their mechanics' lien. The referee decided that the contractors had willfully exaggerated the amount of their lien, and, pursuant to the provisions of N.Y. Lien Law &sect; 39, he declared the lien void and cancelled it. Plaintiffs then brought the action to recover the damages allowed by N.Y. Lien Law &sect; 39-a (1930), which added an additional protection to the owner from fictitious or fraudulent liens. Under &sect; 39-a, plaintiffs could collect an amount equal to the difference by which the amount claimed to be due exceeded the amount actually due. The court disagreed with plaintiffs, who had argued that since the entire debt was cancelled, they were entitled to recover the full amount claimed in the notice of lien. Damages were limited to the amount by which the lien was willfully exaggerated. Because plaintiffs failed to establish the amount of the contractors' exaggeration, the claim was disallowed, but plaintiffs were entitled to reasonable attorney's fees.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Section 39-a of the Lien Law allows damages to be recovered by an owner or contractor with respect to whose property a lienor has willfully exaggerated the amount of his lien and provides that the damages he shall be entitled to recover shall include &quot;an amount equal to the difference by which the amount claimed to be due or to become due as stated in the notice of lien exceeded the amount actually due or to become due thereon&quot;.  Defendants, mechanic-lienors, had&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  filed liens against premises of which plaintiffs were the owner and lessees, respectively.

The cooler temperature was lower than required by law. It was contended that the New York City, N.Y., Sanitary Code &sect; 148, reg. 27 was unconstitutional because it contravened a state regulation, N.Y. Agric. &amp; Mkts.

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Food -- possession or sale of food unfit for consumption -- (1) New York City inspector found in defendant's egg-breaking establishment eggs which had been set aside for candling and which proved to be bad; defendant charged with violation of regulation issued under New York City Sanitary Cod e providing that food becoming unfit must be kept apart &quot;properly denatured, marked 'Condemned' and removed daily&quot;; motion to dismiss complaint denied; presence on premises of such eggs for five days constitutes clear violation of regulation -- (2) fact that bill accompanying eggs bore notice under State law permitting sale as uncandled eggs no defense in view of regulation adopted by city; municipality may enact additional protective provisions to meet special or peculiar conditions -- (3) intent to sell not essential since mere possession of impure food is violation under regulation -- (4) claim that regulation not violated until eggs found bad by candling rejected; otherwise dealer might readily excuse possession of impure food.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  1. When an inspector of the New York City Department of Health visited defendant's egg-breaking establishment on August 9, 1949, he found three cases of eggs, two thirds of which upon candling proved to be bad, and he was informed that the eggs had been delivered on August 4th after candling for the day had been finished, and had been put in the cooler until the next regular candling day which happened to be August 9th.  Defendant was charged with violation of regulation 27 of the General Regulations for the Conduct of Food Establishments, issued under section 148 of the Sanitary Code of the City of New York, providing that &quot;Food which has become unfit for human consumption shall be kept separate and apart from other foodstuffs which are held, kept, and offered for sale properly denatured, marked 'Condemned' and removed daily.&quot; Motion to dismiss the complaint on the ground of failure to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt is denied.  The presence on the premises of the eggs for five days in the face of the regulation for denature, marking and daily removal of such eggs constitutes a clear violation of regulation 27.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. While a bill accompanying the eggs bore the notice required&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  under the Agriculture and Markets Law to permit their sale as uncandled eggs, there is no inconsistency between that law authorizing such sale and the specific requirement of the Sanitary Code that unwholesome foodstuffs be denatured, &quot;marked 'Condemned'&quot; and removed daily from the food-handling establishments. A municipality has a right to enact additional protective provisions to meet special or peculiar conditions, and a city of eight million such as New York City operates under such &quot;special conditions&quot; as will justify the ordinance in question.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Defendant's further contention that mere possession of impure food is not a violation of the law but that it is necessary to prove an intent to sell, is without merit.  The language of the regulation is quite specific and its directions are unmistakable.  There is no need to go beyond the regulation itself to determine whether there is compliance with its requirements in any particular case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The argument that since the only way that the existence of bad eggs may be determined is by candling, there is no responsibility on defendant's part until the candling is done, is also without merit.  If this view were to prevail, it would&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  be very easy for an individual violator to allow impure food to remain on his premises for several days and then try to excuse himself, if he should be visited by an inspector during that period by pleading lack of time to inspect or adherence to a schedule providing for inspection at infrequent intervals.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, a group of teachers, taxpayers, and others, applied for a temporary injunction and judgment on the pleadings in a declaratory judgment action alleging that, inter alia, N.Y. Civ. Serv. Law &sect; 12-a(c), the Feinberg Law, 1949 N.Y. Laws ch. 360, and rules promulgated thereunder, violated due process, free speech, and freedom of association. Intervenor challengers applied for leave to intervene as parties plaintiff.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Feinberg Law was an administrative statute that implemented prior laws, including N.Y. Civ. Serv. Law &sect; 12-a, and it required that a list of subversive organizations be promulgated. While &sect; 12-a(a) and (b) disqualified teachers for personal advocacy of the violent overthrow of the government, &sect; 12-a(c) disqualified teachers for mere membership in a listed subversive organization. In the challenge to these provisions, the court ruled that there was no justiciable controversy as to plaintiff teachers because the list had not yet been promulgated and no teacher had been accused of membership. The taxpayers did have standing, however, under N.Y. Gen. Mun. Law &sect; 51, to prevent waste of public funds. In striking down the laws and regulations, the court ruled that teachers had a basic right of free speech, and due process did not permit them to be barred from public employment by conviction without judicial trial. Proceedings under the laws and regulations, as well as N.Y. Educ. Law &sect;&sect; 310 and 2523, not only allowed nonjudicial conviction, but they required a finding of personal guilt by association, in violation of due process.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The motion to intervene was denied, while the motion for a temporary injunction was not passed upon. Judgment upon the pleadings was entered declaring that the challenged provisions were unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

[c]) violate due process clause of United States Constitution (14th Amendt.).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. In an action for a judgment declaring unconstitutional (a) the so-called Feinberg Law (L. 1949, ch. 360), (b) section 12-a of the Civil Service Law, as implemented by the Feinberg Law, and (c) the rules of the Board of Regents and the memorandum of the State Commissioner of Education promulgated thereunder, teachers who have not been accused of being members of a subversive organization listed as provided by the Feinberg Law have no right to maintain the action since there is no justiciable controversy until the law has first been violated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. As to taxpayers, since an elaborate system of investigation will have to be set up which will require personnel, material and supplies&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  paid for from public funds, section 51 of the General Municipal Law authorizes them to bring this action.  Since it is important to the public at large and the school system in particular that the issue be speedily determined, the court should not pause to consider whether the question is presented in appropriate proceedings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The Feinberg Law provides that the Board of Regents shall promulgate a list of &quot;subversive&quot; organizations after inquiry and &quot;such notice and hearing as may be appropriate&quot;.  Should a teacher be charged with membership in a listed organization and a hearing held to dismiss such teacher, the organization is deemed to be subversive within the definition of section 12-a of the Civil Service Law, even though the finding was by an administrative body and as to the accused teacher the supporting evidence was hearsay and he had no opportunity to meet it.  Under such circumstances there is no reasonable connection between the fact supposedly &quot;proved&quot; and the fact presumed. A presumption which establishes the major portion of a case against an accused and casts upon him the burden of disproving the charges against him is unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Moreover, the statute&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  is ambiguous as to whether past as well as present membership in such organization is proscribed. Though the regents' rules interpret it as forbidding only present membership, the rules create a presumption of continuance of past membership &quot;in the absence of a showing that such membership has been terminated in good faith&quot;.  This rule well may be invalid under the constitutional ban on ex post facto legislation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. The law is unconstitutional in that the procedure under the Feinberg Law might be tantamount to conviction and punishment without judicial trial. A teacher discharged under the Feinberg Law who appeals to the Commissioner of Education loses his right to recourse to the courts; if he starts a proceeding under article 78 of the Civil Practice Act, the court's review (on the record alone) is inadequate, if not illusory; if he goes into court under subdivision (d) of section 12-a of the Civil Service Law he probably will be confronted with a court ruling that his proper remedy was under section 310 or section 2523 of the Education Law -- and this at a time when in all likelihood, the Statute of Limitations already may have run on these remedies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. An analysis of the Feinberg&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Law and of subdivision (c) of section 12-a of the Civil Service Law, as implemented, discloses that the statutes embody the doctrine of personal guilt by association which is unconstitutional.  A person's nonguilt would be no defense under said statutes where the charge would be membership in a subversive organization.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. The procedures set forth in the Feinberg Law and in subdivision (c) of section 12-a of the Civil Service Law, as implemented by the Feinberg Law, do not add up to those fundamental requirements of fairness which are the essence of due process (U. S. Const., 14th Amendt.) and therefore the statutes are unconstitutional.  This determination in no way impairs the power of the Board of Regents under the other adequate provisions of existing law, to promulgate and enforce reasonable rules and regulations designed to rid the school system of teachers found to be unfit.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, a town, members of the board of appeals, a water district, and its commissioners, filed two motions to dismiss plaintiff airport owner's complaint for a declaratory judgment regarding the construction of a water tower on the water district's property, pursuant to N.Y. R. Civ. Prac. 106(4), (5).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The airport owner's property was south of the water district's property and abutted the southern boundary of the town. The airport owner's complaint purported to state two causes of action and sought a declaratory judgment. The first cause challenged, on constitutional grounds, certain provisions of the town's zoning ordinance and the action of the board of appeals in granting the water district's application for the erection on its property of a water tower. The second cause challenged the jurisdiction of the board of appeals in acting directly upon an original application rather than on an appeal from the denial of an application. The airport owner's contention that the ordinance was subject to constitutional attack could not be sustained because of the power conferred upon the board of appeals under N.Y. Town Law &sect; 267. However, the board of appeal's action was void for lack of jurisdiction because it acted upon an original application and not on an appeal from the denial of permission by the town building official. Where a public body acted entirely without jurisdiction, the rule against collateral attack did not apply. The remedy of a declaratory judgment was appropriate.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The motions to dismiss were denied.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Municipal corporations -- zoning -- (1) action for judgment declaring that zoning ordinance </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">unconstitutional</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> and that action of town board of appeals in granting application of water district to erect water tower on its property adjacent to plaintiffs, invalid; that another action pending between same parties for same cause in United States District Court not bar here -- (2) since plaintiffs attack validity of provisions of ordinance and jurisdiction of board of appeals in acting upon original application for variance rather than on appeal from denial of owner's application to board officials, remedy by declaratory judgment proper; determination of board of appeals acting upon original application not upon appeal (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Town Law, &sect; 267</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">) void -- (3) second cause of action challenging action of board on ground that determination was arbitrary, insufficient; matter reviewable solely by certiorari -- (4) zoning ordinance not subject to constitutional attack since provisions circumscribed zoning board from making arbitrary determinations -- (5) since one cause of action sufficient, motions to dismiss addressed to two causes denied.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  1. In an action for a judgment declaring that a zoning ordinance of defendant town is unconstitutional and that the action of the town's board of appeals in granting the application of defendant water district for the erection of a water tower on its property located north of plaintiffs' property is invalid, defendants have moved to dismiss the complaint for insufficiency.  The fact that there is another action pending between the same parties for the same cause in a United States District Court does not bar the prosecution of the instant action.  Such objection does not relate to actions pending in the courts of other States or in the Federal courts.  Moreover, the fact of the pendency of another action does not appear on the face of the complaint.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The ordinance limits the height of any structure in an industrial A district to 35 feet and in an industrial B district to 60 feet. The water tower planned to be erected by defendant water district in an industrial district of the height of 168 feet, 6 inches, could not be permitted unless in the exercise of discretion the board of appeals having jurisdiction and acting under a valid ordinance has granted a variance. If a variance&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  were thus granted, the exclusive manner of reviewing the determination of the board would be by certiorari under section 267 of the Town Law. Nevertheless, since plaintiffs are attacking the validity of certain provisions of the ordinance, pursuant to which the board of appeals purported to grant a variance and attacking the jurisdiction of the board of appeals in acting directly upon an original application rather than on an appeal from the denial of the owner's application to the boards' officials, this action for declaratory judgment lies.  The determination of the board of appeals, acting upon an original application and not on an appeal from denial of permission by the town building official, is void for lack of jurisdiction. Section 267 of the Town Law grants to the board power to vary only &quot;in passing upon appeals&quot;.  No original jurisdiction in such cases is given by the statute or by the ordinance. Where a public body acts entirely without jurisdiction and in the absence of questions of fact the rule against collateral attack does not apply and even though certiorari were available, the remedy of declaratory judgment is appropriate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. A second cause of action in plaintiff's&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  complaint which challenges the determination of the board of appeals on the ground that there were no facts before the board showing unnecessary hardship and practical difficulty and that there were no findings by the board -- rendering its determination arbitrary and capricious -- is insufficient since the matters alleged are matters reviewable by the exclusive remedy of certiorari.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Provisions of the zoning ordinance enable the board of appeals to vary the application of the ordinance in harmony with its general purpose and intent in cases of practical difficulty or unnecessary hardship, provided public health, safety and general welfare are secured.  These provisions sufficiently circumscribe the zoning board from making arbitrary determinations.  Accordingly the ordinance is not subject to constitutional attack because of failure to provide standards for the guidance of the board of appeals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Since the motions to dismiss are addressed to the entire complaint rather than to each of the two causes of action and since there is one sufficient cause of action, the motions must be denied.  </SPAN></P>

Defendant failed to substantiate his claim, made under section 362 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, that the drawing and return of the panel was conducted in such a manner as to constitute a material departure, to the prejudice of defendant, from the forms prescribed by the Judiciary Law. The testimony centered upon the method pursued by the Commissioner of Jurors in selecting the 10,246 registrants upon the jury list for jury service. The word &quot;drawing&quot; in section 362 pertained to the actual drawing of the names of eligible&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  jurors from the so-called jury wheel. The words &quot;return of the jury&quot; had reference to the procedure followed by the Sheriff in summoning into court the jurors drawn.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The pre-amendment ordinance allowed the zoning board to grant special exceptions to a general prohibition on public parking.

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Municipal corporations -- zoning ordinance -- constitutionality of variance made by board of zoning appeals in its discretion -- (1) town zoning ordinance forbade public parking place &quot;except as a special exception&quot; by board of appeals; permit therefor granted by board of appeals on July 27, 1949; on July 26th, ordinance amended to require permit from town board rather than board of appeals; judgment granted plaintiff in action to restrain construction of parking place under permit and to declare said zoning ordinance and determination of board of appeals void -- (2) jurisdiction of board of appeals to issue permit in question unaffected by amendment of ordinance since latter ineffective until published as required (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Town Law, &sect; 269</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">, third paragraph) -- (3) said third paragraph not restricted in application by remainder of section dealing with &quot;Conflict with other laws&quot;; board of appeals had jurisdiction to issue permit if ordinance constitutional -- (4) ordinance authorizing permit </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">unconstitutional</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> for lack of standards limiting exercise of power delegated to board of appeals -- (5) deleting </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">unconstitutional</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> part, ordinance would read &quot;No public parking place shall be constructed in any district&quot;; town still has authority to provide parking places under amendment giving such authority to town board -- (6) even if ordinance deemed void in entirety, same result follows since public parking place never was permitted in district; in absence of proof of need for such places, such construction not unreasonable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Under a building zone ordinance of a town which provides that &quot;no public parking place shall be conducted in any district except as a special exception by the board of appeals&quot;, defendant realty corporation applied for a temporary permit to maintain a public parking place on its property located in a &quot;Business&quot; district in the town and after a public hearing, the application was granted by the board of appeals on July 27, 1949.  One day prior to that date the town board, following a public hearing, adopted an amendment to the section in question so as to provide that the special exceptionformerly granted by the board of appeals should be granted only by the town board. The amendment was posted by the town clerk and subsequently published in a newspaper.  Judgment is directed for&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  plaintiff in this action to restrain the town and other defendants from constructing and conducting a parking place pursuant to such permit and also for a declaration that the provisions of the zoning ordinance and the determination of said board of appeals are void.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The jurisdiction of the board of appeals to issue the permit was not affected by the amendment of the section which gave them power to issue same, for, while the amending ordinance was -- as provided therein -- to become effective immediately on July 26th, both the original ordinance and any amendment thereto, under the terms of the third paragraph of section 269 of the Town Law, must be published twice and posted for ten days before they can become effective.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. While plaintiff contends that the third paragraph of section 269 has no application here and applies only where there may be some conflict of law between the building zone ordinance and any other statute or ordinance, it is clear that said paragraph has no relation to the other portions of that section dealing with &quot;Conflict with other laws&quot; and was made a portion of said section by mistake of the codifiers. Consequently, the amendment passed on July 26th&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  did not become effective until August 12th and the board of appeals had jurisdiction to issue the permit if the law granting such authority were constitutional.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. However, that ordinance was unconstitutional and void because no standards, rules or regulations were adopted to limit the exercise of the discretionary power given therein to the board of appeals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Only that portion of the section should be deleted which reads &quot;except as a special exception by the board of appeals&quot; which would leave the section to read &quot;No public parking place shall be conducted in any district&quot;.  Such a holding will not leave the town without authority to permit proper public parking places for the reason that before the hearing was had and completed before the board of appeals on this very application the town board proceeded to amend the section so as to make it read &quot;Public Parking Places.  No public parking place shall be conducted in any district except as a special exception by the Town Board&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. Even if the section in its entirety was deemed void because of the unconstitutionality of a part thereof, the result would be the same because under the ordinance a public parking place is not and&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  never has been a permitted use in a business district. Moreover, in the absence of any proof that there was need for such parking places or that the interest of any person was jeopardized by the absence thereof, such a construction would not be unreasonable.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner prospective race track owners (owners) commenced a proceeding pursuant to N.Y. Civ. Practice Act art. 78 against respondent town officials (town) seeking to legalize the completion and operation of the race track.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owners brought an action seeking to legalize the completion and operation of their race track. Their activities were challenged by the town, which argued that the local zoning law proscribed such use. The owners argued that the zoning ordinance had never become effective because it had not been published as required, and that the property was exempt from the ordinance because of its prior nonconforming use as a race track. Upon consideration the court found in favor of the town. The court found that an affidavit of the late town clerk certifying that he had posted copies of the ordinance as required was sufficient to establish its validity. The court then found that the property's prior nonconforming use had been abandoned. The court noted that after the original owner had forfeited the property to the county for nonpayment of taxes racing on the site had been virtually nonexistent, and the track and grandstand had eventually deteriorated. The court found that when the owners' predecessor in interest subsequently purchased the property he took possession with notice of the existing zoning code, and that the limitations were therefore binding on the owners as his grantees.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court dismissed the owners' proceeding against the town.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Municipal corporations -- zoning -- (1) procedure for publishing and posting zoning ordinance provided in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Town Law ( &sect; 269</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">) must be strictly followed -- (2) former town clerk by affidavit certified that ordinances posted as required by </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Town Law ( &sect; 269</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">) although affidavit did not state that posting was for ten-day period; court assumes that posted copies remained posted for statutory period, no proof to contrary having been offered -- (3) no racing held between 1936 and 1941 at track built on property in 1927; two races held in 1941; property not used again until 1946; property deeded to county in 1937 upon owner's failure to pay taxes; county sold property to petitioners' predecessor in title in 1946; prior nonconforming use as well as title abandoned; petitioners bought property subject to zoning ordinance -- (4) contentions in brief that property valueless for other purposes and that ordinance confiscatory as to it not alleged in petition and not proven on trial; no finding made with respect thereto -- (5) no estoppel against municipality based on acts of officers in permitting continuance of improvements without objection</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> -- (6) municipality not entitled to injunction requiring removal of structures in proceeding under Civil Practice Act (art. 78) -- (7) proceeding dismissed on merits -- (8) since proceeding involved trial of issues of fact, full bill of costs may be taxed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Under section 269 of the Town Law a zoning ordinance of a town does not become effective after adoption until it is published in a newspaper and &quot;shall have been posted in six public places in such town for not less than ten days&quot;.  Such language is mandatory and a zoning ordinance does not become effective until these requirements of publication and posting are complied with.  The procedural and other provisions of the act must be strictly followed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. A former town clerk certified by affidavit made at the time a zoning ordinance was passed in 1934, that he had posted the ordinance in eleven public places in the town although the affidavit contained no statement that the ordinance was posted for ten days.  Section 371 of the Civil Practice Act makes his affidavit presumptive evidence of that fact which by reason of remaining undisputed throughout the trial has become conclusive evidence. The court will therefore assume, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  since a state of facts once shown to exist is presumed to continue until the contrary is shown, that the copies of the notice posted in at least six public places by the then town clerk remained posted for at least the statutory ten days, no proof to the contrary of any nature having been offered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Petitioners operate an automobile-racing establishment in a residence zone which use may not be permitted unless a prior nonconforming use existed at the time of the adoption of the zoning ordinance. It appears that a race track was built on the property in 1927, and was operated intermittently until 1936.  Thereafter no racing was held.  From 1936 to 1941 the race track was not used and the grandstand became broken and was partially destroyed by fire.  In 1941 one or two automobile races were run and thereafter nothing was done with the property until 1946.  The record owners of the property paid no taxes thereon, as a result whereof the property was deeded to the County of Suffolk in 1937.  Title remained in the county until 1946 at which time the county conveyed it.  The right of the property owners to continue the nonconforming use was here lost through abandonment, not only of the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  nonconforming use but also of the title to the property itself.  The actual abandonment and loss of title need not be inferred from nonuse of the premises during the war years, for that occurred almost five years before the outbreak of the war.  When the county sold the property to petitioners' predecessor in title they took with notice of the existing zoning ordinance and with notice that the property was subject to the provisions thereof.  Such limitations are binding on petitioners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The contentions in petitioners' brief that the property has no value for any other purpose and that the ordinance as to the property is unconstitutional and confiscatory were neither alleged in the petition nor proven on the trial.  Possibility of other utility of the property was not made the subject of testimony and hence no finding can be made with respect thereto.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. No estoppel can be invoked against the municipality on the ground that its officers although aware of petitioners' construction and improvement activities permitted the continuance of such activities for a considerable time without objection.  The acts of public officials of a town do not constitute an estoppel precluding the enforcement&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of existing law by the town.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. The municipality is not entitled to the affirmative relief of requiring petitioners to remove two existing structures in a proceeding under article 78 of the Civil Practice Act. The municipality is relegated to the customary means of compelling the removal of condemned and illegal buildings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. The proceeding is dismissed on the merits and the temporary restraining order is dissolved, with costs to the municipality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. Inasmuch as the proceeding involved the trial of issues of fact, a full bill of costs may be taxed (Civ. Prac. Act, &sect; 1301).  </SPAN></P>

Plaintiffs also sought an injunction against the Board from preparing and publishing a list of subversive organizations. The court held that the statute violated the constitutional proscription of bills of attainder and was a legislative finding of guilt of advocating the overthrow of the government by unlawful means, without a judicial trial in violation of U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 10. The court also determined that, because the statute penalized the free expression of views, it was to receive the closest judicial scrutiny and was in violation of the Due Process Clause. The court found that the statute was also unconstitutionally vague because it failed to establish a definite standard of proscribed conduct, which was a violation of U.S. Const. art. III, &sect; 3.

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Section 3021 of the Education Law (originally L. 1917, ch. 416, &sect; 3) provides that a person employed in a public school of the State shall be removed from his position for the utterance of any treasonable or seditious word or the doing of any treasonable acts while holding such a position.  A somewhat similar provision was later enacted in section 12-a of the Civil Service Law (L. 1939, ch. 547) and applies to all persons in the service of the State or any civil division thereof.  Th e so-called Feinberg Law (L. 1949, ch. 360, adding Education Law, &sect; 3022) provides for the elimination of subversive persons from the public school system by the Board of Regents which is required to provide methods and procedure for the enforcement of section 3021 of the Education Law and section 12-a of the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Civil Service Law. It further provides that such board shall list organizations found to be subversive, &quot;such as the communist party&quot;, and to provide by rule that membership in any organization included on such list should constitute prima facie evidence of disqualification for appointment to or retention of any position in the public schools of the State.  Judgment is granted in favor of plaintiffs, who in Case No.1 are the chairman and secretary of the Communist party and in Case No. 2 are employees of a city school system, declaring the Feinberg Law unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The fact that section 3021 of the Education Law and section 12-a of the Civil Service Law have been on the statute books, the former for twenty-two years, and the latter for ten years, without challenge is entitled to little weight.  Old or new, no statute is immune when challenged as unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The Feinberg Law prevents a person from enjoying public employment in the school service and thus imposes a penalty for an act done prior to the enactment of the Feinberg Law. Such law therefore constitutes an illegal bill of attainder (U. S. Const., art. I, &sect; 10).  The law, as enacted, provides that membership&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  in the Communist party is a seditious act.  In the absence of proof it will not be presumed that membership in such party bears any logical relationship to such a member's fitness as a teacher. Lacking such proof, and none is required by the statute, such disqualification is a legislative finding of guilt of advocating the overthrow of Government by unlawful means without a trial and without any of the forms and guards designed to protect the security of the individual.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The interest of the complaining parties as regards their eligibility to hold a school position is sufficient to give them standing to question the validity of the Fei nberg Law.  Their eligibility to hold a school position enjoys constitutional status and protection.  They may not be deprived thereof upon grounds or by procedures which are unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Nevertheless, the Board of Regents may prescribe any test bearing a reasonable relationship to the fitness of an applicant or incumbent to teach children and the qualifications which the board may set up may include not only scholastic attainment and technical skill but love of the democratic tradition and heritage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. Legislation, such as the Feinberg&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Law which penalizes the free expression of views or espousal of doctrines must receive, therefore, the closest judicial scrutiny.  The Feinberg Law is vague and fails to establish a definite standard of proscribed conduct.  It is a dragnet which may enmesh anyone who agitates for a change of government.  The statute violates the due process clause of the Federal Constitution in that it fails to give adequate guidance to those who would be law-abiding, to advise defendants of the nature of the offense with which they are charged, or to guide courts in trying those who are accused.  The law does not require the Board of Regents to hold a hearing prior to determining whether an organization is subversive. An applicant for or an incumbent of a school position is given no notice of such hearing, as may be had, of the nature of his organization.  He is afforded no opportunity to be present, to confront witnesses, to cross-examine, to adduce evidence of his own or to argue to the Board of Regents the merits of his organization.  As applied to him, such determination is given weight not only as evidence but as prima facie evidence of disqualification. Proof of membership in an organization, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  without proof as to the member's embracing a subversive doctrine, is sufficient basis under said law for visiting harsh consequences upon him.  The procedure under the Feinberg Law amounts to a denial of due process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. When the Feinberg Law directs the Board of Regents to promulgate a rule to the effect that membership in any organization listed as subversive shall constitute prima facie evidence of disqualification, a presumption of guilt is created violating the doctrine that each man is deemed to be innocent until the contrary is proved beyond a reasonable doubt.  A presumption to be effective must be based upon some rational connection between the fact proved and the fact inferred so as to provide reasonable basis for the inference.  From the mere fact of membership in an organization and the listing of such organization the entire concept of advocacy of the overthrow of Government by violence must be inferred.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. Under the Feinberg Law the only factual basis for disqualification is the fact of membership in an organization; no proof of illegal purpose or act is required, nor need an unlawful purpose or act of the organization be proved as against him.  Membership alone is sufficient. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  This is &quot;guilt by association&quot; with a vengeance.  The law is also unconstitutional on that ground.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. It is no answer to say that this measure is needed to combat the menace of communism. Small service, indeed, to our democracy, is afforded by emulating the tactics of communism, and by destroying the guarantees of freedom.  The court finds it hard to believe that it is necessary to resort to witch-hunting in our schools to displace misfits.  Necessary or not, the Feinberg Law cannot be the solution, because it is an answer which the Legislature, under the Constitution, is powerless to provide.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff truckers sought an injunction permanently enjoining defendants, city, village, and their officials, from enforcing ordinances that restricted the truckers' use of city and village streets. Plaintiffs also sought a judgment declaring that the ordinances were invalid. The village and city both alleged that their ordinances were legal and valid. The village sought the same affirmative relief against the city that the truckers demanded.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city ordinance established a truck route that dumped through-freight traffic onto streets that the village had determined were not adequate, safe routes. The combined effect of the ordinances was to prevent through-freight traffic from proceeding beyond the city's boundary with the village. The city argued that its ordinance was reasonable, that the village could not bar trucks from entering at the point required by the city's ordinance, and that the city's only obligation was to provide a safe, suitable route for trucks within the city. The court enjoined the city from enforcing its ordinance. The court held that the village ordinances were reasonable, necessary, and not arbitrary or capricious because the restricted streets were not suitable or safe for truck use, the ordinances did not bar trucks entirely from the village, trucks were permitted to use the restricted streets for the transaction of business thereon, and another safe, suitable route was available. The court held that the city failed to perform its duty as a trustee for the public's benefit by routing truck traffic to its boundaries without regard to the safety and adequacy of the route beyond that boundary.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that the truckers and the village were entitled to enter a judgment declaring that so much of the city's ordinance that prohibited or attempted to prohibit drivers of vehicles from driving or operating through-freight motor trucks on any public streets of the city except the streets specified in the ordinance was illegal, null, and void. The court held that the truckers' complaint against the village should be dismissed.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Municipal corporations -- traffic regulations -- ordinance excluding trucks from streets -- (1) village contiguous to city on west enacted ordinances preventing trucks plus load weighing in excess of five tons from using three designated streets in village; in 1946, city enacted ordinance forbidding use of all its streets by trucks except certain designated streets with result that trucks could not proceed in westerly direction further than west line of city; plaintiffs, motor carriers, entitled to injunction against enforcement of city ordinance and, along with village, to judgment decreeing ordinance forbidding use of any streets in city except those designated invalid -- (2) two of three streets banned by village for use by trucks, inadequate and unsafe -- (3) village's ban on use of third street also not arbitrary in view of conditions -- (4) contention of city that having provided safe route within city, it owed plaintiffs no other obligation and that ordinance valid, not sustained in view of its knowledge that continuation of designated route in neighboring village inadequate</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> -- (5) under all circumstances, ordinance of city which in effect &quot;dumped&quot; trucks at village's door on street which city knew had been banned to truck traffic was void -- (6) quaere whether city's ordinance forbidding use of streets valid in view of Vehicle and Traffic Law ( &sect; 90, subds. 1, 5) permitting cities to forbid heavy truck traffic from certain designated streets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. In an action by motor carriers of freight to enjoin a city and a village from enforcing certain ordinances adopted by each municipality, it appears that the village is contiguous to the city on the west and that in 1940 the village adopted two ordinances forbidding vehicles with a gross weight plus the load of more than five tons from using three designated streets in such village. In 1946, the city enacted an ordinance which forbade the operation of &quot;through freight motor trucks on any of the public streets of this city&quot; except that westbound through-freight trucks could use a street which brought such trucks to the western extremity of the city.  The effect of such ordinance of the city in combination with the ordinances of the village is to prevent any westbound through-truck traffic of the kind described&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  in the ordinances from proceeding further than the west line of the city.  Plaintiffs are entitled to a permanent injunction preventing the city from enforcing its 1946 ordinance and plaintiffs and the village are granted judgment decreeing that so much of the ordinance of the city as prohibits through-freight motor trucks from using any public street of the city except those designated is illegal and void.  (P. 1053.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Consideration of the evidence reveals that two of the three streets of the village banned by the village for use by trucks weighing more than five tons were not safe or adequate by reason of construction, location, course and surrounding conditions.  (P. 1043.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. As to the third street banned for use by the village, the preamble to the ordinance shows that the street (which is a continuation of the only street in the adjacent city which through-freight trucks could use) was rapidly deteriorating and would cost the village a large sum of money to repair.  The evidence further showed that in enacting the ordinance, the village took into consideration the fact that thousands of persons were employed in industries concentrated on the north side of said street and that&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  many of them were required to cross said street on foot or in automobiles twice a day and also took into consideration the fact that there was another east to west street running through the village which was adequate for truck traffic. Accordingly, such ordinance prohibiting through traffic from using said third street in the village was reasonable and necessary and was not arbitrary or capricious.  (Pp. 1043-1044.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The contention of the city that having provided a safe and suitable route to its west city line, it owed plaintiff no other obligation cannot be sustained in view of the fact that it knew that the continuation of such street outside the city did not provide safe and adequate routes for truck traffic. (P. 1046.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. At the time the city adopted its ordinance, it knew that the adjacent village since 1940 had banned trucks of over five tons from traveling over the three streets and knew that such streets were unsuitable for trucks. It also knew that when the trucks were &quot;dumped&quot; at the village's door, there was no other suitable west-bound route which such trucks could take.  Since the city did not perform its duty to plaintiffs or to the adjacent village when it enacted&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  an ordinance which routed through-freight truck traffic to its boundaries without regard to the adequacy of the route beyond such boundary and since the streets are a public trust for use not only by the people of the municipality but of the whole State, the ordinance of the city enacted in 1946 designating through-freight motor routes was unreasonable, arbitrary and capricious.  (Pp. 1050, 1051, 1052.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. Subdivision 1 of section 90 of the Vehicle and Traffic Law provides that certain municipal corporations having a population in excess of 25,000 are authorized to designate highways within their boundaries from which heavy trucks could be excluded.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Quaere</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, since the ordinance of the city did not designate highways from which heavy trucks should be excluded but instead excluded such traffic from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">all streets in the city except those designated</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, whether such ordinance is a valid enactment under subdivisions 1 and 5 of section 90 of the Vehicle and Traffic Law.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The village taxed its residents, including the school district (district), a special assessment for the construction of a water works system (system). The taxpayer claimed that the district could not have been assessed because it was tax exempt and it was not going to benefit from the system because it had its own wells. The court ruled for the village because the district was liable for the assessment under the village's bond resolution. Although the district was exempt from ad valorem taxes under N.Y. Educ. Law &sect; 1502, it was not exempt from the assessment for the main system and its extensions to the main system in proportion to the benefit that it received. Though the district had its own wells, it still received a benefit. There were insufficient facts to determine whether the assessment was proportional to the benefit of the district's enhancement of its property value. The assessing authority had the jurisdiction to determine the proportionality issue and it was not within the court's jurisdiction to detail the method of assessment. There was no violation of due process regarding the seizure of the district's property because the system benefited the entire public.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Taxation -- taxability of school district for local improvement by village -- (1) declaratory judgment proper remedy to determine power of village to tax property of school district for water system -- (2) school property not subject to ad valorem tax -- (3) despite absence of power to levy assessments in Village Law ( &sect; 223) dealing with establishment of complete water system, village has power to levy assessment for local improvement under Village Law ( &sect; 89, subd. 38) -- (4) central school district's property subject to special assessment for water system as local improvement found to benefit property -- (5) property of school district subject to assessment despite fact that school has private water supply -- (6) special assessment may be levied despite fact that bond resolution did not include provision for assessments on property benefited -- (7) court in action for declaratory judgment cannot prescribe method of apportionment which is for assessing authority, subject to court review -- (8) assessment based on benefit does not involve taking of property without due process of law -- (9) any question of excessive assessment must be</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> raised under Tax Law (art. 13).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. An action for a declaratory judgment is the proper remedy to resolve the power of a village to tax a central school district's property, situate in the village, for the purpose of construction of a water system by the village.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. School property is not subject to an ad valorem tax to defray the cost of a water system (Education Law, &sect; 1502).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Despite the fact that section 223 of the Village Law, which provides for the original establishment of a functioning water system, including a source of supply, distributing mains and distributing pipes, does not confer upon a village any assessing power, a village may nevertheless levy special assessments to defray the cost of improvements under that section by virtue of subdivision 38 of section 89 of the Village Law which grants to a village the power to levy assessments for all local improvements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The property in the village of the central school district is subject to special assessment for the water system, including both the waterworks and the distribution system, which constitutes a local improvement. Since it cannot be said as a matter of law that the central school district's property&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  can receive no benefits from the water system a special assessment against the school property can be sustained.  The school property may receive some benefit in the event its own well becomes inadequate or in the event an addition to the school is made which would make the present supply insufficient.  Moreover, the value of the school property will be enhanced by the central water supply, if not as school property then for other possible uses.  It cannot be said that the school's property is permanently dedicated to that one use.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. That the school district has its own private supply of water does not relieve it from the special assessment, for the property is located within the village and within the area to be served by the water system and thus within the assessment area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. The special assessment may be levied despite the fact that the bond resolution -- which authorized the establishment of a water system for the village and the issuance of bonds to finance it -- did not include a provision for assessments on the property benefited.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. The question of how much the school property should pay is not within the power of the court to determine in an action for declaratory judgment. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The court will not decide what method of apportionment should be adopted by the village. The responsibility for determining the method of assessment rests with the assessing authority, subject however to a review in a proceeding in the nature of certiorari.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. There is no constitutional question of a taking of property without due process of law in the imposition of a special assessment on the school property provided the assessment can be justified as based on benefit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. Any question of excessive assessment must be left for relief by way of article 13 of the Tax Law.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A settlor established a trust fund in New York and died intestate in Florida in 1948.  A 1949 law of Florida which imposes estate taxes stated that it applied to estates of persons dying after January 1, 1948, or to payments of estate taxes or death taxes made, or required to be made by a fiduciary after the effective date of the law.  Since the interests of the beneficiaries under the trust funds arose out of a contract in the form of a trust agreement which became vested upon settlor's death in March, 1948, the State of Florida cannot by legislation thereafter impair and destroy those rights.  The Florida statute is unconstitutional as applying to these trust funds. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate was convicted of first degree robbery and he was sentenced to a prison term of 30 years.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied defendant's petition for habeas corpus.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Relator's indictment by a Grand Jury composed of twenty-four members instead of the statutory twenty-three at the most (Code Crim. Pro., &sect; 224) was not thereby rendered invalid. Relator suffered no injustice and was not prejudiced by this imperfection in a matter of form. Moreover, the question is raised many years after trial, conviction and sentencing. It cannot now be said that relator did not receive a fair trial because of the irregularity in the Grand Jury.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. No challenges to the panel are now allowed except as provided for in section 238 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.  None was taken and none can be taken now.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Moreover, affidavits show that the twenty-fourth juror was excused after one day of service and he was not present during any of the time when relator was indicted. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Hence there can be no objection to the indictment since twenty-three members deliberated thereon.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">New York City, N.Y. Admin. Code &sect; 435-16.0 (f) made it a misdemeanor to operate a plane within city limits in a manner prohibited by a rules of the civil aeronautics administration or the civil aeronautics board. The pilot had operated his plane at a height lower than required by a rule of the civil aeronautics board, 14 Fed. Reg. 479. The local law as promulgated by the city council adopted in its entirety the Air Traffic Rules as a standard of conduct for airplane pilots flying aircraft and making landings at its municipal airports. The necessity for the legislation had been demonstrated by two collisions of aircraft with the tall buildings in this city. The contention of defendant that because some other sovereignty or agency developed a pattern the city council was deprived from sanctioning its application to the needs of its own inhabitants was without merit. To adopt a federal regulation by incorporation or reference did not offend the principle of law concerning delegation of legislative power.

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Section 435-16.0 of chapter 18 of the Administrative Code of the City of New York forbids the navigation of an aircraft within the city limits contrary to the rules and regulations of the Federal Civil Aeronautics Administration or the Federal Civil Aeronautics Board. The local law adopted in their entirety these rules as a standard of conduct for pilots flying aircraft and making landings at its municipal airports. Defendant was charged with a violation of said local law in that he failed to conform to the traffic pattern which was prescribed by the Civil Aeronautics Board in making a landing on a runway of La Guardia airport and required final approach for landing at an altitude of at least 1,200 feet and descent over a park and water insofar as practical.  Affidavits of police show that defendant's final approach to said runway was at an altitude of 800 feet and that the pattern was not conformed to, as required by the rules.  Defendant moved to dismiss the information on the ground that the section alleged to have been violated is invalid and unconstitutional.  The motion is denied.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The local law, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  which includes the section in question, was adopted pursuant to the powers conferred upon the city by the State Legislature under the Home Rule Amendment to the Constitution.  Local laws so passed are to be judged by the same standards as an act of the Legislature.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The adoption of the standards of the Civil Aeronautics Board, a Federal agency, was wholly within the local police power.  The contention of defendant that, because some other sovereignty or agency developed a pattern, the city council is deprived of sanctioning its application to the needs of its own inhabitants is without merit.  To adopt a Federal regulation by incorporation or reference does not offend the principle of law concerning delegation of legislative power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The local authorities and Federal agencies participated in drafting the air traffic rules which were to apply to the landing and taking off of aircraft at La Guardia Airport. (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Darweger </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">v.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11"> Staats</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 267 N. Y. 290, 196 N.E. 61, distinguished.) The local law involved is in essence nothing more nor less than an enforcement measure in aid of Federal legislation to regulate aircraft within the boundaries of the municipality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Even if it were true&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  that Congress has exclusive authority to regulate air commerce, it cannot be said that a State or municipality is precluded from enacting legislation which has the effect of enforcing Federal regulations which apply peculiarly within the municipal limits.  The contention that the exercise of police power in a field which the Federal Government has occupied renders such act unconstitutional is without merit.  The enactment of the local law in no way interferes with nor does it affect air commerce but merely supplements the enforcement of the civil aeronautics regulations. Moreover, the enforcement machinery of the Federal Government is inadequate to police every airport i n every State and proper enforcement by local authorities is necessary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. The local law is not unconstitutional since it violates neither the provisions of the New York State Constitution nor the Constitution of the United States.  </SPAN></P>

Arrangements were made by the water company and the city for the transfer of employees of such plant to the city and to that end a proposed local law (Local Law No. 62, 1947) was introduced in the city council&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  which provided that all employees of a water company, the operation of which should be assumed by the city, who were in the employ of such company at the time of such assumption by the city, should be continued in the employment of the city and that the positions should be in the noncompetitive class.  Under this local law continuity of employment on the date of assumption of operation by the city was mandatory, except that the municipal civil service commission could exclude a person who was not of good character. The civil service commission could not, by resolution which it adopted and which related to those employees which the city &quot;elects&quot; to continue in employment, make continuity of employment discretionary when such continuity was made mandatory by local law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Petitioner, an employee of the water company, whose good moral character has not been controverted, is entitled to an order compelling the city to employ him although when petitioner received the offer of city employment, he did not signify his willingness to accept the employment.  It appears that at that time he was requested to assist the water company in winding up the affairs of the particular plant where he&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  was doing his work and the city officials gave him a leave of absence without pay.  When his temporary work was completed he notified the city that he was prepared to start to work for it and although he kept himself available for work and repeatedly requested an assignment, none was ever made.  Under these circumstances petitioner was not guilty of laches. Petitioner had been duly appointed when an assistant commissioner had him execute an oath and acceptance of employment which was approved by the commissioner himself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Petitioner is not entitled to receive salary retroactively.  Section 23 of the Civil Service Law is based on reinstatement after a wrongful removal and is inapplicable to the type of employment in this case where the city acquired ownership of a private enterprise and sought to achieve continuity of employment.  The parties contemplated that petitioner would be assigned to work and that his salary would begin from the date of such assignment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Moreover, an award of back pay would violate the State Constitution which prohibits gifts of public money or property (art. VIII, &sect; 1; art. IX, &sect; 10).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. The Statute of Limitations is no bar to the proceeding since&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the city did not take final action on petitioner's demands until March 9, 1949.  </SPAN></P>

The owner alleged that she derived an income from the sale of the property; and that her customers now refused to buy the property. The court held that the city acted in conformance with N.Y. Gen. City Law &sect; 35, and unless the owner properly alleged an impairment of her constitutional rights, the motion to dismiss the complaint should have been granted. The court concluded that the motion had to be denied. Section 35 afforded the owner no remedy. She was in no position to submit plans and apply for a variance under &sect; 35 because she derived her livelihood from the sale of her property.

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A complaint alleges that a proposed parkway shown on the &quot;Master Plan of the City of New York&quot; includes real property belonging to plaintiff; that defendant city has directed its building department not to permit any building on said property; that plaintiff derives an income from the sale of the property, and that plaintiff's customers now refuse to buy the property.  The complaint is sufficient.  Section 35 of the General City Law authorizes the refusal&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of permits for &quot;any building in the bed of any street or highway shown or laid out on such map or plan&quot; and grants authority to the city board of standards and appeals to grant variances &quot;which will as little as practicable increase the cost of opening such street or highway&quot;.  Since section 35 provides a method for obtaining a building permit and plaintiff alleges that she &quot;derives a major portion of her livelihood from the sale of her real property&quot; plaintiff is thus in no position to submit plans and apply for a variance. The statute affords her no remedy, and defendants' contention that plaintiff has no cause of action because she has not yet exhausted her remedy under the statute is untenable. Whether or not the complaint properly alleges pecuniary damage is immaterial on this motion.  Plaintiff may be entitled to equitable relief. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner husband sought review by certiorari of a tax assessment against his property made by respondents mayor and council to pay for sidewalks, curbs, and gutters. He contended that the resolution adopting the assessment was invalid because he did not receive notice of council's action and that the notice provided by the village was ineffective because it was sent to his wife and not him.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The council took action by resolution to require adjoining property owners to pay for the cost of improving sidewalks, curbs, and gutters. No notice was provided to adjoining property owners before the action was taken. The court held that none was required by N.Y. Village Law &sect; 161. The statute gave the village an unqualified power to make street improvements and also to place the cost of the improvements, in whole or in part, upon adjoining property owners. The notice required by &sect; 161 was to adjoining property owners that they were being required to pay for the improvement. The wife was the owner of adjoining property when the resolution was passed and transferred it to her husband before the notice was sent. Although the notice to the wife did not comply with &sect; 161's requirement that the notice be sent to the record owner, the court held that the husband had timely, actual knowledge of the facts satisfying the objectives of the statute. He and his wife were in the village office the day after the notice was sent inquiring as to what was required of them by the resolution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court dismissed the writ.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Municipal corporations -- power of village to assess cost of curbing on landowner -- (1) certiorari proceedings to review assessment on petitioner landowner of cost of installing curbing by village pursuant to Village Law (&sect; 161), dismissed -- (2) mailing of notice of resolution of village to petitioner's wife who was landowner at time resolution adopted, which notice petitioner read, not defective; petitioner's actual knowledge satisfied objectives of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">statute</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> -- (3) Village Law (&sect; 161) not </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">unconstitutional</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> because of failure to provide notice and hearing to affected property owner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. In certiorari proceedings to review an assessment imposed against petitioner's land by reason of the installation of curbing by a village after a resolution was adopted by the village pursuant to the Village Law (&sect; 161) requiring the owners listed in the resolution to do such work at their own expense, the petition is dismissed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. At the time the resolution of the village was adopted, petitioner's wife was the record owner. At the time that the notice of the resolution was mailed petitioner had become the owner.  By section 161 of&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the Village Law a village is clothed with authority to construct and repair sidewalks, curbs and gutters at its own cost or to place the cost in whole or in part upon adjoining landowners. That is an unqualified grant of power which may be exercised at any time and without advance notice to the affected property owners, especially if the village is to absorb the costs.  If the adjoining landowners are to have the cost placed upon them, the village is required to give notice to them of the specified time, place and manner of the proposed construction. The notice simply informs the landowners of the action which the authorities have taken.  It does not imply that the recipient may attend at some time or place to object.  Since petitioner was aware of the notice mailed to his wife and read it, and also called at the office of the village to inquire about the work, petitioner lost nothing because he received the notification indirectly.  Petitioner's objection to the notice is one in form only and may not be sustained.  His timely, actual knowledge of the facts satisfied the objectives of the statute.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The omission in the statute to provide notice and a hearing to the affected property&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  owners in advance of the official action which burdened them with the cost of the improvement did not render section 161 of the Village Law unconstitutional.  The right to own land obliges the owner to pay for public improvements incidental to his ownership and to submit to the right of constituted authority to determine the improvements needed and to decide upon whom the cost thereof shall fall.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In defendant's prosecution for violating New York City, N.Y., Sanitary Code &sect; 139 by selling adulterated or misbranded egg nog, defendant filed the motion to dismiss for failure of proof beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The egg nog produced by defendant included tartrazine, which was a harmless coal tar substance that enhanced the yellow hue of the egg nog. The tartrazine was a component of the rum flavor manufactured by another firm and defendant was not aware of its existence. Defendant was prosecuted for violating &sect; 139, which prohibited the sale of adulterated or misbranded food. After trial, defendant filed the motion to dismiss the matter for failure of proof beyond a reasonable doubt. The court denied the motion, finding that consumers purchasing egg nog presumed that the coloring emanated from the eggs, rather than a coloring matter that was not a normal ingredient featured on the label. Applying the definition of &quot;adulterated&quot; contained in New York City, N.Y., Sanitary Code &sect; 139(5), the court concluded that the addition of tartrazine constituted a coloring improperly added to make the egg nog better than it really was. Therefore, the proof supported the conclusion that defendant violated &sect; 139. The fact that defendant was unaware of the tartrazine in the rum flavoring was not a defense to the charge. Intent was not a required element under the provision.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Section 139 of the Sanitary Code of the City of New York provides that no person shall have, sell or offer for sale any food which is adulterated, and that food shall be deemed adulterated if &quot;it is colored * * * whereby * * * it is made to appear better than it really is.&quot; Defendant corporation is found guilty of having for sale or offering for sale a milk product labeled as &quot;egg nog&quot;, containing a harmless coal tar product or&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  dye known as tartrazine, which is yellow in color and nonnutritive.

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. It is no defense that the defendant had no knowledge of the tartrazine in the rum flavoring, and had no intention of including it in the final product.

The court considered the motion in this action to have been brought under N.Y. R. Civ. Prac. Rule 107(4). The court found hat the stockholders were not the same persons as those who brought the prior action even though both sets of stockholders were suing in their capacity as stockholders and asserted the rights of the same corporation and the relief was predicated on the same alleged transactions. The court held that the two actions were distinct from one another because the prior action sought rescission of certain transactions plus damages while this action sought damages only and was against defendants in their individual capacity. The court held that the reference in N.Y. R. Civ.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The manufacturer marketed various drug and cosmetic articles, and they fixed minimum retail prices for its products by contracts made with their distributors. The merchants owned a drug store where they sold many drugs and cosmetics, including those of the manufacturer. They belonged to an organization of merchants that gave dividends to customers in the form of cash register receipts that represented a percentage of the amount of each purchase. A customer who purchased $ 10 worth of merchandise could redeem the receipts for 25 cents worth of merchandise. The manufacturer filed an action against the merchants seeking a permanent injunction to restrain them from issuing the receipts. The court awarded the injunction, holding that the merchants were not entitled to issue the receipts unless they sold them at that same percentage of prices above the fixed minimum contract prices. The law permitted contracts fixing minimum prices and forbade the sale of any such commodities at less than those stipulated prices. The customer was deliberately given a discount from the purchase price through the issuance of the receipts, just as effectively as if he received a cash rebate.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner alleged that the conduct pursued was not &quot;pari-mutuel betting&quot; but was in effect a lottery, bookmaking, pool selling, and gambling. Petitioner alleged that tickets were not vended from tote machines and that wagering on the daily double was not immediately and electrically and mechanically displayed on a totalizer board as required by pari-mutuel law. The court found an insufficient basis in law and in fact to grant the relief sought. N.Y. Const. art. I, &sect; 9 allowed pari-mutuel betting on horse races as prescribed by the legislature and from which the state of New York derived reasonable revenue for the support of government. The constitution made no mention of mechanically operated machines. By enacting N.Y. Unconsol. Law &sect; 7569, the legislature provided that tickets sold for daily doubles did not have to be vended by a mechanical or electrical device nor was it required that the totals of the pool be computed and determined by a totalizer.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with violating Lawrence, N.Y. General Ordinances of the Village &sect;&sect; 361.1, 361.2, 361.3, 312(2), by parking a motor vehicle in a space, which required a particular license, without having obtained such license.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant did not deny that he did not have a license or that he parked his car in a spot designated for driver's with such licenses. However, defendant attacked the validity of the ordinance, contending that its provisions were repugnant to and in direct violation of N.Y. Veh. &amp; Traf. Law &sect; 54 and that they were repugnant to and in direct violation of N.Y. Const. art. I, &sect; 11, and U.S. Const. amend. XIV as violating equal protection. While the court rejected the former argument, it accepted the latter. The court agreed that the ordinance violated equal protection. The court held that because the ordinance discriminated within a class of nonresidents of the village, namely in providing for the issuance of permits for one dollar per year to the residents of two localities, both communities outside of the village, and charged other nonresidents $ 10 per year, the ordinance was discriminatory, unconstitutional and void. Accordingly, the court discharged defendant.</SPAN></P>

The ordinance is unconstitutional in that it discriminates within the class of nonresidents of the village. The village might grant a preference to residents over nonresidents, but is discriminatory when it provides for a charge for some nonresidents higher than that&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  for other nonresidents.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff landowner, citing U.S. Const. amend. XIV, N.Y. Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 6, 11, sought an injunction pendente lite to restrain defendant Town of Babylon (New York) from enforcing Babylon, N.Y., Ordinance Licensing and Otherwise Regulating Sand, Gravel and Clay Pits, Quarries, Removal of Topsoil, and Other Excavations (Dec. 6, 1943) during pendency of the landowner's action to enjoin enforcement of the Ordinance and implementing regulations.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An interlocutory federal court judgment denying relief until state issues were passed upon by the state courts had been affirmed on appeal. The landowner contended that the Ordinance was unreasonable and denied the landowner equal protection of the laws. The court granted the motion. The court found that the Ordinance and implementing regulations seemed so unreasonable as applied to the landowner that it was proper to grant temporary relief to maintain the status quo pending the final outcome of the litigation. The court observed that the federal appellate court had stated that the meaning of the ordinance was not plain as to the conditions of which the landowner complained and that such uncertainties were often treated as controlling. The court found that there was some proof of unequal and discriminatory administration of the Ordinance and regulations so far as the landowner was concerned. The court stated that the injury that the landowner would suffer from a denial of relief was far greater than that which the Town could sustain by a temporary restraint.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted the landowner's motion for an injunction pendente lite in its action against the Town seeking to enjoin enforcement of an ordinance and regulations.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Injunctions -- temporary injunction -- town restrained from enforcing ordinance during pendency of action for permanent injunction; ordinance governing conditions for removal of sand and gravel, so unreasonable that status quo should be maintained until final determination of meaning of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">statute</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> and its constitutionality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A motion for an order restraining a town from enforcing an ordinance during the pendency of an action to enjoin its enforcement is granted.  The ordinance and regulations seem so unreasonable that it is proper that temporary relief should be granted to maintain the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">status quo</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> until a final determination of the question so that plaintiff's business will not be destroyed. The ordinance deals with the licensing of and otherwise regulating sand, gravel and clay pits. It requires that a license for the removal of material must be renewed monthly. It is possible under the ordinance that a bond of over $ 175,000 would have to be furnished by plaintiff at a time when it has been unable to persuade its surety to continue a much smaller bond.  The ordinance requires that all excavation should be refilled&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and covered with four inches of topsoil. The court must determine what the true meaning of the ordinance is, and, having determined its meaning, whether it is constitutional.  There is some proof that there has been unequal and discriminatory administration of the ordinance as against plaintiff (N. Y. Const., art. I, &sect; 11).  The injury which plaintiff will suffer from a denial of the temporary relief is far greater than that which the town can sustain as a result of granting such relief.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The complaint asserted that the local law was unconstitutional because it prohibited the use of sound amplification for commercial purposes, and it violated the constitutional protection to the right of free speech. The city argued that the local law was enacted to insure safety and to protect the public health and welfare as well as the peace and comfort of neighboring inhabitants. The owners and sellers maintained that the local law placed the right to be heard in the uncontrolled discretion of a city official and that that constituted a previous restraint upon the right of freedom of speech. The court determined that the owners had set forth sufficient factual averments in the complaint to withstand the motion to dismiss.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">N.Y. Laws ch. 295, &sect;2 (1894) created the loan society to aid those needing financial assistance. The court concluded that the society was organized exclusively for charitable purposes, and was therefore entitled to have its real property exempt from taxation pursuant to N.Y. Tax Law &sect; 4(6). The court held that the lending of money to those applying for pecuniary assistance upon the security of pledged articles of personalty, at rates less than those charged by other available sources for such loans, and in amounts and on terms not generally procurable from other sources, constituted the doing of charity where no private gain could result and where the net income merely augmented the funds employed in making the loans from time to time. Although the society had an undistributed surplus of over ten million dollars, it had an average net return of less that one percent on the loans it had made.

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Relator was incorporated in 1894 by a special act of the Legislature.  The purpose for which relator was organized is declared in the act as being &quot;aiding such persons as said Society shall deem in need of pecuniary assistance, by loans of money at interest, upon the pledge or mortgage of personal property.&quot; The purpose of the society is not to lend money at interest but rather to aid those needing financial assistance.  Consequently relator is entitled to the exemption from taxation of its real property (occupied as its principal office) as a corporation organized exclusively for charitable purposes within subdivision 6 of section 4 of the Tax Law. Such lending of money was not to result in private gain, for the act of incorporation expressly provided that no member of the society should receive any compensation or any profit other than lawful interest. The act of incorporation&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  omitted a provision limiting the rate of interest which could be charged because the State Constitution prohibited a private act &quot;regulating the rate of interest&quot;.  Such a limitation was subsequently placed in the constitution of the society and has remained there since.  The omission from the act of incorporation of a restriction upon the amount of interest which could be charged should not require a holding that relator was not organized for a charitable purpose.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The charitable character of relator's purpose to give &quot;aid&quot; without profit to persons &quot;in need of pecuniary assistance&quot; cannot be negatived by the fact that a subsequent Legislature used similar language in providing for the incorporation of ordinary pawnbrokers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Relator's activities in lending money at interest are charitable in nature, notwithstanding the fact that the services are not rendered gratuitously or limited exclusively to the poor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. If the underlying concept of tax-exemption statutes is, as the city claims, that the exemption is granted in exchange for the assumption of burdens of a public nature which the Government itself should discharge, then relator has assumed a burden of a public nature which&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the Government itself could properly discharge, and might conceivably be forced to discharge in the absence of the existence of a lending agency, such as relator.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Evidence that since its incorporation relator has never charged more than 12% interest per annum, a rate lower than that generally obtainable elsewhere, may properly be considered for the purpose of establishing that the object for which relator was formed was to make loans at less than the rates charged by pawnbrokers and loan sharks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. The evidence establishes that to the extent that the charges made by relator exceed the cost of its lending services the difference does not redound to the private gain of its members or trustees, but goes to augment the fund available for employment in the performance of the relator's lending functions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. Relator's property has not been used for the lending of large individual sums to an extent to indicate that its purpose is not charitable. Only an insignificant portion has thus been given and the word &quot;exclusively&quot; in the tax-exemption statute is not to be given an interpretation so literal as to prevent an occasional use of relator's property for such purpose.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. Nor has relator&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  entered into the business of fur storage by its installation of cold storage vaults.  Relator does not accept furs for storage except where the furs are pledged as security for loans.  The storage is then incidental to the loan for the purpose of preventing deterioration of the pledge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. That relator advertises its loan facilities and solicits borrowers does not alter the charitable character of its activities.  Such advertising seeks to extend relator's facilities to the greatest possible number of those members of the public in need of such facilities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">10. There is no such possibility of pecuniary profit to any of relator's officers and employees, for there is no evidence whatsoever from which it may be inferred that any officer or employee may lawfully be entitled to receive any pecuniary profit except reasonable compensation for services.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">11. That relator did not apply for exemption until recently despite its consent to taxation over a period of more than fifty years is insufficient in and of itself to bar it from claiming exemption for future years.  Relator felt that it was exempt but that it would assume some of the burdens of government as long as it had funds for carrying&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  out its purposes.  In recent years its viewpoint has changed because of an operating deficit.  Since the taxing authorities would not grant exemption in the absence of a claim therefor, there has not been such practical construction in favor of taxation by the taxing authorities in the usual sense of the term as to deprive relator of that privilege.  Moreover, the principle of practical construction applies only when there is ambiguity and here relator's right to exemption appears to be free from doubt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">12. Exemptions granted to relator by administrative agencies under different tax statutes are irrelevant in the determination of relator's present application.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Municipal corporations -- permit for building in bed of mapped street -- (1) lessee of property with power to demolish existing buildings and erect new ones is &quot;owner&quot; within </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">General City Law (&sect; 35</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">) and entitled to apply to board of standards and appeals for permit for building in street whose bed widened by resolution of board of estimate -- (2) whether resolution of city widening street by nine feet is </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">unconstitutional</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> taking of property not determinable until after plaintiff applies to board of standards and appeals for permit to erect building thereon and its application is denied.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. A resolution of the Board of Estimate of the City of New York widened by nine feet the mapped widths of certain streets in the city of New York.  Section 35 of the General City Law provides that for the purpose of preserving the integrity of the official map adopted by the board of estimate, no permit shall be issued for any building in the bed of any street shown on such map, provided, however, that if the land within such mapped street &quot;is not yielding a fair return on its value to the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  owner&quot; the board of standards and appeals shall have power to grant a permit for a building in such street. Although in words such section entitles only an &quot;owner&quot; to appeal to the board of standards and appeals, it was the intention of the Legislature to afford the remedy therein not only to persons who actually own the property involved, but also to those who have a substantial interest in it -- such as plaintiff who holds leases on certain property on such mapped streets which do not expire until 1986, and has authority to demolish the existing buildings and erect new buildings thereon -- and will sustain loss or damage if the property is taken without just compensation.  Plaintiff, if not the owner, stands in the shoes of, and is entitled to the same rights and privileges as the owner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The official map serves a useful purpose and does not, in and of itself, constitute an unconstitutional taking of property included within the mapped streets. Whether there is a taking of property depends upon the circumstances.  Unless and until plaintiff applies to the board of standards and appeals for a permit to erect a building in the mapped streets as provided in section 35, and its&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  application is denied, this court is without jurisdiction to determine, in an action for judgment declaring such resolution and map change unconstitutional, whether under the circumstances there has been a taking of the nine-foot strip without just compensation.  Defendant's motion for judgment on the pleadings dismissing the complaint is granted.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The detainee was charged with the felony in Indiana. The issue in the habeas corpus proceeding was whether the clerk of the circuit court before whom the affidavit was sworn to was a magistrate in the sense in which that term was used in the federal extradition statute,&nbsp;18 U.S.C.S. &sect; 3182. The court dismissed the writ, holding that, in view of the powers and duties of the clerk of the circuit court under Indiana statutes, the clerk was a magistrate within the meaning of the federal statute and that affidavits made before him were sufficient as the basis of an extradition proceeding. The clerk was clothed with power as a public civil officer in connection with the issuance of warrants in criminal prosecutions. Because the prosecution was by affidavit in Indiana, the prosecuting attorney was empowered to determine whether to file the charge, and the clerk was authorized to issue the warrant thereon, in the absence of any direction by a court or judge. Under that procedure, the clerk functioned as the magistrate, issuing the warrant of arrest. The clerk was the only public official to whom the matter was presented by the prosecuting attorney in order to initiate the prosecution.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Extradition -- sufficiency of papers -- (1) in habeas corpus proceeding to test sufficiency of warrant of extradition, court may not consider matters relating to merits of criminal charge -- (2) affidavit in support of extradition papers, sworn to before &quot;clerk of a Circuit Court&quot; of Indiana, was sworn to before &quot;magistrate&quot; as required by Federal extradition </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">statute</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> -- (3) affidavit indorsed by prosecuting attorney was equivalent to information; extradition proceeding sustained on ground that felony prosecution instituted against relator in Indiana by information and requisition supported by copy of information; writ of habeas corpus dismissed -- (4) Code of Criminal Procedure (&sect; 830) providing for acceptance of information as equivalent of indictment constitutional.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. In a habeas corpus proceeding wherein relator is seeking to test the sufficiency of a warrant of extradition charging him with having committed the crime of failing to support his minor children in the State of Indiana, the court has no power to consider matters relating to the merits of the criminal charge and the possible defenses.  The court's jurisdiction is limited to&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the determination of whether the relator is charged with the commission of a crime under the law of the demanding State and whether he was present in that State at the time when the crime is alleged to have been committed there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Section 3182 of title 18 of the United States Code provides that a requisition for the extradition of a person charged with being a fugitive from justice, must be accompanied by &quot;a copy of an indictment found or an affidavit made before a magistrate&quot;.  The term &quot;magistrate&quot; therein refers to any public officer who is regarded as a &quot;magistrate&quot; under the law of the demanding State.  Upon an examination of the applicable Indiana law, it appears that the affidavit of the complaining witness on the basis of which extradition was sought, which was sworn to before the &quot;clerk of a Circuit Court&quot; and had indorsed thereon by the prosecuting attorney the words &quot;approved by me&quot; as required by the Indiana statute, was sworn to before a &quot;magistrate&quot; within the meaning of section 3182 of title 18 of the United States Code.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Moreover, under the applicable Indiana law the affidavit in question, since indorsed with the prosecuting attorney's approval, was in effect an&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  information filed by the prosecuting attorney in lieu of an indictment by a grand jury and was the equivalent of an indictment. Accordingly, the extradition proceeding may be sustained upon the ground that a felony prosecution had been duly instituted against relator in Indiana by information and that the requisition was supported by a copy of the information.  The writ of habeas corpus should be dismissed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Section 830 of the Code of Criminal Procedure in providing for the acceptance of an information as the equivalent of an indictment is constitutional.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner utility company filed a motion for a stay of the order sought to be reviewed pending a final determination of the matter under a N.Y.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The utility company filed a motion seeking the correction of the order of a temporary rate fixed by the Commission after a review, or an order annulling the order sought to be reviewed. The utility company also filed a motion for a stay of the order sought to be reviewed pending a final determination of the controversy. The Commission opposed the application for a temporary stay and asserted that the court was without authority to grant a stay. On appeal, the court denied the application for a stay because the court could not make a finding of &quot;great and irreparable damage&quot; as required by N.Y. Pub. Serv. Law &sect; 23. The court found that the utility company had no permanent right to the rates in existence at the time that the order fixing new temporary rates went into effect. The Commission had the right to regulate the utility company's rates from time to time. The court reasoned that if the temporary rates were erroneous and the utility company had the right to recoupment of any loss due to error, in the fixing of the permanent rate, then the utility company could not suffer &quot;great and irreparable damage&quot; even if the order of the Commission was annulled.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Special Term has discretionary power to grant a stay pending a final order in this proceeding (Civ. Prac. Act, &sect; 1299), but within the limitations of subdivision 2 of section 23 of the Public Service Law which provides that an order staying an order of the commission fixing any rate shall contain a specific finding that &quot;great and irreparable damage&quot; would otherwise result to petitioner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Under the rule in this State which precludes a temporary injunction against enforcement of a temporary rate on the ground of confiscation, a temporary stay cannot be granted in a proceeding under article 78 of the Civil Practice Act for review, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">solely</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on the ground of an alleged confiscatory temporary rate. The law is settled that if a temporary rate order under review were to be annulled by the Appellate Division upon the merits, petitioner utility company would be entitled to, and it would be mandatory upon, respondent Public Service&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Commission to accord to petitioner, all of the benefits of the recoupment provisions of sect ion 114 of the Public Service Law for the entire period during which the temporary rates would have actually been in effect. Under such circumstances, there can be no &quot;great and irreparable damage&quot; to petitioner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The contention that an adverse effect will be had on petitioner's financing during the period of the temporary stay which amounts to &quot;great and irreparable damage&quot; is overcome by the record of the sale of petitioner's securities since the temporary rate became effective.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Since Special Term cannot make a finding of &quot;great and irreparable damage&quot; under section 23 of the Public Service Law, the application for a stay must be denied.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Legislation was passed on a non-local basis permitting towns of a certain size to withdraw from a county public welfare unit. The taxpayers filed a complaint to enjoin action by the county pursuant to such legislation. The court dismissed the complaint. The court first held that the fact that the legislation was only applicable to one town by the town size definition in the legislation did not make the legislation purely a local law and therefore the law was not invalid for failure to pursue a local enactment. The court held that the law was still general. The court concluded that a later amendment of the original law by re-enactment did not constitute a new law but was a continuation of the existence of the former law under the general construction rules of N.Y.

The employer responded to the complaint by asserting five defenses. The employee filed a motion to strike out the five defenses upon the ground that the defenses were insufficient in law. The employee attacked the first defense because he argued that &sect; 83-4.0 was invalid for vagueness and for lack of definiteness as to what was a prevailing scale of wages. The court found that the first defense was sufficient at law because the employer paid the employee the prevailing scale of union wages within the letter and spirit of &sect; 83-4.0.

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Section 83-4.0 of the Administrative Code of the City of New York provides, as a condition to the issuance of a permit to open a street, that the person seeking the permit agree with the city to employ only skilled and competent workmen to whom shall be paid &quot;the prevailing scale of union wages&quot;. In an action by a workman to recover the difference between the wages paid him under a union's collective bargaining contract with defendant employer and such &quot;prevailing scale of union wages&quot;, for a period of six years prior to the commencement of the action, it is found that the statute and the agreement between the permittee and the city make the employee the beneficiary thereof and that the complaint is grounded on the statute and this third party beneficiary agreement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The statute does not define what constitutes the &quot;prevailing scale of union wages&quot; and no method is provided to ascertain and determine it. Since vague, the statute&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  is subject to attack, but in view of the purpose of the statute to aid labor, the Legislature must have intended that the parties affected would themselves employ such legal methods as would provide a standard to define the term. Here defendant and the union of which plaintiff was a member, which union was certified by the National Labor Relations Board as the sole bargaining agent, entered into a contract fixing a union scale. Arbitration awards growing out of such contracts were approved by governmental agencies. Such collective bargaining contracts, arbitration awards, decisions and directive orders of the governmental agencies, have established the union scale of wages. Payment there of constituted payment by defendant of the &quot;prevailing scale of union wages&quot; within section 83-4.0 of the Administrative Code and was compliance therewith. The first defense in defendant's answer which alleged the making of the collective bargaining contracts and payment in accordance therewith, is sufficient in law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. A defense which alleged that plaintiff's acceptance during the six-year period, of the wages paid him pursuant to the collective bargaining contracts without protest constituted a&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  waiver of plaintiff's right to additional compensation is sufficient in law. Plaintiff could voluntarily waive the benefit of the statute if he chose to do so and accept a lesser compensation than provided thereby. Section 83-4.0 does not prohibit the employee from exercising his right of waiver. Whether by his acts and conduct plaintiff intended to waive any right to extra compensation presents a mixed question of law and fact for determination on the trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. A defense states that, insofar as section 83-4.0 and permits issued thereunder require the payment of a scale of wages that is higher than the scale fixed by the collective bargaining contract, the statute and the permits are invalid as contravening the public policy expressed by section 17 of article I of the State Constitution, which recognizes the right of collective bargaining, and that they are inconsistent with the National and State Labor Relations Acts. Such defense is sufficient. The right of collective bargaining is recognized by the State Constitution, by article 20 of the State Labor Law and by title 29 of the United States Code (&sect;&sect; 151-159). Section 83-4.0 of the Administrative Code may not be interpreted to override&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the wages fixed by the collective bargaining contract as the proper and lawful wages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. A defense that section 83-4.0 and permits issued thereunder are unenforcible if interpreted to require the payment of higher wages than that fixed by the collective bargaining agreements since the statute and permits are too vague to be intelligible, is sufficient.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. A defense that the statute, and permits issued thereunder are arbitrary and discriminatory, if interpreted to require defendant to pay higher wages than that fixed by the collective bargaining contracts made by the defendant and plaintiff's union, is sufficient. To interpret section 83-4.0 as overriding the wage determined by the collective bargaining contracts is to confer upon plaintiff and others similarly situated a preferred status and to deprive the other employees of collective bargaining rights granted to them by the Constitution and the labor relations acts.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Relator barber filed an habeas corpus proceeding, contending that Poughkeepsie, N.Y. Ordinance ch. 48, &sect; 9(10) was violative of both the federal and New York constitutional prohibitions against depriving a person of liberty and property without due process of law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The barber was charged with violating Poughkeepsie, N.Y. Ordinance ch. 48, &sect; 9(10) by carrying on his trade before 8:30 o'clock in the morning, which was the time set for the opening of business in the ordinance. The barber claimed that the ordinance violated the constitutional prohibitions against depriving a person of liberty and property without due process of law. The court held that &sect; 9(10) was arbitrary, unreasonable, unconstitutional, and invalid. The regulation was not designed as a health measure to protect the public, proprietors, or employees engaged in the barbering trade, or to facilitate sanitary inspections. It was designed to protect certain members of the trade from lawful competition. The ordinance did not tend to promote or preserve public health, morals, comfort or welfare but was an arbitrary and unwarranted interference with the barber's business. Hours of opening and closing of barbershops did not have a reasonable relation to the public health and safety, and it did not facilitate adequate inspection of the barbershops. Opportunity existed without absolute closing of barbershops for reasonable inspection.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court sustained the writ of habeas corpus and ordered the barber released from custody.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional law -- ordinance regulating hours for barbering -- (1) ordinance restricting hours between which barbering might be carried on </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">unconstitutional</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> -- (2) habeas corpus proper to test constitutionality -- (3) presumption of constitutionality overcome by adequate proof.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. An ordinance of a city which seeks to regulate the hours during which barbers might carry on their trade (not earlier than 8:30 A.M. or later than 6:30 P.M.) is an unconstitutional invasion of the right to earn a living and a denial of due process.  It has no relation to the public health. The public will be just as healthy whether a shop opens or closes at the hours specified in the regulation or at some other reasonable time convenient to the trade.  The regulation does not facilitate adequate inspection of barbershops thus inuring to the public health. Any regulation compelling the opening or closing of barbershops between certain hours because it will be inconvenient for the authorities to inspect them -- when they are open at other hours amply sufficient for such inspection -- is an unnecessary and unreasonable interference with the operation of a lawful&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  trade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Since relator was arrested and charged with a violation of the ordinance, habeas corpus may be resorted to in advance of trial and judgment to determine the question of the constitutionality of the ordinance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The presumption of constitutionality of the ordinance was overcome by proof that it did not contribute to the public welfare, that professional, business and traveling men and tourists required barbering service outside the restricted hours and that it resulted in a financial loss to certain barbers. </SPAN></P>

Act art. 78 against respondents, Commissioner of Education of the State of New York and a city board of education, for order directing discontinuance of the practice of releasing children from school attendance for purpose of religious instruction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The resident sought discontinuance of the practice popularly known as the &quot;Released Time&quot;, whereby public school students in the New York were released from regular attendance for the purpose of religious instruction. The resident argued that the practice violated the First Amendment requirement of separation of church and State. The court concluded that (1) the constitutionality of a released time program was to be tested by a consideration of the factual aspects of the particular program under scrutiny; (2) the released time program as operated by the city entailed no use of the school buildings for the religious instruction, nor was there any expenditure of public funds for that purpose; (3) the programs were not in aid of religion.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional law -- released time from public school for religious instruction -- (1) public school programs of released time for religious instruction of pupils as practiced in New York State not in aid of religion and not </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">unconstitutional</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> -- (2) constitutionality tested by factual aspects of program under scrutiny -- (3) prior action challenging legality of similar program not res judicata.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Pursuant to statutory authority (now Education Law, &sect; 3210, subd. 1, par. b), the State Commissioner of Education adopted regulations permitting the absence of pupils from school during school hours for religious observance and education.  Thereafter the board of education of the city of New York promulgated rules governing so-called &quot;released time&quot; for religious education providing in part that there would be no announcement in the public schools relative to any program for religious instruction initiated by any religious group; that any religious organization might&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  issue to its enrolled pupils a card countersigned by the parent requesting the release of the pupil from school for religious instruction at a specific location; that such card should be filed in the office of the public school; that the religious organization, in co-operation with the parents, would assume responsibility for attendance at the religious center and would file with the school principal, weekly, a card attendance record; that upon presentation of a proper request pupils might be dismissed from the public school for the last hour of the day's session on one day of each week; that the dismissal at that time would be in the usual way and school authorities would have no responsibility beyond that assumed in regular dismissals and that there should be no comment by principal or teacher on the attendance or nonattendance of any pupil upon religious instruction.  This released time program as practiced in the city of New York is generally typical of plans throughout the State -- no use is made of school buildings for religious instruction and there is no expenditure of public funds for that purpose.  This is not a program in aid of religion in violation of the First Amendment&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to the United States Constitution (as made applicable to the States by the Fourteenth Amendment) prohibiting the making of any law respecting an establishment of religion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. &quot;Released time&quot; is not per se unconstitutional.  The constitutionality of such a program must be tested by the factual aspects of the particular programunder scrutiny (see </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Illinois ex rel.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner landlord applied pursuant to N.Y. Civ. Prac. Act &sect; 78 for the court's review of the decision by respondents, the members of a temporary city housing rent commission of the City of New York. Respondents refused to grant the landlord a certificate of eviction for her rental unit based on her good faith desire to withdraw from the rental market the unit that her current tenant occupied.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landlord sought review of respondents' denial of her application for a certificate of eviction to allow her to withdraw her rental unit from the rental market. The landlord's application was based on the federal Housing and Rent Act of 1948 &sect; 204(8), which permitted the petitioned withdrawal. Respondents contended that they lacked the authority to grant the certificate under New York City, N.Y., Admin. Code &sect; U41-7.0, that provided that no tenant could be evicted unless under one of the grounds specified in &sect; U41-7.0. The court granted the landlord's application based on its determination that the local law conflicted with the Act and prohibited the landlord's right to withdraw his property from the rental market, a right that the Act permitted. The court found that the local law was also invalid because it compelled landlords to rent against their will, while the Act provided that they were not required to do so. The court found that the clear and plain direction of Congress that property could not be withdrawn form the rental market could not be nullified by respondents as local authorities, who were required to recognize the Act as the supreme law.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Landlord and tenant -- rent regulation -- municipal regulation restricting evictions -- New York City local law invalid insofar as landlord denied right to certificate of eviction for purpose of withdrawing space from rental market as permitted by Federal rent act.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Subdivision (a) of section 209 of the Federal Housing and Rent Act of 1947, as amended in 1948, permits a landlord to withdraw housing accommodations from the rental market. New York City Local Law No. 66 of 1947 (Administrative Code, &sect; U41-7.0) declares that except for nonpayment of rent, no tenant shall be evicted unless the temporary city housing rent commission shall certify the existence of at least one of four grounds specified in the local law. Withdrawal of housing accommodations from the rental market is not such a ground.  Institution of an eviction proceeding without first obtaining a certificate pursuant to such local law is a misdemeanor.  Such local law is invalid. It conflicts with the Federal statute insofar as it omits the right to withdraw property from the rental market and with the express policy of Congress contained in section 302&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of the Housing and Rent Act of 1948 that &quot;Nothing in this Act * * * shall be construed to require any person to offer any housing accommodations for rent&quot;.  The local law does not supplement the Federal policy but conflicts with it.  It compels landlords to rent against their will, while the Federal law says they need not do so.  The act of Congress is the law of the land and must be recognized by the temporary city housing rent commission.  Accordingly, petitioner's application to compel the commission to issue a certificate of eviction to petitioner who seeks to evict a tenant for the purpose of withdrawing the space from the rental market is granted.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer was incorporated in a foreign state and was engaged in the business of transporting commodities in interstate commerce. The taxpayer maintained terminals in several locations and states, including one located in the city. The taxpayer did not engage in intrastate commerce.

The court found that the taxpayer was subject to taxation and granted the city's motion to dismiss the complaint. The portion of the taxpayer's business in interstate commerce that bore a special relation to the city was subject to the tax. The tax was not repugnant to the Commerce Clause or the Due Process Clause of the United States Constitution because no burden was placed on interstate commerce and the taxing scheme provided for the apportionment of tax attributable to the taxpayer's activities within the city.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner landlord brought a summary proceeding to recover possession of the first floor apartment of a two-family dwelling. The landlord questioned the constitutionality of a local law in the light of the Federal Housing and Rent Act of 1947, 50 U.S.C.S. app. &sect; 1881 et seq. The attorney for the temporary city housing rent commission was invited by the court to appear as amicus curiae, and he so appeared.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landlord desired the apartment for himself. The landlord contended that, in a proceeding under &sect; 209(a)(5) of the Federal Housing and Rent Act of 1947, New York City, N.Y., Local Law No. 66 (1947) and the rules issued thereunder by the temporary city housing rent commission were inapplicable, and if applicable, were unconstitutional. The landlord asserted that he was not required to obtain a certificate under the local laws because the federal law had pre-empted the field where the basis of the eviction was the landlord's intent to withdraw the housing accommodations from the rental market. The landlord urged that the local law, in failing to give the landlord a right comparable to that given by the Federal act permitting a landlord to withdraw property from the rental market, conflicted with and, therefore, had to defer to the supreme law of the land. The court held that the legislation, insofar as it regulated evictions sought on the ground of personal use, came within the permissible local legislation concurrent with and supplementary to the federal law, and was not in conflict with the latter nor in a field of action pre-empted by the Congress.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court dismissed the landlord's petition.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Landlord and tenant -- rent regulation -- municipal regulation restricting evictions -- (1) since landlord testified that he sought apartment for personal use, case not proper to test constitutionality of local law restricting evictions, in light of provision of Federal Housing and Rent Act of 1947 (&sect; 209, subd. [a], par. [5], as amd.) permitting landlord to withdraw space from market; contemplated personal use of apartment not withdrawal of space from market within Federal act -- (2) local law requiring landlord to obtain certificate prior to eviction proceeding if he seeks possession for himself not in conflict with Federal law -- (3) failure of landlord to obtain such certificate not reviewable by Municipal Court of City of New York.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Landlord alleges in his petition that he seeks possession of tenant's apartment in good faith to withdraw it from the rental market pursuant to paragraph (5) of subdivision (a) of section 209 of the Federal Housing and Rent Act of 1947 (as amd. in 1948).  Landlord further alleges that he sought a certificate of eviction from&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the temporary city housing rent commission on that ground which was denied because not based on any of the grounds set forth in Local Law No. 66 of 1947 of the City of New York for the issuance of such certificate. On the trial, landlord testified that he desired tenant's apartment for himself because he intended to marry.  Because of such testimony, this is not a proper test case to declare said local law -- which requires landlord to obtain a certificate, before instituting an eviction proceeding, from the temporary city housing rent commission where he seeks possession for personal use -- invalid and unconstitutional insofar as a proceeding under paragraph (5) of subdivision (a) of section 209 of the Federal Housing and Rent Act of 1947 (as amd.) is concerned.  Although when a landlord occupies his own property, it is not rented and it is thereby withdrawn from the rental market, such a situation may not be considered an instance where landlord has withdrawn the premises from the rental market within the meaning of the act.  The petition in summary proceedings to recover possession of the apartment is dismissed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The local legislation insofar as it regulates evictions sought&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  on the ground of personal use comes within permissible local legislation concurrent with and supplementary to the Federal Law, is not in conflict with the latter, and is not in a field of action pre-empted by Congress.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Since landlord has not succeeded in obtaining a certificate from the temporary city housing rent commission pursuant to the local law, the Municipal Court of the City of New York may not review its determination.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff village sought an injunction to restrain defendant, a professional dog handler, from carrying on a business in a portion of the village zoned for residential purposes. The dog handler alleged that the ordinance as applied to him was unreasonable and confiscatory and, therefore, unconstitutional and that the zoning commission appointed by the board of trustees failed to comply with the provisions of N.Y. Village Law &sect; 179-a.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The dog handler's principal occupation was that of showing pedigreed dogs at dog shows. As a part of his business, the dog handler received dogs into his kennels, maintained them and conditioned them for show purposes. In addition, he owned one or more male dogs which he used as a stud at his kennels. The dog handler attacked the constitutionality of the ordinance and questioned the legality of the enactment, attacking the regularity of the proceedings taken preliminary to the adoption of the ordinance. The court found that the village endeavored to maintain a rural atmosphere in the development of the village and that the ordinance imposed to carry out such purpose was not unreasonable or arbitrary. The court concluded that any depreciation in value of the dog handler's property by reason of the ordinance did not render the ordinance invalid nor did the fact that the property could be more profitably used for business purposes make the ordinance confiscatory and unconstitutional. The court also found that the ordinance was legally adopted, that all preliminary requirements in connection with its adoption were complied with, and that the ordinance was in full force and effect.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court entered judgment for the village.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Municipal corporations -- zoning -- (1) zoning ordinance prohibiting business in section of village zoned residential valid where character of section mainly residential; village entitled to enjoin professional dog handler from continuing his business in such zone -- (2) court will not substitute its judgment for that of legislative body even where determination is debatable -- (3) depreciation in value of property by reason of zoning restrictions does not render ordinance invalid -- (4) ordinance legally adopted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. A zoning ordinance enacted by a village prohibiting the carrying on of a business in a section of the village zoned for residential purposes is not arbitrary, unreasonable or confiscatory where it appears that the property along the highway -- on which the property of defendant, a professional dog handler who maintains kennels on his premises, is located -- is rather rural and its character mainly residential, and that there is no appreciable demand among the residents of the village for defendant's services as a professional dog handler. Plaintiff village is entitled to an injunction restraining&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  defendant from carrying on his business of a professional dog handler in such residential zone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Even where a determination on the part of the board of trustees to keep the village practically free from business is fairly debatable, the court will not substitute its judgment for that of the legislative body charged with the primary duty of determining the question.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Depreciation in value of the property of an individual by reason of the restrictions placed upon it by zoning regulations does not render an ordinance invalid. Nor does the fact that the property might be more profitably used for industrial or business purposes, make the ordinance confiscatory and unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The ordinance was legally adopted where the proceedings taken by the zoning commission were regular and in conformity with section 179-a of the Village Law as to notice of public hearings and the filing of a preliminary and final report. In the absence of a definite requirement of the Village Law as to what notice of the public hearings shall be given, the minutes of the board of trustees noting that two hearings were held sufficiently show a compliance by the zoning commission with the statutory&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  requirement for the holding of such hearings.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pled guilty to attempted robbery in the third degree committed as a second offense. Upon his conviction, the court imposed a minimum sentence of two and one-half years. The State filed a motion to increase the minimum duration of the sentence to five years, claiming that the court's minimum sentence was illegal. The court held that: (1) N.Y.

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Section 1941 of the Penal Law provides that a second felony offender shall be sentenced &quot;to imprisonment for an indeterminate term, the minimum of which shall be not less than one-half of the longest term prescribed upon a first conviction, and the maximum of which shall be not longer than twice such longest term; provided, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  however, that the minimum sentence imposed hereunder upon such second or third felony offender shall in no case be less than five years&quot;.  Section 2192 of the Penal Law provides that when a crime is declared punishable &quot;by not more than&quot; a specified number of years, the court is authorized to pronounce judgment upon conviction in its discretion for any time less than that prescribed by the provisions of the Penal Law. Defendant, who was convicted on his plea of guilty to attempted robbery in the third degree committed as a second offense, could have been given a maximum sentence of five years (Penal Law, &sect; 2129, &sect; 261, subd. 2), and under section 1941 of the Penal Law, the court properly imposed a sentence of two and one-half years to five years.  Such sentence is a legal sentence for the reason that the maximum sentence, which is only a discretionary term and not a fixed term, could be five years and, therefore, one half of this as a minimum sentence could be two and one-half years.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff owners filed an action against defendant town seeking a judgment enjoining their arrest or prosecution or any interference with them in respect to excavation or removal of topsoil from their real property or interference with their business under the authority of Amherst, N.Y., Building Code &sect; XXII (1943).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owners were engaged in removing topsoil from their lands. Amherst, N.Y., Zoning Ordinance &sect; 9(2) provided that farmland could not be used for any other purpose than agriculture. The owners claimed that by the enforcement of the ordinance they were prevented from fulfilling contracts for delivery of topsoil. They claimed that the ordinance was invalid as confiscatory and without due process of law. The court held that &sect; 9(2) was constitutional, reasonable, and valid. The ordinance, while it regulated strictly, was not confiscatory. It provided a formula that would permit the owners' business activities to the point where they invaded or seriously threatened to invade the welfare rights of the community as to health, safety, and general values. The inability of the owners to fulfill contracts was not a compelling objection. There was no convincing showing that contracts could not be fulfilled. The ordinance was a valid exercise of the police power as specifically amplified by 1941 N.Y. Laws 674. It was general in its terms, it was applicable to all alike, and it was directed to a valid purpose to serve broadly public welfare. The ordinance was in no sense capricious.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Injunctions -- removal of topsoil -- (1) Zoning Ordinance of Town of Amherst provides that farm land may not be used for purpose other than agriculture; plaintiffs' business of removing topsoil from farm lands for sale violates ordinance -- (2) Building Code (&sect; XXII) regulates removal of topsoil; such regulation not confiscatory -- (3) esthetic considerations support such </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">legislation</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> -- (4) inability to fulfill contracts not objection; only cost of performance increased by section XXII -- (5) ordinance is valid exercise of police power -- (6) ordinance not capricious or discriminatory -- (7) since town showed no damage, counterclaim dismissed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Subdivision 2 of section 9 of the Zoning Ordinance of the Town of Amherst provides that farm land may not be used for any other purpose than agriculture. The business of certain plaintiffs of removing topsoil from their farm lands for resale is not farming and is in violation of such zoning ordinance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Section XXII of the Building Code of said town regulates the removal of topsoil. Such ordinance, while it regulates strictly, is not confiscatory. It does not constitute a general and complete prohibition&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of the use of property. It provides a formula, the observance of which, within minimum standards, will permit the business activities of the plaintiffs to the point where they invade or seriously threaten to invade the welfare rights of the community as to health, safety and general values.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Esthetic considerations are a proper factor and support the legislation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The inability of plaintiffs to fulfill contracts is not a compelling objection.  There is no convincing showing that contracts cannot be fulfilled, only that the profit therefrom may be lessened or eliminated.  An ordinance does not become unreasonable by reason of the fact solely that it increases the expense of a business and consequently increases the cost of the product of a business.  This ordinance of necessity increases the cost of the topsoil business and where permits are granted, it will increase the price of topsoil produced thereunder.  This increase, however, is not such as to constitute confiscation and does not exceed a reasonable charge for regulation and enforcement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. The ordinance is a valid exercise of the police power. Unless expressly restricted, the police power may be held to include any&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  reasonably prudent legislative program indicated as essential to the growing needs of a forward looking community.  The police power is widely embracing, and constitutionality is to be presumed.  The complaint in this action to enjoin defendants from interfering with plaintiffs' businesses is dismissed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. The ordinance is not capricious and discriminatory. The legislation is general in its terms and is applicable to all alike.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. Since the town has offered no adequate proof of damage from the operations of plaintiffs to support the counterclaim of the answer, the counterclaim is dismissed.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Relator inmate was convicted of feloniously possessing a machine gun, a violation of N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 1897, subd. 1-a, and was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of not less than seven years, nor more than 14 years. His conviction and sentence were affirmed on appeal. The inmate then filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The police raided a building and found four machine guns therein. The inmate was in the building at the time of the raid. He was subsequently convicted of possessing a machine gun in violation of &sect; 1897, subd. 1-a, which provided, inter alia, that the presence of a machine gun in any room, dwelling, structure, or vehicle constituted presumptive evidence of its illegal possession by all persons occupying the place where the gun was found. In his petition for habeas relief, the inmate claimed that the presumption created by &sect; 1897, subd. 1-a, deprived him of due process of the law and was thus violative of U.S. Const. amend. XIV. The court denied the petition, noting that the New York Court of Appeals had determined in a prior case that the presumption did not violate the Fourteenth Amendment. The court also noted that it did not have jurisdiction in a habeas corpus proceeding to determine the question of whether the inmate's due process rights had been violated. Rather, the court found that the inmate's remedy for such a violation was to file a motion to vacate the judgment of conviction in the court that entered it.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court dismissed the writ.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- possession of machine gun -- (1) subdivision 1-a of section 1897 of Penal Law which provides that presence of machine gun in any place is presumptive evidence of illegal possession thereof by person occupying such place is constitutional -- (2) habeas corpus not proper remedy to attack conviction on ground of denial of due process; motion to vacate judgment proper.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Subdivision 1-a of section 1897 of the Penal Law describes a machine gun and provides that possession of one is a felony and that the presence of a machine gun in any place shall be presumptive evidence of its illegal possession by all the persons occupying the place where found.  Such statute is constitutional and does not deny an accused due process of law. The Legislature may enact that when certain facts have been proved they shall be prima facie evidence of the existence of the main fact in question.  The fact upon which the presumption is to rest must have some fair relation to the main fact.  The inference of the existence of the main fact because of the existence of the fact actually proved must not be arbitrary, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and the accused must have a fair opportunity to make his defense and submit the whole case to the jury for decision after weighing the evidence.  Such provision does not take away the right of trial by jury nor does it change the burden of proof.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Moreover, relator who was convicted of violating the section because he was in a building where a machine gun was found cannot use the writ of habeas corpus to attack his conviction on the ground that there was a denial of due process.  Controverted questions of fact as to whether one imprisoned pursuant to a judgment is deprived of his liberty without due process in violation of the Federal Constitution can only be determined by a motion to vacate the judgment made in the court which granted it.  The Supreme Court has no jurisdiction to determine that question upon a writ of habeas corpus. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Condemnation proceedings were held for a determination of the value of claimants' land that was taken by the city for a cross-borough express highway.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The claimants owned property, which was acquired by the city to provide a cross-borough express highway. Proceedings were held before the court for determination of the claimant's property. The court determined that generally the value of property that was subject to eminent domain proceedings was determined by the property's fair market value and that if there was a partial taking, the value was determined by the difference of the value of the whole property before the taking and the value of the remainder after the taking. Additionally, the court held that neither damages incurred to a business because it was required to move to another location as a result of the taking nor expenses incurred in removing personal property from property that was condemned were proper items of damages in a condemnation proceeding. The court found that its receipt of evidence, which showed lost profit, was harmless because the damages awarded were in accordance with the proper standards. Further, the court also considered improvements made by the city in advance of the condemnation in ascertaining just compensation to the claimants.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court adjusted the damage claim of one of the claimants and approved their settlement, ordered the repayment of taxes paid by some of the claimants, and ordered payment of the award to the mortgagees upon submission of proper proof.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. In a condemnation proceeding for the determination of the value of lands taken for a cross-borough express highway which involves many unusually shaped parcels and numerous partial takings, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the owner of private property taken for a public purpose is entitled to just compensation judicially determined.  Just compensation is an award of money for the value of the property as of the time of taking to indemnify the owner for the loss.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The owner of land condemned is entitled to the fair market value.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. A partial taking of an owner's real property by condemnation, leaving the remaining land damaged in value due to the taking and to the resultant size, shape or serious sales impairment of the portion left, is an exception to the constitutional requirement of compensation only for the value of the property taken.  When the property taken is physically an integral part of a larger plot and what is left is substantially deteriorated by reason of the relationship in value of that taken to the entire property, the resulting consequential damages to the remaining part are allowed as part of the sum awarded therefor and for the value of the property taken.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Upon condemnation, a lessee under a lease is entitled to compensation for the value of the unexpired term based upon the difference for such period between the fair annual rental value of the demised premises and the rent&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  reserved.  However, if the lease contains a clause that it shall cease upon the taking of the property for condemnation, the lessee is not entitled to any compensation or to share in the award to the owner-lessor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. An option to buy the property contained in a lease gives the tenants no right to the award or a share of it unless the option has been exercised at the date of the condemnation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. Any claim by a lessee is waived by a clause agreeing that the award will be paid to the lessor without deduction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. A lessee who under agreement with the owner has erected a building on the land is entitled to an award unless he has also limited or waived his right thereto.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. Where there is a change of grade and the lease has an unexpired term of at least three years, both lessor and lessee have a separate right to an award.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. A mortgagee who proves his claim is entitled to be paid the amount of the mortgage and interest at 4% out of the award (since the enactment of section 3-a of the General Municipal Law).  While extinguished on the vesting of title, the mortgage if proved is a lien on the owner's award.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">10. Evidence of sales prices to determine just compensation is admissible on&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  direct examination and is not limited to cross or redirect examination.  Sales are also admissible when included in a notice that they will be offered in evidence upon the trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">11. While expert opinion is still the usual method of proving market value, the view of the property by the trier of the facts and his or their general knowledge of value gained from practical experience and analyses of the opinions by known appraisal checks may lead to a conclusion at variance with such testimony.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">12. As real property alone is taken and it alone requires compensation, incidental losses sustained by the owner are excluded as too speculative.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">13. On the question of value an owner may show any fact which he would naturally and properly bring to the attention of a buyer with whom he was negotiating a sale, but care must be exercised that the mere hope of the owner that the property might be used for some special purpose is not substituted for reality.  Thus while it is proper to show that the property is particularly adapted for a particular business, the success of an enterprise does not depend upon its location alone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">14. Damage occasioned to an owner's business because he is compelled&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to move to another location is not an item which can be considered in a condemnation proceeding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">15. An owner cannot recover the expenses incurred in removing personal property from lands condemned to another location.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">16. Profits may be recognized as an element of value and are only excluded where the evidence is too speculative.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">17. The usable value of the property for any suitable legitimate business is relevant in fixing its market value. The prospective use of the property and its potential value for such use may be considered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">18. Improvements made by the taker in advance of authority in condemnation are considered in ascertaining just compensation to the owner, but not the cost of such improvements, nor their intrinsic, replacement or sound value, nor the value of their use to the taker, but only the amount of the enhancement in the value of the land made by such improvements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">19. The cost or structural value of improvements while not the measure, is a factor in determining value.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">20. Except under unusual circumstances, the actual earnings of multiple dwellings and other improved properties form the factual basis for economic value.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">21. In determining the value of parcels&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  in common use, consideration was given here to the increment of value, if any, which may be reflected to the less valuable parcel from the more valuable one by reason of such use.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">22. The standard practices and principles of law as well as rules and tables in common use are all entitled to due consideration.  None, however, is controlling, and actual value must always depend on such factors as the use to which a property may be put and its marketability.  </SPAN></P>

The court disagreed. The court found that the Commission's formula was reasonable. The remaining question was whether there was evidence to sustain its findings as to values. As to the value of the land and buildings, the court held that the Commission properly accepted the last judicially reviewed city assessment for taxation as prima facie evidence of fair value. City assessments, even those not judicially reviewed, were competent evidence on the question of value. The court concluded that evidence sustained the Commission's finding of value for furniture and fixtures, notwithstanding a lower appraisal. Working capital was an item to be included, and the Commission's act in fixing it at the difference between the current assets and the current liabilities was not arbitrary or unreasonable as against the tenants.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged in an information by the State of New York with keeping empty packing boxes on his premises in violation of Mount Vernon, N.Y., Bldg.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was accused of storing empty packing boxes on his premises in violation of &sect; 5.27. Defendant claimed that &sect; 5.27 was a zoning regulation that was enacted without notice, that &sect; 5.27 was unconstitutional, and that the State's information was required to be dismissed. The court convicted defendant. The court held that a city had the power to prevent fires and to protect its inhabitants, that &sect; 5.27 was not intended as a zoning restriction, and that &sect; 5.27 was intended as a measure of fire prevention and was constitutional. The court also held that defendant piled a huge quantity of boxes on his premises that reached a height of six feet, that there was ample proof supporting the charges, and that defendant was guilty of the offenses with which he was charged.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied defendant's motions to dismiss and convicted defendant of violating the ordinance.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- storage of inflammable material -- (1) motion to dismiss information charging defendant stored empty packing boxes within area where such storage prohibited by ordinance denied and defendant found guilty -- (2) ordinance intended for fire prevention and not zoning -- (3) ordinance presumptively valid; no showing of invalid enactment -- (4) assuming ordinance intended for zoning, ordinance not rendered invalid by failure to hold public hearing and give notice -- (5) power to issue permit not delegated by common council to building commissioner -- (6) court required to take judicial notice of location of premises involved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Section 5.27 of article 5 of the Building Code of the City of Mount Vernon provides that no building within the fire limits shall be used as a lumber yard, cooperage or place for storage of new or second-hand lumber, empty packing boxes or similar inflammable&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  material, as a sawmill, feed, flour or grain mill, &quot;except by special permission of the Common Council after approval by the Commissioner.&quot; A motion to dismiss an information charging that defendant stored empty packing boxes on premises concededly within the fire limits is denied and defendant is adjudged guilty of a violation of the building code provision.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The ordinance is not a zoning regulation and as a consequence it was not necessary that the provisions as to public notice and hearing provided in the Zoning Ordinance of the City of Mount Vernon (&sect; 25) be followed.  The ordinance was intended rather as a measure of fire prevention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The act is presumptively valid and the presumption attachesto the process of enactment.  There is no evidence that the ordinance was not correctly adopted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Assuming that the ordinance were a zoning ordinance, it would not be void for want of public notice and hearing.  The provision for notice and hearing in the zoning ordinance is a self-prescribed limitation enacted by the body charged with having violated it.  It cannot serve to limit the greater power vested in the legislative body by the State.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. The ordinance is not invalid for&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  failure to prescribe a uniform rule for the issuance of a permit.  The common council may act without the approval of the commissioner and the provision for his approval in the ordinance may be disregarded in considering the validity of the ordinance.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner tenants sought review of an order of respondent State Commissioner of Housing granting an increase in rent for apartments to be charged by respondent limited dividend housing corporation. An order was made that the corporation segregate the funds constituting the increased rentals.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After 1947 N.Y. Laws 341 amended N.Y. Pub. Hous. Law &sect; 179 of the Public Housing Law so as to permit a maximum monthly rental of $ 15 per room, the maximum rent chargeable by the corporation was increased to $ 14 a room by the Commissioner. In dismissing the tenant's petition for review of that order, the court noted that there were limitations on the rates of interest limited dividend housing corporations could pay on mortgages or other debts and on the right of mortgage without the consent of the Commissioner. The formula fixing the return that such corporations could obtain was statutory. The corporation's stockholders and debenture holders had never received any dividends or interest. A hearing for the tenants would not have changed the result in light of the Commissioner's diligence, increased costs, and the absence of any interest or dividends to the corporation's investors.</SPAN></P>

In a proceeding to review the action of the commissioner, an application to set aside the rent increase order on the ground that the tenants had no hearing is denied and the petition is dismissed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. There is no statutory provision for any hearing in such situation.

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The return made in the present proceeding indicates that the commissioner has been diligent, prudent and careful and there is no basis for a claim that he has been remiss in the discharge of his duties.

The property owner sought to build 100 bathhouses and 56 cabanas, which was denied by the building inspector until the property owner obtained special permission from the board of appeals. The court held that the ordinance that forbade such uses of the property owner's property was unconstitutional because it failed to provide the necessary standards to have been met by applicants and was void and ordered the building inspector to issue the permit. The court found that the local legislative body was without authority to delegate its power to zone. The court stated that no discretion was given to the employee who administered the ordinance. He merely determined if the standards had been met by the applicant and the standards were to have been reasonable, clear, understandable. The court held that nullifying the special permit section had the effect of restoring the ordinance to the form it took before the amendment, which form provided that a &quot;place of amusement&quot; might have been established in a business district as a matter of right.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested during a public demonstration. The arresting officer testified that he warned defendant to move on, but that she kept &quot;pushing and shoving&quot; toward him all the time. Defendant denied that she had been warned to move on by the officer. She stated that the police had pushed her into the gutter and that the crowd had pushed her back against the officer. She also asserted that she could not have moved if she had wanted to, because of the pressure of the crowd. The officer placed her under arrest and charged her with disorderly conduct. The court found that the police had the right to take reasonable steps to break up the demonstration. The sidewalk was blocked and traffic could not move freely as a result of the demonstration. The police officer, therefore, had the right to order defendant to move on. From all the evidence, there was doubt as to whether the police officer did order defendant to move on. Even if the order was given it was doubtful that defendant heard it. Furthermore, even if defendant wanted to move it was doubtful she could have because of the pressure of the crowd.</SPAN></P>

Penal Law &sect; 1141(1) by reason of having sold a book that he published. The People alleged that the book was obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy, indecent, and disgusting. Defendant's counsel had offered as evidence a collection of letters that were claimed by him to be written by prominent members of the community and stated their opinions of the book. In granting the motion to dismiss, the court found that it could not find by any prevailing judicial standard that the book would have a sexually demoralizing effect upon its readers. The court found that the book was not obscene or otherwise within the condemnation of N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 1141(1). Factors that had to be considered included the theme of the book, the degree of sincerity of purpose evidence in it, its literary worth, the channels used in its distribution, contemporary attitudes toward the literary treatment of sexual behavior, and the types of readers reasonably expected to secure it for perusal. The court also sustained the objection of the People's counsel to the reception in evidence of defendant's collection of solicited letters.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. In a prosecution for the sale of an allegedly obscene book (Penal Law, &sect; 1141, subd. 1), letters solicited by defendant publisher from allegedly prominent members of the community stating their opinions of the book may not be received in evidence.  ( </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">People </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">v.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11"> Viking Press,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 147 Misc. 813, not followed.)

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. On the other hand, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  opinions of professional literary critics publicly disseminated in the ordinary course of their employment are proper aids to the court in weighing an author's sincerity of purpose and the book's literary worth.  A collection of clippings established to have been taken from newspapers and periodicals of general circulation containing reviews of the book by literary critics for those publications is received in evidence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The author testified that his primary purpose was to express the view that, at any given time, the condition of national morality is reflected by the then current condition of individual morality and that national policies of compromise at the expense of principle occur when it has become common practice for individual moral standards to be disregarded for the sake of material advantage.  The critics generally were impressed by his sincerity of purpose.  Every passage in the book seems to have been included to express the author's theme.  Considering the theme of the book, the degree of sincerity of purpose evident in it, its literary worth, the channels used in its distribution, contemporary attitudes toward the literary treatment of sexual behavior and the types&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of readers reasonably to be expected to secure it for perusal, as factors in an evaluation of the extent to which the book as a whole would have a demoralizing effect on its readers, the book is not obscene or otherwise condemned by the statute.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant state made a motion to dismiss a claim by claimant Native American for her share of funds paid to the Onondaga Nation for land purchased by the state.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Native American brought an action as an enrolled member of the Onondaga Nation, not residing on the reservation, alleging certain rights in communal lands. Upon consideration, the court granted the state's motion to dismiss. The court held that the Onondaga Nation did not have a relationship as such with the state but that the tribe was a &quot;ward&quot; of the federal government. Although the tribe had retained its autonomy in many ways, the court found that the federal government had the sole power to legislate as to the distribution of their lands pursuant to the United States Constitution. The court also noted that statutory authority was required before a tribe could sue or be sued or an individual in the name of the tribe could bring an action. Therefore, the court held that it had no jurisdiction as a state court regarding the Native American's claim. The court also held that the Native American did not have title or a vendible interest in the communal property. The court also found that the moneys paid for the property were not annuities but a lump sum paid pursuant to agreement with the Council of Chiefs, which was equitably distributed to those residing on the reservation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted the state's motion to dismiss the Native American's claim for funds regarding the state's purchase of communal property.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Indians -- jurisdiction of State courts -- (1) claim against State by Onondaga Indian for her share of money paid by State to Onondaga Nation for land; claimant, nonresident on reservation, who had no title or enforcible right to communal property, claims State liable as guardian of Indian wards; claim dismissed for lack of jurisdiction -- (2) status of Indian tribes discussed; self government of Onondaga Nation noted; land disputes customarily settled by Council of Chiefs -- (3) no obligation by State shown; judgment against State would affect property rights of Onondaga Nation and would deny inherent sovereignty of tribe with no showing of failure to follow applicable custom.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Claimant, as an enrolled member of the Onondaga Nation not residing on the reservation, alleges that she was the possessor of certain rights in the communal lands of said Nation which have been abridged and she demands judgment against the State because it purchased some of said land and paid the agreed price to the Council of Chiefs who distributed the proceeds equally among the enrolled&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  members of the tribe living on the reservation. The lands involved are communal lands and are not lands allotted to, possessed, or occupied by claimant. They were acquired by agreement not by appropriation. In determining who are the communal owners entitled to share in the distribution of a fund under a treaty, the court will follow Indian laws and customs so far as they do not conflict with the laws of the United States or the purposes of the treaty or natural law and justice. Claimant had no title or enforcible right to the communal property nor did she have a vendible interest in same. She does not state whether she is a full-blooded Onondaga, whether she was born on the reservation, whether she has ever lived there or whether she at any time was an active member of the tribe. She demands judgment on the theory that the State paid the Council of Chiefs without insuring her participation in the distribution. She alleges that by reason of an existing fiduciary relationship of State guardianship over its Indian wards, the State is liable although no claim of fraud is made. The action is dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. ( </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Seminole Indians </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">v.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11"> United States,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 316 U.S. 286, 62&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  S. Ct. 1049, 86 L. Ed. 1480, distinguished.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The status of Indian tribes, particularly that of the Six Nations which includes the Onondaga Nation, with respect to the United States Government and the State of New York, is discussed and it is noted that the rights which belong to self government are vested in the Onondagas, and that their Indian laws and customs control in all international affairs of the tribe when not expressly implied by statute. It is noted also that the Onondaga Nation, unlike others, has never accepted or relied upon the State courts but has retained its tribal integrity and its sovereignty by Council of Chiefs which is a tribunal with original and general jurisdiction over local affairs of reservation members. Land disputes are settled by the chiefs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Moreover, claimant has sought to disregard completely the organization of which she claims to be a member. She has provided the court with no statute which recognizes an obligation running from the State to any and every individual Indian belonging to the Nation nor has she pointed to any treaty or agreement where such an obligation was required or mentioned. These moneys were not annuities but the total&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  amount was paid at once to the tribe and no complaint is made that the Council of Chiefs failed to disburse it equitably to all members residing on the reservation. Property rights of the Onondaga tribe and legal and political relations affecting it would seem to be involved in the proceeding. The Nation is not a party. The ultimate result sought, namely a judgment against the State, would affect the property rights and relations of the tribe. In the absence of legislative action bestowing on individual Indians the right to litigate internal questions relating to their tribal property in the Court of Claims and conferring jurisdiction to determine such controversies, this court should not assume jurisdiction.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, Superintendent of Banks for the State of New York, as liquidator of a Japanese bank, moved to dismiss plaintiff's third cause of action seeking return of certain funds transferred to the bank on the ground that it was not commenced within the prescribed time period under N.Y.

Plaintiff alleged that &sect; 625 was inapplicable because the third cause of action sought return of a particular, earmarked fund, not part of the agency's assets, to which plaintiff alone was entitled when liquidation began. Plaintiff claimed that under the circumstances, the statute of limitations in &sect; 625 had been tolled. Defendant's motion was granted because the Federal government had never &quot;occupied the field&quot; in such a manner or to such an extent that the State of New York was without power to liquidate the New York agency of the Japanese bank in accordance with state banking laws. Further, the six-month statute of limitations in &sect; 625 was mandatory and could not be tolled.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's motion to dismiss was granted. Plaintiff's allegations established nothing more than a debtor-creditor relationship with the agency with respect to the funds sought to be recovered. The federal government did not occupy the field precluding the State of New York from liquidating the New York agency of a foreign bank, and the applicable statute of limitations was mandatory and could not be tolled.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The resident's action sought to block the city agencies and officials from developing a housing project involving four separate development sites and from other acts related to the project, including the sale of notes or certificates of indebtedness and bonds, the payment of moneys pursuant to a subsidy-guaranty contract, and the condemnation of land in the areas selected for the project. The court held dismissal of the action was appropriate in part because the complaint failed to allege facts sufficient to make out a good case against the city agencies and officials on any of the grounds mentioned in the complaint. In particular, the court found the resident's allegation that families with annual incomes of more than $ 4,500 per year were eligible for tenancy in the buildings proposed was insufficient without more to overcome a presumption that the eligibility limits ultimately established for the project would be fixed in conformity with the requirements of N.Y.

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. In this taxpayer's action to enjoin the Mayor of the City of New York, other members of the board of estimate and the New York City housing authority from proceeding with a housing project, a motion to dismiss the complaint is granted on the ground that the complaint fails to allege facts sufficient to make out a cause of action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Plaintiff alleges that the project is not &quot;low rent housing&quot; within the meaning of section 1 of article XVIII of the Constitution and&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  subdivision 23 of section 3 of the Public Housing Law since eligibility to tenancy in the proposed project will be increased to include families with annual incomes of $ 4,500 or more per year, and a monthly rental of $ 12.50 per room is contemplated, as against former rentals of $ 6.05 to $ 7.00. Under article XVIII the Legislature may provide for low rent housing for persons of low income &quot;as defined by law&quot; (&sect; 1), and the Legislature has defined low rent housing to mean dwellings within the financial reach of &quot;families of low income&quot; (Public Housing Law, &sect; 3, subd. 23), and the latter have been defined as families who are in the low income groups and &quot;who cannot afford to pay enough to cause private enterprise in their municipality to build a sufficient supply of adequate, safe and sanitary dwellings&quot; (Public Housing Law, &sect; 3, subd. 18). The Legislature has thus fixed the criterion of what constitutes low rent housing or what constitutes families of low income without reference to a precise amount in dollars and cents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The allegation as to families with incomes of more than $ 4,500 per year is made upon information and belief and is a conclusory statement. It is insufficient&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  without more to overcome the presumption that when the eligibility limits are established they will be fixed in conformity with law. Moreover, assuming the truth thereof, it does not necessarily follow that the project is illegal for such families are &quot;families of low income&quot; if they cannot afford to pay enough to cause private enterprise to build a sufficient supply of adequate, safe and sanitary dwellings. Furthermore, there is no legal requirement that public housing projects must be limited to the very lowest rents and the very lowest income limits that have been previously set, or that the needs of all families of the very lowest incomes be satisfied before public housing may be constructed for the benefit of other low income groups.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Nor does the allegation that rentals paid by the majority of tenants of privately owned multiple dwellings in the city of New York are less than $ 12.50 per room per month, avail plaintiff, for families of low income, as defined by the statute, are those which cannot afford to pay enough to cause private enterprise to build a sufficient supply of adequate dwellings, and no facts have been pleaded to show at what rental private enterprise could&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  or would build adequate dwellings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. The Constitution authorizes the Legislature to provide low rent housing for persons of low income &quot;or&quot; for the clearance and rehabilitation of insanitary areas &quot;or for both such purposes&quot;, and the Legislature has so provided (Public Housing Law, &sect; 3, subd. 14). Consequently, the fact that slum clearance is not called for here does not impair the legality of the project.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. The fact that construction will be pursuant to the authorization contained in the Constitution is sufficient answer to the charge of illegality based on class discrimination and to a charge of loss of potential tax income from competition with private housing developments. The same is true with respect to the claim that the construction will produce overcrowding and will depreciate adjacent real estate values.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. The charge that the project will violate zoning laws is a conclusion without supporting facts and the claim that the city is illegally agreeing to donate sewage, drainage and sanitation, as well as beds of streets to be closed, is without merit in view of sections 99, 100 and 124 of the Public Housing Law which expressly authorize such donations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. The subsidy-guaranty&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  contract for the project is not illegal because it has not received the approval of the city council, but only that of the board of estimate (Public Housing Law, &sect; 97; Administrative Code of City of New York, &sect; 223-3.0; N.Y. City Charter, &sect;&sect; 295, 300).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. The attack on the location of one of the sites, based upon a comparison of the tax arrears thereon and those of other areas considered and upon a comparison of the relative cost of acquisition, goes solely to the administrative judgment of the city housing authority, the board of estimate, the city planning commission and other agencies legally empowered to determine the sites.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">10. The charge that it is intended to acquire one of the sites at a price greater than its assessed valuation, which is claimed to be the fair market value, must also be rejected since the property will be acquired by eminent domain and the amount to be paid will be that which the court in charge of the condemnation proceedings fixes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">11. There is nothing in the law indicating that it is illegal to combine four separate developments into a single project for financing purposes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">12. The charges that the subsidy-guaranty contract and the approving resolution&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of the board of estimate create a city indebtedness in excess of the city's debt limitations are nothing more than conclusions, and insufficient facts are set forth to support them.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff taxpayer filed an action against defendants, a police commissioner, a city, and a mayor, for an injunction restraining them from destroying slot machines. The taxpayer also sought to restrain defendants from enforcing an order of destruction directing them to return the machines from the premises from which they were seized or post security for their safe return.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer alleged that the commissioner and his subordinates threatened to seize machines from various citizens and places in the city and have them destroyed. The taxpayer claimed that she did not have an adequate remedy at law for the relief demanded. However, the taxpayer did not claim ownership of or interest in the machines and did not claim that she had any other interest in the proceedings other than as a taxpayer anxious to prevent waste. The court found that there was no urgency in the matter. The statutes that were questioned by the taxpayer had been on the statute books for almost 50 years. Further, the supreme court did not have jurisdiction in equity to grant to the taxpayer an injunction against defendants as prayed for in her amended complaint. Moreover, because the taxpayer did not claim any interest in any of the machines or in the proceedings, she could not maintain an action for an injunction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied the motion for an injunction filed by the taxpayer. The stay in proceedings was vacated and set aside.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Municipal corporations -- taxpayer's action -- (1) court has no power to grant temporary injunction in action by taxpayer (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">General Municipal Law, &sect; 51</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">) to enjoin destruction of slot machines by city on ground that if Penal Law (&sect;&sect; 982-985) </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">unconstitutional</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> city will be subjected to damage suits by owners of machines, thus wasting city funds -- (2) court has no inherent power to declare </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">statute</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> unconstitutional</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> except where litigant's personal rights affected -- (3) matter not so urgent that court should ignore exact procedure -- (4) although plaintiff disclaims ownership of slot machines, she is seeking to lay foundation for damage claims; court will not permit true owners to protect their unlawful property and activities through a &quot;front&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. In an action by a taxpayer under section 51 of the General Municipal Law to restrain certain officials and the police department of a city from destroying slot machines seized by the police on the grounds that sections&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  982, 983, 984 and 985 of the Penal Law, which authorize the seizure and destruction of such machines, are unconstitutional, and that if defendants should deprive the rightful owners of the machines and should destroy said machines, defendants would, if the statutes be unconstitutional, subject the city to damage claims thereby causing waste of the property and funds of the city, the taxpayer's motion for a temporary injunction is denied.  The Supreme Court has no jurisdiction in equity to grant said taxpayer a temporary injunction as prayed for in the complaint.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. There is no inherent power in a court of equity to set aside a statute as unconstitutional or to right a wrong, except in a controversy between litigants where it is sought to enforce rights or to enjoin, redress or punish wrongs affecting the individual life, liberty or property of one or more of the litigants.  Special, peculiar personal rights of the complaining litigant must be affected.  A citizen and taxpayer has no right to bring before a court for review the acts of a department of government simply because he is one of many such citizens and taxpayers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Where a matter is of urgency and of transcending public&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  importance, the court should not permit any delay and it would be justified in not overly concerning itself with exact procedure.  This matter is not such a one.  The statutes have been upon the statute books of this State in nearly their present form for almost fifty years and were last amended in 1934.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Moreover, plaintiff taxpayer comes before the court here seeking to lay the foundation for a flood of litigation against the municipality for destruction of the slot machines. She escapes the &quot;unclean hands&quot; doctrine by her disavowal of any interest in the machines. Nowhere have the names of the true owners appeared.  A court of equity ought not permit itself to be used as a forum wherein persons engaged in activities contrary to law may use a &quot;front&quot; in an effort to protect their contraband property and in an effort to permit themselves to continue their unlawful activities secure in the half-light of anonymity.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An action was brought against defendant for the failure to comply with the fire commissioner's direction, which required defendant to install certain fire safety devices. Defendant admitted that no effort was made to comply with the direction, but contended that there was no obligation on its part to do so, inasmuch as his building was not a hotel within the contemplation of the &sect; 487e-2.0(d). The defendant has mistaken its remedy. The court held that it had no jurisdiction to review the facts for the purpose of determining whether the fire commissioner's order, which represented the exercised discretion of that official, was reasonable or necessary. The only question, which the court could consider was whether defendant did in fact comply with the fire commissioner's direction. Inasmuch as there was no such compliance, defendant was found guilty as charged. No valid reason was presented to justify taking the matter outside the jurisdiction of the New York City Board of Standards and Appeals.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Three former employees sought to recover overtime wages withheld by the former employer.

The court ruled that the former employees' work was sufficiently closely related to the movement of commerce to justify a holding that they were &quot;engaged in commerce.&quot; The court held that the former employer was not relieved of its obligations to pay overtime wages under the Act by the passage of the Portal-to-Portal Act of 1947, 29 U.S.C.S. &sect; 251 et seq., because the statute was retroactive in its scope and was an attempt to exonerate employers from the consequences of having failed in the past to comply with the terms of the Act. The court determined that the former employees had a vested right to their wages for services already rendered and that application of the Portal-to-Portal Act would violate ex post facto principals.

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Defendants, under a cost-plus contract with the War Department, were constructing an airbase for the Government in Greenland and, for administrative and executive purposes, they maintained a New York office in which plaintiffs were employed and which was responsible for obtaining supplies and materials and sending them to Greenland.  At this office were kept all the records of materials, supplies, equipment and the like.  Plaintiff bookkeeper-accountant and plaintiff watchmen sue under the Federal Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 to recover additional compensation for overtime work, an equal amount as liquidated damages, and attorney's fees.

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Employers' contention that plaintiffs are not entitled to the benefits of the act because they were not engaged in interstate commerce or in any work essential thereto lacks validity in view of the constant stream of men and materials from the United States to Greenland and return.  Plaintiff bookkeeper-accountant was responsible for the recording of data relating to the interstate and foreign transportation of men and materials and plaintiff watchmen at the office not only guarded the documents but protected the supplies destined for Greenland.  All three employees come clearly within the Act.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Section 9 of the Federal Portal-to-Portal Act provides that no employer shall be subject to liability on account of failure to pay minimum wages or overtime compensation under the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 if he pleads and proves that the act or omission complained of was in good faith and in reliance on any administrative regulation and defendants contend that their failure to pay was in good faith and in reliance upon orders and rulings of the War Department.  It is asserted that it was the view of the War Department that the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Fair Labor Standards Act did not apply to firms doing work similar to theirs and that, even if such views were invalid, they were, nevertheless, relied on in good faith.  From an analysis of the testimony and the records it does not appear that the Secretary of War at any time recognized the applicability of the statute to employees like the plaintiffs.  So far as defendants are concerned, their negotiations and dealings were entirely with the War Department.  In no event could defendants be reimbursed by the Government for any wages disbursed unless their payments were in strict accordance with the rulings from the department.  It is plain that there were orders and rulings relating to the payment of wages directed to defendants and that defendants complied therewith.  As between the Wage and Hour Administrator and the War Department, the defendants had to abide by the rulings of the latter with which it was dealing.  It could not with impunity act in defiance of those rulings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Since the defense by the statute is a bar to the action, plaintiffs urge that the statute is not constitutional when applied to them.  The actions were pending when the Portal-to-Portal Act was passed and&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  it is said to be invalid under the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution because, reaching back into the past, it deprives plaintiffs of property -- earnings acquired in the past.  While retroactive legislation is not beyond the power of a Legislature to enact, it calls for justification and no justification was expressed in the Congressional statement of findings and policy in part I of the act.  For services already rendered, the employee had a vested right to his wages. The Fifth Amendment looks to the substance of owners' rights and these have been destroyed.  An obstacle has been interposed to plaintiffs' right to recovery where none had previously existed.  Congress adopted the invalidity of the rulings of the Secretary of War as the basis, not for isolating him or the Government from liability, but for outlawing the plaintiffs' claims against their employers.  In the absence of findings of an overwhelming public need to deny compensation for work done, courts ought not to rationalize Congressional action in an effort to support that denial.  Congress was without power to deprive plaintiffs of the wages they had already earned whether the power was attempted to be&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  exercised by direct repeal or, as in this instance, by reference to a standard erected by the War Department.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. As to plaintiffs' claim for liquidated damages, different considerations apply.  The Fair Labor Standards Act does not authorize payment of interest as such but it has provided a substitute, in effect, 100% interest which is deemed to be damages for withholding the wages. The computation of damage for withholding sums due has always been a subject within legislative control even when the Legislature has acted retroactively. It was the judgment of Congress that the item of damage heretofore allowed a plaintiff in a suit under the Fair Labor Standards Act ought, under certain circumstances, be disallowed and the soundness of its judgment in this matter cannot be inquired into.  The two branches of recovery must be treated separately from a constitutional standpoint.  It cannot be said it would be arbitrary to deny a recovery beyond the strict overtime, where overtime payment was withheld, not willfully or deliberately or in defiance of the statute but pursuant to the mature and considered judgment of a department of the Government with which the employer had his dealings. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  6. The principle relating to &quot;double payment&quot; applies with equal force to an allowance for attorney's fees for it is a rule of the common law that the expense of carrying on a law suit is not an item of compensation to the prevailing party.  The power to deny interest or damages by way of interest from a recovery includes the power to deny attorney's fees as an item of recovery, even retroactively.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. Normally the plaintiffs suing for unpaid wages would be entitled to interest under the New York statute (Civ. Prac. Act, &sect; 480) but, since the Portal-to-Portal Act of 1947 governs and Congress intended to relieve defendants from all liability, except where it was beyond its power to do so, there can be no interest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. Plaintiffs, however, may include costs under the New York statute.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant filed a motion to dismiss plaintiff's personal injury action against him on the ground that he was not a resident of New York and the court did not have jurisdiction over his person as a result. Service of the summons was made upon defendant pursuant to N.Y. Veh. &amp; Traf. Law &sect; 52, as amended by 1937 N.Y. Laws 490. Defendant claimed that &sect; 52 violated N.Y. Const. art. VI, &sect; 11, relating to the powers and jurisdiction of county courts.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The enactment of N.Y. Veh. &amp; Traf. Law &sect; 52 was caused by the legislature in order to give New York residents a remedy against non-resident users of New York highways. The legislation was based on a legal theory that when a court acquired jurisdiction of the subject matter, it also acquired jurisdiction over the person of a nonresident involved in an accident upon the New York highways. Under &sect; 52 it was presumed that a defendant, by such operation of a motor vehicle, knew the law and gave his consent that a summons served upon the Secretary of State had the same force and effect as if personally served on him within the state. 1937 N.Y. Laws 490 added the following language: &quot;and within the territorial jurisdiction of the court from which the summons issued.&quot; The court held that, by implication, the legislature had conferred jurisdiction upon all courts that had jurisdiction of the subject matter, jurisdiction over the person of a defendant when service was made as provided for in N.Y. Veh. &amp; Traf. Law &sect; 52. Applying the rule of implied consent, the court found no conflict between provisions of the New York State Constitution conferring jurisdiction upon county courts and &sect; 52.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied defendant's motion to dismiss.</SPAN></P>

VI, &sect; 11) limits jurisdiction of County Courts to residents, jurisdiction may be conferred by consent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Service of the summons, in this action for damages for personal injuries arising out of the alleged negligent use of the highways by nonresidents, has been made pursuant to section 52 of the Vehicle and Traffic Law. That section provides for service by mail upon the Secretary of State and further provides that the operation of a motor vehicle in this State shall signify an agreement that any summons so served shall be of the same force and validity as if served personally within the State and within the territorial jurisdiction of the court from which the summons issues.  By such service the County Court acquired jurisdiction, and a motion to dismiss the complaint is denied. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  2. Section 11 of article VI of the State Constitution provides that jurisdiction of County Courts shall not be extended to authorize an action for the recovery of a sum in excess of $ 3,000 or in which any person not a resident of the county is the defendant unless such defendant have an office for the transaction of business within the county and the cause of action arose therein.  There is no conflict between this constitutional provision and section 52 of the Vehicle and Traffic Law. Concededly the court had jurisdiction of the subject matter. Jurisdiction over the parties may be conferred by consent.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a proceeding by plaintiff limited dividend housing company to condemn a parcel of real property for low-rent housing, defendants opposed the condemnation on the ground of the unconstitutionality of the provision in N.Y.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The housing company sought to condemn a parcel of real property for low-rent housing for persons of low income. Defendants urged that &sect; 135 was unconstitutional because it provided that a certificate issued by the State Housing Commissioner was &quot;conclusive evidence&quot; that a property had been acquired for a public use. The trial court construed the term &quot;conclusive evidence&quot; as used in &sect; 135 in light of the presumption favoring a statute's constitutionality. It concluded that the legislature had intended to give great weight to the certificate and to regard the matters certified as incontrovertible and conclusive, provided the certificate had been issued according to law. The trial court found no basis for nullifying the determination of the commissioner. Further, the trial court found that a preference to be given in the housing to members of the garment trade had not made the taking for a private use. The taking of property for a housing project could be for a public use, despite preferences in housing matters, as long as the persons benefitted satisfied the statutory definition of low income and there was no discrimination.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Public housing -- condemnation -- commissioner's certificate as &quot;conclusive evidence&quot; of necessity -- (1) Public Housing Law (&sect;&sect; 134, 135) providing that certificate of State Housing Commissioner shall be &quot;conclusive evidence&quot; that acquisition of property in public interest and necessary for public use does not bar review of commissioner's determination; certificate &quot;conclusive&quot; only if issued in manner prescribed by law and with reasonable basis; so construed, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">statute</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> not </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">unconstitutional</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> -- (2) </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">statute</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> presumed constitutional in construing words &quot;conclusive evidence&quot; -- (3) project of limited dividend housing company to condemn real property for low-rent housing for persons of low income not for private use although sponsored by trade union of which 30% of tenant-stockholders are members -- (4) judgment granted for relief requested in petition in proceeding to condemn real property for low-rent housing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Sections 134 and 135 of the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Public Housing Law provide that in a proceeding, such as this, by a limited dividend housing company to condemn a parcel of real property for low-rent housing for persons of low income, the certificate issued by the State Housing Commissioner shall be &quot;conclusive evidence&quot; that the acquisition of the property is necessary for the construction of a low-rent housing project and that the acquisition is in the public interest and necessary for the public use. It may be assumed that the Legislature cannot pass conclusive rules of evidence; that a legislative or administrative finding of public use is not conclusive on the courts and that, if the Legislature intended to deny to property owners the right to review a determination of the State Housing Commissioner, the law would be unconstitutional. However, the intention in the passage of this statute was to give the certificate great weight and to regard the matter therein certified as incontrovertible and conclusive in character, providing the certificate was issued in the manner prescribed by law and providing there was any basis for the determination of the commissioner, and the intention was also that the determination should be nullified&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  only if palpably without reasonable foundation. The certificate may be issued only after a public hearing (Public Housing Law, &sect; 134), notice of which must be published in the manner prescribed by law (&sect; 135). The statute when so construed is not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. In construing the meaning of the words &quot;conclusive evidence&quot;, the presumption in favor of its constitutionality should be applied.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The fact that the project is sponsored by a trade union and that about 30% of the tenant-stockholders of the plaintiff corporation are members of that union or in some way connected with the garment trade does not justify a determination that the proposed taking is not for public use. It need not be shown that the development may be open for use by everybody in order to make it a public use. The taking of the property for a housing project may be for public use even though this apparent preference be granted provided the persons benefited are persons of low income (N. Y. Const., art. XVIII, &sect; 1) and provided also that there is no discrimination because of race, creed, color or national origin (Public Housing Law, &sect; 223). The main purpose of the legislation is to eliminate slum areas, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and if the public good is thus enhanced by the construction of the project it is unimportant that the corporation and its stockholders may ultimately reap a benefit.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondents, the New York State Civil Service Commission and others, filed a motion to dismiss petitioner applicants' action in which they sought an order prohibiting the Commission from taking any proceeding to cancel an examination taken by the applicants for the position of fire fighters in a certain city and the eligible list upon which the applicants were placed, pursuant to N.Y.

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. A petition in a proceeding under article 78 of the Civil Practice Act, in the nature of prohibition, to prohibit the State Civil Service Commission from taking any proceedings to cancel the examination taken by petitioners, the resulting eligible list and the appointments of petitioners as fire fighters in the fire department of the City of Lackawanna, which challenges a proceeding pending against such city's civil service commission before the State commission, on the ground that the State commission has prejudged the proceeding, that subdivision 7 of section 11 of the Civil Service Law (as amd. by L. 1944, ch. 435) under which the State commission has instituted the proceeding is unconstitutional and that the proceeding is invalid because petitioners have not been given any notice of the hearing and have not been made parties to the proceeding, must be dismissed for insufficiency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The factual allegations in the petition and the exhibits show that the matter has&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  not been prejudged but has been set down for hearing and if the hearing reveals that the charges are sustained, the State commission proposes to take appropriate action.  The factual situation shown by the exhibits prevails over any conflicting allegations in the petition.  The petition charges misconduct by employees of the State commission but contains no factual allegations to sustain an inference that the members of the commission are biased or prejudiced or that they will not decide the matters fairly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The State commission is not disqualified by reason of its preliminary investigation. The commission has power to supervise and review the work of municipal commissions, and the statute (Civil Service Law, &sect; 11, subd. 7) necessarily contemplates that the commission will conduct such preliminary ex parte investigations as it may deem proper.  Before taking final action, the State commission must give the local commission an opportunity &quot;to make a personal explanation and to file papers in opposition&quot; to the action proposed to be taken, but the statute does not require that a judicial or quasi-judicial hearing precede the State commission's action.  The function of the State&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  commission is predominantly legislative or executive rather than judicial in character.  Where the Legislature vests in a particular administrative agency the sole power of investigation and decision, the Legislature's purpose cannot be defeated by disqualification of the designated officer or agency on the ground of alleged prejudgment or bias.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Under subdivision 7 of section 11 of the Civil Service Law, as amended in 1944, the State commission has power to rescind an eligible list established by a municipal commission and cancel an appointment made from such rescinded list not only on the ground of fraud or material misstatement but also on the ground that &quot;the provisions or purposes of this chapter are not properly or sufficiently carried out.&quot; This would seem to embrace the power to rescind lists and cancel appointments upon the ground that the examination given for the position was not sufficiently practical in character and did not fairly test the relative capacity and fitness of the persons examined to discharge the duties of the position within the standard of section 14 of the Civil Service Law. The charges served by the State commission upon the municipal commission indicate&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  that the former intends to inquire whether the examinations were practical in character and complied with the standard established by section 14, whether the questions and answers were disclosed to certain candidates in advance of the examination and whether the oral examination was so poorly conducted that many of the candidates knew in advance the questions which were to be asked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. The 1944 amendment to subdivision 7 of section 11 of the Civil Service Law does not invade the home rule provisions of the State Constitution (art. IX, &sect; 12) and is not an improper delegation of legislative power to an administrative agency. The maintenance and protection of the merit system in civil service is a matter of State concern and appropriate powers may be vested in the State commission in that regard by general law without invading the province of local government.  The standard of the commission's action is sufficiently set forth in the statute so that no valid objection can be made that the Legislature has granted unfettered discretionary power to the commission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. The statute does not provide for notice to petitioners or anyone other than the local commission.  Petitioners have no&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  right to an administrative hearing in the absence of a provision therefor in the statute.  If the commission issues an order canceling petitioners' appointments, they may seek relief in a proceeding under article 78 of the Civil Practice Act in the nature of mandamus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. Section 22 of the Civil Service Law which forbids the removal of veterans -- and petitioners are such -- except for incompetency or misconduct shown after hearing on due notice, is wholly inapplicable here.  The question here is whether petitioners were legally appointed in the first instance and whether the eligible list from which they were appointed should be rescinded and the appointments cancelled </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">ab initio</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.  The protection against removal under section 22 attaches only after it is established that the veteran was lawfully appointed in the first place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. Petitioners have no standing to maintain a proceeding to prohibit the proceeding now pending before the State commission which proceeding will give the municipal commission an opportunity to make an explanation of the matters in controversy.  Moreover, the hearing will embrace matters other than the examination in which petitioners are interested.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. Prohibition&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  will lie only to enjoin a judicial or quasi-judicial proceeding.  Concededly the State commission has not instituted any quasi-judicial proceeding to which the petitioners are parties or by which they can be bound.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff shareholders' first cause of action against defendant utility company challenged its merger with a second utility company. The shareholders' second, third, and fourth causes of action were predicated upon acts of the utility company prior to the merger and sought an accounting of the utility company prior to the merger. The utility company filed a motion for summary judgment and a motion to dismiss the causes of action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">As to the first cause of action, the shareholders alleged that N.Y. Stock Corp. Law &sect; 85 was unconstitutional and void insofar as it authorized this merger. The court disagreed and granted the utility company's motion for summary judgment. The Supreme Court of New York County had previously overruled the claim that the provision incorporated into &sect; 85 permitting a stock corporation to merge with another corporation of similar power was unconstitutional. The court held that the matter was primarily one of public policy within the province of the legislature. Further, the remedy of appraisal and judgment was intended to afford fair and just compensation to dissenters. In the second, third, and fourth causes of action, the allegations of the first cause of action were repeated and the shareholders purported to bring suit both individually and as stockholders. The court held that the shareholders had no individual cause of action, as the alleged wrong was to the second utility company and no individual cause of action existed. Likewise, the shareholders could not bring suit derivatively because any wrong to the second utility company had vested in the utility company upon the merger.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted the utility company's motion for summary judgment dismissing the complaint as to the first cause of action. The court dismissed the complaint as to the second, third and fourth causes of action, with leave to serve an amended complaint within 20 days after service of a copy of the order. The court also held that there was no cause of action stated in favor of the shareholders and individuals.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff contractor filed suit against defendant utility company, seeking an order requiring the utility to continue to provide gas service to an apartment building. The intervening defendant was the Public Service Commission of the State of New York. Before the court was the Commission's motion for judgment and to dismiss the complaint on the ground that the court was without subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to N.Y. R. Civ. Prac. 107(2).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The complaint alleged that the utility company was the sole supplier to the public of Syracuse of electricity and gas for light, heat, and power. The contractor arranged for construction of several apartment houses to be heated by gas and advised the utility company of intention to construct the buildings with separate gas heating equipment. The contractor notified the utility company that such gas heating systems had been installed in several of the apartments and would shortly be installed in the remainder. The utility company laid pipes connecting from its gas mains in the adjacent streets into the basement of each of the apartments for servicing gas to such heating systems and to stoves and hot water heaters. The utility company then notified the contractor that it would discontinue all gas service to the apartments unless the gas heating units, which were in violation of restrictive regulations, were discontinued. The court held that there were no legal or statutory authority conferring sole authority on the Commission in an action such as the instant one. The court further held that there was a question of law presented in the complaint that required judicial determination.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Public utilities -- regulation by Public Service Commission -- (1) complaint, in action for injunction, alleges defendant, sole supplier in city of Syracuse of gas for light, heat and power, gave notice it would discontinue gas service to apartments unless gas heating discontinued, because installation of heating units violated restrictive regulations of Public Service Commission; that defendant obligated by franchise from city to furnish service; that plaintiff had no notice of proceeding involving use of gas for heating; Public Service Commission's motion for dismissal of complaint denied -- (2) question of law presented whether Legislature has power to deprive city and its citizens of benefits of franchise -- (3) Public Service Commission not clothed with sole jurisdiction as to use of gas -- (4) question of law presented as to whether notice to discontinue use of gas unreasonable and arbitrary -- (5) temporary injunction continued.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The complaint, in an action for an injunction, alleged that after plaintiff, which had constructed several apartments to be heated by gas, had installed gas heating&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  systems and had paid defendant, sole supplier in the city of Syracuse of gas for light, heat, and power, for furnishing pipe and labor in connection with the laying of pipes from gas mains in the streets, and after meters had been installed in many of the apartments, defendant notified plaintiff that it would discontinue gas service within ten days unless the gas heating units were discontinued, because defendant had been informed that the heating units had been installed in violation of restrictive regulations of the Public Service Commission. Plaintiff was never given an opportunity to be heard in opposition to the commission's determination.  It was further alleged that the city had granted a franchise to defendant's predecessor to lay pipes and mains in the streets, conditioned upon furnishing gas for cooking, hot water and space heating. A motion by the intervener, Public Service Commission, for a dismissal of the complaint on the ground that the court has no jurisdiction of the subject of the action is denied.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. A question of law is presented as to whether, assuming the Legislature delegated sole authority to the commission to act on the questions arising between these parties, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the Legislature has power to deprive the city and its citizens of the benefits of a contract and franchise by which defendant is permitted to use the streets for its pipe lines.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Claimant, the Guaranty Trust Company of New York, filed suit against defendant, the State of New York, to recover moneys illegally paid into the Unemployment Insurance Fund. The court granted the State's motion to dismiss for noncompliance with &sect; 10(4) of the N.Y. Court of Claims Act. The trust company appealed to the Appellate Division, Supreme Court, Third Department (New York), which reversed the order and remitted the matter to the court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal to the supreme court, the trust company had asserted a new theory and argued that its payments were enforced contributions, as distinguished from tax levies, that were used to augment the United States Government's Unemployment Trust Fund. It claimed further that a statutory trust resulted, that, when the express trust became invalid, the statutory trustee held the funds for the benefit of the settlor, that the statute of limitations did not run until after demand was made, and that its claim was, thus, timely filed. The State renewed its argument that the claim for the return of the illegal tax was not timely filed. The court regarded the law of the case as settled by the concluding sentence of the supreme court's opinion for reversal finding that there was a trust created by statute and that the public officials became trustees of the resultant trust when the enforced contributions involved were determined to be illegal. The court determined that the trust company was entitled to the claimed amount in addition to interest from the date that its application for a refund was finally denied when the appeal board affirmed the commissioner's ruling.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court awarded the trust company the amount claimed in addition to interest from the date its application for a refund of the amount was denied.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Unemployment insurance -- refund of contributions -- (1) reversal by Appellate Division made law of case that resultant trust created by enforced payment of sums into State Unemployment Insurance Fund, later held illegal, and that public officials were trustees thereof -- (2) interest of 4% on award granted from date of final denial of refund by appeal board, and not from date of payment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Claimant State bank paid sums into the State Unemployment Insurance Fund for a period of time which, for that period, were subsequently held to be unconstitutional exactions. Where said bank's claim for refund was dismissed by the Court of Claims for failure to comply with subdivision 4 of section 10 of the Court of Claims Act [filing claim or notice of intention within six months of accrual], but on appeal, the Appellate Division reversed, the law of the case is settled that here a trust was created by statute and that the public officials became trustees of the resultant trust when the enforced contributions were determined to be illegal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Claimant is entitled to interest on the award to be computed, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  not from the date of payment, but from the date that its application for a refund was finally denied by the appeal board's affirmance of the commissioner's ruling.  Moreover subdivision 6 of section 570 of the Labor Law provides that refunds shall be made without interest.  Hence, had the commissioner directed a refund, claimant would have received no interest.  Interest should be computed at the rate [4%] prescribed by section 16 of the State Finance Law.  </SPAN></P>

Some 16,000 residents and property owners in the area were eligible for membership in defendant's corporation. The People charged defendant with maintaining a bathing establishment in violation of &sect; 340 because the premises were not equipped with facilities and because the board of health issued no permit. Defendant filed a motion to dismiss, contending that the premises fell under an exception to &sect; 340 because only defendant's stockholders used the shorefront. The court denied defendant's motion to dismiss and found it guilty. Although defendant was principally composed of members who were also stockholders, such individuals were not owners within the meaning of the exemption under &sect; 340. Section 340 did not contemplate that 16,000 stockholders of a corporation owning a bathing establishment of small area were to be considered an exception to the general governing regulation.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employees formerly worked for the employer. Pursuant to a United States Supreme Court decision allowing compensation for walking and preparatory time, the employees brought an action for overtime compensation and penalties. The employer filed a motion to dismiss, and the court granted the motion because it no longer had jurisdiction over the action. The Portal-to-Portal Act of 1947 had been enacted and removed the court's jurisdiction under &sect; 2(d). That subdivision applied retrospectively to all cases then pending. The retrospective provisions of the Act had always been held constitutional when challenged.

[d]) as condition to court's jurisdiction, insufficient -- (2) Congress could withdraw rights created by Federal </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">legislation</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> -- (3) retroactive provisions in Portal-to-Portal Act constitutional.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The Federal Portal-to-Portal Act of 1947 (&sect; 2, subds. [a], [b], [d]), effective May 14, 1947, provides that no employer should be liable under the Federal Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 for any activity engaged in prior to the enactment of the act, in an action commenced before or after the enactment of the act, except in an activity which was compensable under an express provision of a contract in effect at the time of such activity, or compensable under a custom in the place of employment in effect at the time of such activity.  A complaint in an action commenced prior&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to May 14, 1947, seeking compensation, both straight time and overtime, for preliminary activities, such as walking, &quot;shaping up&quot;, securing tools, changing clothes, etc., which does not allege that such activities were performed pursuant to any contract provision or custom or practice, is insufficient since such activities are not compensable under section 2 of the Portal-to-Portal Act, and the Supreme Court has no jurisdiction to entertain the action.  The complaint is dismissed with leave to serve an amended complaint which will comply with such act.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. In view of the findings of Congress and the express policy of the Portal-to-Portal Act, it was within the power of Congress to withdraw rights which were created by Federal legislation and certainly Congress could withdraw from State courts the power to enforce rights under a Federal statute.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The retroactive provisions of such act are constitutional.  In the absence of any appellate court pronouncements to the contrary, and in view of the many precedents in other courts sustaining the constitutionality of the act, a court at nisi prius should not, unless the case is a clear one, declare an act of Congress unconstitutional.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At the instance of the state tax commission, the appraiser entered a pro forma taxing order for an estate. On appeal, the executors contended that the inclusion in the gross estate of all the property in the decedent's record of ownership at his death was erroneous because it was in fact owned one half by his widow and was subject to a life estate in the other half for the benefit of the widow. The court held that: (1) N.Y. Tax Law &sect; 249-r(5-a) stated that there was to be included in the gross estate property held as community property by a decedent and a surviving spouse under the law of any state, territory, or possession of the United States, or any foreign country; (2) the taxing statute in question was not unconstitutional as the executors contended; and (3) the meaning of the taxing statute was that a community property right created by private contract in a jurisdiction that permitted such creations of community interests was as much held &quot;under the law&quot; as it would be if the law itself created the right.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court entered an order confirming the tax imposed.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Taxation -- estate tax -- community property -- (1) full value of property held by decedent in community with now surviving spouse, under agreement made in Belgium and permitted by Belgian law,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> properly included in gross estate for tax purposes (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Tax Law, &sect; 249-r</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">, subd. 5-a) -- (2) statutory direction for inclusion in gross estate of community property rights held &quot;under the law&quot; of foreign country includes rights created by contract under permissive statute -- (3) since similar Federal </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">statute</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> held constitutional, New York </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">statute</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> also constitutional -- (4) property also taxable under subdivision 3 of section 249-r since community property represents transfers made by decedent with intention that possession or enjoyment take effect on death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Decedent and his widow, in 1895, prior to their marriage, entered into an agreement in Belgium providing that there should exist between them a &quot;community of their property both personal and real, present and future * * * in accordance with article 1526 of the Civil Code.&quot; After providing for special treatment of certain tangibles it provided that as to the remaining property the survivor should have one half in full ownership and the other half for life.  Subdivision 5-a of section 249-r of the Tax Law provides that there shall be included in the gross estate property &quot;held as community property by the decedent and surviving&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  spouse under the law of * * * any foreign country&quot;.  The full value of property held by deceased in community with his now surviving widow was properly included in the gross estate for tax purposes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Community property rights subject to tax comprise not only those which are themselves the creation of statute but those which are the creation of private agreement made under a permissive statute or case law. The meaning of subdivision 5-a of section 249-r is that a community property right created by private contract in a jurisdiction which permits such creations of community interests is as much held &quot;under the law&quot; as it would be if the law itself created the right.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The interpretation of our taxing statute will follow the interpretation given by the Supreme Court of the United States to like text in the Internal Revenue Code.  The constitutionality of the like text in the Internal Revenue Code (&sect; 811, subd. [e], par. [2]) has been upheld and it follows that the New York statute is constitutional.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The effect of the agreement was that all property rights existent at the date of death in favor of the surviving spouse were transfers made with the intention of their taking&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  effect in possession or enjoyment after death of the spouse first to die.  In that concept the property is taxable under subdivision 3 of section 249-r of the Tax Law.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant comptroller, the city, and others, sought dismissal of plaintiff taxpayer's action seeking a declaratory judgment that a utility tax did not apply to the taxpayer, and to recover sums paid under protest.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer owned and operated a security business that included the use of electrical alarms. A utility tax was assessed by the city. Defendants contended that the taxpayer's action for declaratory relief should be dismissed because the taxpayer's exclusive remedy was administrative per New York City, N.Y., Admin. Code &sect;&sect; Q41-6.0, Q41-7.0, and Q41-9.0. The court did not rule on the merits of the taxpayer's claims that the tax either did not apply or was unconstitutional. However, the court denied the motion to dismiss because the taxpayer's complaint contained allegations sufficient to present a genuine question which required a declaration of the rights of the parties with respect to applicability or unconstitutionality of the tax.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Taxation -- municipal utility taxes -- (1) complaint alleges plaintiff is engaged in protecting customers' premises against burglary and that comptroller of city of New York had served notice of deficiency under utility tax laws based on receipts from customers; complaint states cause of action for declaratory judgment where it alleges plaintiff is not furnishing telegraphic service and seeks refund of taxes paid under protest -- (2) &quot;exclusive remedies&quot; provision in utility tax laws no bar to plaintiff's action which states inapplicability of laws to it -- (3) determination whether plaintiff's assertion of inapplicability is correct not necessary on defendant's motion to dismiss complaint.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Plaintiff, a company engaged in the business of protecting the premises of its customers against burglary and unauthorized entry, states a cause of action for a declaratory judgment in its complaint where it alleges that the comptroller of the city of New York had served on plaintiff a notice of deficiency under the utility tax laws of said city for the period from May 1, 1942, to December 31, 1943, based on plaintiff's receipts from its customers; &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  that the assessment was made against plaintiff as a &quot;utility&quot; or &quot;vendor of utility services&quot; and as a person selling telegraphy or furnishing telegraph services; that the assessment was made pursuant to Local Laws of the City of New York, No. 49 of 1941, No. 29 of 1942, and No. 22 of 1943; that plaintiff was not engaged in the business of selling or furnishing telegraphic service and accordingly the utility tax is not applicable to plaintiff; that plaintiff had paid, under protest, additional utility taxes for the period from July, 1938, to April, 1942, and plaintiff seeks recovery of the amount of such payment after defendant's refusal to refund.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The &quot;exclusive remedies&quot; provisions in the city's utility tax laws which defendant claims accords the comptroller, in the first instance, jurisdiction to decide the issues presented in the complaint are not a bar to plaintiff's action.  Declaratory judgment actions and other available remedies are permitted where the tax laws are inapplicable to a taxpayer or where they are unconstitutional in their application.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. On this motion to dismiss the complaint on the ground that the court does not have jurisdiction of the subject of the action, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the court does not have to determine whether plaintiff's assertions of inapplicability or unconstitutionality are correct.  It is sufficient upon this motion that there be a showing that a genuine question is presented which requires a declaration of the rights of the parties with respect to applicability or unconstitutionality. Whether the amendments to the utility tax laws, made after plaintiff was successful in sustaining its claims to inapplicability (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Matter of Holmes Elec. Protective Co. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">v.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11"> McGoldrick,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 262 App. Div. 514, 30 N.Y.S.2d 589, affd. 288 N.
