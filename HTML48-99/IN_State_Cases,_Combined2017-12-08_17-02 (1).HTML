<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, a minor child and her legal custodians, sought review of the denial by defendant State of Indiana, through the Full Industrial Board, of an application for financial assistance under the Indiana Compensation for Victims of Violent Crimes Act (Violent Crimes Compensation Act), Ind. Code &sect; 16-7-3.6-1 et seq.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The minor's mother was strangled and stabbed to death by her estranged husband when their divorce was pending. The minor, who was a little over two years old at the time, was present at the scene of the murder but was not physically harmed. She claimed she was entitled to compensation. The trial court denied compensation to the minor on the basis that the Violent Crimes Compensation Act did not apply to family members. The minor claimed that Ind. Code &sect; 16-7-3.6-5(b) violated her right to equal protection under U.S. Const. amend. XIV. On review, the court disagreed. The court concluded that the minor was not entitled to compensation under Ind. Code &sect; 16-7-3.6-1(e), which defined a &quot;victim&quot; as an individual who suffered bodily injury or death as a result of a violent crime. The child could not recover for direct harm, nor under a derivative claim based on harm to her mother, because of the statutory exclusion of family members. Thus, the trial court correctly interpreted Ind. Code &sect; 16-7-3.6-5(b) as disallowing assistance based on a familial relationship with the offender.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the Industrial Board.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The child was removed from the mother's care based on an allegation of physical abuse. Subsequently, the mother admitted to the abuse. When the child was placed in the care of the welfare department, his inappropriate behavior improved. The child was placed back in the mother's home, but he was again removed when it was determined that the mother was not progressing and was unable to provide proper care for the child. The mother then underwent extensive counseling, but the return of the child was not recommended. The welfare department sought to terminate the mother and father's parental rights so that the child could be placed for adoption. The court held that, based on the extensive but unsuccessful efforts to remedy the mother's inability to parent the child, the recommendations that the child not be returned to the mother provided sufficient evidence to justify termination of parental rights. The court found that the welfare department's observations were sufficient to prove that the termination was in the best interests of the child. The court also determined that Ind. Code &sect; 31-6-5-4 was not vague as to the grounds for terminating parental rights and was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant acting as a corporate officer endorsed a check that was dishonored. Defendant was arrested September 14, 1981 for check deception, but was not brought to trial until one year and five months later. One hundred forty-seven days of the delay was due to the state's motion for continuance. Defendant appealed his conviction for check deception and argued that he had been denied a speedy trial in violation of Ind. R. Crim. P 4(C). The court affirmed defendant's conviction but remanded with instructions to fix the amount of restitution in an amount not exceeding what defendant could or would be able to pay. The court determined that defendant was not denied a speedy trial because the period for the state to commence the trial was extended to 167 days. The court rejected defendant's argument that he was not guilty of violating Ind. Code &sect; 35-43-5-5 because he endorsed the check as a corporate officer. The court determined that the trial court had erred when it failed to set the amount of restitution to be paid by defendant. The court found that the conditions of probation established by the trial court were authorized by Ind. Code &sect; 35-38-2-2.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowner owned property in an area zoned as a Student Social Service Zoning District (SSS), which permitted fraternities and sororities. The landowner filed an application for a permit to remodel his residence as a fraternity house.

The board affirmed the officer's decision. The trial court affirmed the decision of the board. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's judgment. The court determined that the trial court correctly found that the land did not comply with the performance standards. The court held that the performance standards were not unconstitutional because: (1) fraternity houses caused special problems to the public health, safety, morals, and general welfare that legitimized the exercise of the police power; (2) the performance standards were rationally related to the elimination or amelioration of the special problems; and (3) the performance standards were reasonable.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Hendricks Circuit Court (Indiana) that convicted him of, and sentenced him for the Class A misdemeanor of official misconduct, Ind. Code &sect; 35-44-1-2(1). The action concerned defendant's battery of a prisoner in his custody while defendant was the county sheriff. Defendant contended that he was denied due process because the prosecutor had a conflict of interest.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant showed that a deputy prosecutor discussed matters with him that later resulted in the conviction. The court affirmed the judgment in part and reversed in part. It was not shown that the prosecutor received any confidential information from the deputy prosecutor, that any such information assisted the prosecution, or that the prosecutor's failure to recuse himself resulted in a denial of due process. Denial of the motion for change of judge was proper when there was no indication that defendant received an unfair trial. Although the jury commissioners took their oaths after the deadline in Ind. Code &sect; 33-4-5-2, the defect was technical and not substantive and no prejudice was shown. It was not error to deny defendant's motion to dismiss because it was not based on the grounds listed in Ind. Code &sect; 35-34-1-4, Ind. Code &sect; 35-34-1-8(e) authorized dismissal for this lack of basis, and it was not timely filed under Ind. Code &sect; 35-34-1-4(b)(1). It was not an abuse of discretion to admit evidence of defendant's batteries against other inmates when interwoven with the charged offense. The trial court did not have the authority to order the sentence served in the county jail.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The board's findings of fact and conclusions of law stated, inter alia, that the noise from the grain dryer would have caused no disturbance to the property owners, the company would not have contaminated the water supply, there was a likelihood that the property values in the area would have been enhanced, and the construction of the facility promoted the general welfare of the village. On appeal, the property owners argued that (1) the findings and conclusions were not supported by sufficient evidence, were contrary to law, and constituted an abuse of discretion; (2) the county zoning ordinances were unconstitutionally vague; and (3) the board's composition was unlawfully constituted, such that its action was void.Upon review, the court found that the property owners' arguments were without merit. The property owners, in order to succeed on appeal, had to establish that the quantum of evidence was proportionately meager such that it led to the conclusion that the findings and determinations of the board did not rest on a rational basis.

The court reversed. The court held that the public indecency statute had to be narrowly construed and did not apply to theatrical expressions. The court held that the non-obscene nude dancing performed in the enclosed theater was presumptively protected expression under U.S. Const. amend. I. The court held that in following state precedent, the nudity could be tolerated when there was a communication of ideas involved and there was an absence of obscenity.

He was to pay the sum in monthly installments. When the father failed to make his payments, the State successfully brought contempt proceedings. On appeal, the court affirmed the decision. The court stated that the analogy between an action for child support and an action for paternity was sufficient to warrant use of the trial court's contempt power to coerce payment of the blood test costs in the paternity action. The court held that although the paternity action was a civil proceeding, the money judgment rendered against the father was not considered a debt within the meaning of Ind. Const. art. I &sect; 22.

The circuit court ordered that the police officer be reinstated.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed and held that the circuit court was acting outside its jurisdiction and that the judgments entered were void.

It was then for the board to determine which action to take consistent with the circuit's court's conclusions. The circuit court erred by ordering the board to reinstate the police officer and by conducting damage hearings on evidence not even considered by the board. The error was not merely a technical one, but a constitutional one, which required the circuit court, after reviewing the board's determination, to remand for the board to make the initial attempt to correct its own proceedings.</SPAN></P>

Defendants alleged that the nude dancing did not take place in a public place within the meaning of &sect; 35-45-4-1. The court held that the bookstore constituted a public place.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The commission brought an action against the company pursuant to Ind. Code &sect; 36-7-4-1015 (1982). The action sought to enjoin the company from using its property in violation of the Marion County Dwelling District Zoning Ordinance. The lower court found the ordinance unconstitutional and entered judgment in favor of the company. Upon appeal, the court reversed and remanded for further proceedings. The court held that the company failed to exhaust its administrative remedies by seeking a variance for the property use. Therefore, there was no showing that the ordinance permanently precluded the use for any purpose to which it was reasonably adapted and was thereby unconstitutional as a confiscation of property. Because the Indiana Board of Zoning Appeals had the power to rule on a claim that the zoning ordinance was unconstitutional, it would have been proper for the company to proceed with its administrative remedies. The company's contention that the zoning ordinance was unconstitutionally restrictive called for a factual determination of hardship that was clearly within the Board of Zoning Appeals' area of expertise.</SPAN></P>

After the husband asked the wife to leave, the wife filed an action to set aside the property settlement agreement on the basis of fraud. The trial court dismissed the action as untimely. The court affirmed. The husband was not equitably estopped from relying on the statute of limitations. This was true even though he allegedly told the wife that filing for a divorce was really a means of reconciliation as living apart might make them appreciate each other more, and that if the marriage ultimately failed he would return to her one-half of the home. To sustain a claim of equitable estoppel, a party had to show that the fact of reliance and the right of reliance.

The court also determined that the trial court properly instructed the jury. According to the court, the essential elements of burglary and theft were conveyed to the jury. The court also found that the requisite affidavit was not present to warrant a new trial based on alleged newly discovered evidence. The court held that the trial court did not err in denying defendant's request to conduct an omnibus hearing prior to trial.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A widowed truck driver was determined to be the father of a baby boy as the result of a proceeding initiated by the mother on behalf of their child. Her petition for a declaration of paternity was initially denied but it was subsequently revised, resubmitted, and approved. In the time period between the denial of the first petition and the approval of the second petition, the father died. The mother successfully then requested a family allowance award for her son. On appeal, the executors argued that the trial court committed error by a &sect; 29-1-4-1 allowance to the child because there was no judicial declaration of paternity during the father's lifetime as required by Ind. Code &sect; 29-1-2-7(b). In affirming the judgment, the court concluded that the provisions of &sect; 29-1-2-7(b) were sufficiently complied with because a formal proceeding was initiated during the father's lifetime and the father executed a written agreement acknowledging that he was the child's father. The court observed that the requirement of a paternity determination during a father's lifetime was intended to promote fairness by insuring claim presentation in an adversarial context.</SPAN></P>

On review, the court affirmed the contention, finding that the acts performed clearly constituted the practice of medicine.

One defendant, the decedent's wife, was found guilty of the nonsupport of a spouse, Ind. Code &sect; 35-46-1-6. The other, the decedent's son, was convicted of the neglect of a dependent, Ind. Code &sect; 35-46-1-4(A). The decedent was 80 when he died, and defendants admittedly confined him to a room with no heat for eight years.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The temperature in the decedent's room was well below freezing for several days before his death, he had received no medical attention for a year, and it was admitted that the son forcibly restrained him when he tried to escape. An autopsy showed several fractured ribs, contusions to the head, and a rupture of the thoracic aorta that caused death. Malnutrition and physical neglect were contributing factors. Defendants insisted that they locked the decedent in because he was crazy, and the trial court directed a verdict for them on additional charges of criminal confinement. Photos showed the decedent's fractured ribs and showed that rodents devoured parts of his face. The court rejected arguments that joinder of the confinement and neglect charges was logically inconsistent because dependency was a defense to confinement and an element of neglect, holding that defendants waived the right to severance by failing to make a timely motion. Though the challenged photos were obviously gruesome, the court held that they were relevant to establish that rodents and unsanitary conditions existed in the confinement room, to identify the decedent, and to show a lack of medical attention.</SPAN></P>

In addition, defendant alleged that he was denied due process when the lower court refused his request for an evidentiary hearing concerning his ability to spend two years in the correctional center and that his sentence was grossly disproportionate to the acts which formed the basis of the charges. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded the sentence imposed. The court held that defendant had established at the sentencing hearing his apparent need for extraordinary medical care and the life-threatening consequences of its denial or delay. The court held that the lower court erred when it allowed the employees at the correctional facility to determine whether they could properly care for defendant and in finding that defendant could otherwise be placed on formal probation if his medical needs could not be provided at that facility.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's conviction stemmed from a fracas at his girlfriend's apartment complex, as a result of which defendant was shot twice by a policeman. The amended information stated that defendant engaged in tumultuous conduct on a particular date. On appeal, the court concluded that the information was inadequate and that the trial court erred in denying defendant's motion to dismiss the disorderly conduct count. When the statute defined the crime in general terms, an information was required to specify the facts and circumstances which informed the accused of the particular offense coming under the general description with which he was charged. &quot;Tumultuous conduct&quot; was precisely the type of generic charge that required additional facts and circumstances in order to fully apprise defendant of the nature of the offense with which he was charged.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with unlawful possession of a portable police radio, a class B misdemeanor, and carrying a handgun without a license, a class D felony. He was later charged with a habitual offender information. After a mistrial, a second trial resulted in convictions on the criminal charges but the jury determined that defendant was not a habitual offender under Ind. Code &sect; 35-50-2-8. Defendant filed a belated motion to correct errors, and his convictions were set aside. The State filed another habitual criminal charge, and defendant filed a motion to dismiss the information, which the trial court granted. The State then filed a motion to correct errors, which the trial court granted, thereby reinstating the habitual offender charge. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's judgment, reasoning that the double jeopardy provisions did not apply to the habitual criminal statute and the filing of the new habitual criminal charge did not constitute prosecutorial vindictiveness. The State could reuse prior felony convictions in support of a habitual criminal charge even though the prior habitual offender proceeding based upon the same prior felonies resulted in an acquittal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The labor organizations represented construction contractors who desired to be awarded contracts by the board for public demolition projects.

The labor organizations filed an action against the board, and the board filed a counterclaim. The trial court entered judgment for the labor organizations and ordered injunctive relief. The board appealed, and the court affirmed. The court held that the board did not demonstrate that &sect; 5-16-7-1 violated the Indiana Constitution.

The committee did not act arbitrarily in setting the prevailing wage scale for the demolition projects. The committee investigated the pertinent facts before arriving at its decision.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant entered into a plea agreement under which he would plead guilty to forgery, and the State would dismiss a theft count and recommend suspending all but 30 days of the sentence on the forgery count. The plea was accepted, but the State filed a motion to correct errors, asserting fraud by defendant in that he had failed to tell the probation officer that he had no prior felony convictions. The court held that the suspended sentence was prohibited and thus illegal under Ind. Code &sect; 35-52-2, so that the trial court had the power to vacate the sentence. However, the trial court's sua sponte action in reinstating the dismissed theft count was erroneous, because criminal actions could only be instituted by action of the prosecutor in filing an indictment or information. The court held that the State's use of the motion to correct errors, while perhaps improper, did not invalidate the trial court's action in vacating the illegal sentence.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that the trial court erred in permitting the State to use excerpts of his previously suppressed statement for impeachment purposes. The post-arrest statement was made to police when defendant was without counsel and was determined to be a Miranda violation. The court affirmed and held that statements inadmissible under Miranda in the State's case in chief could be used for the purpose of impeaching defendant's trial testimony to prevent perjury by way of defense, free from the risk of confrontation with prior inconsistent utterances. The trial court was required to determine the voluntariness of the proffered impeaching statement, because any criminal trial use against a defendant of his involuntary statements was a denial of due process of law. Statements obtained under coercion or duress were inadmissible for all purposes. The burden rested with the State to prove defendant's statement was freely and voluntarily made and required evaluation of all the circumstances surrounding the giving of the statement to determine that it was the product of the defendant's free and rational choice.</SPAN></P>

The court disagreed. The court held that under Ind. Admin. Code tit. 640, r. 1-11-1, the employer had a right to appeal because it qualified as an &quot;interested party&quot; under either definition of r. 1-11- 1(b) or (e). The employee argued that Ind. Code Ann. &sect; 22-4-15-6, which required that benefits be held in abeyance pending the result of a criminal proceeding, rendered the deputy's decision final and made the board lose its jurisdiction to hear appeals. The court stated that unless the right to appeal was terminated by a deputy award pursuant to &sect; 22-4-15-6, the referee and the board had jurisdiction to review the merits of the employee's claim for unemployment benefits. The court found that the section merely required the deputy to postpone his denial or award of benefits until the trial court rendered a judgment on the claimant's criminal prosecution.

The board brought an action for injunctive relief to prevent the deductions. The trial court found for the county auditor and held that the modification was not effective for six years. The board filed a subsequent action against the PERF board seeking a declaratory judgment that the modification was effective. The trial court found for the board. The employees then intervened in the first action and obtained a declaratory judgment that the second judgment was invalid. On appeal, the court reversed. The employees could not collaterally attack the second judgment because it was not void. Res judicata applied to the second action despite the lack of identity of parties in the two suits.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The corporation operated the only sanitary landfill in the county and contracted with the board to accept all refuse delivered to the landfill by refuse haulers in the county, the maximum rate for which service could be increased periodically. After the contract expired, the board enacted an ordinance which established the maximum rate for landfill operators and the corporation increased its rates beyond that of the maximum. A local hauling company brought an action for injunctive relief against the corporation and the corporation filed a third-party complaint against the board. The superior court granted the board's motion for summary judgment and the corporation appealed. The court affirmed in part and reversed in part, holding that Tippecanoe County, Ind., Ordinance 81-10 (1981) was valid as it tended to promote the general welfare of the county's residents. The court found that the board's police power to regulate the corporation included the authority to establish rates, but that the reasonableness of the standards by which the rates were established was a question of fact, and thus summary judgment on that issue was improper and required a new trial for its determination.</SPAN></P>

Defendant's speech consisted of telling the officer he had a grudge and no right arresting her brother, calling the officer an &quot;asshole,&quot; and continuing to debate the arrest of her brother after she was told to have been quiet.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the evidence was insufficient to support her conviction because her words fell outside the statutory prohibition of &quot;unreasonable noise.&quot; The state argued that defendant's speech consisted of fighting words. The court reversed the judgment with instructions to enter a judgment of acquittal. The court determined that pursuant to &sect; 35-45-1-3(2) a person committed disorderly conduct when he recklessly, knowingly, or intentionally made unreasonable noise and continued to have done so after being asked to stop. The court found that there was insufficient evidence to find that defendant's speech fell within the definition of &quot;unreasonable noise&quot; reasoning that loudness, by itself, did not constitute evidence of unreasonable noise. The court concluded that defendant's words were not fighting words explaining that fighting words were words that by their very utterance inflicted injury or tended to incite an immediate breach of the peace. The court opined that, as a matter of law the epithet &quot;asshole&quot; was not so inherently inflammatory that, when addressed to an ordinary citizen, was inherently likely to provoke violent action.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The infant began her action through her mother as next friend and was nearly six years old. The father filed a motion to dismiss on the basis of the two-year statute of limitations formerly contained in Ind. Code Ann. &sect; 31-4-1-26. The trial court set aside the prior judgment of dismissal and reinstated the cause. The father asserted that (1) the original two-year statute of limitations applied; and (2) because the paternity law was amended after the two-year statute of limitations had already expired, the cause of action against him could not be revived. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that the paternity law neither created new rights nor took away existing rights, but merely provided a new remedy for the enforcement of an existing right. It was remedial in nature and could therefore be applied retroactively. The fact that the new law allowed a child to maintain a cause of action on his own behalf was nothing more than a modification of procedure, however. The fact that the child, in addition to the mother, could invoke the aid of the courts to obtain parental support did not change the father's obligation, but merely influences its enforcement.</SPAN></P>

The landowners were the owners of the real estate which encompassed the leasehold. The drillers filed an application for a permit to drill a second oil well, on the tract, thus creating two 10 acre units. The landowners filed a petition for judicial review. They sought review of the questions of whether a cause of action arising out of an order by an administrative agency, based on a denial of due process, could be pursued in equity, or at common law, without regard to the requirements of the American Arbitration Association (AAA) pertaining to judicial review. They argued that the denial of due process, the Agency's lack of statutory authority to act, and the drillers' lack of standing to request the administrative action complained of, presented a cause of action which could be determined without regard to the AAA. The court disagreed and held that the landowner could pursue any administrative remedies available through judicial review under Ind.

The paternal grandmother contended that Ind.

The court held that the classification was reasonable for the purposes of legitimately governing the state's adoption procedures. The court reasoned that the public policy embodied in the statute was to guarantee harmony on the part of the adoptive parents and to assure a welcome and affectionate reception of the child into its adoptive home.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The police officer's pension benefits were discontinued after he was convicted of second degree murder in Arizona, pursuant to Ind.

The Board voted unanimously not to reinstate the pension, which was upheld by the trial court. The court found that the Arizona court, in restoring the police officer's civil rights and setting aside the conviction, did not find his underlying felony conviction infirm in any way. The court found that there were no documents or testimony in the record to suggest that the police officer's conviction was not correct. The court held that the trial court was not bound to apply Arizona law in the manner suggested by the police officer, since to do so would have violated the public policy of the State of Indiana.

The clinic then sought the modification based on a change in law. The trial court granted the modification. The hospital appealed and the court affirmed. The court held that it was proper to file the second 60(B) motion without having appealed the first one because they alleged distinct bases for relief. Further, the repetitive 60(B) motions were allowed because the case upon which the second motion was based had not been decided at the time of the first motion.

The court found that the evidence produced at trial was sufficient to support defendants' convictions. The evidence showed that the automobile was reported stolen by its owner and that two days later defendants were observed removing tires from the car and placing the tires in their truck. The owner identified the car with the missing tires as the one stolen from him. It was proper to prove the owner of stolen property by circumstantial evidence. Further, proof of license number or registration was not essential in establishing the identity of a stolen automobile. The court further found that it was not unconstitutional to try defendants before a six-person jury, rather than a 12, because the constitutional right to a jury trial did not include the right to be tried by a jury of 12 persons.

Based on the results of that test and the odor, the officer asked defendant to accompany him for a breath analysis test. Defendant consented.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant debtors, an Indiana individual and an Indiana partnership, sought review of a decision of the Marion Circuit Court(Indiana), which granted summary judgment in favor of appellee creditors, a Florida individual and a Florida company, upon a suit on a foreign judgment. The issue presented on appeal was whether the Florida court had personal jurisdiction over the Indiana debtors.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Indiana debtors entered into a construction contract with the Florida company to perform roofing, painting, and parking lot repair on a shopping center located in Indianapolis, Indiana. The contract failed to designate a place for payment. The debtors also executed a promissory note in Indianapolis, in which the debtors promised to pay the Florida individual $ 2,000 in Florida. Services and materials were not paid for as agreed in the contract, and the promissory note was not paid. As a result, the creditors brought an action against the debtors in Florida. The debtors were properly served notice but neither appeared or defended. Default judgment was entered in favor of the creditors, and suit on the judgment was filed in Indianapolis, Indiana. The trial court granted summary judgment to the creditors. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded. The court held that Florida's long-arm statute,&nbsp;Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 48.193(1)(g) (1969), authorized the exercise of jurisdiction over the debtors, but the single contact of having payment due on a contract in Florida was not sufficient to satisfy minimum due process.</SPAN></P>

The trial court specifically found that three of the six findings of fact made by the Commission to support the penalty were illegally considered. The City argued that the trial court was without power to modify the Commission's penalty. The Court agreed that modification of the Commission's decision was unwarranted by law, holding that to the extent that Ind. Code Ann. &sect; 18-1-11-3(d) (Michie 1980) or Ind. Code Ann. &sect; 36-8-3-4(i) (Michie 1980) granted that power to the courts, they were invalid. The court, however, ordered that because three of the six &quot;findings of fact&quot; made by the Commission were illegally considered, the trial court should remand the case for proper consideration of the three legally sufficient findings of fact.</SPAN></P>

The board revoked the license due to the chiropractor's alleged sexually-oriented misconduct in violation of Ind. Code &sect; 25-22.5-6-2(6) (1980).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The board appealed from the superior court's reversal of a chiropractor's license revocation. The proceeding arose from several allegations that the chiropractor touched patients in an improper, sexually-oriented fashion. The court held that the superior court erred when it required medical expert testimony in support of the ultimate findings of willful or wanton misconduct, set forth in Ind. Code &sect; 25-22.5-6-2(6). It was the board's function to make the determination regarding the chiropractor's behavior when that decision was based on substantial evidence, particularly in view of the fact that the several medical practitioners served on the board, and that the chiropractor's acts resembled criminal battery. The court also found that the board provided sufficient, though defective, notice of the revocation decision to the chiropractor. Further, the court held that the phrase &quot;willful or wanton misconduct&quot; was not void for vagueness, but rather was sufficiently descriptive of unacceptable behavior in the practice of medicine to give the chiropractor warning that he ran the risk of discipline for his actions. The court reversed the judgment and reinstated the board's decision.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, an African-American special deputy, became involved in a confrontation with two white men in the parking lot of a restaurant. When another African-American became involved, the altercation moved into the restaurant. Defendant fired two shots, one of which hit a restaurant employee. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that &sect; 35-42-2-2 and Ind. Code &sect; 35-41-2-2(c) (Repl. 1979) were not unconstitutionally vague on their faces or as applied because the state supreme court had determined that the term &quot;reckless&quot; was sufficiently definite and a person who fired a pistol twice in a fast food restaurant should have known that such behavior was reckless. Because defendant presented evidence on his own behalf after his motion for directed verdict, the court determined that he had waived any error in the denial of the motion. The court found sufficient evidence to support defendant's conviction because the State did not have to prove that defendant acted intentionally, only that he acted recklessly. The court held that evidence of a bullet wound was sufficient to support a finding of great bodily harm.</SPAN></P>

The property owner argued that the trial court abused its discretion in refusing to admit the board's findings and in formulating its own findings on the board's record.

The employee was caught smoking marijuana while at work and was terminated.

The Review Board refused to allow the employer to introduce additional evidence. On appeal, the court reversed the decision and remanded the action for an evidentiary hearing. The court held that the Board abused its discretion in refusing to hear the additional evidence. While the Review Board was commended for its attempt to expedite the hearing process, the court was constrained to find an abuse of discretion in not granting a full hearing where facts such as those of the instant case were demonstrated to the Review Board. In such a situation, a short delay did not impair the praiseworthy objective of declaring unemployment benefits, where warranted, under an accelerated system of review.

Upon review, the court found defendant's arguments without merit. Defendant did not contest the validity of his arrest, but implied that as the arrest was foreseeable, so was the search incident to it, and the police should have obtained a search warrant. There was no precedent supporting that argument, nor any logical reasons which compelled such an imposition when the arrest was valid. Despite the lack of expert testimony, it was reasonable to infer defendant's intent to deliver by considering the circumstantial evidence as a whole.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The claimant alleged that he was exposed to carcinogenic agents while employed by the employer, and that the exposure resulted in his contraction of acute myelocytic leukemia. In affirming the dismissal of the claim, the board found that the claimant's application was untimely because it was not filed within two years of the last date of exposure, as required by &sect; 22-3-9(f). The court affirmed the board's order affirming the dismissal. In so ruling, the court rejected the claimant's argument that &sect; 22-3-9(f) was unconstitutional. The court noted that its prior decision holding that &sect; 22-3-9(f) was unconstitutional had been reversed by the Indiana Supreme Court, upon its determination that the clear legislative intent of &sect; 22-3-9(f) was to provide a definitive time period in which claims could be filed. Consequently, the court concluded that the claimant was not entitled to benefits because he filed his claim more than two years after the last date of the alleged exposure. Additionally, the court observed that the claimant failed to offer any evidence that he suffered an occupational disease.</SPAN></P>

The first involvement was due to the family's dirty, cluttered, inadequate living conditions and the parents' medical neglect of the children. At that time, the husband presented his naked wife to the caseworker to view. The children were present throughout the salacious display. The children were removed, and the Department formulated a plan to reunite the family. The parents began living in a camper over a truck. The parents did not have any plans to change their housing arrangements. The court held that the parent-child relationships were properly terminated. The court held that Ind. Code &sect; 31-6-5-4 was constitutional and was constitutionally applied by the trial court. The parents did not realize that there was anything wrong with their lifestyle. The Department proved by clear and convincing evidence that it offered reasonable services to assist them in fulfilling their parental obligations.

However, the individual permitted persons in travel trailers, who were vendors or customers, to park the travel trailers on the premises and occupy them. A zoning ordinance provided that the area was zoned &quot;General Business,&quot; and a special exception was required to operate a travel trailer park, which the individual did not have. The court reasoned that the ordinance directly prohibited a travel trailer park use under the schedules in an area zoned General Business without the acquisition of a special exception. The court further held that the accessory use definition clearly meant any permissible accessory use, and by the definition stated in the ordinance it specifically excluded as a permissible accessory use, uses which involved human occupancy. The court affirmed the judgment, holding that a travel trailer park was prohibited in an area zoned General Business without the issuance of a special exception regardless of whether it was a primary or accessory use.</SPAN></P>

Ann. &sect; 35-43-2-1 (Repl. 1979) following an incident in which he shattered a locked store door with a rock at dusk, crawled into the store, and was found by police minutes later in the pharmacy area. On appeal, defendant alleged that there was insufficient evidence to prove the element of intent to commit a felony, and that there was error in refusing his tendered instructions on the presumption of innocence and voluntary intoxication. The court affirmed, holding that there was sufficient evidence to permit the jury to reasonably have inferred that defendant broke and entered the store with the intent to commit a burglary because such intent could have been inferred from the time, force, and manner of entry. The court further concluded that the presumption of innocence was sufficiently covered in the superior court's instructions, and that defendant was not denied a fair trial. The court also stated that there was no error in the voluntary intoxication instruction, and that it was not fatally incomplete because separate instructions adequately informed the jury of the State's burden of proof.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with providing transportation and storing stolen merchandise by the use of her car. The superior court found a search of her car was unconstitutional and accordingly suppressed all evidence obtained during that search. Defendant claimed that the State could not appeal as Ind. Code &sect; 35-1-47-2 (1982) was a limitation on the types of cases in which rules could be adopted authorizing appeals by the State. She thus contended that the appeal was unauthorized as there was no specific enabling rule. She also asserted that the suppression order was not an order precluding further prosecution under &sect; 35-1-47-2(5). She claimed that the State did not comply with Ind. R. Trial P. 59(G), by including in its motion to correct errors a statement of the grounds on which the errors were based. The court denied the motions. The suppression order was tantamount to dismissal and therefore appealable as it effectively prevented the State from proving its allegations. The State's motion incorporated by reference two separate memoranda that clearly set forth the facts and grounds of the claimed error. The State's brief was timely filed.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court held that defendant waived the issue by his failure to make a motion of his own for mistrial or for a comprehension hearing. Moreover, the court held that defendant could not take advantage of the State's motion as a ground for reversal. The court also noted that although defendant's answers were somewhat rambling and verbose, they were responsive. Thus, there was no fundamental error. Defendant also argued that the trial court violated his Fifth Amendment right against compulsory self-incrimination by ordering defendant to be examined by two medical witnesses employed by the State after he pleaded insanity. The court held that because defendant voluntarily filed his insanity defense, his right against self-incrimination was not violated by the appointment of experts under Ind. Code &sect; 35-5-2-2. The Fifth Amendment protection only extended to compelled self-incrimination.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the patient was diagnosed with bladder cancer, he was sent to a university hospital to be treated by a radiotherapist. Subsequent to completion of radiation therapy, the patient began to have complications.

The patient was not given any expert medical opinion that he was the victim of medical malpractice until April 18, 1979, when a urologist told the patient that his problems resulted from malpractice in the radiation treatment. The patient and his wife commenced a medical malpractice action on March 5, 1981, to recover damages for personal injuries and loss of consortium. The trial court granted summary judgment to the doctor, the hospital, and the university on the grounds that the two-year statute of limitations had run. On appeal, the court affirmed and held that since the patient had last been treated by the doctor in January 1977, and the malpractice claim did not qualify for a recognized exception to the statute of limitations, such as fraudulent concealment or equitable estoppel, it was barred.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The police bought the claimant's stolen vehicle as part of an on-going investigation of car thefts. To avoid disclosing the undercover operation, the claimant's vehicle was retained for five months. Meanwhile, the claimant was not notified that his car was recovered. The claimant filed an inverse condemnation action, seeking the rental value of his car, depreciation, and other consequential damages. The lower court granted the State's motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim on which relief could be granted. On appeal, the court affirmed the lower court's judgment, concluding that no unconstitutional taking of the claimant's property occurred. Rather, the State obtained the vehicle from a third party through a lawful investigation and temporarily retained it. The officers were not acting pursuant to the State's police power because no law or emergency justified their actions. Rather, the officers had the authority to seize the stolen vehicle when they discovered that it was not in the hands of its true owner. Although they were required to notify the claimant within 72 hours, their failure to do so was not actionable because no tort claim was raised below.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, the Dekalb County Welfare Board challenged a decision from the Dekalb Circuit Court (Indiana), which reversed the Welfare Board's decision to deny hospitalization benefits to appellee, an indigent. The Welfare Board had found that the applicant's failure to apply for assistance before his hospitalization was a bar to his receipt of benefits pursuant to Ind. Code &sect; 12-5-1-1 et seq.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The indigent was hospitalized for tests. Although his social worker later reported his hospitalization to the county's department of public welfare, the indigent did not apply for pre-treatment benefits. Not until he received a hospital bill did the indigent seek benefits from the Welfare Board. On appeal, the Welfare Board argued that the circuit court erred in reversing its decision to deny benefits. The court explained that the plain meaning of Ind. Code &sect; 12-5-1-1 required a recipient of a county's hospitalization benefits to apply for them before his treatment. The statutory scheme, which set forth how a county's welfare board was to investigate an indigent's financial resources and communicate its decision to the treating hospital, made no sense absent such a reading. An exception occurred only when an indigent was admitted for an emergency. That other statutes, including an amendment to &sect; 12-5-1-1, did not require pre-treatment applications was irrelevant. The statute did not violate due process. The Welfare Board was not estopped from denying benefits when it had made no affirmative representation to the indigent that a pre-treatment application was required.</SPAN></P>

The trial court found that plaintiff administratrix could bring a wrongful death action under Ind. Code &sect; 34-1-1-2 on behalf of her decedent's illegitimate child. Plaintiff's decedent and defendant's decedent were killed in a car accident. The court accepted jurisdiction of the appeal under Ind. R. App. P. 4(B)(6).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The evidence showed that plaintiff's decedent acknowledged the child as his own in writing and provided for the child's support. However, no action was ever filed to establish the child's paternity. The court affirmed the trial court's order denying defendant's motion for summary judgment. It noted that it had previously held that the term &quot;dependent children&quot; as used in the wrongful death act, Ind. Code &sect; 34-1-1-2, included any illegitimate child who had the right to maintain a claim for inheritance against his father's estate under the laws of intestate succession or to enforce parental obligations under the paternity statute. Here, it was undisputed that until his death plaintiff's decedent supported the child, and there was evidence that he acknowledged the child in writing. Ind. Code &sect; 31-4-1-7 provided that the obligation of the father, where his paternity had been acknowledged by him in writing, or by the part performance of his obligations, was enforceable against his estate in such an amount as the court might determine. Therefore, the child of plaintiff's decedent was a &quot;dependent child&quot; within the meaning of the wrongful death statute.</SPAN></P>

The city appealed, contending that the city had statutory license to establish by ordinance the commission. The court reversed the judgment of the trial court, finding that a specific enactment was not required for a city to establish a civil service merit commission under Ind.

The court concluded that the city's power to create a commission by ordinance was delineated in the Powers of Cities Act, Ind. Code &sect; 18-1-1.5-2. The court, however, remanded the case to the trial court to determine whether the ordinance impinged unconstitutionally upon certain firemen's property rights under the collective bargaining agreement.</SPAN></P>

One of the issues in reaching this conclusion was whether the term &quot;knowingly&quot;, as used in the child neglect statute, should have been construed in terms of an objective or a subjective standard. The court concluded that the legislature, by inserting the degrees of mental state in the child neglect statute, intended to change the standard from an objective one to a subjective one.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A wrecker service employee approached an accident and offered to tow the car of one of the parties. As a result, he was arrested for soliciting towing work at the scene of an accident in violation of a city ordinance, Code &sect; 29-375(1). The wrecker service filed a complaint contending that &sect; 29-375(1) was unconstitutional. The trial court agreed and entered partial summary judgment in favor of the wrecker service. On appeal, the court reversed, remanded, and held that: (1) the wrecker service failed to establish that the city exceeded its police power in enacting the ordinance, and the trial court erred in so finding; (2) there was no First Amendment violation, as the state was not impotent to regulate harmful commercial activity whenever speech was a component of that activity; (3) the ordinance was not vague or overbroad; (4) the ordinance did not violate the equal protection provisions of the state and federal constitutions; (5) the wrecker service failed to show that the ordinance was unconstitutionally applied, and the trial court erred in so holding; and (6) the trial court erred in finding the ordinance invalid on the basis of preemption.</SPAN></P>

Defendant contended that the Indiana obscenity statute, Ind. Code &sect; 35-30-10.1 (Supp. 1981), was vague and overbroad. The court found that the statute was not unconstitutionally vague or overbroad. Defendant contended that comments by the prosecutor during closing arguments constituted misconduct. Defendant failed to demonstrate any prejudice arising from the prosecutor's comments. The trial court sustained his objection and admonished the jury to disregard the improper comments. There was no abuse of discretion. The evidence was sufficient to sustain the jury's verdict. Defendant contended that it was error to sentence him on four counts. The court found that there were two sales. One detective purchased two magazines and the other detective purchased two films. Defendant could be charged with only two counts of distributing obscene material. The court reversed two of the counts and remanded for resentencing.</SPAN></P>

The property owners used the lake for their private enjoyment, and it was utilized for catfish farming. The general public could use the lake for a daily fee. When the catfish farm was closed, the owners began to develop a subdivision around the lake. The surface mining company began to strip mine an area nearby, and it encountered flooding in its pits. When it began to pump the pits to dewater them, the level of the lake began to fall. The owners filed an action against the company which alleged that the mining activities caused the loss of the water in the lake. The trial court entered judgment in favor of the company, and the owners appealed. The court reversed and remanded, holding that it was necessary for the mining company to dewater its pits in order to mine coal, but a business was required to bear its own costs, burdens, and expenses of its operation because the costs could be distributed to the consumer through the price mechanism.</SPAN></P>

The state veterens' home sought review of the arbitrator's award in the trial court and the trial court refused to vacate the award. The state veterens' home appealed, and the court affirmed the trial court's judgment. The court held that the failure to award a merit raise was an arbitrable matter under &sect; 4-15-2-35 (1974). The denial of a salary increase fell within the remedies provided by that statute. The employees' complaint did not involve the issue of whether it was a property-like character to require a due process hearing, nor did it involve procedural safeguards attendant to a demotion.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The three defendants had established an illegal camp in a state park. Officers discovered the illegal camp and found ginseng, loaded firearms, and a quantity of marijuana. When the three defendants were confronted by the officers each carried ginseng in his pockets. On appeal defendants first argued that the evidence was insufficient. Two defendants specifically argued that they were charged with possession of loaded firearms in a state park and the evidence showed that they were arrested in a nature preserve. The court held that the nature preserve was a part of the state park. The court also determined that the Department of Natural Resource's regulations were not unconstitutionally vague. Finally, the court noted that the trial court could permissibly infer that the ginseng was gathered inside the state park. As a part of the penalty the trial court confiscated the digging tools and firearms and ordered their disposal. The court concluded that the trial court erred in ordering the confiscation because defendants were not convicted of violating the 1937 Fish and Game Act, and confiscation was an inappropriate punishment.</SPAN></P>

The trial court denied both motions. The property owners sought review, raising only the constitutional issue. On review, the court rejected that contention, finding that the amortization provisions were constitutional because they were reasonably related to the public welfare, namely health and safety. The court noted that it did not find all amortization provisions were constitutional per se. The court found that an amortization provision valid on its face could be found unconstitutional as applied to a particular parcel of real estate after weighing the pertinent factors. The court held that the rule of reasonableness was to prevail, considering the public gain versus the private loss and that each case must be decided on its own facts.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court reversed and found that the remonstrators did not have actual notice of the waiver of their right to remonstrate. The court found that the waivers failed to provide actual notice to the remonstrators because the developer executed the sewer contracts which contained the waivers prior to the sale of the land. The remonstrators were not parties to the waivers and had no actual notice of them. The sewer contracts were not recorded in the chain of title until after most of the lots were sold.

The court denied the rehearing and held that the parties argued the merits of private sale, sheriff's sale, and determining deficiency by appraisement. Thus, the issue was previously decided.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A police officer witnesses defendant break into a service station and arrested him walking out. He was convicted at trial. On appeal, he argued that the trial court erred by not giving his requested instruction that the presumption of innocence operates as evidence in favor of the defendant. The court found no error and affirmed his conviction. The presumption of innocence accorded defendant was not evidence to support the innocence of defendant. Rather, it was merely a rule of law that describes the bare point from which the jury was required to begin its assessment of the evidence and its deliberations thereon. Defendant's proposed instruction was also an incorrect statement of the law and the presumption of innocence was adequately explained in the other of the trial court's instructions. In this case, proof of a criminal trespass under Ind. Code &sect; 35-43-2-2(a)(1) or (a)(4) was not required to gain a conviction for burglary. Criminal trespass was not an inherently included offense or a possibly included offense. The trial court properly refused to instruct the jury on lesser-included offenses.</SPAN></P>

As to the count of theft that was reversed, the court did so on statute of limitations grounds. Theft was a class D felony, and under Ind.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Despite complaints and warnings about the deteriorated condition of the stairs and landings at the apartments they owned, the landlords did nothing substantial to repair or replace the stairs and landings. A social guest of one of the tenants went out on the rear porch of the apartment and leaned against the railing. She fell to the ground when the railing gave way and she subsequently died from her injuries. The landlords were convicted of reckless homicide. On appeal, the court found that a common law duty was imposed upon the landlords because a landlord's duty to maintain common areas extends to social guests. Because the tenant had express permission to remain in the apartment, she was not a tenant at sufferance and the landlords' duty still existed. The court found that criminal responsibility was not intended for merely negligent conduct. The court found that the standard to determine whether the landlords' failure to act was reckless or merely negligent was vague. The court found the convictions could not stand because the vagueness violated the landlords' right to the due process of law.</SPAN></P>

The putative fathers filed motions to dismiss the petitions on the grounds that the two-year statute of limitations in Ind. Code &sect; 31-4-1-26 barred the petitions. The trial courts denied the motions. The putative fathers appealed. The court affirmed, holding that there was no substantial, or even reasonable, state interest that would justify a barrier that precludes an illegitimate child from bringing a support action if the action depends upon a paternity determination. The court reasoned that the state's interest in protecting its fiscal integrity outweighed its countervailing interest in protecting against stale claims. The court also found that the problems of proof in paternity cases were no greater than, if as great as, problems of proof in other causes of action whose statutes of limitation are tolled by infancy. The court concluded that the limitation on an action grounded in the classification of illegitimacy was broadly discriminatory and not carefully attuned to alternative considerations.</SPAN></P>

However, the court found no merit to the union's underlying claims for breach of contract or for the existence of a constructive trust in connection with the excess health plan funds.

On rehearing, the court held that (1) the State failed to present even a scintilla of evidence that the value of the automobile was insufficient; (2) a factual argument made by the State regarding who owned the automobile was unavailing because both the person whose name was on the title and the person for whom bail was posted agreed to the arrangement; (3) based on the lack of evidence of the value of the automobile, defendant's conduct was not unlawful under Ind. Admin. Code tit. 760, r. 1-6-16(k), which provided for a guaranty of premium, and Ind. Code &sect; 35-4-5-40, under which defendant was prosecuted and which did not proscribe the receipt of money or money's worth for a premium; and (4) whether or not the lien was formally perfected had no effect on the State's failure to show the insufficiency of what defendant received because transfer of the title was binding between the parties to it.</SPAN></P>

The court further held that it was not unconstitutional for a statute to impose the burden of proof upon defendant for proof of an issue where the issue was not an element of the crime.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the trial court erred in refusing to allow him to introduce a foreign order granting him custody in order to show a lack of intent to violate the Indiana order. On appeal, the court agreed but affirmed. The offense of criminal confinement occurred when one knowingly or intentionally removed a child under 18 years of age to a place outside Indiana when the removal violated a custody order. According to Ind. Code &sect; 35-41-2-2, the State was required to show that defendant acted with either a conscious objective to violate the order or that he was aware of a high probability that he was doing so. As such, the foreign order should have been admitted because it was relevant and material to the issue of whether defendant had a conscious objective to violate the Indiana order. However, the error was harmless. The evidence was clear that defendant knew that the Indiana order awarded custody to his former wife; defendant did not challenge the validity of that order. Those facts showed that defendant was aware of the high probability that he was violating a court order when he removed the child from Indiana. As such, the State established that defendant acted knowingly.</SPAN></P>

Defendants were convicted for robbery, a class B felony. Defendants appealed and the court affirmed. The court held that defendants' sentences were not manifestly unreasonable. The court noted that, while the non-knife wielding defendant argued that his attorney-client privilege was violated by his cross-examination of him, he had failed to properly assert that privilege. The court found that he had testified about their conversations and had therefore waived his privilege. The court noted that threats were viewed as admissions of guilt, and were relevant and proper for a jury's consideration. The court found that the trial court did not err in admitting the customer's testimony. The court held that the knife was evidence that made it more likely than not that defendants were the robbers.</SPAN></P>

Code &sect; 35-42-2-3 at a bench trial. Defendant alleged that the trial court erred by not granting her motion to dismiss, that there was insufficient evidence to sustain her conviction, and that Ind.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant and a companion were walking southward on a street. A police officer, who had the passenger side window rolled up, was driving northward on the same street. The officer testified that he saw defendant lean towards the street where he partially heard her say, and partially read her lips to say, &quot;fucking pig&quot; or &quot;fucking prick.&quot; The epithet was directed to the officer. The officer backed up, got out of the vehicle, confronted defendant, and then arrested her. In reversing the judgment of conviction by the trial court, the court held that the language of Ind. Code &sect; 35-42-2-3--likely to provoke a reasonable man to commit battery--naturally implied a condition that the victim of the verbal harassment must have the present capacity to commit battery. That interpretation was consistent with the constitutional provisions necessary to protect free speech. The evidence was insufficient to show that the officer had the physical capacity to commit battery. There was no showing that the officer was provoked to batter defendant.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The City challenged a judgment of the St. Joseph Superior Court, Traffic and Misdemeanor Division (Indiana), which declared South Bend, Ind., Mun. Code art. 4, &sect; 13-55.1 to be unconstitutionally vague and granted defendants' motions to dismiss charges that they violated the ordinance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The City argued that the trial court erred in declaring the ordinance unconstitutionally vague or overbroad. On appeal, the court agreed. Section 13-55.1 made it unlawful for any person to loiter in or near any public place in a manner manifesting the purpose of inducing, enticing, soliciting, or procuring another to commit an act of prostitution. The ordinance was clothed with a presumption of constitutionality and defendants bore the burden of overcoming that presumption. Because the case was one of first impression, the court looked to decisions of other jurisdictions which upheld similar enactments against vagueness challenges. Moreover, the court found that &sect; 13-55.1 detailed specific, prohibited conduct in language that was sufficiently definite to give a person fair notice of the forbidden conduct. It also gave law enforcement officers definite criteria to follow, thus avoiding arbitrary enforcement. Finally, the prohibited loitering was tied to the criminal purpose of soliciting; it did not authorize arrest for simple loitering by a known prostitute or anyone else. Thus, &sect; 13-55.1 was not unconstitutionally vague or overbroad and the judgment to the contrary was reversed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The police searched defendants' home and found a bottle of Desoxyn on the dresser in the bedroom and marijuana in a purse in the bedroom. Both defendants argued the evidence was insufficient to support their convictions. The court affirmed. The court found that the husband's argument that his possession of the Desoxyn without a valid prescription was an element of the crime which the State must prove beyond a reasonable doubt had to fail. The court held the existence of a valid prescription was an exception to, not an element of, the possession statute, and the husband had the burden of proving he had a valid prescription for the Desoxyn by a preponderance of the evidence. Here, the Desoxyn was found in plain view on top of a dresser in a bedroom of the home occupied by both defendants, which demonstrated the wife's capability to control the Desoxyn. The fact the contraband was in plain view was sufficient to establish an intent to control. In addition, the evidence showed the marijuana was found in a purse in the bedroom of defendants' home. A reasonable inference was properly drawn that the purse belonged to the wife.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When the police officer was appointed, the mandatory retirement age of police officers was 70 years. The legislature subsequently lowered the mandatory retirement age to 65. The police officer was notified by the City that he was to be officially retired from the police department pursuant to Ind. Code Ann. &sect; 18-4-12-20.5. The police officer argued that the trial court's application of Ind. Code Ann. &sect; 18-4-12-20.5 impaired a contractual obligation and violated the Contract Clause of both the United States and Indiana Constitutions because Ind. Code Ann. &sect; 19-1-1-1, which was in effect at the time he was appointed to the department and which had not been expressly repealed at the time the action was initiated, governed his mandatory retirement age. The court agreed and reversed the judgment because the attempt by the City to apply the current age limit of 65 to a contract made before the effective date of Ind. Code Ann. &sect; 18-4-12-20.5 impaired a contractual obligation assumed by the City.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The board concluded that it did not have authority under Shelby County, Ind., Zoning Ordinance ch. 13, &sect; (B)(4) to grant the applicant's request for a use variance. On rehearing, the court reversed the trial court's judgment that upheld the board's denial of the application. The court held that the final segment of 13, &sect; B(4), which provided that the board did not have authority to grant a variance for a use not specified as a permitted or special use, was invalid because it was in direct conflict with the enabling statute Ind. Code. &sect; 18-7-4-918(c). The court considered 1979 Ind. Acts 178 &sect; 165(a) p. 861, which provided that &sect; 18-7-4-918 was a recodification and that the substantive operation and effect of the law continued uninterrupted. The last paragraph of &sect; 18-7-4-918(d), which denied county and municipal boards of zoning appeals authority to grant variance from a use district or classification, did not appear in the prior legislation. Thus, the ordinance could not have in any way restricted the board's authority to grant a use variance because the enabling statute endowed the board with powers to authorize variances from the terms of any zoning ordinance.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parties stipulated that the substance delivered by defendant was not a controlled substance.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The victim, a 13-year-old girl, went to a party and eventually left with a group of people, including defendant. She was raped by defendant and several others. Upon his conviction, defendant claimed that the trial court should have granted his motion for change of venue based on his affidavit alleging prejudice. The court disagreed and held that absolutely no evidence was presented to show community bias or prejudice because he was a minority, other than his affidavit. The mere possibility of prejudice or bias was not sufficient to entitle him to a change of venue. Next, the court held that defendant failed to preserve his claim that the trial court used improper wording in its instructions to the jury. The court then ruled that photographs of the alleged rape scene were properly admitted because they were relevant as to the scene of the crime from the officer's observation. Defendant argued that the trial court erred in granting the State's motion in limine under Indiana's Rape Shield Law, Ind. Code &sect; 35-1-32.5-1 (1980). The court stated that the law was constitutional. Further, defendant failed to object to the motion when it was presented to the trial court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee filed a claim for compensation against the employer with the Industrial Board of Indiana (board) in which he alleged workmen's occupational disease. The employer filed a motion to strike the employee's interrogatories. The board denied the employer's motion to strike and ordered the employer to answer. When the employer refused to comply, the employee filed a complaint in the circuit court to enforce the board's order. The circuit court entered summary judgment for the employee and awarded attorney fees. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment insofar as it ordered the employer to answer. Ind. R. Trial P. 26-37 were intended to be an exception to the general rule that the Indiana Trial Rules were inapplicable to administrative agencies. Therefore, the board had the authority to order the employer to answer the interrogatories, and the circuit court had the authority to order the employer to comply with the order of the board. The employer's refusal to comply with the order came at the board level, not at the circuit court level, and thus the portion of the circuit court's judgment awarding attorney fees was reversed.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the trial court did not err in refusing to declare a mistrial because of prosecutorial misconduct because the prosecutor did not argue a new theory of the case for the first time in closing argument. Rather than asserting that defendant intentionally killed her husband, as defendant alleged, the court held that the State argued only that she recklessly killed him. The court also held that the trial court properly refused to submit defendant's tendered instruction on lesser included offenses to the jury. The court found that battery was not a lesser included offense of reckless homicide, but that criminal recklessness was. However, defendant did not submit an instruction defining serious bodily harm, which was fatal to her argument.

The court determined that it was apparent that the trial court relied upon Ind. Code &sect; 34-4-2-13(a)(3) in vacating the award. Section 34-4-2-13(a)(3) stated that upon application of a party, the trial court should vacate an award where the arbitrators exceeded their powers and the award could not be corrected without affecting the merits of the decision upon the controversy submitted. The court concluded that &sect; 34-4-2-13(a)(3), on its face, said nothing about error of law or erroneous interpretation of the law by the arbitrator; the same was true of the other four paragraphs of Ind.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The school board adopted a voluntary policy for collective bargaining with its non-teaching, classified employees. A number of the employees refused to perform their work assignments after the school refused to recognize and negotiate with the individual selected by the classified employees to represent them. The school filed an action for injunctive relief, and the trial court enjoined the employees and ordered the school to bargain with the employees' representative. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded. Collective bargaining was voluntary, and the voluntary recognition and bargaining policy adopted by the school was expressly conditioned upon two factors. It would not recognize a classified employee organization if the organization had any members who were not employees of the school, and it would not negotiate with &quot;representatives&quot; who were neither employees of the school nor attorneys. The classified employees indicated their desire to be represented in negotiations by an employee of the state teacher's association, who was not an employee.

On appeal, the court held that the pre-tax sale notice provisions were sufficient and met the constitutional due process standards. The mortgagee's actual knowledge of the sale after the date of the sale, whether actual or constructive, was not determinative. The fact that the tax sale statutes provided no notice to the mortgagee of the right of redemption did not violate due process because all mortgagees had notice of the right by the enactment of the tax sale statutes and the two-year grace period. Finally, the court held that the statutory scheme of classification, which distinguished between owners and mortgagees, did not involve either a fundamental right or a suspect class. The court concluded that the scheme was reasonable and had a fair and substantial relationship to the purpose of the legislation.</SPAN></P>

Appellants applied for a warrant, but the trial court refused to issue one because appellants failed to establish probable cause to believe that a specific violation of IOSHA existed on the company's premises. Appellants sought review, asserting that the trial court applied an improper standard. The court agreed and reversed. It held that the relevant sanctions under IOSHA were civil in character, and, thus, that the standard of probable cause for securing a warrant under IOSHA was the same as the standard for obtaining a warrant under the Occupational Safety and Health Act. The trial court's erroneous application of a criminal probable cause standard to assess the sufficiency of appellants' warrant application required a reversal. The court further found that the affidavits and evidence introduced before the trial court were adequate to meet the applicable probable cause standard because they established that a reasonable legislative or administrative standard for conducting an inspection was satisfied as to the company.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After finding an emergency situation existed with the mother's children, the juvenile court made them temporary wards. Thereafter, the mother failed to follow her casework plan, and the department filed an action seeking a declaration that the children were permanent wards. The juvenile court found in favor of the department, and the mother appealed. She contended that the juvenile court lacked subject-matter jurisdiction to terminate her parental rights and that it incorrectly applied certain legal standards in terminating her rights. Upon review, the court held that where parental rights were terminated by appropriate proceedings, the natural parent's consent to adoption was not required under Ind. Code &sect; 31-3-1-6(g)4 (repealed 1978 Ind. Acts 136, &sect; 28). Further, Ind. Code &sect; 31-3-1-6(g)7 was applicable only in those instances where a juvenile court deprived a parent of custody and not parental rights. Thus, the claim that &sect; 31-3-1-6(g)7 affected the jurisdiction of the juvenile court was without merit. As to the evidentiary standards applied by the juvenile court, the court ruled the mother waived those argument that she raised by failing to properly preserve them for review.</SPAN></P>

The board rejected his claim on the basis that disablement had not occurred within three years of his last exposure to the hazards of the disease. The employee appealed. On appeal, the court reversed the decision of the board and remanded the case for further proceedings. The court found that in dealing with the disease rather than the more typical forms of industrial injury the determination of causation could be a problem. The court held that the Act's principal purpose was to compensate disabled workmen. The court found that the Act required a claimant to file his claim within three years after his last exposure to the hazards of the disease and within two years after the occurrence of disability. The court held that based on the long reaction time of the disease of asbestosis, the time limitation under the Act was unconstitutional as it amounted to a denial of justice by effecting a denial of the right of recovery, which the legislature sought to confer.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the trial court committed harmless error when it found that the safety equipment was consumed in direct production because consumption does not mean normal wear and tear or withdrawal from the workplace. The court found no error in the trial court's admission of circulars because the circulars apparently reflected the department's belief about legislative intent at the time the statute was enacted and, consequently, were relevant to the significant issue of whether safety equipment was within the scope of Ind.

The trial court upheld the decision. On appeal, the court held that the officer was not denied due process under U.S. Const. amend XIV even though he did not have counsel during the board of captains hearing and a record was not made. The court explained that the officer had received a full and fair hearing before the merit board and that he had suffered no prejudice. The court held that under Ind.

The court held that the officer did not have a statutory right to counsel or a record made at the board of captains hearing.

Moreover, the courts were not authorized to go behind the constitutional authentication of a bill. Regarding the trial court's failure to consider an attorney general's opinion regarding &sect; 35-45-4-2, the court held that the opinion was not persuasive authority because it dealt with the status of what was to become &sect; 35-45-4-2 before its enactment. Defendant also argued that &sect; 35-45-4-2 was unconstitutionally vague because of its use of the word &quot;fondle.&quot; The court rejected the argument, holding that based upon the term's common meaning, the term &quot;fondle&quot; was not obscure and stated reasonably clear guidelines. Additionally, the evidence supported the finding that defendant knowingly offered to fondle the genitals of another person for money.

On appeal, defendant contended that the trial court properly dismissed the charge of operating while intoxicated, under Ind.

The court reversed the trial court's judgment and remanded. The court held that the trial court erred by dismissing the first count of the indictment because Ind. Code &sect; 9-4-1-54 did not require proof of operation on a public highway. Additionally, the court held that the trial court erred in dismissing the third count of the indictment since it was the intent of the legislature to treat repeat offenders more severely, and to establish a deterrent to future crimes.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The plain-clothes officers filed a class action suit seeking reimbursement for clothing expenses and an annual clothing allowance. The trial court determined that Ind.

Reversing the trial court, the court ruled that the legislature's clear intent in enacting Ind. Code &sect; 10-1-1-7 was to require the police board to provide only official uniforms and equipment and did not require an allowance for plain-clothes officers, that the word &quot;uniform&quot; in &sect; 10-1-1-7 referred only to the distinctive garb of the official uniform, and that defendants therefore had no statutory duty to furnish a clothing allowance. The court further ruled that there was no equal protection violation because the job classification of plain-clothes officers was different from job classifications of uniformed officers and the classifications were reasonable. The court noted that creation of job classifications and provision for pay and other benefits for each classification was the function of the police authorities, not the judiciary.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff's son was injured in accident and was taken to defendant hospital for x-rays. Plaintiff refused to pay for interpretation, and filed declaratory judgment action. The court held that plaintiff failed to show that trial court's finding that he consented to the doctor's services was clearly erroneous; plaintiff was not encumbering himself with heavy liability in exchange for small gain; therefore, consent form was not unconscionable. The court held that plaintiff lacked standing to litigate issue of whether defendant hospital's policy constituted state action and violated its patients' right to refuse treatment. The court held that any right that plaintiff had to direct his son's medical treatment was not infringed since plaintiff consented to the taking of the x-rays of his son's wrist, and to allege that consent was effective for the taking only, and not its interpretation was absurd. Finally, the court held that plaintiff failed to show antitrust violation or illegal tying arrangement.</SPAN></P>

Defendant contended that the Indiana statute permitting a six-member jury was unconstitutional, that the evidence was insufficient, and that it was error to allow the arresting officer to testify about defendant's incriminating statements.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that a 12-member jury in a felony case was a fundamental, constitutional right. The court determined that there was no constitutional impediment to the six-member jury in county courts with concurrent felony jurisdiction. While defendant had a constitutional right to a jury trial, nothing in the federal or Indiana constitutions guaranteed him a specific number of jurors. The court agreed that marijuana found under a jacket in defendant's kitchen did not establish his possession because he was one of nine persons present when the police arrived. However, the presence of marijuana in his bedrooms was sufficient to establish possession because the jury was entitled to infer from the testimony that he did not share his bedrooms or dressers and that his bedrooms were not routinely accessible to outsiders. The court rejected defendant's contention that the arresting officer should not have been permitted to testify that defendant identified himself as the owner of the house when the police arrived. The officer's informational question did not constitute an interrogation that required a hearing on voluntariness. The court affirmed defendant's conviction.</SPAN></P>

Although the trial court did not make any specific findings as to the candidate's party membership, the trial court apparently found that the candidate had violated the cross-filing prohibition of &sect; 3-1-9-6. The court found that, without having found the candidate belonged to a specific party, the trial court could not have found the candidate belonged to &quot;any other party.&quot; Moreover, &sect; 3-1-9-6 was unconstitutionally vague and overbroad and infringed upon the candidate's fundamental First Amendment right of freedom of association. The statute, which did not define &quot;belonging to&quot; or &quot;member of,&quot; went far beyond the permissible goal of preventing candidates from cross-filing petitions for candidacy and prohibited a candidate from belonging to or associating with more than one political party.</SPAN></P>

Defendant testified that he was backing away from the victim when he tripped and his gun accidentally discharged.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant claimed that the mandatory sentencing requirements in Ind. Code &sect; 35-4.1-4-7 were unconstitutional. The court rejected his argument. The court added the trial court acted within the statutory guidelines, precluding review of the sentence. The court ruled that cross-examination of a State witness about the victim's illegal drug activity was properly excluded. The court explained that the issue was not addressed on direct examination. The court rejected defendant's argument that the trial court should have ordered another competency examination under Ind. Code &sect; 35-5-3.1-1. The court noted that while defendant had a tendency to ramble during his testimony, he always maintained that the shooting was an accident. The court noted that defendant's testimony was consistent with his pre-trial statement. The court noted the earlier psychiatrists' reports that defendant was competent to stand trial and sane at the time of the shooting and defendant's testimony, which revealed he understood the nature of the offense charged. The court remained unpersuaded that the trial court abused its discretion in denying a second examination. The court rejected defendant's other arguments.</SPAN></P>

The gun club and the board filed motions to correct errors. The circuit court granted the gun club's motion and ruled that the gun club was entitled to partial exemptions for 1976 and subsequent years. The appellate court reversed, holding that the circuit court committed reversible error by admitting evidence that was not presented before the board. The court found that the circuit court's scope of review of the board's decision was limited to deciding whether the board's order was arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, unsupported by substantial evidence, or in excess of statutory authority.

Following this, the county welfare agency filed a petition that sought to terminate the father's parental rights to the children. The trial court granted the petition and terminated the father's parental rights. The father filed an appeal. The court first noted that the procedures outlined in Ind. Code &sect;&sect; 31-6-5-3(6)(A), 31-6-5-4(1) (1978) were followed because the children were removed from the father's care and they were adjudicated neglected and dependent children. Next, the court did not find anything clearly erroneous about the trial court's finding that reasonable services had been offered to the father, and that he failed to accept such services. Finally, the court did not find the trial court's decision in terminating the parental rights was contrary to the law. The court noted that the trial court properly based its decision pursuant to the criteria outlined in Ind. Code &sect; 31-6-5-4. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment.</SPAN></P>

After the father's death, the son filed a claim against the estate because the father failed to devise the farmland to him. Before trial, the son's mother transferred by quitclaim deed all her interest in the father's real estate to the son. At trial, the son questioned the mother about the father's promises. The estate objected to the testimony on the ground of competency. The trial court ruled that the mother was an incompetent witness because she was the grantor of a party. It entered an involuntary dismissal of the son's claim against the estate. The court held that the mother was not incompetent because of Indiana Dead Man's Statute, Ind. Code &sect; 34-1-14-6, and she should have been permitted to testify. Having transferred her interest in the land, she had no interest that would render her incompetent. The mother was not rendered incompetent by Ind. Code &sect; 34-1-14-10. Her grant to the son did not make her incompetent within the intent of &sect; 34-1-14-10 and its application to Ind.

Defendant was convicted and fined for possession of the device. Defendant argued that Ind.

The state maintained that &sect;35-44-3-12 was sufficiently clear. The court reversed. Section 35-44-3-12 was plain and unambiguous on its face. However, if construed to apply to defendant's radar detection device, it was unconstitutionally vague because its terminology was too general to put a person of ordinary intelligence on notice that possession of a portable radar detection device was prohibited. The court held that although it was required to strictly construe &sect; 35-44-3-12 against the State, the court was also obligated to adopt, if possible, a construction that was constitutional. Consequently, in order to avoid giving &sect; 35-44-3-12 an unconstitutionally vague construction, the court held that it did not prohibit the possession of a portable radar detection device.</SPAN></P>

The court also rejected her contention that the Act was unconstitutional and found that the stutute did not delay litigation or cause undue expense beyond that required in litigation. Nothing in the Act violated a plaintiff's right to trial because the actions of the department of insurance and of the medical panels were not delegations of judicial or administrate authority. The trial court did not err in granting the doctor and the hospital judgment on the pleadings because the patient did not establish that the doctor had a duty to warn her of the possibility of finding a problem during surgery such as the one that caused the complications. Because the patient did not identify any basis that would have dissuaded her from surgery, other than the one about which there was no duty to warn, she failed to establish a lack of informed consent claim.</SPAN></P>

The trial court granted the motions to dismiss filed by the employer and the attorney general. On appeal, the court affirmed and held that the employee's allegations did not operate to bring the employee's claim outside the exclusive remedy provision of the Act, Ind. Code &sect; 22-3-2-6. Further, the employee did not state a cognizable common law claim by alleging that his injury was produced by the employer's negligent, wanton, or reckless violation of safety laws or by seeking punitive damages. Moreover, the Act necessarily distinguished between employers and employees. Because the employee and employer were not similarly situated, the employee did not present a cognizable equal protection claim under U.S. Const. amend. XIV, &sect; 1 or Ind.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court approved appellees' computation of pension benefits. The method employed the simultaneous use of two reduction factors, one based on age and one based on years of service. The pensioners alleged that they were being discriminated against in violation of the constitution and that appellees' pension trust agreement violated Indiana Law. The court determined that appellees were entitled to use a reduction factor based both on the age of a retiree if below 55 and a reduction based on the years of service he had rendered if below 20 because the factors did not abridge the pensioners' statutory and constitutional rights. The court further found that appellees' pension fund was not required to recalculate the pension benefits of all retired policemen each time the law was changed. The court determined that the pension fund's refusal to apply changes in the computation retroactively did not violate the law nor the constitution.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A family sought poor relief from town. At first, they were granted assistance except as to their shelter cost because they were home owners and not renters. Eventually the town stopped all assistance, citing that the family failed to disclose all of their income. The family appealed to a poor relief hearing officer. The hearing officer found that there was no renters-only provision in the law, but shelter assistance was still properly denied because the family was not in an immediate emergency situation for shelter even though they were behind in payments. The family filed an action against the town, but the trial court granted summary judgment in favor of the town. The family's house was foreclosed. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded. The court held that the poor relief statute did not authorize the trustee to have a blanket policy of providing shelter assistance only to those renting their shelter. The court found that the trial court's sua sponte granting summary judgment an issue was error because it did not give the family an opportunity to prepare or present material in opposition of the judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">This case involved the visitation of a father whose child had been declared a ward of the Delaware County Department of Public Welfare. The superior court denied the father's request to visit with his daughter. The father challenged the Indiana rule consistently applied in juvenile proceedings that the best interests of the child had to be considered. The father specifically argued that the best interests standard unconstitutionally interfered with his fundamental rights to family integrity and parent-child communication. The court held that the best interests standard was a constitutionally permissible standard which applied in determining the visitation rights of a father whose child had been found dependent and neglected under Indiana law. The court also found that there was sufficient evidence to prove it was not in the best interests of the child to force her to visit with her biological father. Therefore, the decision of the superior court was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs filed a complaint for medical malpractice arising out of the patient's fall from the fourth story of the hospital's building. The doctor and medical practice filed motions for summary judgment, which were granted. After trial, the jury rendered a verdict for the hospital. On appeal by plaintiffs, the court affirmed the judgments for defendants. The trial court did not err by granting summary judgments based on plaintiffs' failure to comply with Ind. Code &sect; 16-9.5-9-2 (1971), which required them to first present their complaint to a medical review panel. Because plaintiffs' affidavit did not comply with Ind. R. Tr. P. 60(B), there was no genuine issue of material fact as to the qualifications of the doctor and medical practice under the Act. Also, the Act did not violate plaintiffs' constitutional rights. The court also rejected plaintiffs' argument that the legislature delegated judicial power to the Indiana Department of Insurance (department) through the Act. The delegated functions were not judicial in nature. The court could not review the trial court's failure to give plaintiffs' requested instructions because a record of the proceedings below was not provided.</SPAN></P>

In affirming, the court held that: (1) an office created by municipal ordinance, as the city judge office was, could be abolished by ordinance; (2) the office of city judge was not a constitutional office, and the council had the power to abolish the office it created; (3) the city judge did not have any vested right in the office, and there was no provision in the constitution that prohibited a city from abolishing by ordinance the office of city judge created by ordinance; and (4) the city judge had no contractual obligation that was unconstitutionally impaired by the abolition of his office.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The corporation was doing business as a drive-in theatre. It was convicted of five counts of exhibition of an obscene performance in violation of Ind. Code 35-30-10.1-3. The corporation was fined $ 5,000 on each count. The corporation appealed arguing, among other things, that the evidence was insufficient to sustain the jury's verdicts against the corporation. Specifically, the corporation claimed the films were not obscene. The court affirmed the judgment. There was testimony at trial by police officers which gave descriptions of each of the five films exhibited to the public by the corporation. Those descriptions revealed thin or nonexistent plots or story lines connecting a series of sexual acts including sexual intercourse, anal intercourse, cunnilingus and fellatio, all with genitals clearly exhibited. The films were also shown to the jury as exhibits. The court was of the opinion that the trier of fact had ample evidence to find that the films, taken as a whole, clearly appealed to a prurient interest in sex as their dominant themes and that the films lacked serious literary, artistic, political or scientific value and therefore were obscene.</SPAN></P>

The trial court ordered the child would take the surname of the father, and the mother appealed, claiming that the order was contrary to law, unsupported by the evidence, and an abuse of discretion. The court concluded that the father had not engaged in misconduct, which might justify forfeiture of his interest in having the child bear the paternal surname. The court noted that the father had already made payments for the support of the child, he had testified to his willingness to provide support in the future, and had indicated his desire to exercise visitation rights, thus, changing the child's name to that of his natural father would be consistent with preservation of the father-child relationship and, perhaps more importantly, such a change avoided a fair indication that the child was illegitimate, therefore, the judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

Code &sect; 6-2-1-2 (1978). On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment of the trial court, which found that the taxpayer was entitled to a refund. The court considered the direct mail catalog sales and the credit service charges separately. The court could not say that the trial court's conclusion that the taxpayer's direct mail sales were interstate was an erroneous application of the law. The uncontroverted evidence supported the conclusion that the minimal local intervention of the taxpayer fell short of the degree of activity contemplated by &sect; 6-2-1-2. Similarly, the facts supported the trial court's conclusion that the taxpayer's local credit service activities were remote and minimal in comparison to the interstate character of the transactions. Accordingly, the taxpayer's activities were not taxable under &sect; 6-2-1-2, and the taxpayer was entitled to a refund.</SPAN></P>

The court upheld the finding of a deceptive practice, but it remanded on the issue of damages. There was sufficient evidence of a deceptive act when the seller used bait and switch tactics. There were misrepresentations in the advertising for the piano. The Consumer Act did not violate constitutional principles. However, damages were allowed for actual, but not punitive damages, and there was insufficient proof of damages. The purchasers failed to make a case for damages based on emotional distress or loss of consortium. They also failed to submit the necessary proof of actual out of pocket expenses, or to show they were entitled to damages for the loss of bargain, as they never purchased a piano.</SPAN></P>

Notice of the proceedings resulting in the approval of the resolution was published in strict compliance with &sect; 19-2-14-7 and that publication was all that was required by the statute. The property owners argued that notice by publication under the circumstances was inadequate because it was not reasonably calculated to inform them of governmental action adversely affecting their property interests. The court held that the type of assessment involving the retirement of bonded indebtedness of the taxing corporation was similar to that to which property became subject when annexed to a city or other municipal corporation. The court held, therefore, that notice by publication as provided by &sect; 19-2-14-7 was adequate in the proceedings, which incorporated the property into the sanitary district and pursuant to which certain increases in ad valorem general assessments were levied against the properties.</SPAN></P>

The court determined that the statute applied to the commission because a person was defined as an individual, trustee, partnership, corporations, and bodies politic. The court found that the statute was constitutional and in accordance with Ind.

In affirming, the court found that a determination of the issues raised would not have any effect on the litigation and that the association did not assert an effect on the appeal. All issues raised in an appeal were not required to be determined. The court refused to address the issues because it found that whether policemen had a right to enter into collective bargaining or whether the trial court incorrectly interpreted a statute which had since been declared unconstitutional would not alter the determination that the collective bargaining agreement was invalid because the mayor did not have the authority to enter into such an agreement. Further, the wage provisions of the agreement were not to be severed from the agreement because the mayor had no authority to enter into any facet of the agreement. Finally, the city should not have been estopped from denying the validity of the agreement because it was not the city, but the mayor, who was found to have performed the authorized act of entering the agreement.</SPAN></P>

The trial court held that it did not have jurisdiction over the cause of action because no medical review panel had been convened or had rendered a written opinion on the claim as required by the Act. The parents contended that they were not subject to the Act. The court affirmed, holding that the parents' action was subject to the Act and that therefore, the submission of the claim to the panel and the panel's opinion were necessary prerequisites to the action. The court had previously resolved that the Act was not unconstitutional, as the parents contended. The court reviewed the Act's legislative history and concluded that the legislature intended that all actions, the underlying basis for which was alleged medical malpractice, were subject to the Act. Therefore, all persons, including the parents, having causes of action found upon such malpractice were subject to and had to comply with the Act.</SPAN></P>

Respondent challenged the sufficiency of the evidence supporting her commitment, and her appeal from the extension of such commitment challenged only the constitutionality of the appropriate statute. The court held that while the relevant statute was not constitutionally defective, and thus the second commitment had to stand, the initial temporary commitment was in error. More specifically, the court held that the evidence presented at such hearing did not rise to a level even approaching &quot;clear and convincing&quot; proof, in part because the evidence in support of such commitment failed to reveal the testimony of at least one physician who had &quot;personally examined&quot; respondent to determine her mental condition within the meaning of Ind.

On appeal of a judgment that awarded interest to the landowners, the State contended that the interest awarded was not correctly computed. The State claimed that interest should have been paid only on the difference between the trial court's final offer and the jury's verdict and not on that amount of the verdict that represented the State's final offer to the landowners prior to initiation of the condemnation proceedings. The court held that under the operative law during the period for which the judgment awarded interest the landowners either could not withdraw the deposit at all or could do so only by posting surety. In affirming, the court ruled that Ind. Code &sect; 32-11-1-8, as amended in 1975, was not entitled to retroactive application to this matter. The court held that the landowners were not able to withdraw the deposit without posting surety therefore the no-interest provision of Ind.

Later, a new mayoral administration assumed office and notified the union that it was disaffirming the agreement. The union contended that the agreement was valid and binding. The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of the city. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that an examination of Ind. Code &sect; 18-2-1-10(b) revealed that the mayor had no authority to bind the city to an agreement fixing the salaries of patrolmen. The purpose of the statute was to vest the mayor the power to fix the salaries of employees in the administrative and executive branches of the city except for members of the police department. The Common Council had the exclusive authority to set the salaries of members of the city police department. Thus, the mayor had no statutory authority to bind the city to the collective bargaining agreement.</SPAN></P>

The court held that: (1) the controversy over the temporary wardship was moot; (2) appellants' failure to include a transcript of the evidence in the record on appeal precluded the court from determining whether appellants had standing to raise their vagueness and &quot;least restrictive means&quot; challenges to the statute; and (3) the clear and convincing standard of proof was not required for a determination of neglect or an order of permanent wardship.</SPAN></P>

The court held that there was evidence from which the trial court inferred that the deceased made the transfers for living reasons, not in contemplation of death, and that no inheritance tax was due. The court held that the trial court's appraisal of the deceased's four-tenths interest in the real property was correct because any reasonable buyer would have paid less than the fair market value because the property was encumbered by the 10-year lease that prohibited partition.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The injured party was struck with a frisbee while on school property during recess. The frisbee owner was not involved in the incident and the frisbee player had thrown the frisbee just before it struck the injured party. The injured party claimed that the school corporation and principal were liable because they failed to adopt rules that insured adequate supervision of students at recess. The trial court found that the school corporation and principal were immune from liability under the Indiana Tort Claims Act, Ind. Code Ann. &sect; 34-4-16.5-3, and granted their motion for summary judgment under Ind. R. Trial P. 54(B), 56(C). The trial court granted the frisbee owner's motion for summary judgment because he was not involved in the incident. On appeal, the court affirmed, finding that the frisbee was not a dangerous instrumentality and the frisbee owner was not connected with the injury. Since there was no support for the injured party's claim that the Tort Claims act violated the right to equal protection conferred by Ind. Const. art. 1, &sect; 23, the court held that the trial court properly granted summary judgment to the school corporation and principal.</SPAN></P>

Code &sect; 35-4.1-1-3. The court agreed with defendant's second contention. The record did not reveal that defendant was present at the commitment hearing, nor was his absence explained. The court disagreed with defendant's contention that the trial court lost jurisdiction over him by failing to sentence him for sodomy within 30 days after its finding of guilt because Ind. Code &sect; 35-8-1A-2 did not require sentencing of defendant. Defendant's commitment for treatment as a criminal sexual deviant was invalid and had to be set aside for the reason that the commitment was obtained in violation of the Criminal Sexual Deviant Act. A proper hearing should have been held to determine whether defendant was in need of treatment. Defendant was fully advised of the rights and law detailed in Ind. Code &sect; 35-4.1-1-3.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The liquor store filed a request before the local administrative board that sought to transfer a liquor license.

The matter came before the trial court for its consideration, and the trial court affirmed the decisions of the board and the commission. The liquor store again filed an appeal. The court noted that the commission did have wide powers and discretion concerning the issuance and revocation of liquor permits or license. However, the court held that the commission's broad discretion did not mean that judicial review was unavailable or that the administrative adjudication act was inapplicable. Because the liquor store did not file its appeal within 15 days, as required by Ind. Code &sect; 4-22-1-14, the trial court was without jurisdiction to hear the appeal.

The court noted that the question of self-defense was for the trier of fact, which could reject defendant's version of what happened. The court held that the jury, based on the evidence, could have rejected defendant's claim of self-defense and doubt that she thought the officer was a purse snatcher when she struck and bit him as he attempted to arrest her. The court noted that a police officer's duties to uphold the law operated on a continuing basis and his obligation to preserve the peace were not nullified by the fact that he was off duty and privately employed as a security guard at the time of the incident. The court held that the state proved that the officer was a law enforcement officer in performance of his official duties when he showed her his badge and placed her under arrest.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court adjudged the driver to be an habitual traffic offender based on his five convictions for driving under the influence of intoxicating liquor. That adjudication was affirmed on appeal. The driver filed a petition to rehear. Upon consideration, the court denied the petition. The court noted that, as made clear in Ind. Code &sect; 9-4-13-5 (1979), although &quot;penal&quot; in nature, the true nature of an habitual traffic offender proceeding was civil. As such, the court reaffirmed its prior holding that the trial court properly refused to permit the driver to collaterally attack his prior convictions in his habitual traffic offender proceeding. The court rejected the driver's argument that the habitual traffic offender adjudication was improper because one of his five convictions was not properly &quot;certified&quot; by the court of conviction. The court noted that even if that were the case, Ind. Code &sect; 9-4-13-3 (1979) required only three convictions for operating a vehicle while intoxicated for habitual traffic offender status and the driver had five. Therefore, the court held that the evidence was sufficient to support the finding that the driver was an habitual traffic offender.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the trial court's judgment for the property owners, holding that there was sufficient evidence to establish that a public highway had been established by public use pursuant to Ind. Code &sect; 8-20-1-15. The road across the farm's property had been used for more than 20 years to travel between a road and a ferry landing operated by former owners of the property owners' land. Because use as a public highway was the sole test, it was not necessary to show that the use was frequent or continuous. There was sufficient use to negate a claim of abandonment, the farm's attempts to obstruct passage were immaterial because the use continued despite the obstruction, and the facts that public authorities did not improve the highway or that it was unsuitable to vehicular traffic did not change its status. The failure of proof as to the road's original location and width did not preclude the finding of a public highway, and there was no taking of the farm's property without due process because the public highway had been established before the farm took title to the property.</SPAN></P>

On appeal the Department argued that renunciation did not affect the assessment of inheritance taxes and the renunciation statute was unconstitutional if it purported to affect the assessment of inheritance taxes. The court held that there was no transfer under the decedent's will to the executrix of the portion of the decedent's estate that she renounced and therefore there was no basis for the assessment of inheritance tax. The renounced interest was not transferred to the executrix at the decedent's death. The court also concluded that the statutory provisions in question were not unconstitutional.&nbsp;Ind.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The company was created by charter in 1851 under the provisions of the 1816 Indiana Constitution. The charter provided for an existence of 50 years. The Indiana Constitution of 1816 was superseded in 1851. In 1869 and in 1873, the Indiana General Assembly purportedly amended the act creating the company by granting to it perpetual existence. The State brought an action for a mandatory injunction against the company, claiming the charter upon which the company based its existence had expired, thereby requiring the company to comply with the regulations of the Department of Insurance. The trial court entered judgment for the State. The court affirmed, holding that the attempts by the legislature to extend the charter were null and void. The granting of a new term of existence, i.e., from a limited 50-year term to perpetual existence, was tantamount to creating a new corporation in violation of Ind. Const. art. 11, &sect; 13 (1851). Further, the creation by charter conferred special privileges and immunities upon the company in violation of Ind. Const. art. 1, &sect; 23.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Ind. Code &sect;18-5-10-29 permitted towns to annex contiguous territory. A town was required to comply with Ind.

The town enacted an ordinance to annex property at the behest of the landowners and did not give the city the opportunity to consent to the annexation. The trial court held that the consent was not required. On appeal, the court held that the consent was required as specified in Ind. Code &sect; 18-5-10-31. It rejected the town's argument that the consent requirement only applied if the town initiated the annexation. It noted that only a town was authorized to annex property, and was required to pass an ordinance to effectuate an annexation. The town then became the party seeking the annexation, and it was required to comply with &sect; 18-5-10-31. The identity of the initiator, a towns or individuals, was irrelevant. The court rejected the town's challenge to the city's standing and its claim that the appeal was not timely. It rejected the town's claims that &sect; 18-5-10-3 was unconstitutional.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When the employee turned 70 years of age, he was informed by the employer that pursuant to Ind. Code &sect; 4-15-8-2 (1976), he had to retire. The employee commenced the instant action in which he alleged that the statute created an impermissible classification based on age, infringed on an alleged fundamental right to work, and deprived him of a fundamental right to life. The employer and others filed a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted, which was granted by the trial court. On appeal, the court found that although the employee argued that the trial court erred in not affording him a chance to amend his complaint before dismissing it, the record did not indicate that the employee ever attempted to file an amended complaint. The court also found that there was a rational basis for the statute at issue. It offered an opportunity for employment and advancement of young persons, and ensured that failed mental or physical health was not a basis for retirement. However, because the case was dismissed pursuant to a Ind. R. Trial P. 12(B)(6) motion, a remand was warranted to afford the employee an opportunity to prove his allegations.</SPAN></P>

Defendant argued that the trial court erred in admitting into evidence, over his objection, of a written statement or confession made by him to two police officers. He contended that there was no valid waiver of his right to counsel as guaranteed by U.S. Const. amend. VI nor of his privilege against self-incrimination as embodied in U.S. Const. amend. V. He further argued that the admission of his co-defendant's confession that implicated defendant was erroneous. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment. The court held that in the absence of any circumstances indicating that defendant was indeed misled, his confession was properly admitted. The court ruled that the improper admission of a defendant's confession which implicated jointly tried co-defendant would have been considered harmless error beyond a reasonable doubt where co-defendant's own confession had been lawfully introduced and where it did not materially differ from that of his confederate. The court concluded that the granting of a mistrial lied largely within the discretion of the trial court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The applicant sought a license to carry a handgun pursuant to Ind. Code &sect; 35-23-4.1-5, claiming that he feared for his life and needed to carry a gun to protect himself. The Superintendent denied the permit, finding that the applicant did not have a proper reason to be licensed. On appeal, the applicant argued that the Indiana Constitution afforded him the right to bear arms for his own defense. The court held that the Ind. Const. art. 1, &sect; 32 provided the citizenry the right to bear arms for self-defense. Further, if it was determined that under Ind. Code &sect; 35-23-4.1.5 an applicant had met the conditions, the Superintendent had no discretion to withhold the license. The court determined that the applicant's assigned reason, which stood unrefuted, was constitutionally a proper reason within the meaning of &sect; 35-23-4.1-5. However, there was conflicting evidence on the applicant's suitability to be licensed and those issues were not resolved in the original determination.

The Board granted a variance to the company to permit it to conduct a liquid fertilizer sales and distribution business in conjunction with its existing liquid petroleum business. The property owners petitioned the circuit court for certiorari, and then appealed from the judgment sustaining the Board. The court affirmed the judgment. It held that the questions of reasonableness and hardship had to have in large part depended upon the rights afforded non-conforming uses under the ordinance. The property owners had not, however, on appeal or at any prior point in the proceedings made any argument or showing that the evidence did not sustain the Board's action. Nor was it contrary to law once the company's rights to its non-conforming use under the ordinance were taken into consideration.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee was suspended for three days without pay by the police chief because he allegedly had not appeared for several court dates and had allegedly caused problems in the chain of custody of evidence in one case. The employee turned in his gun and his badge, but criticized the chief's actions against him in an obscene, abusive, and threatening manner. Based on these actions, charges were filed before the Board requesting that the employee be discharged. The Board conducted a hearing and found in favor of the employee on the charges concerning appearing in court and the chain of custody problem, but found against him on the charges concerning the incident in the chief's office. The employee alleged that the Board was not legally constituted. At the time the notice was given the Board consisted of the mayor, the city attorney, and the city engineer, all members of the same political party. The employee alleged that the Board should have been bipartisan under Ind. Code &sect; 18-1-11-1, and that the bipartisan requirement of &sect; 18-1-11-1 had to be read into &sect; 18-2-1-5.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employees brought suit in mandamus to compel the payment of funds to PERF, arguing that a reduced allotment was in violation of statutory funding requirements of PERF, and that the officials acted arbitrarily and capriciously. The trial court decided in favor of the employees and ordered the payment of the sums to PERF. The appellants sought review and challenged the trial court's conclusion that the employees had standing to maintain the suit. The court held that the employees lacked standing and reversed the ruling of the trial court. The issue of standing required that the action had some adverse impact on the interests of the employees, and the employees lacked the requisite interest for challenging the actuarial soundness until a more concrete detriment existed, such as the actual failure of the city to meet its obligations. Because the trial court's findings of fact did not indicate demonstrable injury to a present and substantial interest of the complaining parties, they did not support the trial court's conclusion that the employees had standing to maintain the action. The court concluded that the trial court had no authority to decide any issues in the case.</SPAN></P>

The taxpayer hauled stone from the quarry to the plant in large carriers. The taxpayer's predecessor in interest had entered into an agreement with an Indiana county, which obligated the taxpayer to maintain that particular one-mile portion of road. The taxpayer contended that because it maintained the roadway, the roadway was not a &quot;public highway&quot; within the meaning of Ind. Code &sect; 6-6-2-2(3) (1971) of the Motor Fuel Use Tax, and hence the taxpayer was not obligated to pay the tax. The taxpayer also argued that the type of carriers it used did not fit the definition of &quot;motor vehicles&quot; within the meaning of Ind. Code &sect; 6-6-2-2(1). On appeal, the court held that the language of Ind. Code &sect; 6-6-2-4(a) was clear that the tax was imposed for the privilege of using the public highways.

The trial court dismissed the first case for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, and in the second case, the Public Service Commission approved emergency petitions filed by defendant. On appeal, the court held that plaintiff had not established that it was without access to the Commission. It should have brought its complaint there. Because plaintiff failed to do so, the court held that plaintiff failed to exhaust its administrative remedies, the necessary precursor to judicial review. Thus, the trial court properly dismissed plaintiff's first action. As to the second action, the court held that the requirements of due process were satisfied by the Commission's order affording notice and full hearing within a reasonable time and before the rule was to be made permanent. The court held that the Commission's actions were not contrary to law; the actions were adequate when viewed for the temporary and emergency nature of the action taken.

Code &sect; 31-1-11.6-1 et seq., and a writ of habeas corpus to compel the father to produce the parties' child. The father filed a counter-petition to modify the decree.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parties Hawaiian divorce decree granted the parties joint custody of their child, with the father to have physical custody subject to the mother's visitation. The decree provided that if either party left Hawaii physical custody of the child would be awarded to the mother subject to the father's visitation rights. The father moved to Indiana and took the child with him. In denying both petitions, the trial court concluded that the father retained the right to physical custody of the child in Indiana. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded. The court held that pursuant to Ind. Code &sect; 31-1-11.6-14, the trial court lacked jurisdiction over the issue of the child's custody. Under Ind. Code &sect; 31-1-11.6-3(A)(1)(A), the Hawaiian court had jurisdiction over its decree at the time the mother filed her petition in Indiana where Hawaii adopted the Act, the child lived with her mother in Hawaii for more than six months prior to the filing of her petition, and modification of the decree was permitted under Hawaiian law.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, various neighborhood residents and association, appealed a judgment from the Allen Circuit Court (Indiana), which affirmed a decision by appellee Fort Wayne City Plan Commission (plan commission) to grant the permit to build a shopping center.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Neighborhood residents surrounding property proposed to be used as a shopping center sought review of a decision from the municipal plan commission (commission) to grant a permit to build the center. On a writ of certiorari, the trial court affirmed. On appeal of that judgment, the court held that the trial court erred when it concluded that residents were not &quot;aggrieved&quot; parties; thus lacked standing under Ind. Code &sect; 18-7-5-87 (1971). However, such error was harmless because, notwithstanding its conclusion, the trial court adjudicated the residents' claims. The court then reviewed the grant of statutory power given to cities and their planning commissions under Ind. Code &sect; 18-7-5-1 et seq. (1971), and agreed with the residents that the commission exceeded its statutory authority when it granted the shopping center permit because such final approval rested with the city council. However, because the commission's approval of the development plan was supported by substantial evidence, the court affirmed much of the judgment from the trial court and remanded the case with instructions to refer the development application to the city council for its final approval.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed in part, but reversed that part of the judgment concluding that a plan commission acted within its statutory powers when it granted the shopping center permit.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property in question was zoned C-1, which did not include among its permitted uses a used car business. The proper zoning for a used car business was C-4. The property's use when the zoning ordinance was enacted was as a service station, which was classified as a C-4 use. The service station was a legal non-conforming use. This business was discontinued and the landowners commenced the used car business. The city's Building Commissioner issued an order to cease and desist operation of a used car lot. The landowners appealed the order to the Board contending that the use did not violate the ordinance and that the order was illegal. The Board affirmed the cease and desist order and the trial court affirmed the decision of the Board. The court held that the trial court erred in deciding that the ordinance did not permit a lawful non-conforming use to be changed to another non-conforming use of the same or lesser restrictions. The court held that in accordance with the applicable zoning regulations, the landowners had the right to use the property in question for a used car business as it fell within the same zoning classification as the prior lawful non-conforming use, C-4.</SPAN></P>

The firefighter alleged in his complaint that the demotion, which was to take effect upon a change of administration in the City, was politically motivated and was to be effected without giving him notice of charges and a hearing as required by an executive order issued by the former mayor. The trial court denied relief, finding that the agreement reached by the parties did not contemplate the protection of firefighters from demotions associated with a change of administration. Affirming, the court found that the order relied upon by the firefighter did not vest in him a right to continue in the rank of captain because there was no statutory authority for the proposition that the mayor, by executive order or otherwise, could have granted to firefighters the right to notice and hearing prior to demotion. Because Ind. Code Ann. &sect; 18-1-11-3 (1971) did not grant the firefighter the right to remain in his rank until demoted for cause other than politics after notice of charges and a hearing, he was not deprived of anything in an unconstitutional manner.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a consolidated appeal, four defendants challenged judgments from the Grant Circuit Court (Indiana), which convicted them of operating vehicles which exceeded the weight limitations set out in Ind. Code &sect; 9-8-1-12 (1973) and sentenced them pursuant to Ind. Code &sect; 9-8-1-13 (1973).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were convicted and each was fined in accordance with &sect; 9-8-1-13. They appealed claiming that the penalty provision of &sect; 9-8-1-13 was unconstitutional and that evidence about their vehicles' weights was admitted without proper foundation. Affirming, the court held that defendants did not demonstrate standing to raise the constitutionality of Ind. Code &sect; 9-8-1-13, as the records were devoid of evidence that they intended to refuse to pay their fines. Thus, Ind. Code &sect; 35-4.1-4-16 (1975), which provided for the incarceration of a defendant in lieu of the payment of fines and credited the prison time toward the payment of the fine at a rate of five dollars per day, did not apply. Nevertheless, the court held that Ind. Code &sect; 9-8-1-13 was not unconstitutional. The court further held that a proper foundation was laid for the admission of evidence about the vehicles' weights. There was sufficient evidence regarding the precision of the portable scales used to weigh the vehicles. Moreover, defendants presented no evidence or argument to support their contention that the portable scale technique was not an established technique.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The broker's business consisted of securing mortgage loans for home buyers and servicing the loans after mortgages were placed. The broker filed a claim for a refund of the intangible taxes it paid on those mortgages for 1971, 1972, and 1973 with the revenue department. The claim was denied. The broker then unsuccessfully filed the complaint for declaratory judgment. On appeal, the court affirmed in part and reversed in part. The court found that the broker's claim for the intangible taxes paid in 1971 was barred by the statute of limitations because it was untimely filed. However, the claims for the years 1972 and 1973 were not so barred. The court held that the broker neither owned nor controlled the intangibles, as required for taxation under the intangible tax statute. Although the broker's name appeared as the legal title holder on the mortgages until a permanent investor was found, it was not entitled to exercise any of the incidents of ownership. The broker was never in possession of the mortgages and had no discretion in how they were handled. Thus, the broker was entitled to a refund for 1972 and 1973 because it was not subject to the intangible tax paid in those years.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants appealed the judgments of the Allen Superior Court (Indiana), which convicted each of them of distributing obscene matter for consideration. The trial court held that films and magazines purchased by police officers were obscene as defined in Ind. Code &sect; 35-30-10.1-1(c) (1971, 1978 Supp.).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the court held that films and magazines that primarily featured pictures of sexual acts and genitalia were obscene because they clearly appealed to a prurient interest in sex and nudity and explicitly portrayed sexual intercourse and deviate sexual conduct in a patently offensive manner, without serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value despite the inclusion of some insignificant text. The court agreed that knowledge of the nature of the material was an essential element of the offense, but held that scienter had been shown by circumstantial evidence of defendants' daily exposure to the stock of merchandise and their activities. The court held that Ind. Code &sect; 35-30-10.1-6 (1971), which gave defendants a right to a pretrial adversary proceeding to determine if there was probable cause to find that the materials were obscene, was not void for vagueness and was satisfied when a hearing was held at the request of the state. The court held that a superior court judge's ruling in another case that the obscenity statute violated equal protection was binding only on the parties to that case and did not trigger stare decisis or strike down the statute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff deputy sheriff appealed a judgment of the Jefferson Circuit Court (Indiana), which affirmed the decision of defendant Sheriff's Merit Board of Jefferson County that he had effectively resigned by failing to file, upon his return from a leave of absence, a physical examination report, in compliance with Jefferson County, Ind., Police Merit Bd. R. &amp; Regs. &sect; K, para. 4. A hearing was not held until almost a year after termination.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">With the intention of complying with the Merit Board rule, the deputy submitted to the examination. The report, which indicated that he was &quot;employable,&quot; never officially came into the sheriff's possession. The trial court first found that there was substantial evidence to support the administrative decision. On appeal, the court affirmed this finding. It also affirmed the trial court's decision that the deputy waived any procedural defects and that he received a fair public hearing because he had stipulated away his claim that the notice of termination was insufficient. The trial court also held that the Merit Board rule was not unconstitutionally vague. The court affirmed as to this issue because the deputy had waived the issue by failing to present a cogent argument on appeal. The court agreed with the deputy, however, that he had been terminated in violation of Ind. Code Ann. &sect; 17-3-14-7 (1971) and Jefferson County, Ind., Police Dep't R. &amp; Regs. &sect; 3.c, which provided that there could be no discharge without appropriate due process, including a prior hearing. The court held that an &quot;automatic resignation,&quot; as set forth in the Merit Board rule, was tantamount to a discharge.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed as to three issues, but reversed as to the &quot;automatic resignation&quot; issue upon which the trial court had found that the Merit Board rule did not deprive the deputy of due process. It remanded the cause with instructions to award back pay for the period during which the deputy had been discharged without a hearing. Upon compliance of the order, the judgment, as corrected, would stand in all things affirmed and approved.</SPAN></P>

Obscenity was not within the area of constitutionally protected speech or press. Defendant did not demonstrate an infringement upon any First Amendment guarantees. The legal definition of obscenity in &sect; 35-30-10.1-1 did not change with each indictment. It was a term sufficiently specific to provide adequate notice of proscribed conduct. Defendant failed to demonstrate that no rational basis existed for the different treatment of the exempt class and did not show any identity of interest between the exempt class and the nonexemptions.

The Lake Superior Court, Civil Division (Indiana), granted the petition and allowed the detainees to name appellants, the County's commissioners, common council, and auditor, as additional parties. Appellants sought further review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In their petition, the detainees alleged that they had been subjected to beatings, deprivation of food, detention in solitary cells without bedding, and punishment without due process of law and that their rights to medical care and visitation had been denied. The trial court granted the petition and ordered the sheriff to make extensive changes. The trial court allowed the detainees to amend their petition to include the County's commissioners, common council, and auditor after the sheriff protested that he could not comply with the trial court's order without additional funding from the County. Appellants argued on appeal that the detainees could not use a writ of habeas corpus to challenge illegal and unconstitutional conditions of their otherwise lawful detention. The court agreed. The detainees did not challenge the legality of their restraint; they merely alleged that they were entitled to a change in the conditions of their confinement. Indiana only allowed habeas corpus to be used to inquire into the legality of the cause of a restraint. The detainees had to seek relief through either a writ of mandate or a civil rights action under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property buyers entered into a conditional sales contract for the purchase of a property, paid the property taxes and insurance, then attempted to file an affidavit of mortgage indebtedness with the county auditor in order to qualify for the mortgage tax deduction The auditor denied the application and the buyers appealed to the board, which ruled against them. In the buyers' action, the trial court granted appellees summary judgment. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that the mortgage tax deduction provision was clear and unambiguous and therefore not subject to interpretation. The court found that the deduction was granted to persons who owned real property, and that Ind. Code &sect; 6-1.1-1-9 defined &quot;owner&quot; as the person who held legal title in fee or the mortgagee in possession. The court concluded that inasmuch as the buyers did not have legal title in fee, nor were they mortgagees, they were not &quot;owners&quot; within the meaning of the mortgage tax deduction provision. The court compared the tax deduction provision with a provision relating to homestead credits, and noted that where the legislature intended a provision to apply to contract buyers, it knew how to do so.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant inmate sought review of a judgment of the Marion Criminal Court, Division Three (Indiana), which denied his petition for post-conviction relief. The inmate claimed in part that his guilty plea to an offense committed while he was on parole was not properly accepted under Ind. Code &sect; 35-4.1-1-3(d) (1971) because he was not advised that the parole board might have set him back to serve a portion of his former sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the inmate pleaded guilty to a crime that he committed while on parole, the parole board set him back, which meant that it ordered him to serve a portion of his former sentence before beginning to serve time under his new sentence. In the instant appeal, the inmate challenged the acceptance of his guilty plea; he also claimed that the statute under which the parole board acted, Ind. Code &sect; 11-1-1-11 (1971), was unconstitutional. In affirming, the court ruled that the statute was constitutional and that the parole board had almost absolute discretion to act without interference by a court. The court also ruled that there was no obligation to advise the inmate when he pleaded guilty of the possibility of being set back. Ind. Code &sect; 35-4.1-1-3(d) did not require advising someone of the effect of prior convictions unless they bore directly on the length of the sentence for the new offense. The court also rejected the inmate's claim that he received an inadequate parole revocation hearing, ruling that although his alleged injury might have been of constitutional proportions, no reversal was required because he failed to show that he had any evidence to present in mitigation.</SPAN></P>

Defendants appealed and asserted that the evidence did not sustain their convictions, that the trial court erred when it refused to suppress evidence obtained by an insurance investigator during a warrantless search of the burned house, and that Ind.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The home of defendant one was destroyed by fire. The State charged defendant one and her father, defendant two, with arson. The case was based on circumstantial evidence. The State proved that defendant one had removed all of her personal possessions and had arranged for the home's other occupants to be away from the home on the day of the fire. The State showed that defendant one had lied concerning the loss of her personal possessions and concerning her whereabouts at the time the fire started. Gasoline cans purchased and filled by defendant two were found nearby. The State also introduced evidence obtained by an insurance investigator, who had conducted a warrantless search of the home after the fire. In affirming, the court noted that the investigator's search was not performed by a government agent and was, therefore, not subject to the illegal fruits doctrine. Although circumstantial, the evidence was sufficient to support defendants' conviction. Defendants had no right to a suspended sentence.  Ind. Code &sect; 35-7-1-1 was not unconstitutional merely because it permitted the suspension of sentences for other crimes but not for arson.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellees, the Indiana Education Employment Relations Board (IEERB) and the teachers, filed petitions for hearing of the judgment finding that IEERB was without power to make final reinstatement orders. Appellant Board of School Trustees of Worthington-Jefferson Consolidated School Corporation opposed the petition for rehearing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The teachers sought reinstatement in their positions with the Board. The court held that the IEERB was not statutorily-authorized to issue a final reinstatement order. The teachers and the IEERB filed the petition for a rehearing of the decision. The court denied the petitions, concluding that its earlier interpretation of Ind. Code &sect; 20-7.5-1-11 (1971) was correct. That provision contained no language which could reasonably have been construed to grant the IEERB the power to issue final orders reinstating aggrieved teachers with or without back pay. The court also found that Ind. Code &sect;&sect; 20-7.5-1-11(a), (b) (1971), which used the term &quot;remediable,&quot; did not conclusively resolve the issue. The sections might merely have indicated that the IEERB was authorized to decide whether or not a school employee was aggrieved by an unfair labor practice. The language did not describe with sufficient specificity IEERB authority to issue final reinstatement orders. The legislature easily could have done so through enactments. Finally, the court held that the trial court was authorized to award back pay in the case.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Vanderburgh Circuit Court (Indiana) convicted defendant of reckless homicide in violation of Ind. Code &sect; 35-42-1-5. Defendant appealed and asserted that the evidence was insufficient to support the conviction, that the penalty provision of &sect; 35-42-1-5 was unconstitutional, and that the trial court had erred in failing his request to instruct the jury on the crime of recklessness as defined in Ind. Code &sect; 35-42-2-2.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">What had begun as roughhousing between defendant and the victim escalated; defendant wrestled a gun away from the victim and shot him. On appeal, defendant argued that the evidence did not prove that he had acted recklessly as defined in Ind. Code &sect; 35-41-2-2(c). He argued that the reckless homicide statute was unconstitutional because it imposed different penalties depending upon the instrumentality involved in the death. He also claimed that the jury should have been instructed on a lesser-included offense, the crime of recklessness. In affirming, the court held that the evidence was sufficient to support the jury's verdict; defendant clearly should have realized that he was putting the victim's life in danger when he seized and fired the gun at him. The reckless homicide statute was constitutional. The legislature had authority to establish and define criminal offenses; it had a legitimate basis for imposing higher penalties for reckless homicides caused by deadly weapons. The trial court properly focused its jury instructions on the murder charge. The crime of recklessness applied to bodily injury only; it was not applicable under the facts of the case.</SPAN></P>

The taxpayer was the successor to the parent corporation and filed an action seeking a refund of taxes paid, arguing that under Ind. Code &sect; 6-2-1-14, the income derived from the sales of its services to its affiliates could be eliminated from the gross income computation. The trial court entered judgment in favor of the taxpayer and the Department appealed. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment. An amendment was made to &sect; 6-2-1-14 after the action was filed which made it clear that the income could be eliminated from gross income. However, the amendment did not change the meaning of the statute but merely expressed the original intent more clearly. The income received from sales of services generated from a source outside the corporation was taxed under other provisions. The Department's distinction under the statute was unreasonable because it treated certain receipts as income and eliminated others from income merely because the acts generating the receipts differed.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was found guilty of the charged crime. Defendant contended that &sect; 35-1-55-2 was unconstitutionally vague. On appeal, the court affirmed the conviction and held that any ordinarily intelligent parent having not lawful custody of one's child who took the child with the intent to detain the child from the law-endowed custodial parent knew that he was committing a crime. The court ruled that it could not reasonably assume that the legislature would exempt a transgressing parent from what otherwise would constitute an act of child stealing by any other person. The court held that defendant's conduct was such that he either took, led, or carried away his son from the lawful custodial parent with the intent to detain or conceal the child.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, defendant argued that the trial court (1) erred in ordering that the sentence for the possession of burglary tools offense and for another offense committed while he was released on appeal bond were to run consecutively pursuant to former Ind. Code &sect; 35-8-7.5-1; and (2) erred in not vacating his conviction and sentence for possession of burglary tools in light of the repeal of Ind. Code &sect; 35-13-8-1. Upon review, the court found defendant's argument without merit. Defendant was not deprived of any right which he had at the time he committed the crime of possession of burglary tools on June 24, 1975. Regardless of the applicability of former Ind. Code &sect; 35-8-7.5-1, defendant had to serve the sentence he received for that crime before he could have been released. Defendant was not deprived of any right he had at the time he committed the crime of entering to commit a felony by having to serve his sentence for that crime consecutively to his sentence for possession of burglary tools. He had more than an adequate opportunity to modify his behavior so that he would not commit an offense for which he would have to serve a sentence consecutively to another sentence.</SPAN></P>

The trial court's judgment was correct insofar as it determined that the estate was liable to the State for those maintenance charges of which the decedent had timely notice of the State's determination to consider him liable for such costs. However, the State failed to prove by sufficient evidence that the decedent received the notice required to establish the liability of his estate for the son's maintenance costs prior to October 21, 1966. The failure of proof of the decedent's liability for the son's maintenance costs prior to October 21, 1966, mandated the court's agreement with the estate's contention that the trial court's award of recovery to the State was excessive.</SPAN></P>

Defendant also argued that the trial court erred by refusing to give a requested instruction that absolved defendant of liability if the jury found that defendant did not personally distribute the materials. The court held that the requested instruction did not correctly state the law, finding that the legislature did not mean to exclude all those with a financial, managerial, or proprietary interest in the distribution process from liability because they did not directly sell the material. Defendant also alleged that there was insufficient evidence to show that he knew the specific content of the purchased material. The court held that defendant's knowledge could be inferred from evidence showing that the adult bookstore posted the typical warning notices, that defendant ordered inventory and looked through some magazines, and that the covers of the matter depicted sexual activity.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A police officer fatally shot an individual who was attempting to flee from the scene of a second-degree burglary. The mother of the individual filed an action for wrongful death against the city which employed the police officer. A jury returned a verdict in favor of the city and the mother sought review, contending that the statute under which the officer acted was unconstitutional, that the trial court refused to proceed under the federal rules of evidence, the trial court refused to allow testimony of another shooting incident two years after her son was shot, that statements from the deceased were wrongfully prohibited. On appeal, the court held that: (1) the constitutionality of the statute would not be considered because the officer was justified in relying on its presumptive constitutionality; (2) it was not error to deny the mother's request to use the federal rules; (3) the later shooting incident was properly excluded because the mother failed to establish similar conditions in both incidents; and (4) statements made by her son after he was shot were properly excluded.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant landfill challenged an order of the Howard Superior Court (Indiana) that held valid a local ordinance that regulated the collection and disposal of garbage. The landfill claimed that Indiana had preempted the field of sanitary landfill regulation; that the ordinance encroached upon the statutory powers of the Howard County Board of Zoning Appeals; and that the ordinance violated the due process and equal protection clauses.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A local ordinance regulating the disposal and collection of trash was passed and the landfill sought a declaratory judgment declaring the ordinance void. The trial court found the ordinance valid and the landfill sought review. On review, the court invalidated &quot;only&quot; the part of the local ordinance. The court found that the invalid portions of the ordinance were &quot;sufficiently severable&quot; from the valid parts. The court found that the portion of the ordinance that addressed landfill site approval was invalid and violated the due process clause of the U.S. and the Indiana Constitutions. The court reasoned that it failed to set forth any standard for its application. The court also found that the local government regulation of landfills was not preempted by the 1972 Environmental Management Act (EMA), Ind. Code &sect;&sect; 13-7-1-1 to 13-7-8-1. The court reasoned that Ind. Code &sect; 17-2-22-4 allowed appellee county commissioners to retain specific powers to adopt ordinances dealing with solid waste disposal. The court indicated that this was an indication that the EMA was never intended to preempt the field of solid waste disposal from local regulation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court to the extent that it upheld the validity of the part of the ordinance that addressed land fill site approval. The court affirmed the validity of the ordinance in all other respects.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the bargaining unit and the board claimed that the lower court lacked jurisdiction to issue an injunction preventing the holding of an election and that the board's decision that a certain election contract was no longer in effect was improperly reversed. The bargaining agent countered that the board's order impaired its contract rights and that res judicata controlled on that issue. The court affirmed the lower court's judgment in favor of the bargaining agent. The court held that the lower court had subject matter jurisdiction over the action. The board's order that the election agreement was no longer in effect was not final, and thus the bargaining agent did not err by not following the judicial review provisions of Ind. Code &sect; 4-22-1-14 (1976). Moreover, the bargaining agent showed that the board's order would cause it irreparable injury. Thus, judicial review was not premature because the exhaustion requirement was excused. Finally, the lower court did not err in reversing the board's order because res judicata barred the relitigation of the election agreement's continuing validity.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant physician sought review of an order from the Marion Superior Court (Indiana) dismissing his complaint for an injunction to delay a hearing and for a declaratory judgment that the scheduled hearing would violate several constitutional guarantees. Appellees, medical licensing board and its members (board), scheduled the hearing to determine whether the physician's medical license should be revoked.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The board alleged that the physician violated Ind. Code &sect; 25-22.5-6-2 by illegally issuing controlled substances prescriptions to female patients in exchange for sexual acts. The physician argued that he should be allowed to bypass the normal review procedure because he raised pure questions of law concerning constitutional issues. The court affirmed the order, concluding that the trial court properly dismissed the action on the basis that the physician did not exhaust his administrative remedies. The court found that the Administrative Adjudication Act (Act), Ind. Code &sect; 4-22-1-1 et seq., afforded the physician an adequate administrative procedure and review. The court determined that the Act restricted access to the courts even where the administrative agency took action affecting constitutional rights. Because the physician could not demonstrate that he was entitled to equitable or extraordinary relief, he was limited by the Act to the prescribed procedure for judicial review. The court found that the physician was not entitled to either injunctive relief or the remedy of declaratory judgment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the order that dismissed the physician's complaint for an injunction to delay a hearing and for a declaratory judgment that the scheduled hearing would violate several constitutional guarantees.</SPAN></P>
