</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The taxpayer was a disabled World War II veteran who had owned real property in the county since 1980. The taxpayer received monthly compensation by the Veterans Administration for the loss of, or the loss of use of, one or more limbs. In 1990, the taxpayer sought an exemption based on his disability. The county exempted the taxpayer from 1989 taxes to be continued on a year-to-year basis. The county judge denied the taxpayer's request for a refund for tax years 1980 through 1986, but granted a refund for 1987 and 1988. The taxpayer filed a petition for declaratory relief and mandamus to direct the county judge to refund property taxes paid for the years 1980 through 1986. The county judge responded that the taxpayer had not claimed the necessary exemptions and was barred from seeking a refund by the three-year limitations period. The court reversed the circuit court's judgment for the taxpayer, holding that the taxpayer voluntarily paid his taxes for the years 1980 through 1986 and claimed no exemption. He was presumed to have known the law and his rights under the law.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The State appealed an order from the Pulaski Circuit Court (Arkansas), which found that defendant was guilty of possession of drug paraphernalia with intent to use, that he was a habitual offender with more than one but less than four felony convictions. The court sentenced defendant to six years in prison but suspended imposition of five of those six years.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of possession of drug paraphernalia with intent to use and found to be a habitual offender with more than one but less than four felony convictions. The trial court imposed the minimum six-year sentence but suspended five of the six years. The State appealed, contending the trial court had no authority to suspend any period of the mandatory minimum sentence. The court agreed, holding that: (1) under Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 5-4-104 (1987), the trial court was mandated not to suspend imposition of defendant's sentence; (2) the trial court did not have any inherent authority to suspend imposition of the sentence; (3) it was for the legislature to determine the kind of conduct that constituted a crime and the nature and extent of punishment that could be imposed; (4) sentencing in Arkansas was entirely a matter of statute; and (5) the legislated minimum sentences for habitual offenders were mandatory.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the trial court's suspension of five of the six-year sentence and remanded the cause with directions for trial court's commitment order to be corrected to impose the mandatory six-year sentence and to delete any reference to suspension of any portion of that sentence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The property owner alleged that part of her tract was landlocked from the nearest city street by the adjacent landowners' tract. The property owner filed a petition, pursuant to Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 27-66-401 (1987), to establish a private road across the adjacent landowners' tract. The county court held that it was without jurisdiction to open a private road within the city limits and the circuit court affirmed. The property owner appealed. Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 27-66-401(1987) authorized the county to establish a private road out of a landlocked tract. Ark. Const. art. 7, &sect; 28 provided that the county court had exclusive jurisdiction in all matters related to county roads. The court held that the county court had the power of eminent domain to create a road when there was a landlocked tract. The circuit court and the county court erred in determining that the trial court did not have jurisdiction over county roads. The cause was remanded for a determination on the merits.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 16-114-203 (1987). The court reasoned that there was no precedent in support of the theory that the patient's continued ingestion of the medicine that the physician prescribed established an on-going course of treatment for the purpose of applying the continuous treatment doctrine. The court also held that the physician's alleged negligence occurred when he prescribed the patient's medicine and that she did not have any further direct or indirect contact with him until she went to see him more than two years after that alleged negligence occurred.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant taxpayers sought review of a judgment from the Washington Chancery Court (Arkansas), which denied them relief in their illegal action suit against appellees, the city and a trust company.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On appeal, the taxpayers argued, inter alia, that (1) 1981 Ark. Acts 25 was either repealed or unconstitutional; (2) the chancellor erroneously construed Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 14-164-338 (Supp. 1991); and (3) the trial court erred in ruling that the tax was valid even through the voters approved the tax at the same time they approved issuing $ 10,000,000 in bonds for the school district. Upon review, the court held that the trial court erred in denying the taxpayers relief in the illegal exaction suit. The vote on the tax and the vote on the school district bonds were inextricably linked, and the school district bonds were, at the least, a primary purpose of the tax. Three years after the favorable vote on the two proposals, the city admitted that the proceeds from the tax could not have been used to issue the $ 10,000,000 in school bonds. An illegal exaction occurred when a primary purpose of the tax could not be accomplished and the collection of the tax was continued.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the ruling of the trial court and remanded the matter for the chancellor to enjoin the further collection of the tax. In addition, the chancellor was instructed to conduct a hearing to award an attorney's fee, and to determine whether the city or the trust company had any funds that rightfully belonged to the taxpayers.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After an indigent was found not guilty, appellee, the indigent's appointed counsel, brought a motion for certification of attorney's fees and expenses in the Independence Circuit Court (Arkansas). The circuit court certified an award, finding that appellee county was liable for $ 450 of counsel's fees and costs and that appellant, the State of Arkansas, was liable for the remainder. The State sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The issue on appeal concerned the allocation of liability for the fees. The State contended that, under Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 16-92-108 (1987), the county was primarily liable for the fees and that, under Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 14-20-102 (Supp. 1991), because the county established a fund for indigent costs, the county was responsible for all of the fees. The court had previously found that Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 16-92-108(b) was unconstitutional because it unlawfully capped fees. The court found that it was necessary to invalidate the entire statute because the sections of &sect; 16-92-108 were interwoven and the entire statute revolved around the fee caps. Further, the court found that a county ordinance, Independence County, Ark., Ordinance no. 419-86, which established the indigent cost fund, pursuant to Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 14-20-102, was also completely invalid because the fee caps were an integral part of the ordinance. By invalidating the ordinance and Ark. Code. Ann. &sect; 16-92-108, there was no statutory authority requiring the county to pay the fees. Because payment of counsel for indigents was constitutionally required, the State alone was liable for payment of the counsel's fees and expenses.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court modified the trial court's order of payment to place the full responsibility of payment on the State. The order was otherwise affirmed and remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

The property owners appealed. The circuit court found that the property owners were not entitled to any damages. The court affirmed.

On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's decision. The court held that the trial court did not err in denying defendant's motion to suppress his in-custody statement because of an alleged mental illness. The court found that a state hospital examination of defendant found no indication of psychosis. The court noted that defendant had been incarcerated for two days at the time he gave his statement. Police testified that defendant had signed his rights waiver and told the officers that he would talk to them without a lawyer present.

The court found that the center had not met that burden given that substantial evidence existed for the board's findings with regard to staffing, overcapacity, and other matters. Furthermore, &sect; 102 of the Minimum Licensing Requirement for Child Care Centers was not vague because it clearly stated that total compliance with staffing ratios was needed in order for a child care center to be in substantial compliance with the department's requirements.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">At an omnibus hearing, defendant offered evidence of the alleged victim's allegations against others. Both of the other men accused earlier testified at the hearing and denied the incidents.

The State objected to the evidence on the basis of the rape-shield law, Ark.

The mother had a son nine months from the alleged date of conception and claimed that the father was the child's father. The mother brought a paternity suit in the juvenile division of chancery court. The parties agreed prior to trial that a blood test would be administered to determine paternity and that the test would be admissible at trial. The test showed a 99.59 percent probability that he was the father. Based on the results of the blood test, coupled with the mother's testimony, the chancellor determined him to be the natural father. On appeal, the court affirmed the decision. The court held that jurisdiction was proper. The father had voluntarily agreed that the blood test would be admissible in evidence and that he signed the form authorizing the test to be administered. The court found that the evidence was clearly sufficient to establish paternity and that there was insufficient evidence to rebut the presumption of paternity.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The circuit court found that appellants' petitions should have contained the statutory notice and further that a public hearing should have been held prior to the election. On appeal, the court noted that Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 14-86-203 (1987) provided two methods for establishing fire protection districts outside of cities and towns, which was the case here. Neither method required a public hearing prior to an election. The court also noted that the notice specified in Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 14-86-201(a) (1987) informed potential voters that if the district was formed, they could be charged for the costs of the improvements. However, appellants' petitions did set out the maximum assessments that could be levied on various categories of lands if the voters approved establishment of the district. Moreover, assuming that the statutory notice was required, the failure to provide such a notice was not a sufficient basis to void the election. Election law provisions were mandatory before the election was held but only directory afterward. Also, there was no prejudice because appellants' petitions contained more information than that required by the statutory notice.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant, a juvenile, appealed a decision of the Clay Chancery Court (Arkansas), which adjudged defendant to be a delinquent juvenile based on his violation of a statute prohibiting minors from possessing intoxicants and denied defendant's driving privileges for one year, with the exception of driving to and from work and school. Defendant argued that the trial court violated his equal protection rights in applying the juvenile code.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued that the juvenile code was unconstitutional and that its use should have been enjoined because it subjected juvenile offenders to more severe penalties than adults were subjected to for violating the same statutes. On appeal, the court did not reach the merits of that claim because defendant was not sentenced under the juvenile code. Rather, defendant was cited as a minor in possession of intoxicating liquor which carried a penalty of suspended driving privileges under Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 5-64-710 (1987), in addition to all other penalties. Further, there was no delinquency disposition as provided for in Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 9-27-330 (1987), the statute that defendant claimed was unconstitutional in its application to juveniles. Thus, &sect; 9-27-330 had no impact on defendant, and, as such, he had no standing to challenge it. Accordingly, the trial court's refusal to enjoin the use of the juvenile code was affirmed. Further, &sect; 9-27-303(11) was not facially void for vagueness in its &quot;juvenile offender&quot; definition because the statute clearly set out the age of a juvenile offender as well as the proscribed acts. Finally, there was no merit to defendant's remaining contentions.</SPAN></P>

The officer administered field sobriety tests and based on her results, arrested defendant for DWI. Defendant began yelling and cursing, and kicked the officer. She refused to take a breathalyzer test and demanded to be taken to the hospital for a blood test. The officer did not take her for the blood test because she was too combative and abusive. Defendant was convicted in the municipal court of DWI, disorderly conduct, violation of the implied consent law, and speeding. In a de novo bench trial in the circuit court, defendant was convicted of all of the charges, except speeding. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded for a new trial. The court held that defendant never waived her right to a jury pursuant to Ark. Const. art. II, &sect; 7. That right could not be forfeited by her inaction, so her failure to request a jury was not a forfeiture of her right. The court held that there was no requirement that an independent chemical test be afforded defendant under Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 5-65-204(e) (Supp. 1991) after she refused to take the police breathalyzer test.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant, a habitual offender, shot and killed a police officer. A jury convicted him of first-degree murder and felon-in-possession-of-a-firearm, for which he was sentenced to life imprisonment on the murder conviction and six years for possession of a firearm. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment of conviction. Even thought the trial court erred in failing to sever the murder charge from the felon-in-possession charge, the error was harmless because defendant failed to request curative relief. The trial court did not err in allowing the prosecution to introduce unsigned judgments of defendant's past felony convictions during the sentencing phase. Failure to sign the past judgments did not, in itself, demonstrate that they were invalid. The prosecutor's conduct in making remarks relating to cocaine and homosexuality was not so drastic as to warrant a mistrial, and any potential prejudice was cured by the admonition to the jury, as requested by defense counsel. The court rejected the argument that Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 5-2-207 (1987), which provided that voluntary intoxication was not an affirmative defense, was unconstitutional. .</SPAN></P>

The court found that the ballot title was sufficient and issued a mandate to that effect. The court stated that a ballot title had to convey an intelligible idea of the scope and import of a proposed law. The attorney general's approval of a ballot title created a presumption as to its sufficiency. Moreover, a liberal construction of Ark. Const. amend. VII was utilized when the sufficiency of a ballot title was challenged. The court found that the ballot title clearly designated the offices subject to the term limitation proposal and that its terms were not misleading. The court refused to address the constitutionality of the proposal because it believed that such action would constitute a advisory opinion.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant and an accomplice robbed and beat to death a couple for whom defendant had done yard work. After a jury trial, defendant was convicted of two counts of capital felony murder. After defendant's conviction was affirmed, he filed a pro se petition seeking permission to proceed in the circuit court with his request for post-conviction relief. Defendant argued that the use of one robbery as the underlying felony for two counts of capital felony murder subjected him to double jeopardy. Defendant made several other claims, including that he had ineffective assistance of counsel. The court determined that Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 5-10-101(a)(1)(1987), which defined capital murder, was not violated by defendant's convictions because he was not convicted of any count of aggravated robbery. Defendant's claimed instances of ineffective assistance of counsel were actually strategy decisions by counsel and did not meet the necessary standards to prove that counsel's assistance was ineffective.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Police stopped defendant, a motorist, and asked permission to search her vehicle. Her purse contained cocaine and a loaded automatic pistol. The trial court ruled that the stop was illegal. On appeal, the State argued that the question was whether the trial court correctly interpreted the ordinance in light of its findings, rather than a problem of search and seizure under the Fourth Amendment. The court reversed and remanded. It did not agree that it was the State's obligation to prove that defendant acted in disregard of persons or property. Defendant's proof was directed, not toward the ordinance involved, but to whether she had consented to the search, an issue the trial court did not reach. The court noted that it was incumbent on defendant to establish grounds for the suppression of the evidence seized by the State. The court determined that the State did not have to prove, in addition to the offending conduct charged, that particular persons or property were affected thereby. The court concluded that the proof was essentially unchallenged that defendant's driving came within the prohibition of the ordinance, and thus, there was probable cause to stop and investigate.</SPAN></P>

Defendant registered .11 percent, by weight, of alcohol in his blood. Defendant was charged by citation with &quot;D.W.I. 5-65-103.&quot; The circuit court excluded the evidence of the breathalyzer test because there was no evidence the machine used to perform the test had been timely calibrated, but still found defendant guilty of driving while intoxicated.

The court held that the city had no authority for what it attempted to do because the statute did not directly authorize taking land without compensation, nor did it authorize the trading of a waiver of a zoning fire safety requirement for a right of way dedication.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In appellant's suit challenging the validity of emergency ordinance number 0-90-7, appellees' motion for summary judgment was granted. On appeal, appellant contended that the validity of the ordinance was a genuine issue of material fact to be litigated. The court found that the county had admitted that on April 24, 1990, it had enacted an emergency ordinance providing for the opening and closing of graves without charge. There being no material questions of fact at issue, the chancellor was left to apply the applicable statutes. The county operated within the statutory framework of enacting an emergency ordinance; therefore, the ordinance complied with Arkansas Code Ann. &sect; 14-14-908 (1987) and was not clearly in violation of the state or federal constitutions. Appellant also argued that the construction and constitutionality of Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 14-14-802 (1987) was a genuine issue of material fact. The court found that the State had a recognized legitimate governmental interest in the provision of burial services. The ordinance provided burial services for the health, safety, and welfare of the county's citizens. Section 14-14-802 was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant Arkansas Department of Human Services (department) challenged the decision of the Pulaski Chancery Court, Second Division (Arkansas) in favor of appellee guardian. The guardian represented a ward, who was a retarded adult woman. The court denied the department's claim against the assets of the ward as a result of the ward becoming the beneficiary of both the principal and income of a trust.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The department first decided that the ward was no longer entitled to Medicaid benefits as a result of the trust. The trustee then sent the income from the trust to the department, and the ward remained in the facility she had lived for many years. However, the department thereafter made a claim against the trustee for the past care of the ward. The claim exceeded the total assets of the trust. The court reversed the judgment of the trial court and remanded the case, holding that the trial court erred in failing to join the guardian and the bank, as the successor trustees, as parties to the cause of action. The court held that in the declaratory judgment action, complete relief could not be afforded without making the lifetime beneficiary and the remainder beneficiaries parties to the action and that the interests of the guardian and the remaindermen conflicted as well as the interests of the guardian and the department, because if all of the principal and income were paid on behalf of the ward, the remaindermen received nothing, or if the department's request for payment of the debt was granted, nothing was left for the ward or the remainderman.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The State appealed from a judgment of the Faulkner Circuit Court (Arkansas), which dismissed the charges against each of them for operating a gambling house, as defined in Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 5-66-103(a) (1987). Defendants filed similar motions to dismiss the charges, and the trial court agreed to decide the motions simultaneously. After oral argument, the trial court granted defendants' motions to dismiss, finding both statutes unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants' motions to dismiss submitted below argued that Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 5-66-103(a) (1987), which prohibited keeping or operating a gambling house or a place where gambling was carried on, was unconstitutionally vague and overbroad. They also challenged as unconstitutional&nbsp;Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 5-66-101 (1987), which provided that statutes prohibiting gambling were to be liberally construed. The circuit court found both statutes unconstitutional. On the State's appeal pursuant to Ark. Sup. Ct. &amp; Ct. App. R. 29(1)(c) and Ark. R. Crim. P. 36.10(b), (c), the court reversed. The words &quot;gambling&quot; and &quot;gambling house&quot; were not unconstitutionally vague because the Arkansas Supreme Court had previously defined the terms in case law. Under those definitions, defendants, charged with operating establishments where money and risk were plainly involved, had fair warning that their actions were prohibited. While defendants also argued that the statute was overbroad, the circuit court did not rule on that issue. The court declined to address Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 5-66-101 (1987) as it was unnecessary to resort to the construction statute when no ambiguity was found in Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 5-66-103 (1987).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court held that the trial court erroneously dismissed the charges against defendants for operating a gambling house, and erred in holding that the statute defining the criminal offense was unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The parents contended that appellees knew or should have known of the presence of friable asbestos in their children's elementary school and failed and refused to correct the condition and to protect the students and staff from the dangers of exposure. The trial court granted appellees' motion to dismiss and the parents appealed. On appeal, the court reversed the dismissal of the parents' claims for outrage and negligence and affirmed the dismissal of the 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 claim. In so doing, the court found that (1) the parents' allegations that appellees purposefully deceived the parents as to the condition of the asbestos in order not to disrupt school routine stated a cause of action for outrage; (2) Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 21-9-301 did not provide immunity for the intentional acts of appellees; (3) the complaint sufficiently alleged the parents' right to recover for the negligence of appellees pursuant to an insurance policy that was required for such acts; and (4) appellees' actions did not amount to established policy or custom sufficient to impose liability under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of the rape of his three-year-old niece, and he appealed, asserting that the trial court erred in admitting the out-of-court statements of the victim to her mother, a nurse, and a policeman under Ark. R. Evid. 803(25). He urged that Rule 803(25) violated the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment of the United States Constitution. The court agreed and reversed. It held that Rule 803(25) deprived the accused of his right of confrontation because it provided that the hearsay statement of a child was admissible upon showing only that it possessed a &quot;reasonable likelihood of trustworthiness,&quot; which was a lesser standard than the Confrontation Clause required. The child's statements to her mother and the nurse were independently admissible under the hearsay exceptions for an excited utterance and a statement made in the course of medical treatment. But, the statement to the policeman was not admissible as a deeply rooted exception to the hearsay rule, and its admission under Rule 803(25) violated defendant's constitutional rights. The error was not harmless because the police officer's hearsay testimony was the only direct evidence of sexual penetration.</SPAN></P>

The citizens brought this mandamus action against the county assessor to correct the assessment rolls. The county assessor moved to dismiss the cause for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, and the circuit court granted the motion. The court affirmed upon appeal. The court noted that, under art. 7, &sect; 28, of the Arkansas Constitution, the county courts had exclusive original jurisdiction over county tax matters. The court determined that, although Ark.

Defendant contended that the evidence was insufficient to convict him and that the trial court erred in not allowing him to impeach a witness with prior statements made by the witness and in denying his motion for a change of venue.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The victim, a sixteen-year-old, was last seen driving a 1986 red Ford Ranger. Two days after his body was found, a patrolman in Plano, Texas, pulled over the driver of a 1986 red Ford Ranger. The driver told the patrolman that he spent the weekend with defendant in Arkansas and that on the day the victim disappeared, defendant showed up with the red truck. The Plano police obtained a search warrant and found a gun in defendant's apartment that was identified as the murder weapon. The driver eventually pled guilty to capital murder and testified against defendant. Defendant was convicted of capital felony murder. On appeal, the court held that: (1) defendant waived his right to challenge the sufficiency of the evidence by failing to move for a directed verdict at the close of the case; (2) where defendant failed to obtain a ruling on the admissibility of the driver's testimony as to statements made to the police, he was precluded from raising the issue on appeal; and (3) where the jurors were polled and stated they would be able to give defendant a fair trial and follow the instructions of the court, the trial court did not err in refusing defendant's motion for change of venue.</SPAN></P>

The cleaner obtained a prejudgment attachment order against the owners, although the prejudgment attachment laws had been ruled unconstitutional three years before. The Garland Circuit-Chancery Court (Arkansas) denied the owners' motion for sanctions against the cleaner under Ark. R. Civ. P. 11. The owners appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court denied the Ark. R. Civ. P. 11 sanctions on the ground that the cleaner did not file its prejudgment attachment action for an improper purpose and that neither the cleaner nor the trial court had known that the Arkansas Supreme Court had ruled that the prejudgment attachment laws were unconstitutional. The court held that the trial court's finding that the prejudgment attachment action was not filed for an improper purpose fell far short of absolving the cleaner's counsel from sanctions. Furthermore, the court stated, counsel was not safeguarded from an Ark. R. Civ. P. 11 award because the trial court was unaware of the unconstitutionality of the laws. The court stated that the trial court had failed to determine whether the cleaner and its counsel had made the reasonable inquiry into the law required by Ark. R. Civ. P. 11 before they signed and filed their request for a prejudgment attachment. Here, the counsel stated, the cleaner's counsel need only to have checked a supplement to the Arkansas Code to discover that the prejudgment attachment provisions had been ruled unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was a passenger in a car that was stopped at a field sobriety checkpoint. Officers noticed the odor of marijuana coming from a car window. When defendant attempted to hide two hand-rolled cigarettes under his leg, he was ordered from the car. As he did, he stuffed the contents of his hand in his mouth and swallowed. Defendant was placed under arrest. He tried to run, but was caught. In searching for weapons, the officer found a bag of marijuana. A small white pipe was retrieved in a search at the jail. Defendant was convicted of possession of marijuana, fleeing, resisting arrest, and possession of drug paraphernalia. He contended the paraphernalia charge should have been dismissed due to vagueness of Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 5-64-403 (1987), that he was illegally detained and arrested without probable cause, that evidence should have been suppressed, and his conviction of fleeing dismissed. The court held that the drug paraphernalia law was not unconstitutionally vague and that the initial detention and subsequent arrest were not unlawful. Thus there was no error in admitting the evidence. Further there was no reason to dismiss the fleeing charge.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The pipeline company filed a claim with the DFA for a credit of the sales tax that it had paid on fuel that it had diverted from its interstate pipelines to power its compressor stations. The DFA audited the company's sales tax reports and proposed deficiency assessments of additional sales tax, penalties, and interest based on its determination that the compressor fuel was taxable. The company paid the amounts in controversy and filed an action for a refund. The chancery court ruled in favor of the company, ruling that the company was entitled to an exemption under the Tax Act. The court reversed and held that the chancery court erred in finding that the pipeline company had shown its entitlement to an exemption beyond a reasonable doubt. The court further determined that the imposition of the sales tax was not prohibited under the Commerce Clause, U.S. Const. art. 1, &sect; 8, cl. 3. The court found that an obvious nexus existed between the company's activities and the state and that the tax was fairly apportioned, did not discriminate against interstate commerce, and was fairly related to the services provided by the state.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed his conviction and sentence. Petitioner sought permission to proceed in circuit court for post-conviction relief. Although his request was not filed within three years as required by Arkansas Rule of Criminal Procedure Rule 37.2(c), petitioner claimed that the judgment of conviction was void.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner's conviction was based on his killing of a police officer who was acting in the line of duty. The information charged a violation of Ark. Stat. Ann. &sect; 41-4702 (Supp. 1973), but the jurors were instructed according to Ark. Stat. Ann. &sect; 41-1501 (1977), which was enacted 11 days after the murder. The court rejected petitioner's claim that he was convicted under an ex post facto law. Under both laws, the jury had to find beyond a reasonable doubt that petitioner had a premeditated design to cause the death, that with that purpose petitioner caused the death, and that the officer was a policeman acting in the line of duty. Since the same punishments were possible and the same elements were present in both laws, there was no ex post facto application. Neither was petitioner deprived of the right to claim that he was an accessory after the fact, as he could have under the law in effect at the time of the offense. Although the jury was instructed as to the meaning of &quot;accomplice&quot; according to 1977 statutes, accomplice statutes were in effect at the time of the murder at Act 280 of 1975, &sect;&sect; 302-303. Further, the evidence did not support the defense of accessory after the fact.</SPAN></P>

The dealership argued the attempt was an illegal exaction within the meaning of Ark. Const. art. 16, &sect; 13.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The dealership prepared two sets of retail installment contracts. One contract, reflecting the actual selling price, was sent to the financing agent. The other, reflecting a significantly lower purchase price, was sent to the state for the determination of the amount of gross receipts tax due on the transaction. The resulting loss in revenues to the state was calculated to be $ 60,960. After an administrative law judge ruled that the dealership was responsible for the jeopardy assessment, the dealership did not follow the procedure set out in Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 26-18-406(a) (1987), but filed an illegal exaction suit. Reversing the decision, the court explained that the wording of Ark. Const. art. 16, &sect; 13 was broad and not to have been narrowed by statute or interpretation, but the court also thought that the provision was not intended to have been the vehicle by which taxpayers aired individual grievances in the methods by which taxes were assessed and collected. Rather, it was intended to be the means by which taxpayers, generally in a collective capacity, resisted illegal taxation. For jurisdiction, the court ruled that there had to have been a claim that the tax was void.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the decision enjoining the ADFA from attempting collection from the dealership of unpaid gross receipts taxes.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The corporation sought a refund of taxes paid by the corporation's wholly owned subsidiary prior to a merger. After the merger, the corporation filed amended returns. The returns included the corporation's Illinois operations in computing &quot;business income&quot; under Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 26-51-701(a) (1987) and requested a tax refund. The chancellor relied upon a revenue policy statement issued by the state department of revenue in granting the director's motion for summary judgment. On appeal, the corporation argued that the chancellor erred in ruling that the corporation was prohibited from filing corporate income tax returns according to the unitary combined reporting method. The court noted that the policy statement had been struck down as unconstitutional. However, the court found that the corporation had not preserved the issue of the constitutionality of the statement for review and declined to apply the subsequent decision retroactively. Further, the court found that the chancellor properly decided the issue presented according to the law then in effect.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The corporate taxpayer produced precast concrete components in the construction of bridges. The corporate taxpayer produced the components at an out-of-state plant. It paid use tax based upon the cost of raw materials used in making the components instead of the components' sales price. The Revenue Division assessed the use tax based on the components' sales price. The trial court found in favor of the corporate taxpayer and determined that the Revenue Division's interpretation constituted an illegal exaction. The court reversed the order and remanded for entry of a decree consistent with the court's holding that the corporate taxpayer was required to remit use taxes based upon the sales price of its finished products at the time of the sale. The action did not come within the illegal exaction provision of the Arkansas Constitution and the trial court erred in certifying the case as a class action. The Revenue Division assessed the taxes on the &quot;sale&quot; of &quot;tangible personal property&quot; within the meaning of the tax statutes. The sales and use taxes were not imposed in a way that created an inequity between in-state and out-of-state taxpayers and did not violate the Commerce Clause.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court denied his request for a motion to stay execution and held that (1) the trial court lacked jurisdiction to stay the execution on the basis of the allegation that defendant was ineligible for execution due to his mental condition; (2) even if that trial court had such authority, the court could not disagree with the trial court's finding that there had been no change in defendant's condition since his last evaluation; and (3) state law did not pose for execution of a person who may be mentally deficient a standard different from that declared by the United States Supreme Court.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On appeal, the court first detailed the facts of the case for the purpose of comparing it to other cases which had affirmed the death penalty in order to assure evenhandedness. The jury found one aggravating circumstance, that the murder was committed for pecuniary gain, and one mitigating circumstance, that defendant was a model prisoner and could conform to prison life and be a productive member of the prison society. The real issue was whether the wickedness, inhumanity, and heinousness of the murder for pecuniary gain was comparable with that of other cases in which the court allowed the sentence of death to stand, and it concluded that it was. The court then addressed defendant's assignment of errors. It found: (1) that the statute properly provided the narrowing of the death eligible class at the penalty stage by a jury's findings of aggravated circumstances. (2) The jury was free to return a verdict of life without parole. (3) Although the trial judge erred in orally amending the information, reversal was not required because there was no contemporaneous objection and defendant suffered no prejudice. (4) There was no abuse of discretion in the admission of evidence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The state's evidence included a docket sheet which indicated that defendant pled guilty to a burglary charge in 1969 and was placed on probation for three years. Defendant argued that admission of his prior guilty plea constituted error because the definition of &quot;conviction&quot; did not encompass a guilty plea to a felony charge for which a suspended sentence was imposed. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment convicting defendant. The court only reversed a trial court for erroneous rulings, and when an issue was not brought to the attention of the trial court, the court would not consider it on appeal because the trial court had no opportunity to rule on the issue. Defendant neither raised his ex post facto argument below nor offered the court any reasoning or authority in urging the court to overrule the Finley decision, which held that the felon in possession of a firearm statute did not violate the ex post facto clause simply because a defendant committed the original felony before the effective date of the statute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court found that defense counsel presented a zealous defense on behalf of defendant, against whom there was ample evidence of guilt. Defendant offered no factual substantiation that there was a reasonable probability that the outcome of either the guilt or sentencing phases of the trial would have been different had the jury heard specific testimony of a specific witness. Further, defendant failed to show that the excusal of two venire persons by the court for cause prejudiced him since both the jurors clearly looked upon capital punishment with favor. And, defense counsel was not ineffective in failing to object to the makeup of the jury panel because there was no evidence that the jury was selected in violation of U.S. Const. amend VI. Further, defense counsel was not ineffective for failing to secure defendant a comparative review of his death sentence because defendant was afforded a comparative review. Finally, defendant's claim that if he was permitted to testify the jury would have been swayed by his testimony was conclusory. Defendant failed to show that his defense counsel did more than merely advise him not to testify.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant insured sought review of a judgment entered by the Sebastian Circuit Court (Arkansas), which dismissed his action against appellee insurer for want of personal jurisdiction. The trial court found that it lacked the authority under the Arkansas long-arm statute,&nbsp;Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 16-4-101 (1987), and the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to exercise personal jurisdiction over the insurer.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The insured purchased an automobile insurance policy from the insurer. The policy provided that uninsured motorist coverage would be available throughout the United States. After he moved to Arkansas, the insured was involved in an accident with an uninsured motorist. The trial court dismissed his action against the insurer for want of personal jurisdiction. On appeal, that judgment was reversed. The &quot;transacting business&quot; provision of the long-arm statute,&nbsp;Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 16-4-101(C)(1) (1987), was intended to permit the maximum exercise of personal jurisdiction. A provision of the insurance code, Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 23-60-102(13) (1987), included matters that arose out of an insurance contract within the definition of &quot;transact.&quot; Therefore, the insured's action to enforce his rights fell within the &quot;transacting business&quot; provision of the long-arm statute. Moreover, given that insurer could control its amenability to suit by limiting coverage to certain states, the purposeful availment prong of the &quot;minimum contacts&quot; inquiry was satisfied. The insured was also unable to overcome the presumption that jurisdiction over a matter that arose of its purposeful availment was reasonable.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 9-27-318 (Supp. 1991).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant had five juvenile cases pending against him in chancery court when the prosecutor moved to transfer two of the cases to circuit court. One case contained a felony theft-by-receiving count and the other case involved two felony counts of breaking or entering into two vehicles. On the present appeal, the court found that appellant failed to show that he suffered prejudice. At the hearing, he never suggested that the four-day notice given him prevented him from presenting any witnesses. Nor did he proffer any testimony or evidence that he could, or intended to, present if he had been given additional time. The court ruled that the prosecutor clearly showed by clear and convincing evidence that the transfer was warranted. The trial court's findings showed that appellant exhibited a repetitive pattern to commit felony offenses and reflected he possessed character traits, a prior history, and a mental maturity indicating he was beyond rehabilitation. In addition, the evidence reflected that the offenses became increasingly more serious. In view of the above, the court was unable to say the trial court was clearly erroneous in transferring appellant's cases to circuit court.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The department challenged the trial court order expunging the father's name from the Child Abuse and Neglect Central Registry subsequent to the court's reversal of the department's determination that the father had committed child abuse. The department argued that Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 12-12-516(b)(1)(A) (Supp. 1989) prohibited expungement prior to the expiration of a three year period, and requested the trial court to modify its order to conform with the department's interpretation of the statutory expungement provision.The trial order declared &sect; 12-12-516(b)(1)(A)&nbsp;unconstitutional on grounds that the expungement provision violated the father's due process rights, and unconstitutionally infringed on the court's inherent power to issue orders assuring compliance with its rulings.On appeal, the department argued that the trial court erred in ordering the agency to violate the statutory recording requirements. The department also argued that the expunction order exceeded the scope of judicial review. The court found that the constitutional arguments were not fully developed at trial.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The dog owner filed a declaratory judgment action against defendants in which he sought a declaration that a city animal control ordinance which prohibited the keeping of certain breeds of dogs, including the American Pit Bull Terrier, within the city was unconstitutional. The city and the board members filed a motion for summary judgment. The circuit court granted the motion and dismissed the dog owner's suit. The dog owner appealed. Upon review, the court affirmed the judgment. The court held that the ordinance did not violate due process by being impermissibly vague because it put a person of ordinary intelligence on sufficient notice to reasonably determine the prohibited conduct. The court also held that the classification of the banned breeds was not unconstitutional because the city had a reasonable basis for including the American Pit Bull Terrier and the &quot;pit bull&quot; within that classification. Finally, the court held that the dog owner's claim that the ordinance violated an alleged contract with the city was without merit because such a contract, which would essentially have contracted away the board's legislative powers, would have violated public policy.</SPAN></P>

At the trial, the fiance identified defendant in court as the gunman.

On appeal, the court affirmed and held that the trial court properly allowed the fiance's in-court identification, irrespective of his prior encounter with defendant at the police station. The court rejected defendant's contention that the &quot;show-up&quot; procedure with the deputies' escorting only defendant into the station was unduly suggestive and tainted any further identification by the fiance. The court found no evidence suggesting that the police brought defendant to the station to facilitate an identification by the fiance. The fiance made his initial identification spontaneously and before defendant was brought inside the building. Moreover, the fiance could not have known for certain that the person who was getting out of the sheriff's car was indeed the suspect in that crime.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The inmate had worked on the capitol grounds during 1988 and 1989. He filed a grievance, seeking good-time benefits under Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 12-30-408 (1987) for that work. After his grievance was denied, the inmate filed a petition challenging the constitutionality of Act 709, entitled Administrative Adjudication-Judicial Review and codified at Ark. Stat. Ann. &sect; 25-15-212 (Supp. 1991). That provision barred inmates from seeking judicial review of administrative adjudications. The trial court found that the inmate had standing and that Act 709 was unconstitutional. Appellants sought review of that decision, which was affirmed. The court agreed that the inmate had standing to seek relief under the Declaratory Judgment Act, Ark. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 16-111-101 to -111 (1987), because his rights had been directly affected. It also stated that the legislature had the discretion to grant or withhold judicial review of administrative decisions except when it was constitutionally required.

In affirming defendant's conviction, the court held that the evidence was sufficient to support findings of premeditation and deliberation because defendant armed himself with a sawed-off shotgun, drove to the victim's housing project, walked six feet toward him, spoke his name, and shot him in the side of the head. The circuit court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to declare a mistrial because there was no evidence that the jury withheld information during voir dire that he might have known the victim.

The chancery court found in favor of the subcontractor. The property owners appealed from that judgment, which was affirmed.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellants, a county quorum court and other county officials, sought review of a decision of the Washington Chancery Court (Arkansas), which voided a quorum court ordinance to regulate solid waste disposal facilities on constitutional grounds. Appellee, a solid waste disposal service, had set forth the action against appellants. The effect of voiding the ordinance was to allow the disposal service to proceed with plans to build a landfill.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court found that the ordinance lacked any rational relationship to a government purpose so as to be arbitrary and constitute a due process violation. The court disagreed with the position taken by the trial court. The court determined that there was a lenient rational basis test in Arkansas. The trial court had erred in its task, which was merely to consider if any rational basis existed that demonstrated the possibility of a deliberate nexus with state objectives so that the legislation was not the product of utterly arbitrary and capricious government. A rational basis was established by the quorum court in passing the ordinance. Although no studies or analyses of the sub-surface geology had been made of the area in question by either party, the disposal service's testimony admitted that underground waterways might not have corresponded to surface waterways due to sub-surface geology. It was also conceded that the zoning ordinance might have allowed the control of pollution emanating from the proposed landfill. Thus, the finding of the trial court was clearly erroneous. The ordinance was also valid on the basis that it did not conflict with any state statute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed and remanded the decision of the trial court, which voided the ordinance.</SPAN></P>

The court held that there was evidence from which the jury could have concluded the killing occurred in the course of a robbery.

The court also held that the jury was not required to believe evidence of self defense and that there was no error in denial of defendant's directed verdict motion. The court also found that no prejudice resulted from admitting evidence of a statement the state may have agreed to exclude, that certain other statements were voluntarily made, and that there was no merit in the &quot;fee cap&quot; argument because defendant had not demonstrated that his case was prejudiced as a result of the legislative limit on the fee to be paid his appointed counsel.</SPAN></P>

He was convicted of the crime and sentenced to 10 years. Defendant appealed, arguing a violation of his right to confrontation and the introduction into evidence of his prior conviction for first degree sexual abuse that occurred two years before the this charge. The court affirmed, concluding that defendant's right to confrontation had not been violated even though the victim was in effect unavailable to testify at trial because sufficient guarantees of trustworthiness existed to support the finding that the parents' testimony of the victim's statements did not violate defendant's confrontation rights. The court held that Ark. R. Evid. 803(25) no longer passed constitutional muster. The court held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the prior sexual abuse conviction where it occurred within two months of this trial and the prior offense occurred within the same time frame as the current offense. The court held that to the extent Jones v. State, 274 Ark. 379 was inconsistent with the court's holding, it was overruled.</SPAN></P>

The court held that sufficient guarantees of trustworthiness existed to support the trial court's finding that the parents' testimony of the victim's statements did not violate defendant's confrontation rights even though the victim was in effect unavailable to testify at trial due to the judge's finding of lack of competency. The court ruled that the victim's inability to testify effectively at trial did not presumptively invalidate the reliability of her statements to her parents. The court found that the victim's statements to her mother qualified as an excited utterance under Ark. R. Evid. 803(2) because they were made at an unusually late hour following a nightmare that clearly terrified the victim. The court determined that the trial court did not use irrelevant corroborative evidence, and if it did, it was harmless error.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The property owners entered into a contract with a different county (authority) for the purpose of selling their Poinsett County land for use as a landfill for the authority's county. Under the agreement, the authority acquired an option to purchase the land for $ 750,000. The county was opposed to using land in its county for a solid waste disposal landfill. The property owners alleged that, in response to the pending sale, the county enacted a zoning ordinance preventing any property located in the township where the property owner's land was located from being used as a landfill. The property owners filed an action contending that the ordinance was illegal. While the action was pending and before the sale was finalized, the Arkansas legislature passed legislation preventing one county from placing a landfill operation in an adjoining county without the consent of the receiving county. On appeal, the court affirmed finding that no reduction in the $ 350,000 valuation of land was shown only the lessening of one profitable use of the property. The court held that a much greater reduction in value or use of the property than was present would not constitute a regulatory taking.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant's convictions for rape, kidnapping, and aggravated robbery were affirmed. Defendant sought permission to proceed for post-conviction relief and asserted that his attorney was ineffective. After the rape victim's father had testified he stopped in front of the defense table and glared at defendant. Defendant sought a mistrial. The trial court held an in camera hearing to determine whether the jury had observed the father's conduct. The motion for mistrial was denied. Defendant asserted that his counsel was ineffective for failing to demand that his presence for the in camera hearing. The court stated that it could not be concluded that counsel's conduct was outside the wide range of reasonable professional assistance. Although defendant asserted that he was so intimidated by the father that he could not aid in his defense it was unlikely that had he testified at the hearing the trial court would have granted the mistrial. In light of the evidence it was improbable that defendant's suggestions, even if he had thought of them at trial would have changed the verdict. Therefore, it could not be said that his counsel's conduct denied defendant a fair trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellants, Director of the Arkansas Department of Finance and Administration and Commissioner of Revenues, sought review of the judgment of the Pulaski Chancery Court (Arkansas) that ordered a refund of income tax collected from appellee retirees, who had retired from federal civil service agencies, military, and other states' agencies and political subdivisions. Appellees' counsel was awarded an attorney's fee from a portion of the refund.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellees filed an action against appellants, alleging that the provisions of Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 26-51-307 (1987), violated the principles of intergovernmental tax immunity by favoring retired employees of the state and local government over retired federal employees and retired employees of other states and political subdivisions. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's judgment that ordered a refund in appellees' favor. The court held that trial court's order on the issues of class certification, constitutionality, the injunction, the refund, and the right to attorney's fees was final for the purposes of Ark. R. App. P. Civ. 2. The details of notice and the amount of the attorney's fees were primarily collateral and ministerial. The court held that the constitutional doctrine of intergovernmental tax immunity, codified at 4 U.S.C.S. &sect; 111, had been violated because the state tax discriminated based upon the source of the payment. The court retroactively applied its finding because the doctrine was not new principle of law, retroactive application advanced the doctrine, and one of two inequitable results must have occurred, as a result of the court's decision.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the trial court's judgment that ordered an income tax refund to appellees in their action challenging, as violative of the principles of intergovernmental tax immunity, the provisions of the state tax law, which provided a full exemption to retired employees of the state and local government over retired federal employees and retired employees of other states and political subdivisions.</SPAN></P>

The trial court further denied the taxpayer's request to enjoin the exaction by payment of funds relating to the case.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Three members of the Public Service Commission (PSC) recused themselves from considering a case to avoid a conflict of interest. The governor responded by appointing three special commissioners pursuant to his authority under Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 23-2-102(a). The taxpayer filed an action to enjoin the state from allowing the governor to appoint the special commissioners. The trial court denied the injunctions. The taxpayer appealed. On appeal, the taxpayer argued that Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 23-2-102(a), was unconstitutional because it violated the separation of powers and, further, that due to the absence of senate confirmation to the appointment of the special commissioners, the general assembly had impermissibly delegated legislative power to the governor in violation of the state constitution. However, the court held that where the constitution was silent on which branch of government had the general power to appoint special commissioners, empowering the governor to appoint special PSC commissioners, without senate approval, was a valid delegation of authority by the legislature to the branch of government that was equipped to execute and implement legislative matters.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 26-52-301(3) (1987, Supp. 1989), as a valid and legitimate exercise of the state's power to tax.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The telephone subscribers challenged &sect; 26-52-301(3) on the grounds that it violated both the First Amendment and Equal Protection Clauses. The statute imposed a sales tax on long distance services with the exception of certain private lines and WATS service. The subscribers challenged the exemption for WATS services. The trial court ruled that &sect; 26-52-301(3) was constitutional, and the court affirmed the judgment below, rejecting the contention that a strict standard of review applied to the statute. No fundamental rights were affected because there was no attempt to censor based on content or to discriminate among classes of speakers. The court ruled that under the applicable rational basis test, &sect; 26-52-301(3) was constitutional. WATS service was primarily used by businesses, and the statute was rationally related to the legitimate legislative goal of providing tax incentives to businesses to encourage them to stay in the state. Further, the state had wide latitude in the exercise of its power to tax, which implied the power to discriminate in taxation. The exact reason for the distinction in treatment did not have to be proved for a statute to be upheld.</SPAN></P>

The man then took the cash register and fled. The second victim identified defendant from a series of photographs. An officer testified that after pursuing a speeding truck, which struck a tree, the driver, who wore blue sweatpants and a red sweatshirt, exited the truck and fled. The officer found a cash register and the first victim's wallet in the truck. On appeal, the court rejected defendant's claim that the evidence was insufficient to sustain his convictions.

The court affirmed and held as follows: (1) defendant's own testimony belied the claim that he was not provided an opportunity to take a breathalyzer because he testified that he was given two opportunities to take the test, but he did not complete it; (2) the trial court was correct in finding that Act 44 of 1989 was not void for vagueness; (3) the trial court was correct in denying defendant access to the arresting officer's personnel file because that discovery would have served no useful purpose since Act 44 did not invalidate actions taken by officers that did not meet the published law enforcement standards; and (4) by its terms, Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 5-65-111(a) (1987), did not confer upon the trial court the authority to instruct the jury on public service as an alternative sentence because it stated that the trial court could order public service in lieu of jail, presumably as part of sentencing following a bench trial or in the nature of post-conviction relief.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In an appeal from a juvenile delinquency proceeding, appellant juvenile's attorney filed a &quot;no merit&quot; brief and a motion to be relieved as counsel. The Court of Appeals certified the motion to the Supreme Court of Arkansas to determine whether the protection of an adult appellant's right to counsel on appeal applied to the appeal of an adjudication of juvenile delinquency.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The United States Supreme Court holds that a criminal appellant could not have been denied representation on appeal based on appointed counsel's conclusory assertion that counsel was of the opinion that there was no merit to the appeal. A procedure was incorporated in Arkansas Supreme Court Rule 11(h) that required counsel to first conduct a &quot;conscientious examination&quot; of the case and then support a request to withdraw with a brief that referred to anything in the record that might have arguably supported the appeal. The appellate court then had to conduct a full examination of all the proceedings and permit withdrawal if its separate inquiry revealed no non-frivolous issue but had to appoint new counsel to argue the appeal if such issue existed. Although delinquency proceedings were not penal in nature and were essentially a civil proceeding, certain due process safeguards, made applicable by the Fourteenth Amendment, normally associated with criminal proceedings had been extended for the protection of juveniles. A juvenile was entitled to counsel in situations where an adult would have been entitled to an appeal and the juvenile had to have an opportunity to respond.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The motion was granted in part and the clerk was directed to provide the juvenile and his parent or guardian with a copy of counsel's motion so that the juvenile could have filed a pro se brief or other response within 30 days if he so chose.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of illegal possession of a controlled substance in the first phase of a bifurcated trial. In the sentencing phase of the trial, the trial court denied his request to testify that he had been a cocaine addict when the offenses were committed but had placed himself in a rehabilitation program and had kicked the habit. Defendant claimed that the trial court's ruling was an encouragement to give up his right not to testify in the guilt-innocence phase of the trial and thus violated that right. The court affirmed the refusal to allow defendant to give the proposed testimony. It found that in the sentencing phase, the State could only introduce evidence of prior convictions and defendant could only introduce evidence to rebut the existence of those convictions. There was no provision for the accused to present evidence in the sentencing phase that he could have but declined to present in the guilt-innocence phase. Further, while defendant's right to testify in his own defense could not be limited in an unconstitutional manner, he could be required to make a choice between exercising his right to remain silent or to testify in his own defense.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant, a juvenile, appealed from a judgment entered by the Washington Chancery Court (Arkansas), which adjudicated him a juvenile delinquent and suspended his driver's license for one year in accordance with 1989 Ark. Acts No. 93. The chancery court found that Act 93 did not constitute age discrimination under the Equal Protection Clauses of the United States and Arkansas Constitutions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant, a 17-year-old, was arrested for public intoxication. He was adjudicated a juvenile delinquent. Pursuant to Act 93, codified as Ark. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 5-64-710, 5-65-116, 27-16-914, his driver's license was suspended for one year. The chancery court rejected his argument that Act 93 violated equal protection. On appeal, the court agreed with that conclusion. The court rejected the State's argument that the declaratory judgment statute,&nbsp;Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 16-111-106(b) (1987), required defendant to notify the attorney general of his challenge to the constitutionality of Act 93. Rather, &sect; 16-111-106(b) applied to civil proceedings where the State was not automatically a party. Under Act 93, the driver's license of a person under the age of 18 had to be suspended upon a conviction for an offense involving the illegal possession or use of alcohol or a controlled substance. The court found that Act 93's focus on the age of 18 was not unreasonable or arbitrary even though persons between the ages of 18 and 21 also could not purchase alcohol. Similarly, the fact that Act 93 was not limited to the crime of drunk driving also did not violate equal protection.</SPAN></P>

After construction of the line, raw sewage overflowed on the landowners' property and continued periodically for years.

The city initiated an inverse condemnation action to build the additional sewer line, and the landowners' filed suit, alleging that the years of overflows from the sewer line constituted an unconstitutional taking of their property. The circuit court found for the landowners. The city challenged, alleging error in a jury instruction and an award of prejudgment interest. The court affirmed, holding that permanency was not a necessary predicate for inverse condemnation, and a taking did not require permanency nor an irrevocable injury, as urged by the city. The court did modify the award of prejudgment interest, holding that the amount to be paid by the city depended upon the proof regarding not only the value of the landowners' property on the date of taking, but also upon how long the temporary taking was effective.</SPAN></P>

The State appealed, contending the circuit court erred in holding Arkansas Code Ann. &sect; 5-37-525&nbsp;unconstitutional. The court affirmed and held that &sect; 5-37-525 was unconstitutional because a citizen was subject to imprisonment for debt, in violation of Arkansas Constitution art. II, &sect; 16.

On appeal, defendant argued that the patrolman's failure to have his certificate of appointment with him was fatal to the arrest and that the patrolman was without jurisdiction. The court affirmed defendant's convictions. The court held that, although the patrolman was technically in violation of the Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 25-17-304(e)(1) (1987), the error was a harmless since defendant failed to demonstrate any prejudice to him resulting from the certificate's absence. Additionally, the court held that the patrolman was well within the bounds of his authority when he pursued defendant for four blocks and made the arrest, because the patrolman began pursuit within his jurisdiction and his actions constituted a fresh pursuit for a traffic violation committed in his presence. The doctrine of fresh pursuit applied to the pursuit of a person who had committed any criminal offense in the presence of the arresting officer.</SPAN></P>

The court further ruled that the trial court's finding that the taped confession was voluntary was not clearly contrary to the preponderance of the evidence under a totality of the circumstances test. The court also determined that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by denying defendant's motion for a continuance the day before trial on the basis that his role was only that of an accomplice and that the actual perpetrator of the murder was unavailable to testify.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant employer appealed a decision of the Greene Chancery Court (Arkansas), which granted default judgments to appellee judgment creditor and upheld the constitutionality of the Arkansas Garnishment Statutes,&nbsp;Ark. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 16-110-401 to 415 (1987). The employer claimed that the Garnishment Statutes did not afford it adequate due process since they did not warn garnishees of their liability for failure to comply with writs of garnishment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The creditor obtained two judgments against her former husband, who was an employee of the employer, related to the creditor and employee's divorce decree. Default judgments were issued against the employer when it twice failed to respond to writs of garnishment. The employer appealed, challenging the constitutionality of the garnishment statutes. The court found for the employer and reversed the chancery court, ruling that Ark. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 16-110-401 to 415 (1987) were unconstitutional because they did not satisfactorily notify garnishees that they could be liable for the judgment against the debtor if they did not answer the writ of garnishment. Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 16-110-407 provided for a penalty for a garnishee's failure to answer a writ of garnishment, the court observed, but did not require notice to the garnishee in keeping with the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. The level of protection afforded by Ark. R. Civ. P. 4(b) did not meet that constitutional requirement, the court held. Notice that one's property may be taken should have flowed from the statute authorizing the taking, the court said, not from the graces of the judiciary.</SPAN></P>

The subcontractor then brought suit for labor and materials and to establish a materialman's lien against the property. The owners had been given no notice of any potential lien claimants because Ark.

The owners claimed that the statutory provision was unconstitutional because it violated the Equal Protection Clause. The trial court agreed and found that the materialman's lien was unenforceable. On appeal, the court affirmed, finding that the owners had standing to challenge the statute because their rights were affected by it.

Additionally, there was evidence to the effect that defendant had shot the decedent more than once. On review, the court held that such testimony and evidence was sufficient to support the conviction for premeditated and deliberated murder. The court found no error in the admission of testimony that, after the shooting, defendant drove to his home and went inside the building, as such evidence was relevant to defendant's guilt that he fled the scene. Additionally, there was no error in the trial court's decision to sustain the state's objection to defense counsel's posing a hypothetical question to a witness, as questions on cross-examination were not be conjectural or speculative. The court further found that even if the introduction of several photographs of the decedent's body were inflammatory, the photographs were admissible when the location of the wounds was at issue because of the varying witness testimony. Upon its determination that the remaining points of error did not merit a reversal, the court affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant, the spouse of a patient treated by a hospital, challenged an order of the Crawford Circuit Court (Arkansas) awarding summary judgment to appellee, the assignee of the hospital's account on the patient. The hospital had filed suit against appellant and the patient to recover for medical goods and/or services provided to the patient by the hospital.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellee argued that the common law doctrine of necessaries applied to hold appellant liable for the account. The doctrine of necessaries provided that a husband was liable to a creditor for necessaries furnished to his wife; however, under Arkansas common law, the wife had not been held to be similarly liable. Regardless, the trial court ruled for appellee. The court reversed. Assuming, without deciding, the viability of the doctrine, the question presented was limited to whether the trial court was correct in extending to a wife the long-standing common law duty to provide necessaries. As this was an issue most appropriately resolved by the legislature rather than the judiciary, the court could not say it was. Thus, appellee had to show some other legal basis for finding appellant liable. The law in Arkansas provided that a married person could contract in his or her own right, per Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 9-11-503 (1987). A review of the record revealed that appellee offered no evidence of a contract or agreement between it, or the hospital, and appellant. Thus, there was no legal basis for holding appellant liable for the services provided absent a contractual agreement.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was living with a child and her mother. The child was raped, killed, and stuffed in a hollow tree. Hairs found on the body were consistent with defendant's. Defendant was arrested in California five weeks after his and the child's disappearance. Defendant was convicted by a jury of capital murder and was sentenced to die by lethal injection. The court affirmed, determining that the trial court did not err in excluding two jurors, who expressed a definite negative attitude toward the death penalty and whose equivocation did not sufficiently ameliorate those expressions to assure they could follow the law if instructed on the death penalty, for cause. The jury could have found beyond a reasonable doubt the defendant killed to avoid being arrested for raping the victim. While some of the prosecutor's remarks were on the borderline of diminishing the jury's role in returning a death sentence, under the totality of the circumstances the jury was made well aware of its duty. Defendant did not show or even argue any specific prejudice resulting from Ark.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant contended that his counsel should have been allowed to examine the arresting officers' personnel files and that evidence admitted during their testimonies should have been suppressed. He also contended that he should not have been sentenced pursuant to the habitual criminal statute. The court affirmed. It found that several officers participated in defendant's arrest and at least one of them was properly qualified to make a valid arrest. Because there was at least one authorized law enforcement officer present in his official capacity, the court did not need to consider the qualifications of any other officers who were also present. The court declined to hold that any evidence obtained as a result of the arrest should have been suppressed. The court determined that defendant was on notice that the State intended to proceed against him as an habitual offender. It noted that defendant never made a denial of due process objection at trial and he could not seek review of such a denial for the first time on appeal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">An unqualified officer stopped a truck after observing it crossing the center line. When neither defendant nor her husband could produce a driver's license, they were taken to the sheriff's department. The husband gave another officer permission to search the truck for identification. The officers found a gas mask and later, containers of chemicals used in making amphetamine and methamphetamine. Defendant and the husband were arrested and read their Miranda rights. The husband signed a consent form for searches of the truck and a motel room he shared with defendant. The officers found firearms, explosives, and chemicals. Defendant was charged and tried jointly with the husband. She argued that the husband's involuntary statements should have been suppressed. On appeal, the court held that defendant lacked standing to object to the alleged violations of the husband's Fourth Amendment rights. There was no merit to her claim that the evidence seized from the hotel room and the truck should have been suppressed. Not only did she fail to specifically request suppression of the evidence from the hotel room, the record showed that both searches were conducted with the husband's consent.</SPAN></P>

The parties later agreed on a set amount that would increase gradually over time. Ultimately the mother brought suit against the father for the arrearage. The trial court ruled in favor of the father. The mother appealed. The court found that due to changes in the law that lengthened the statute of limitations as to recovery of arrearages, Ark. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 9-14-236 and 16-56-129 (Supp. 1989), and prohibited parties from modifying the terms of the support agreements as reflected in divorce decrees, Ark.

The trial court ruled that the state could admit evidence only that he sought treatment, the type of treatment sought, and the reporting of suspected child abuse.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was charged with sexual assault on a child. The trial court granted a motion to suppress certain evidence. The state appealed the order, contending that defendant's confidential statements to physicians and counselors were admissible pursuant to Ark.

The court affirmed the suppression of the evidence. The court held that the admission into evidence that defendant sought counseling for sexual abuse and that a report was made to the proper authorities satisfied the purpose of &sect; 12-12-511 without taking the evidentiary privilege between patient and physician. The court held that deference to legislation involving rules of evidence and procedure would be given only to the extent the legislation was compatible with established court rules. When conflicts arose which compromised the rules, court rules remained supreme. Defendant's confidential statements to his doctors and therapist remained privileged, but there was no privilege with regard to the fact that defendant sought and received treatment.</SPAN></P>

Gen. Assembly &sect; 3, under which appellee Board of Education (Board) paid the costs in school desegregation cases, was unconstitutional, and which denied a petition for injunctive relief against future payments and for a return of funds.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Board was ordered by the federal court to pay costs in school desegregation cases. The Board paid those costs under authorization of the Public School Fund Act (Act), Act 1048, 1987 Ark. Gen. Assembly &sect; 3. The trial court denied the unconstitutionality of the Act and refused to order a refund of monies paid out of the Mutual Foundation Program Aid (MFPA) account but issued an injunction to prevent further misdistribution of these funds. The trial court also refused to order the refund of the monies previously expended. The court affirmed and stated that there was nothing in the Act that proscribed the MFPA formula that would have indicated that all distributions to the school districts must necessarily have been allocated to the formula. The court held that the Board had an obligation to follow the orders of the federal court; therefore, the utilization of money from the public school fund for desegregation was rationally related to achieving that legitimate purpose. The court held that any use of school funds that resulted in benefits to school funds or property or aided in the stated purposes for which these funds may have been expended was not an unconstitutional diversion.</SPAN></P>

The governor issued a call for an extraordinary session, which resulted in almost identical legislation being passed on the transfer of duties and appropriations. Appellants filed suit to prohibit disbursements and to enjoin other actions and the lower court granted the state summary judgment. The court affirmed and found that the legislature had the right to grant or withdraw agency powers and that this was not a violation of the separation of powers doctrine. As the appropriation only related to one subject, it did not violate state laws. The second enactment of the legislation was not outside of the governor's call as the call was related to the transfer of duties.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant, an employee of a municipal fire department who had been injured in the course of his employment, sought review of an order from the Circuit Court of Jackson County (Arkansas), which denied his application for disability retirement pursuant to Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 21-11-819 (1987). The employee had filed suit after appellees, various municipal officials and the firemen's pension and relief fund, denied his application.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Among the employee's assignments of error on appeal was his contention that the trial court erred in finding that no evidence of certified disability by the pension board's physician was submitted that declared the employee to be disabled. The employee asserted that the letter report from the pension board's physician to the city clerk complied with the requirement that a pension board physician subscribe and swear that the employee was disabled. However, in light of the nature of the physician's evaluation of the employee, the court was unable to say that the finding that the letter report was not a certification of the employee's disability, as required by &sect; 24-11-819, was clearly erroneous. Moreover, the failure to obtain the required certificate of disability from the pension board's physician was fatal to the employee's case, as Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 24-11-819(b)(1) specifically stated that no person would be retired unless there was filed with the pension board certificates of his or her disability, with the certificates being subscribed and sworn to by the pension board's physician. Accordingly, the court affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the Pulaski Circuit Court, Fourth Division (Arkansas), which convicted him of first-degree murder. He claimed that the trial court erroneously permitted introduction of custodial statements obtained in violation of his Fifth, Sixth, and Fourteenth Amendment rights. He also claimed that the trial court gave an incorrect jury instruction on first-degree murder.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was charged with capital felony murder under Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 5-10-101 (Supp. 1989) but found guilty of first-degree murder. He was also found guilty of theft under Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 5-36-103 (Supp. 1989). On review, the court found that defendant waived his Miranda rights when he gave his statements, but the jury instructions were erroneous. An instruction was given on first-degree murder over defendant's timely objection. Defendant proffered a correct instruction on felony murder as a lesser included offense of capital murder, but the instruction was not given. The proffered instruction correctly tracked the provisions of Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 5-10-102(a)(1). The trial court erred in believing that the first-degree felony murder instruction required the same elements of proof and would thus be a repetition of the capital felony murder instruction, except for the degree of punishment. Thus, the trial court, in effect, removed the underlying felony from the capital murder charge set forth in the information. The court therefore reduced the conviction to second-degree murder and reduced defendant's sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed defendant's conviction as modified to reduce it to first-degree murder.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Secretary certified the proposed amendment that would have authorized a state lottery and legalized bingo for placement on ballot, and petitioners sought review of that action, claiming that the ballot title was insufficient and misleading and that the signatures had not been properly counted. The court granted the petition for review and enjoined the secretary from placing the proposal on the ballot. The court held that Ark. Code Ann. &sect;7-9-107(e)(1)(B)(i), (ii) (Supp. 1989) was unconstitutional because it permitted the court to review a decision of the secretary of state with respect to the ballot title portion of a petition, and the only authority given the court by Ark. Const. amend. 7 was the authority to review the secretary of state's certification of a &quot;petition&quot; which included both the ballot title and the signatures.In this case, the court was able to review the secretary's certification because it was complete. However, the court concluded that the ballot title was insufficient because it failed to inform voters that the amendment created an ostensibly autonomous board to handle large amounts of state money and that it named specific persons to that board.</SPAN></P>

A similar tax was declared unconstitutional when passed by a county because a special election had not been held. An action was brought challenging the constitutionality of the tax passed by the state and injunctions were issued. The trial court declared the tax unconstitutional, and the city sought review. The court reversed, holding that the state's power to tax was broader than the county's power. Therefore, the fact that the tax was unconstitutional when passed by the county did not render it unconstitutional when passed by the state. Also, because the tax was imposed by the state, there was no fundamental right of the citizens to vote on the tax. Finally, it was for the general assembly to levy the tax because they were elected for that purpose.</SPAN></P>

He was orally sentenced to life without parole for capital murder and 30 years for attempted rape, but the written judgment and commitment order sentenced him only to life for capital murder. The convictions were affirmed. Petitioner sought permission to proceed in the circuit court for post-conviction relief under Criminal Procedure Rule 37, claiming his attorney was ineffective.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court noted that in order to prevail on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, petitioner was required to show that counsel's performance was deficient and that the deficient performance prejudiced the defense. Petitioner argued that his attorney spent only 30 minutes with him prior to the trial and that this was not enough time to prepare the case. However, he failed to state what might have been developed by a longer consultation. Thus, he failed to reveal how he was prejudiced. Petitioner also contended that his counsel was ineffective for failing to object to the submission of the offense of attempted rape. The court noted that a defendant could be tried for multiple offenses, but he could not be convicted of two offenses if the second offense was included within the first. Rape and attempted rape were lesser included offenses of capital murder. Thus, it was error for petitioner to be convicted and sentenced for attempted rape. However, the trial court corrected the mistake in its oral sentence by the sentence in the written judgment. Thus, petitioner was not prejudiced by the oral sentence. The court declared that the written judgment recited the valid sentence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was the owner and operator of two adult entertainment establishments when he was charged and convicted of promoting obscene materials in violation of Ark. Code. Ann. &sect; 5-68-303 (1987). Defendant contended on appeal that the trial court erred in denying his motion for a directed verdict because the state failed to prove the scienter element of the offense, that he knowingly promoted obscene materials, because he was not present when the detective purchased the magazine and the two films. The court held that the evidence presented below was more than sufficient to support the jury's determination that the defendant had knowledge of the contents, nature, and character of the pornographic materials. The court held that the indictment was definite about the charge and defendant was made fully and timely aware of the evidence the State intended to use. The court found no error in the trial court's refusal of defendant's proffered jury instruction that suggested the terms used in the other jury instructions were vague. Defendant's punishment of six years imprisonment and a $ 10,000 fine did not violate the Eighth Amendment's prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed and found that legislature was without authority to grant jurisdiction to the chancery courts for any action which was not within equity jurisdiction at the time the Arkansas Constitution was adopted, which had not included domestic abuse petitions. The equity jurisdiction was not flexible enough to violate the constitution. While equity jurisdiction protected personal and property rights, equity jurisdiction required no adequate remedy at law, which existed in the domestic abuse criminal statutes. The victim's fear and a lack of prosecutorial diligence had not rendered the criminal statutes ineffective because chancery court was not less frightening and victims were able to commence criminal proceedings without the prosecutor. The criminal statutes protected the victims. The injunction of a crime's commission where a remedy at law existed infringed upon the right to a jury trial.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was charged with engaging in deviate sexual activity with a person under 14 years of age. Defendant asserted a privilege under Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 17-39-107 (1987) to protect a conversation he had with a certified licensed social worker in which he admitted to the abuse. The State argued that no privilege existed &quot;at any proceeding&quot; involving the sexual abuse of children under Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 12-12-511. The court rejected defendant's argument that &sect; 12-12-511 applied only to civil and not criminal proceedings and affirmed. In construing &sect; 12-12-511, the court was required to give effect to the intent of the general assembly by considering the entire act. The purpose of the act was to protect the best interests of the child. Further, &sect; 12-12-511 contained no language limiting its use in criminal proceedings, but instead used the term, &quot;any proceeding.&quot; Thus, &sect; 12-12-511 applied to a criminal prosecution for rape.</SPAN></P>

The court rejected the creditor's assertion that Ark. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 23-79-134(a) and 24-7-715(a) (1987) were unconstitutional because they increased the exemption of Ark.

Defendants remained seated. The officers then stepped forward and handcuffed and carried the protestors to the van. The trial court convicted defendants of criminal trespass and refusal to submit to arrest. They appealed only the conviction for refusal to submit to arrest, and the court affirmed. The court held that a reasonable and commonly understood construction of the language of Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 5-54-103(b), the statute under which defendants were convicted, gave a person of ordinary intelligence fair warning that an inactive or passive form of non-compliance with the arrest process could subject one to punishment. Therefore, the court held that the statute was not unconstitutionally vague.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The taxpayer failed to pay sales taxes, believing his sales of sod to be exempt. The Department assessed taxes, and refused to abate the assessment. The taxpayer tried to file a bond pursuant to Ark.

The trial court dismissed the action. On the taxpayer's appeal, the court affirmed. Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 26-18-204(e) (1987) gave the exclusive remedy for challenging a tax assessment, and it did not allow for a taxpayer to make a partial payment and seek partial relief, as was allowed under a &quot;divisible&quot; tax scheme. The procedures under Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 26-52-507(a) were not applicable because that section applied only to erroneous overpayments of tax. Because the taxpayer was not seeking to hold a tax statute unconstitutional, the trial court did not have jurisdiction under Ark. Const. art. 16, &sect; 13, which gave citizens a right to sue for illegal exaction. There was no legal basis for the taxpayer's contention that the requirement that he pay the taxes or post a bond was a violation of due process.</SPAN></P>

The owners further asserted that their rights to due process and equal protection were denied. On appeal, the court held that although the trial court reached the right result, it should have dismissed the complaint without prejudice pursuant to Ark. R. Civ.

On review, the court held that the circumstantial evidence clearly supported the charge that defendant killed the victim in the course or furtherance of a robbery and that defendant failed to meet his burden of proving his affirmative defense. Because defendant was provided funds for a psychologist even though he had been evaluated by a state hospital, the trial court's refusal to furnish additional funds for a psychiatric expert was not error. Defendant was properly advised of his constitutional rights and his statements were voluntarily given after a short period of detention and without undue or prolonged questioning. The trial court did not err in denying defendant's motion to strike a venireman for cause after finding that he could reach a fair verdict based upon the evidence. Defendant failed to establish a prima facie case of purposeful discrimination in the jury selection; moreover, the State clearly offered a neutral explanation for its challenge of a black panelist.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed. The parents claimed that the Department's prerequisite for continued counseling, that the father admit to child abuse, placed an unreasonable burden on them in order to continue receiving such services. The court noted that the parents overlooked the fact that the two major reasons for removing the children from their home were an unsanitary home environment and the allegation of sexual abuse. The court found that despite 18 months of counseling services provided by the Department, the issue of sexual abuse had not been resolved. The court concluded that the evidence of the Department's efforts to improve the unsanitary home environment and unhealthful living conditions by making homemaker services available, and the Department's attempt at resolving the issue of sexual abuse by providing 18 months of counseling supported the chancellor's findings, and his findings were not clearly against the preponderance of the evidence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In 1988, the landowners filed three separate suits alleging that a tax by the district constituted an illegal exaction because, among other reasons, there was a failure to levy the tax. The actions were later consolidated. Under a special act of the general assembly, Act 103 of 1917, the district obtained a court order authorizing the district to levy and collect a tax for the year 1985. The landowners contended that the tax was authorized and levied only for the year 1985, and yet in subsequent years, the district continued to collect the tax, and that collection such constituted an illegal exaction for all years after 1985. The trial court granted the district's motion for summary judgment and dismissed the case. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded for further proceedings, holding that there was no showing of a valid or lawfully levied tax for the years after 1985 and that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of the district. Also, the court noted that the landowners could not collect refunds for taxes voluntarily paid before the suits were filed even if those taxes were unconstitutional and illegal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the decision of the trial court to dismiss, upon a motion for summary judgment filed by the drainage district, in a consolidated action challenging a tax collected by the district as an illegal exaction. The cause was remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

The conviction and sentence were affirmed on appeal. Petitioner sought to proceed in the Circuit Court of Poinsett County (Arkansas) pursuant to Ark. R. Crim.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Post-conviction proceedings under Ark. R. Crim. P. 37 were civil in nature; therefore, there was no constitutional right to appointment of counsel to prepare a petition under the rule. Petitioner alleged that he was denied due process of law, that the trial court permitted his attorney to stipulate to the validity of certain prior convictions that the state used to enhance his sentences as an habitual offender, that the trial court erred when it denied a pretrial motion to sever from the other charges and hear separately a petition for revocation that the state had filed against him, and that he was not afforded the effective assistance of counsel. The court found that petitioner could not raise the first two issues because he did not object at trial, and all errors prejudicial to petitioner were examined on direct appeal pursuant to Ark. Sup. Ct. &amp; Ct. Appeals R. 11(f). The court noted that counsel was placed in the difficult position of having to defend someone accused of kidnapping and twice raping an 87-year-old woman, that evidence of guilt was overwhelming, and that improvident strategy alone was insufficient to establish ineffective assistance of counsel.</SPAN></P>

A dispute arose over the type of other goods the store would carry, return of goods, and payment. The circuit court rendered judgment for the inventory supplier. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment. The court held that jurisdiction was proper because the action arose from business transactions of the storeowner in Arkansas and satisfied minimum contacts. The court held that the storeowner failed to show the appeals court whether the action was on open account or on contract. Venue would have been proper if the suit were on contract. Therefore, he failed to show that the venue ruling was reversible error. Likewise, the court found no error in the circuit court's refusal to continue the action because the storeowner failed to show that his local counsel was unable to provide adequate representation. Finally, a pending federal court action between the parties did not bar the inventory supplier from pursuing its claims in the circuit court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The ex-wife obtained two judgments against her ex-husband, the employee, for failure to comply with their divorce decree and for attorney's fees.

The employer argued that the ex-wife did not effect service against it pursuant to Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 16-58-124 (1987). The trial court agreed and set aside the default judgments. On appeal, the ex-wife argued that &sect; 16-58-124 was superseded by Ark. R. Civ. P. 4(d)(5). The court agreed and reversed the judgment. However, the court remanded the case because the absence of the corporation's president was never shown. Therefore, it had to be determined whether service upon the corporation's secretary was proper.

Defendant also challenged the jury selection process. The court held that the trial court committed no error in excusing jurors who might have opposed the death penalty, and noted that the trial court was entitled to deference regarding jury selection. Defendant further claimed that the jury ignored mitigating circumstances. The court disagreed, and noted that there was a paucity of mitigating circumstances. Evidence that defendant had corresponded with young people while incarcerated was self-serving rather than mitigating. The prosecutor's racial descriptions of the victims of the robbery in which the murder was committed did not constitute reversible error.

Defendant appealed the conviction. The court determined that Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 16-44-203 (1987), the statute that authorized the videotaping of the testimony of a young victim of a sexual offense, was not an unconstitutional violation of the separation of powers doctrine because it concerned matters of procedure and evidence that rules of court had not preempted. The court found that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to declare the victim incompetent to be a witness. Although the victim stated that she did not know what a lie was or what happened to a person who told one, her overall testimony showed her ability to understand the obligation of an oath and the consequences of false swearing. The court also found that the jury did not hear the victim's taped testimony until defendant had completed his cross-examination and the trial court had ruled the witness competent. The court concluded that there was sufficient evidence to sustain the conviction because the victim's testimony provided a rational basis for the jury to find proof of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">At defendant's trial, a psychological examiner, a physician, and the child's mother were allowed to testify about the child's statements to them under A.R.E. 803(25)(A), which permitted certain hearsay evidence to be admitted in child sexual abuse cases. On appeal, defendant argued that the rule was unconstitutional and if it was ruled constitutional, that the trial court erred in not giving the jury an instruction in accordance with the rule. The court affirmed defendant's conviction. The court first held that the separation of powers doctrine did not preclude the general assembly from enacting the rule. The general assembly's adoption of Rule 803(25)(A) dealt with a matter that court rules did not cover. The court then recognized that the trial court did not give an instruction in accordance with Rule 803(25)(A), but noted that defendant did not ask for such an instruction and did not object to the failure to give it. The trial court was never given the opportunity to correct the error. The court would not consider the matter for the first time on appeal.</SPAN></P>

The tract consisted of two parcels of land. The seller received the tax statement in its name and forwarded the tax statement to the original purchaser, who went to the office of the assessor to ensure the change of ownership. The assessor, however, transferred only one of the parcels. The taxes on the parcel that was not transferred became delinquent and the parcel was certified to the land commissioner for tax sale. The tax sale purchasers bought the parcel at a negotiated sale and notified the original purchaser that they had purchased the parcel and requested the payment of rent. The original purchaser had not been notified of the tax sale and instituted an action to aside the limited warranty deed. The trial court set aside the sale. The court affirmed and held that the original purchaser's good faith attempt to pay his property taxes was not defeated by the assessor's mistake and that he substantially complied with his statutory duty to assess his property by visiting the assessor's office to ensure that the records reflected the change of ownership for the property.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The school district claimed the land under a deed. The title claimants asserted title by adverse possession. The school district filed for summary judgment on the basis of legislation prohibiting claims and defenses of adverse possession when asserted against a school district, which the court granted. The court affirmed. Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 22-1-203 was a clear expression that adverse possession claims would be cut off against school property. The legislation barred claims or defenses of adverse possession against school districts when the right to adverse possession had not yet vested. The title claimants argued that the last sentence of Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 22-1-203(b) expressed the intent to not cut off claims until January 1, 1983, a time by which the claim of the title claimants had vested. However, it was not the intention of the legislature by that sentence to extend claims of adverse possession which had not vested at the time the act became effective. The title claimants' general listing of equitable defenses was not sufficient to warrant reversal on their argument that the circuit court lacked jurisdiction. Other arguments were not preserved on appeal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The county obtained a condemnation award in the county court and the landowners' petition for damages was denied on the basis that the betterments resulting to their property from the condemnation offset the damages they claimed.

On appeal, the court held that the circuit court erred when it denied the Commission's motion to dismiss. The Commission was not a proper party because the record contained no petition by the Commission to the county court. A petition referred to in the record was merely a request by the Commission, made pursuant to Ark. Code. Ann. &sect; 27-67-212(a), for the County to institute the condemnation proceeding.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The bank contested the opening of the branch bank even though the bank itself had recently opened a branch bank in the city where the branch bank's principal bank was located. The bank contended that the order granting approval of the application was in violation of constitutional and statutory provisions and made upon unlawful procedure. The court held that generally, the basic constitutional due process requirements of notice and a reasonable opportunity to be heard were mandatory prerequisites to divest a property owner of his interest. However, the court reasoned that the commissioner's action did not affect the bank's authority or right to conduct its banking operations and the establishment of the branch bank did not constitute unlawful competition. The court held that the commissioner complied with the statutory requirement of notice and a reasonable opportunity to be heard. Finally, the court held that neither the language nor the meaning of Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 23-32-1201 (1989) et seq. was ambiguous, and the commissioner's decision not to have a hearing was within his discretion. Therefore, the court held that the statute was not in violation of constitutional prerequisites.</SPAN></P>

R. Crim. P. 37. He raised many grounds, including, in general, the unconstitutionality of his death sentence, jury errors as to mitigating and aggravating circumstance, and ineffective assistance of counsel in numerous ways.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">One of petitioner's arguments was that, in finding no mitigating circumstances, the jury erred in failing to consider the evidence that he was mentally retarded. The court held that whether mitigating circumstances existed was a factual determination for the jury. The court rejected several arguments because petitioner had not raised them either at trial or on appeal. Even constitutional challenges were deemed waived if not properly preserved, unless they presented a question so fundamental as to render the conviction void. Some constitutional issues had already been decided. Even if some of petitioner's other arguments had merit, he had not shown that any error was prejudicial. As to some of his assertions of ineffective assistance, the court noted that there was a strong presumption that counsel's performance was within the range of reasonable professional services. Matters of strategy would not normally provide grounds for Rule 37 relief. Even if statements by the prosecuting attorney were improper, petitioner made no showing that the statements rendered his trial unfair. The court rejected his other arguments on various grounds.

At trial, the jury was allowed to consider assault and battery as the offenses defendant intended to commit upon entry of the victim's dwelling. The court reversed defendant's conviction, holding that it was improper for the jury to consider burglary as the underlying felony with assault and battery because the assault and battery were not separate from the murder. At the second trial, defendant was again charged with murder committed in the course of burglary and found guilty. On appeal, defendant argued that the court's first reversal amounted to a finding of insufficient evidence and that he had been twice placed in jeopardy. The court ruled that the first case was reversed because of trial error rather than sufficiency of the evidence. The evidence in the first trial was the same as in the second trial. The evidence was sufficient in the first trial to show that defendant unlawfully entered the dwelling with the purposed of committing theft. The evidence was sufficient in the second trial to show the same.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant county citizens sought review of a decision of a trial court (Arkansas), which denied their petition that sought to invalidate the legislation that provided for an election regarding Sunday horse racing and also to enjoin the election. Appellees, an election commission, the city board of directors, and a franchise holder, defended against the action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The election regarding Sunday horse racing was held and the voters approved Sunday racing. The citizens requested the court to set aside the election results. The court first noted that the courts were without authority to enjoin the holding of a regular election, regularly called. On appeal the citizens first argued that the election should have been set aside because the time and manner in which it was called violated the absentee voting provisions, particularly Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 7-5-407(a) (1987), of the state election code. The court determined that the citizens had failed to name even one voter who was disfranchised by the absentee voting procedure employed at the election. The citizens also asserted that the act that allowed the election violated the Arkansas Constitution. The court disagreed and decided that the legislature acted within its authority in passing 1989 Ark. Acts 12 and allowing the voters to approve Sunday racing. There was not a delegation of legislative authority to enact a law. Finally, the court concluded that the emergency clause in Act 12 was not unconstitutional and was valid.</SPAN></P>

Because she fell behind in her rent, the landlord served a notice to vacate upon her. At trial, defendant was convicted of violating Ark. Code. Ann. &sect; 18-16-101 (1987) and fined $ 1,625. Upon review, the county circuit court determined that defendant owed $ 600 and sentenced her to jail for 30 days because she was unable to pay. On appeal, the supreme court affirmed the conviction but reduced the sentence to a fine of $ 25. The court found that there was no dispute that defendant was in arrears when the notice to vacate was served upon her. The court also found that defendant did not establish that there was a settled course of dealing whereby the rent was accepted late without warning or notice objecting to the arrearage or late payments. The court held that because defendant's offense was classified as a violation, she was only subject to punishment in accordance with &sect; 18-16-101.</SPAN></P>

The appeals court held that the charcoal company and the production company complied with the Commission by filing an environmental impact statement and reversed the Commission's cease and desist order. On certiorari, the court affirmed the appeals court's reversal of the cease and decision order but reversed the portion of the judgment applying the Utility Facility Environmental and Economic Protection Act, Ark.

P. 37, petitioner sought post-conviction relief after the court affirmed a finding by a Scott Circuit Court (Arkansas) jury that petitioner was guilty of capital felony murder. The court had previously denied his request to intervene as the next friend in another case, but the United States Supreme Court subsequently granted the petition for certiorari and stayed the execution date for the defendant in the other case.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner claimed that he did not receive a fair trial because, among other contentions, his trial attorney was ineffective by failing to present psychiatric evidence to show either diminished capacity as to his guilt or mitigating circumstances at the penalty phase. Petitioner also contended that he was presently insane. The court felt that the petitioner's case and that of the other defendant were examples of a chain of Arkansas cases that revealed how the state and federal judicial systems had permitted applications for post-convictions remedies to get out of control. The court wondered how petitioner could have standing to intervene on behalf of another defendant if he had a diminished capacity or a psychiatric problem. Believing that Rule 37 had served to allow the review of convictions to become an interminable process, rather than to improve the system of justice, the court abolished Rule 37, effective July 1, 1989; however, persons who had been convicted and sentenced during the existence of Rule 37 could still proceed under the rule. The court also amended Ark. R. Crim. P. 36.4 to provide that a defendant could assert a claim of ineffective counsel on direct appeal.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court denied the petition for post-conviction relief.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of rape, and the court affirmed in a second appeal. The court rejected defendant's contention that his confession stood alone and did not support his conviction under Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 16-89-111(d). There was other proof that the offense was committed from a doctor who testified that the victim told him that he had been having sex with defendant. The victim's statements, as exceptions to the hearsay rule, were substantive evidence. The court also found that corroboration by physical evidence was not required. The victim's recantation offered no obstacle to the court's decision. The court rejected defendant's contention that the State failed to prove that the date of the offense occurred within the statute of limitations as required by Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 5-1-111(d). There was no evidence presented by defendant to indicate that the offense was committed prior to six years of filing the information. The trial court properly refused to permit defendant to voir dire the jurors on questions of law.

In reversing, the court held that reversal was mandated because the Attorney General was not notified in accordance with Ark.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The probate court entered an order appointing a master to hear all juvenile cases in the probate court as provided in 1987 Ark. Acts 14, &sect; 6. The juvenile master of the probate court conducted a hearing. An order, which was signed by the master and by the probate judge, was entered, finding that custody should continue with Human Services and that Human Services should proceed with a petition for guardianship with authority to consent to adoption. On appeal, the court reversed the order and remanded the cause for further proceedings. The court held that the master's participation exceeded the powers which probate courts could vest in juvenile masters. The final order entered by the master reflected his findings and judgments rather than those of the probate judge. 1987 Ark. Acts 14, &sect; 6 constituted an unauthorized grant of legislative authority. 1987 Ark. Acts 14, &sect; 6 was unconstitutional and void because it violated Ark. Const. art. 7, &sect; 34 by creating what amounted to substitute judges. The court held that jurisdiction of the case, which involved dependent-neglected juveniles, was proper in the probate court.</SPAN></P>

Appellants had filed an action against appellees, a city and its police department, to restrain them from releasing the items and certain photographs from the police department's official files.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Prior to his suicide, a man had been one of the estate's executor's clients.

Thereafter, appellants commenced an action against appellees to restrain them from releasing certain items and photographs that were obtained at the dead man's residence. The police department also asked the trial court to rule that it did not have to release information gained from informants. The trial court held that the items, photographs, and information had to be disclosed under the Act. The court granted a temporary stay to prevent disclosure of any of the items. However, the court thereafter dissolved the stay and affirmed the trial court's judgment. The court held (1) that the police and pathologist photographs were public records under a provision of the Act, codified at Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 25-19-103(1) (1987), as such photographs were obviously &quot;otherwise kept&quot; for evidence in criminal cases as an &quot;official function&quot; of a police department; and (2) that the mother's privacy interest in avoiding disclosure of some personal matters was outweighed by the government's interest in disclosure under the Act.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A jury convicted defendant of capital murder, and he was sentenced to life imprisonment without parole. The trial court refused at several stages to rule on whether defendant was mentally competent to stand trial. The court observed that it was the trial court's duty to rule whether an accused was competent to stand trial. Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 5-2-309(a) (1987) provided that if the defendant's fitness to proceed became an issue, it should be determined by the trial court. To leave the matter to the jury was error. The trial court erroneously thought, and stated repeatedly, that the question of competency to stand trial was to be resolved by the jury. Each time the issue was raised, there was additional direct evidence which could have borne on the trial court's decision whether defendant was fit to stand trial. The prejudice was obvious. The court had no choice but to reverse and remand for a new trial. The trial court did not err in refusing to strike the testimony of a witness who invoked her Fifth Amendment privilege. Her answers to questions about her medical history could only have been viewed as affecting the weight of her previous direct testimony as to defendant's condition.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After he was convicted and sentenced to death for capital murder, petitioner requested to proceed in the circuit court for post-conviction relief pursuant to Ark. R. Crim. P. 37 on the claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. Petitioner claimed that counsel was ineffective for failing to introduce evidence in mitigation during the penalty phase, failing to establish that he was incompetent to stand trial, failing to object to certain psychiatric testimony, and failing to make a proper record for a change of venue. The court denied relief in part because the failures would not have prejudiced the defense. The court determined that attacks on the sufficiency of the evidence to convict for capital murder, on proportionality in sentences, and on issues that had been raised and decided on direct appeal were not appropriate under Ark. R. Crim. P. 37. However, the court granted the request and ordered evidentiary hearings on the issue of whether it was ineffective assistance for counsel to fail to request a lesser included offense instruction and to fail to object to the use of petitioner's silence and insistence on counsel as proof that he was not insane at the time of the crime.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant challenged his conviction for murder. The court affirmed defendant's conviction on the grounds that the police officers acted in good faith in arresting him. The arrest was legal because the warrants, issued in another county for burglary and theft, were valid. The fact that a clerk signed them instead of a judge did not invalidate them because it was common for the clerk to sign warrants, and the officers could not have anticipated a federal court determination that the accepted practice would be ruled illegal. Although a copy of the information or affidavit was not attached to the warrant, the omission was not fatal because there was no suggestion that the warrants were baseless or pretextual, and the officers were not even required to have the warrant in their possession to make the arrest. The trial court correctly refused to appoint a psychologist to assist with the preparation of the case because, despite defendant's mild retardation, a state hospital examination revealed, and his confessions reinforced, that he understood right from wrong and he was clear and coherent. The bludgeoning of the victim and subsequent violation of her body warranted the death penalty.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The first hospital operated a psychiatric hospital. The second hospital planned to construct a similar facility in a locale two miles away.

The court reversed that decision and remanded the case to the lower court with instructions to transfer the case to the circuit court, which had original jurisdiction. The court found that the lower court, a chancery court, abused its discretion in exercising jurisdiction. At the time the declaratory judgment action was filed in the lower court, the first hospital's petition for review was pending in circuit court.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court considered a petition for an injunction that prohibited respondent, the Secretary of State, from placing a proposed amendment of the state constitution on the ballot at a general election. Petitioner taxpayers claimed that the popular name and ballot title of the proposed amendment were inaccurate and misleading to such an extent that the voters would not have been able to cast a knowing and intelligent vote on the amendment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The ballot title and popular name of the proposed amendment were submitted to Attorney General and approved under Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 7-9-107 (1987). The popular name of the proposal provided that it was an amendment to repeal the personal property tax on household goods and to consolidate the procedures for motor vehicle registration. The ballot title of the proposal stated that it was a proposed amendment exempting household goods from all ad valorem taxes levied and allowing the General Assembly to establish procedures for assessing and levying ad valorem taxes on motor vehicles at the time of registration. The court dismissed the taxpayers' petition, finding that the popular name and ballot title did not contain misleading language or partisan coloring. The court reasoned that the popular name and the ballot title were intelligible, honest, and impartial. The court noted that the use of the word repeal in the popular name and the use of the word exempt in the ballot title were not misleading because the proposed amendment would have repealed the ad valorem tax on personal property, which would have been exempted from the tax if the proposal was passed in the election.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The commission sought an injunction against the enforcement of the Act because it restricted the commission's power. The court affirmed the decision that &sect; 14, limiting the amount the commission could spend on its magazine, violated the separation of powers doctrine and Ark. Const. amend. 35. The importance of the magazine to the commission's function was a policy decision within the commission's discretion, and the legislature could not substitute its judgment on a question of resource management. The court reversed the decree that the legislature and the commission were entitled to set hunting and fishing license fees, finding that 1987 Ark. Acts 939 &sect; 18 was constitutional because Ark. Const. amend. 35 gave the legislature power to set the maximum fees. The commission was entitled to issue licenses as long as their cost did not exceed the legislative maximum. The court reversed the ruling that 1987 Ark. Acts 939 &sect; 17 was constitutional, holding that the legislative council's practice of reserving &quot;review and advice&quot; power in an appropriated bill violated separation of powers where the &quot;advice&quot; to an executive agency was tantamount to a legislative order.</SPAN></P>

The circuit court determined that the Act was not special or local legislation and refused to enjoin appellees. On appeal, the court reversed and held that it was unconstitutional pursuant to Ark. Const. amend. XIV because there was no rational basis for the classifications and exemptions within it, which created selective application. The court held that fair and adequate representation was not different merely because a city reached a population of 30,000 inhabitants. 1977 Ark. Acts 808 mandated compliance by certain classes of cities, exempted others, and gave several cities the option to either come under the Act or to remain exempt. Even though the theme of the Act may have been to provide fair and adequate representation, arbitrariness remained.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant lessee sought review of an order of the St. Francis Circuit Court (Arkansas), which awarded appellee lessor a default judgment for past due rental payments in the amount of $ 5,250.00. To obtain satisfaction of their judgment, the lessor filed a writ of garnishment against the Agriculture Stabilization and Conservation Service (ASCS), which was holding deficiency and disaster funds payable to the lessee in the sum of $ 10,000.00.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">ASCS ignored the garnishment proceeding and the lessor petitioned the circuit court to compel the lessee to obtain the funds from ASCS and to place them with the registry of the circuit court. The lessee argued that the circuit court had no jurisdiction and that the funds were exempt under federal law. The circuit court agreed that ASCS was not subject to its orders and dismissed the writ of garnishment proceeding, but directed the lessee to deposit the funds, equal to the amount of the judgment, in its registry. The lessee argued that neither ASCS nor its property was subject to attachment, injunction, garnishment, or similar process and that the circuit court's order was an indirect attempt at a process which is prohibited by federal law. The court reversed and held that the lessee's funds from ASCS were subject to legal process by the lessor, and that the lessee's action lied in the chancery court, not circuit. The court held that the type order used here, compelling the appellant to obtain the funds from ASCS and deposit them in the circuit court's registry, was normally one cognizable in equity.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the judgment of the circuit court and remanded the cause to the chancery court.

The lessee filed a counterclaim that asserted that the prejudgment attachment code was unconstitutional and joined the clerk of the trial court. The trial court initially sustained the writ of attachment, but subsequently discharged the writ, entered a judgment in favor of the lessor, and dismiss the lessee's counterclaim. On appeal the court reversed and remanded the trial court's grant of summary judgment in favor of the lessor and dismissal of the lessee's counterclaim against the lessor, but affirmed the dismissal of the court claim against the clerk of the trial court, holding that she was entitled to absolute immunity. The court held that the prejudgment attachment code was unconstitutional because it violated due process by not providing the debtor with a prompt notice or hearing and by allowing the clerk of the trial court issue the writ instead of a judge. The court also held that the trial judge committed reversible error by telling the jury that the writ of attachment was legal.</SPAN></P>

The priest filed a motion to intervene as next of friend, asked for a stay of execution, and asked the court to make appeals mandatory in death sentence cases. The court denied the petition. The court concluded that there was nothing in the priest's petition to indicate that he was the defendant's minister, spiritual adviser, or confidant, or that the two had ever met. The court held that the priest had failed to allege any facts to show that his relationship to defendant was sufficiently close to give rise to next friend status, and it could not have granted him standing on that basis. The court held that the lack of a mandatory appeal in death sentence cases was not unconstitutional where a defendant was able to forego a state appeal if he had been judicially determined to have the capacity to understand the choice between life and death and to knowingly and intelligently waive all rights to appeal his sentence.

Defendant argued that he would not receive a fair trial in the county. On appeal, the court affirmed.

The trial court did not err in refusing to suppress defendant's statements made to police officers because there was simply no evidence of a curtailment of freedom to a degree associated with formal arrest. The trial court did not err in refusing to exclude photographs of the victims and the crime scene because whatever minimal prejudicial effect could have been ascribed to them was clearly outweighed by their relevance and usefulness in enabling the jury to understand the testimony describing the scene and the circumstances surrounding the victims' deaths.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The underlying cause of action involved a moratorium placed upon the city with regard to any medical facilities or expanded facilities. The single issue presented on appeal was whether the operator's motion to intervene should have been granted. The court reversed the judgment of the trial court and held that the trial court erred in denying the operator the right to intervene. The court found that the underlying litigation between appellees was concluded in 22 days. On the day after the judgment, the operator filed its motion to intervene and to reopen on the grounds that its rights were materially affected by the judgment, that the judgment was advisory in that no justiciable controversy existed between the parties, and that the judgment constituted a denial of due process. The court agreed that the speed of the litigation impaired the operator and that the operator's interests were not adequately represented. The court further found that the operator's contention that Ark. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 20-8-101 (1987) et seq., which established the constructive moratorium, was unconstitutional, was never litigated, and that the operator had the right to intervene under Ark.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The circuit court ruled on the motion after a federal court decision declared a portion of the garnishment law unconstitutional. The creditor argued that the federal court held that the garnishment procedure was unconstitutional solely due to lack of notice to a debtor and that a garnishee had no standing to raise that issue. The court reversed and agreed with the creditor. The federal court concluded that the garnishment procedure was unconstitutional only as it affected the rights of debtors. Thus, this court concluded that it was error for the circuit court, on the basis of the federal court's decision, to vacate the default judgment on the garnishee's motion. The debtor did not raise any question about notice or unconstitutionality. The garnishee had no standing to assert the debtor's right to due process. Constitutional rights, including due process guarantees, were personal and could not be asserted by a third party. Moreover, the garnishee could not ordinarily plead a defense, which concerned the debtor only, with respect to the validity of the garnishment proceedings or the creditor's claim against the debtor.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The board claimed that the city failed to make certain contributions to the fund as required by law. The city claimed that it was exempted by law from having to contribute a percentage of the fines collected from violators of municipal ordinances. The trial court found in favor of the city. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that the exempting legislation was not repealed by a subsequent act and could have had a rational basis, and thus it was not in violation of the Arkansas Constitution. The court further held that proffered testimony about the intent of the legislature in passing the exemption was inadmissible and that a new trial on the basis of newly discovered evidence was not justified. The court found that the exempting legislation was in effect when the events relevant to the action occurred. The court concluded that the testimony of the fund administrator was inadmissible because it had no bearing on the issue whether the legislature had a rational basis for enacting the exempting legislation. The court further noted that the administrator's testimony was inconclusive regarding her rationale for determining in one year that more contributions were needed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed his conviction for capital felony murder in the Cross Circuit Court (Arkansas). Defendant argued that his Fourth Amendment rights were violated when he was unlawfully seized at his home and that evidence obtained as a result of that seizure was used against him.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A white store clerk was found bludgeoned and stabbed to death. A policeman and witnesses saw a black man run from the store. Upon seeing a book of photographs, one witness could not identify the man, but she said that defendant looked similar. Based on that evidence, several police required defendant to go to the police station. Defendant was not arrested, but he was advised of his rights. Defendant denied the murder, but admitted going to the convenience store. The witness identified defendant at a lineup, and, after a polygraph test, defendant admitted the crime. Defendant was convicted, and, on appeal, the court reversed. It was error to rule that the police had enough information to detain defendant for investigative purposes because probable cause did not exist. Defendant was seized in his home in violation of the Fourth Amendment. The officers did not comply with Ark. R. Crim. P. 2.3. Evidence gathered later did not bolster the State's case. The lineup identification violated the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments. On remand, the court instructed the trial court to conduct a pretrial hearing to determine whether the in-court identification was tainted by the illegal seizure.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed defendant's conviction, and it remanded for a new trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Subsequent to the passage of Act 746 of 1979, but prior to its effective date, the landowners entered into a contract with the contractor for the construction of a house. The contractor, in turn, entered into an oral agreement with the subcontractor to install the heating and air conditioning systems. The subcontractor supplied materials and labor both before and after October 1, 1979, the effective date of Act 746. He filed suit to perfect his materialman's lien after the contractor was discharged in bankruptcy. The chancery court found that the subcontractor had a valid lien for only the materials and labor furnished before October 1, 1979, because the landowners had not received notice. On appeal, that decision was affirmed. The court found that the chancery court did not err when it found that the action was timely filed because the subcontractor's agreement with the contractor was a single transaction. Furthermore, Act 746 did not violate the Contract Clauses of the Federal and Arkansas Constitutions, U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 10; Ark. Const. art. II, &sect; 17. In that regard, Act 746 did not impair vested rights and only affected the remedy or mode of procedure.</SPAN></P>

The trial court found, in part, that the transactions of certain of the foundation's businesses were subject to sales tax only at wholesale value; it did not assess a penalty for nonpayment. Both parties appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The foundation was a nonprofit organization that, incidental to its charitable purpose, operated businesses for profit that included a restaurant, a grocery store, two service stations, a clothing store, and an auto repair shop. The foundation provided shelter, food, clothing, and other necessities to its associates, who worked at the various businesses without pay or joined or served the foundation. The trial court found that the meals, clothing, goods, and services furnished by the businesses to the foundation's associates were subject to the sales tax, but that meals prepared by the restaurant and delivered to the associates were taxable only at wholesale value. On review, the court agreed with the trial court that the transactions were non-exempt sales and that no penalty should have been assessed, but it held that the meals should have been taxed at retail value. The court found that the transfers to the foundation's associates were given for the valuable consideration of the associates' work and that, once it entered a for profit business, the foundation was subject to the same rules as all secular businesses. It found no authority for taxing the meals at the wholesale value.</SPAN></P>

In reversing the trial court, the court held the Due Process Clause had not been violated because the father's inchoate relationship with the child had not entitled the father to equivalent constitutional protection under the Due Process Clause. The court also held that because the mother had established a custodial relationship with the child and the father had never established such a relationship, the Equal Protection Clause had not prevented the state from according the two parents different legal rights.</SPAN></P>

In seeking review, the department claimed the documents were not subject to disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act (Act).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The department needed the corporation's land for a highway relocation, and prior to the condemnation suit being filed, the corporation requested copies of all appraisals forming the basis for the department's offer to purchase the corporation's land. When the department provided monetary breakdowns for the estimated offer but refused to provide underlying documents, the corporation brought an action, which resulted in an order directing the department to reveal the information. Upon review, the court affirmed, holding the underlying documents had been discoverable under the Act. In so holding, the court found the corporation's demand had not been an abuse of the Act's intent under Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 25-19-102 (1987) because the Act's exceptions under Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 25-19-105 (1987) had not included the information requested. The court also rejected the contention that the documents, in the hands of the attorney general, were privileged because the attorney-client privilege was not one of the Act's exceptions. Finally, the court held that the Act's overall intent included a corporation doing business in the state as a party entitled to information under the Act.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant mother, as next friend of an illegitimate heir, sought review of a judgment of the Union Probate Court (Arkansas) for appellee estate representative. The probate court found that the illegitimate heir was the decedent's child, but that she could not inherit because she had not asserted her claim within 180 days of her father's death as required by Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 28-9-209 (1987) (replacing Ark. Stat. Ann. &sect; 61-141(d) (Supp. 1985)).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The father died intestate leaving an heir and the illegitimate heir who was nine months old. The mother contended that because a legitimate child had a longer period in which to assert his or her claim, the statutory scheme was unconstitutional. On appeal, the court held that Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 28-9-209 (1987) did not violate the Equal Protection Clause of the United States Constitution. The United States Supreme Court had upheld a statute that limited the time an illegitimate child could assert her claim to the lifetime of the father. Because &sect; 28-9-209 provided a longer time period than did the statute approved by the United States Supreme Court so it did not violate the illegitimate heir's right to equal protection under the laws. The 180 day period was not a statute of limitations because it was a condition of a new right that did not exist at common law, so once that 180 day period expired, so did the right for the illegitimate heir to inherit. The contention that the illegitimate child was not given a required notice of the administration could not be raised on appeal because it was not raised in the probate court.</SPAN></P>

The teacher filed suit challenging the school district's decision not to renew her contract. The trial court affirmed the decision. On further appeal, the teacher argued that the school district's residency policy was unconstitutional under Ark. Const. art. II, &sect; 18, and was discriminatory and unreasonable under the Teacher Fair Dismissal Act, Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 6-17-1510. The court affirmed the trial court's decision. The court reviewed the residency policy under a rational basis test and found that the teacher had failed to meet her burden of proving that the residency policy was not rationally related to achieving any legitimate objective of government under any reasonably conceivable state of facts. The court further found that the residency policy was not discriminatory even though it did not apply to non-certified personnel or to part-time employees.</SPAN></P>

However, the court held that the attorney's fee was limited to a quantum meruit recovery for the reasonable value of the attorney's services. The court reiterated that contingency contracts for legal services were valid and enforceable, and when those services were performed as contemplated in the contract, the attorney was entitled to the fee fixed in the contract and to the lien granted by Ark.

The court held that the trial court had jurisdiction to decide the student's request for injunctive relief. The board had the discretion to enforce school policy, and whether the student violated that policy was a contested issue between the parties. The student's recourse was to establish her right to continue in school by showing that she did not violate the policy or that the board acted arbitrarily or capriciously. The court concluded that the trial court erred in ordering the board to readmit the student into school. The board did not act arbitrarily or capriciously.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The victim went to the hospital and was seen by the doctor and prescribed an antipsychotic drug, and, after he returned home, he died of a ruptured ulcer and peritonitis. The estate administrator brought an action against the doctor for malpractice. The doctor made a motion for summary judgment, and the trial court granted it. The administrator appealed, and the court reversed the judgment from below. The administrator had furnished the deposition of an expert to show that the doctor had not met the appropriate standard of care because he had failed to do certain laboratory tests, record an adequate history, and observe the outward appearances of chronic illness calling for a more thorough examination. According to the court, this testimony was sufficient to create a fact question to be submitted to the jury. Ark. Stat. Ann. &sect; 34-2615(c) gave a privilege to medical-care providers not to give expert opinion testimony on whether or not they met the standard of care, and the court ruled that the trial court did not err in denying the administrator the doctor's deposition to defeat the summary-judgment motion, but the court did not address the constitutionality of &sect; 34-2615(c).</SPAN></P>

It specifically mentioned decedent's daughter and disinherited her. The will did not mention the decedent's son who predeceased the decedent. When the decedent died the grandchildren, who were the children of the decedent's son, were determined to be pretermitted heirs. The executor appealed. On appeal, the court affirmed finding that because neither the son nor the grandchildren were mentioned in the will, the pretermitted heir statute applied and gave them a share of the estate. The court found that the pretermitted heir statute was constitutional and rejected all of the executor's arguments to the contrary.</SPAN></P>

The executor and the son were unable to agree on the manner of disposing of the land in question. The trial court directed the executor to make written proposals to the son, which he did. Thereafter, the executor petitioned the trial court to sell the land to an individual, and the son petitioned the trial court to require that the land be sold to him. The executor asserted that the son was not making a timely offer on the land. The trial court ordered that the land be sold at public sale. The land was sold at public sale, and the son appealed. The court affirmed. The court held that proposals made in the executor's letter to the son were palpably reasonable and demonstrated a fair effort to keep the land in the hands of one of the brothers. The court held further that because the son did not raise at the trial level his argument regarding the constitutionality of Ark. Stat. Ann. &sect; 62-2016 f. (Repl. 1971), which permitted a fiduciary, such as an executor, to obtain a stay without bond, the argument could not be reviewed on appeal.</SPAN></P>

The variance at issue related to applicable air pollution controls on the manufacturer's kilns.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The manufacturer's charcoal making kilns were not in compliance with the Commission's regulations limiting the amount of air pollution that could be emitted. The manufacturer sought a variance from the regulation that would permit it to replace the kilns and keep them exempt from the requirements unless the cost of replacement exceeded 50 percent of the replacement cost of the existing facility, at which point the air emission controls would have to be installed. The Commission granted a lesser variance and the manufacturer appealed. The trial court reversed the Commission's order on the ground that the Commission had failed to given proper consideration to the threat to the economies of the community caused by imposing strict compliance with the regulations. The Commission appealed. The court stated that the trial court's reason for reversing was not one of the grounds upon which review of a Commission order was permitted under Art. Stat. Ann. &sect; 82-106(7)(d), which governed judicial review of a Commission order. The court noted further that the Commission had not required strict compliance and had apparently considered the hardship evidence in granting the substantial variance.</SPAN></P>

The court held that nothing contained within Ark. Const. art. 35, &sect; 8 prevented the commission from making a zone of a single lake. Furthermore, the commission did not abuse its discretion in doing so. The expert testimony at the chancery court was that creating regulations for each lake was environmentally sound. The commission was exercising its expertise in a way that is not only reasonable but also laudable in the opinion of wildlife and fishing professionals.

At trial, the State was permitted, over defendant's objection, to play videotaped interviews of the child by a juvenile probation officer. Defendant was convicted of carnal abuse. The court reversed the conviction. The appropriate procedure for presenting videotaped testimony of a child victim of sexual abuse was provided for under Ark. Stat. Ann. &sect; 43-2036 (Supp. 1985). This procedure, however, was not complied with. Thus, the trial court erred in admitting the videotapes into evidence. Such error was prejudicial, as it denied defendant the right to cross-examine the child at the time of the interviews. The trial court properly allowed other witnesses to testify as to statements made to them by the child with respect to the abuse because the trial court's consideration of the admissibility thereof met the requirements of Ark. R. Evid. 803(25). The application of Rule 803(25) to defendant did not violate the constitutional prohibition against ex post facto laws, as the State was required to prove the same facts at the trial as it was before Rule 803(25) was enacted.</SPAN></P>

Defendant argued, inter alia, that the trial court erred in admitting hearsay evidence without first determining the child's reliability in accordance with Ark. R. Evid. 803(25)(A)(1)(j).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The child was placed in a daycare operated by defendant's mother. Upon her inquiry, he allegedly told his mother that defendant had touched his genitals, had performed oral sex on the child, and forced the child to perform oral sex on him. Although the child was not called to testify at a pretrial hearing to determine whether witnesses to whom the child recounted the allegations would be permitted to testify at trial pursuant to Ark. R. Evid. 803(25), the trial court ruled such testimony admissible. The child and the hearsay witnesses testified at trial. On appeal of defendant's conviction, the court held that although Rule 803(25) intended that the trial judge form his own conclusions of the trustworthiness of the statements by observing the child as a witness, there was substantial compliance with the Rule when the child took the stand at trial. The court further held that because the statements allegedly made by the child were made within a few months of the alleged events, they were not so remote as to warrant exclusion. Finally, the court held that proffered testimony from the defense that the child learned about oral sex from another source was collateral and irrelevant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed his conviction by a jury in the Poinsett Circuit Court (Arkansas), for the rape of a nine-year-old boy, in violation of Ark. Stat. Ann. &sect; 43-1015 (Repl. 1977). Defendant argued that it was prejudicial error for the trial court to permit the physician who examined the boy to state that the boy had been sexually abused.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The evidence at trial consisted of the physician's testimony about what the boy told him and his opinion that the boy had been abused, statements of several persons about what the boy told them when he accused defendant and when he recanted, and police officers' testimony that during questioning, defendant admitted to rubbing his penis around the boy's anus. The doctor found no evidence of sexual assault, but he gave his opinion that an act had occurred that was detrimental to the boy's health. On appeal, the court held that it was prejudicial error for the trial court to have permitted the physician who examined the boy to state that the boy had been sexually abused. The court determined that the other evidence of defendant's guilt was not so overwhelming so as to make the error in admitting the doctor's opinion non-prejudicial. The court also ruled that on retrial, the testimony as to the boy's statements of sexual abuse were not inadmissible because the boy was not unavailable. The court reasoned that in sexual abuse cases, as in cases involving conspirators, the boy's statements of abuse to other persons derived significance from the circumstances in which they were made.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed defendant's conviction for rape and remanded to the trial court for a new trial.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant sought review of a judgment by the Benton Circuit Court (Arkansas), which convicted him of capital felony murder, attempted first degree murder, burglary, and attempted capital murder.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant approached the truck of his ex-sister-in-law and ex-father-in-law. Defendant shot at them and then chased his ex-father-in-law into his house. Later, his ex-father in-law and his ex-mother-in-law were found shot dead. On appeal, the court held that the trial court erred in not directing a verdict on the capital murder charges. The court held that the victims' deaths were not caused in the course of and in furtherance of a burglary as required by Ark. Stat. Ann. &sect; 41-1501(1)(a) (1977). The court held the State elected to proceed under &sect; 41-1501(1)(a) and that defendant could have been charged under Ark. Stat. Ann. &sect; 41-1501(1)(c) for causing the death of two or more persons in the course of the criminal episode. The court concluded that defendant entered the house for the purpose of committing the murders. The court also held that the trial court erred in submitting an instruction on previously committed felonies under Ark. Stat. Ann. &sect; 41-1303(3) as an aggravating circumstance at the penalty phase of his trial because there was no evidence that defendant previously committed another felony, other than the shooting that was contemporaneous with the murders.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed defendant's capital murder convictions. The court otherwise affirmed defendant's convictions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Shortly before the forum state repealed its guest statute, an insured passenger, who had uninsured motorist coverage in a foreign state that did not have a guest statute, was injured in a vehicle driven by an uninsured motorist in the forum state. The insured subsequently filed a claim against her insurer under the provision of her uninsured motorist coverage, which was purchased in the foreign state for coverage on a vehicle registered in the foreign state. The insurer contended that the forum state's guest statute should apply to bar the passenger's recovery. The insured contended that the lower court erred in applying the forum state's substantive law to bar her claim. After considering and weighing all five choice-influencing choice of law considerations, the court held that it was clear that the substantive law of the foreign state should apply. Most significant among the considerations was a finding that the foreign state's law was the better rule of law due to a previous finding that the forum state's guest statute was archaic and unfair, which resulted in its repeal.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the lower court's holding that the forum state's substantive law should apply and remanded.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant medical services provider brought an action in the Pulaski Circuit Court, Second Division (Arkansas) against appellee individuals arising from certain medical treatment and the payment thereof. The circuit court ruled that the claim was brought after the applicable 18-month limitation period under 1983 Ark. Acts 638, codified as Ark. Stat. Ann. &sect; 37-245(a) (Supp. 1985). The provider challenged the constitutionality of the Act.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Act provided that claims for charges for medical services performed or provided prior to April 1, 1985 had to be brought within 18 months. The provider argued that the legislation created an inferior class of medical services because it imposed upon them a shorter limitation than had been imposed upon other creditors similarly situated. The court had previously upheld the Act against the same constitutional argument. No evidence was presented to show that the general assembly did not have or could not have had a reasonable basis for finding, that medical services were traditionally provided under special circumstances deemed sufficient for medical providers to be in a different category from other creditors who performed services and sell goods to the public. Before the court declared an act of the general assembly unconstitutional, there had to be clear and strong evidence that it was incompatible with the Constitution, and the court resolved all doubts in favor of the constitutionality of the act in question.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the decision of the circuit court.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed judgment of the trial court that sentenced defendant to death and remanded to the trial court for a hearing to resentence defendant, holding that evidence that mitigated against the death penalty should have been presented to the jury and that defendant's good conduct while waiting for his resentencing was relevant to the mitigation of the death penalty.
