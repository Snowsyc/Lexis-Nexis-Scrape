</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant county challenged a judgment of the 112th District Court of Upton County (Texas), which found that appellant violated the Whistleblower Act (Act), Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 6252-16a (recodified as Tex. Gov't Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 554.001-.009 (1994)), and 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983, when it terminated appellee decedent from employment. The jury awarded damages against appellant for violating the Act and for infringing appellee's free speech rights.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant county fired appellee decedent after he reported safety violations, misuse of county property and personnel, and other misconduct. Appellee died after filing an action under the Whistleblower Act (Act), Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 6252-16a (recodified as Tex. Gov't Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 554.001-.009 (1994)), that was later amended to add a claim under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983. At trial, appellee prevailed on both claims. The court affirmed on appeal. Rejecting appellant's statute of limitations arguments, the court held that appellee timely filed the initial claim because he immediately grieved his termination to appropriate county officials, which tolled the filing time by thirty days. The &sect; 1983 free speech claim was timely because it related back to the initial filing date. Relying on the Survival Statute,&nbsp;Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann. &sect; 71.021 (1986), and the remedial purposes of the Act and &sect; 1983, the court held that both actions survived appellee's death. The statute requiring claims to be presented to the commissioner's court before filing suit was held inapplicable. Concluding that the evidence in support of the judgment was sufficient, the court affirmed the judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Affirming the judgment, the court held that appellee's free speech and whistleblower claims were not time-barred; nor were they subject to a statute requiring claims to be presented to the commissioner's court prior to filing suit. Relying on the Texas Survival Statute, the court held that both claims survived appellee's death. The court also held that sufficient evidence was presented at trial to support the jury's findings.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 101.04 (1995) did not provide that refusal to permit inspection was a code violation, Tex. Alco. Bev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 61.71, 61.77 provided that a refusal to permit an inspection constituted a violation of the code.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant employer challenged the decision of the 93rd District Court of Hidalgo County (Texas), which rendered judgment in favor of appellee employee on common law and statutory claims for sexual harassment and related intentional torts.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant employer was held liable for claims of sexual harassment and related intentional torts arising from the rape of appellee employee by her supervisor. The court affirmed the judgment. It found there was sufficient evidence to support a finding that appellee was constructively discharged because the rape occurred in the course of a business outing, she was unable to report the rape because the rapist was the person to whom she was to report the incident, and appellant responded to the rape report by putting appellee on administrative leave. The court held this would compel a reasonable person in employee's position to resign. The court upheld the award of future lost earnings because it was a legitimate exercise of the trial court's equity. It held the award of punitive damages was not unconstitutional because the trial court's instruction placed reasonable constraints on the exercise of the jury's discretion and the award was based on objective criteria. The court determined that the calculation of attorney fees was proper and that appellate attorney fees were properly awarded because they were conditioned on appellate success.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant juvenile was adjudicated a delinquent for committing murder and sentenced to the Texas Youth Commission.

Thus, the petition upon which he was transferred to prison was an indictment under the language of Tex. Fam. Code &sect; 53.045(d).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">During appellee's term as county commissioner, he was investigated for misconduct.

Appellee filed a motion to quash the indictments, claiming the district court had no authority to impanel a second grand jury during a regular term of court. After examining Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 19.01 et seq., the district court agreed with appellee and granted the motion to quash the indictments on grounds the second grand jury was unlawfully impaneled. On appeal, the court affirmed, finding no statutory authority to permit a district court to impanel more than one grand jury during a regular term of court.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review from the 329th District Court of Wharton County (Texas), which convicted him of burglary pursuant to Tex.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of burglary. Pursuant to Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 30.02 (1994), appellant's prior burglary conviction elevated his second offense to a first-degree felony and enhanced his sentence to a term of 75 years in prison. Appellant sought review of the sentence pursuant to U.S. Const. amend. VIII. The court determined that, although the Eighth Amendment disfavored imposition of a sentence that was grossly disproportionate to the severity of the crime, substantial deference should be given to the trial court. The court determined that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in sentencing appellant in compliance with the statute. The court held that the Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause was not automatically violated when the trial court imposed a penalty greater than that imposed for an offense of equal or greater gravity. The court determined that the state statute was constitutional and affirmed the judgment of the lower court.</SPAN></P>

Penal Code Ann. &sect; 31.03(e)(1) (1994, Supp. 1997). Appellant claimed Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 45.17 (1979) complaint was vague and violated his rights under Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 21.04 (1989), U.S. Const. amend. V, and Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 19.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was charged by complaint of theft of property under $ 20 in violation of Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 31.03(e)(1) (1994 and Supp. 1997), and appealed to the county court for a trial de novo when the justice court convicted him of the offense. The county court denied appellant's motion to quash the complaint and sentenced him pursuant to a plea agreement. On appeal, the court held that although the complaint followed the procedural form required by Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 45.17, and although the complaint to the justice court did not need to show the same specificity required by an indictment or information, the complaint did not allege how the property was stolen and did not describe the stolen property with specificity. Thus, the complaint did not meet the specificity requirements of Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 21.04 (1989) of U.S. Const. amend V and XIV or Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 19. However, Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 44.181(a) (Supp. 1997) prohibited the county court from dismissing an appeal from the justice court because of a defective complaint. Therefore, the court affirmed the judgment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment that denied appellant's motion to quash and convicted him of theft of property under $ 20. The court held that although the complaint was defective because it was insufficiently specific, because the complaint was filed in the justice court, the county court was statutorily precluded from dismissing the complaint when appellant appealed his justice court conviction for a trial de novo in the county court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants business property owners sued appellee city under the Texas Tort Claims Act (act), Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann. &sect; 101.001 et seq., for damages to their business property. Appellants also alleged an unconstitutional taking of that property. The lower court granted appellee's summary judgment motion. This appeal followed. Appellants contended summary judgment was improper because they stated a cause of action under the act, sovereign immunity did not protect appellee, and appellee failed to meet its summary judgment burden by establishing that no genuine issue of material fact existed as to its affirmative defenses or at least one element of each of appellants' causes of action. Since the lower court did not specify upon what basis it granted judgment for appellee, the court evaluated every theory set forth in appellee's motion to determine if summary judgment was proper. The court noted that appellee failed to offer any summary judgment proof to dispute appellants' charge. Further, appellee failed to establish its affirmative defense of sovereign immunity as a matter of law.</SPAN></P>

After a hearing, the trial court revoked appellant's probation on the harassment charge and sentenced him to 150 days of incarceration. However, the trial court continued appellant's probation for the stalking charge. Appellant then filed an application for a writ of habeas corpus, challenging the constitutionality of &sect; 42.07. The trial court granted appellant's application to the extent of the stalking conviction and denied it as to the harassment conviction. As a result, appellant sought review, claiming &sect; 42.07 was unconstitutionally vague on its face in violation of U.S. Const. amends. I and XIV. On review, the court affirmed the denial of appellant's request because appellant failed in his burden of demonstrating &sect; 42.07(a)(4) was unconstitutional as it was applied to him.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following a judgment by the Texas Supreme Court that past surety bond fees paid by appellant bail bond companies were illegal, the case was remanded to the trial court for determination of whether appellants were entitled to refunds. The trial court entered a final take-nothing summary judgment in favor of appellees, sheriff and county, and appellants sought review. The court affirmed in part, reversed in part and remanded in part. The court, inter alia, affirmed the summary judgment in favor of the county finding that appellee county was not a proper party to this suit. The court held that acts performed by officials that were subsequently declared to lack statutory authority could not be attributed to a unit of state government, and therefore could not be a party to the action. The court affirmed the summary judgment in favor of appellee sheriff in his individual capacity, but reversed as to his official capacity. The Texas Supreme Court's invalidation of the bail bond fees applied retroactively. Appellants demonstrated that they paid the bond approval fees under implied duress, and thus they were entitled to a refund. The action was remanded to determine the amount of refund.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of the judgment of the 290th Judicial District Court, Bexar County, Texas, which found appellant guilty of misapplication of fiduciary property of the value of $ 200 or more but less than $ 10,000, contending that an incorrect standard was applied in determining that appellant was a fiduciary, that no agreement existed under which appellant held property, and that the restitution order was unsupported by the evidence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant worked at a plumbing supply store as a store clerk. When his employer noticed shrinkage in the inventory, an investigation was conducted, which revealed that appellant had been making off-premises sales of his employer's supplies. Appellant was convicted of misapplication of fiduciary property of the value of $ 200 or more but less than $ 10,000, placed on community supervision, and ordered to pay restitution. On appeal, the court affirmed the conviction, holding that the essential elements for a finding of a violation of Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 32.45 were met. The evidence showed that appellant acted in a fiduciary capacity in that he worked in a position of trust and received money on behalf of his employer. In that capacity, he misapplied property contrary to a duty created by the understanding between himself and his employer as to appellant's duties as a store clerk with regard to the handling of money and the control and access to the inventory. The court reversed the monetary restitution order for losses independent of the charged offenses where the bulk of the restitution payment was awarded to a non-victim, contrary to Tex. Code Crim. P. Ann. art. 42.037.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed appellant's conviction of misapplication of fiduciary property, holding that the evidence was sufficient to show that appellant, in a fiduciary capacity, violated the law by selling his employer's supplies on the side. The court reversed a restitution order as improperly entered because restitution to insurance company was unavailing under applicable law.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the conviction. The statute prohibited delivery, which was defined by Tex. Health &amp; Safety Code Ann. &sect; 481.002(8) to include offering to sell a controlled substance. Further, the court found that the term offer meant both verbal conduct alone and actual presentation of a controlled substance.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from the judgment of the 209th District Court of Harris County (Texas) that imposed a jury assessed sentence of 17 years imprisonment for non-capital murder, following the admission, over defendant's objection, of victim impact testimony from the victim's sister during the punishment phase of defendant's trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of murder and sentenced to 12 years imprisonment, but the sentence was reversed on appeal and remanded for resentencing. At the new penalty phase hearing before the jury, the trial court admitted into evidence certain victim impact testimony from the victim's sister. The jury assessed punishment at 17 years imprisonment and defendant appealed, arguing that the victim impact evidence was irrelevant and inadmissible. In affirming, the court ruled that, pursuant to Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 37.07, &sect; 3(a) (Supp. 1997), evidence relevant to sentencing included evidence concerning the circumstances of the offense. It was not an abuse of discretion to admit the victim impact evidence here because the impact that the offense had on the victim's sister was relevant as a circumstance of the offense because it bore on defendant's personal responsibility and moral guilt. The prejudicial effect of such evidence did not outweigh its probative value under Tex. R. Crim. Evid. 403.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The sentence was affirmed because it was not abuse of discretion for the trial court to admit victim impact testimony during the punishment phase; such evidence was relevant to sentencing since the effect of the offense on others is a circumstance of the offense that may be considered by the jury in assessing punishment.</SPAN></P>

Loc. Gov't Code Ann. &sect; 42.024 (1997) was a local law regulating appellant's affairs in violation of Tex. Const. art. III, &sect; 56.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a suit against appellant releasing municipality, appellee adopting municipality's sought a declaratory judgment regarding the constitutionality of Tex. Loc. Gov't Code Ann. &sect; 42.024 (1997). The statute permitted a municipality to compel the transfer a municipality's unincorporated area adjacent and contiguous to its corporate boundaries that was declared extraterritorial jurisdiction upon satisfaction of certain requirements. The trial court upheld the constitutionality of &sect; 42.024 and appellant sought review therefrom. The court reversed the decision, sustaining appellant's argument that &sect; 42.024 was a local law targeting a single geographic area and was of no statewide significance in violation of Tex. Const. art. III, &sect; 56. Although the court found no fault with the statute's general purpose of curbing abusive extraterritorial jurisdiction practices, the statute's classifications relating to requirements of limited-purpose annexation, electric utility ownership, and transbasin diversion permits had no reasonable basis. Further, the requirements did not legitimately distinguish the parties from other municipalities with regard to the statute's public purpose.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the declaratory judgment in favor of appellee adopting municipality, holding that challenged statute was unconstitutional. The statute, which singled out a particular local area for special treatment without a reasonable basis for doing so violated the prohibition against special, rather than general local laws.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the jury was properly instructed that appellants could not be civilly liable unless they were aware that the expenditures were in violation of the election code. The court also found that there was sufficient evidence to support the jury's findings that one of the appellants knowingly violated the election code. Because the record was completely devoid of evidence that the other appellant participated in the expenditures with knowledge that they were in violation of the election code, the judgment against her was reversed.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After pleading guilty without an agreed recommendation as to punishment, the trial court granted appellant deferred adjudication on an aggravated robbery charge. The state later filed a motion to adjudicate guilt and the trial court assessed punishment at eight-years confinement. The court affirmed appellant's conviction. Appellant, by his guilty plea, waived his right to argue that the statutory procedure for the acceptance of his guilty plea was unconstitutional and that the trial court erred in entering a judgment when the record was silent as to a waiver of his right to compulsory process and to present evidence on his behalf. Error that could be raised on appeal despite a guilty plea was error of a constitutional dimension. Both of appellant's complaints went to presenting evidence and witnesses to the court. Neither involved questions of the court's jurisdiction, nor questioned the constitutionality of the statute prescribing his offense. By not objecting in the trial court to the alleged disproportionality of his sentences, appellant waived any error with respect thereto. Appellant failed to establish the ineffectiveness of counsel during the trial's punishment phase.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant juvenile argued that his adjudication of delinquency for the aggravated sexual assault of two female juveniles was improper because the trial judge did not give him every admonishment required by Tex.

Appellant was represented by counsel and did not argue that he was harmed by the trial judge's failure to completely admonish him. Appellant did not give up any rights based on the incomplete admonishments. Cases cited by appellant that mandated reversal were distinguishable because they were cases where no admonishments were given at all. Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 22.021(a)(2)(B) (1997) was constitutional because classifications based on age for offenses involving deviant sexual acts furthered the state's legitimate interest in protecting children.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Disciplinary proceedings were instituted against appellant lawyer for charging excessive fees and failing to account for costs in connection with his representation of five women on a sexual harassment claim. The trial court ordered a suspension of appellant's license with part to be active, and the remainder to be probated subject to various terms. The probation was subsequently revoked. Appellant challenged both rulings, arguing there was no finding of just cause and the unwillingness of the women to sign the complaint. The court held that the Commission for Lawyer Discipline found just cause was shown and that no abatement of an inquiry was justified. The five women had hired an attorney to sue appellant to get an accounting of the fees and expenses in their litigation with their former employer. This was legally sufficient evidence that appellant violated the disciplinary rules. Appellant had been afforded due process during the proceedings. When he failed to comply with the terms of his suspension, the probation period was properly revoked.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged his conviction and life sentence for first-degree murder on the basis that his right to equal protection was violated by the county's grand juror selection process, and that the trial court erred in not granting his motion to transfer venue. The court held that appellant did not establish a prima facie case of an equal protection violation. The court, applying a three-pronged test, held that Spanish-surnamed Americans of Mexican descent were recognized as a clearly identifiable class with a history of being subject to discriminatory treatment, and that the &quot;key-man&quot; system, where a district judge is appointed to maintain a list of prospective jurors, was susceptible to abuse. The court held, however, that appellant failed to establish that the class had been underrepresented on the county grand juries by a legally significant amount over a legally significant period of time. The court reversed appellant's conviction on the basis that appellant's uncontroverted motion for change of venue complied with Tex. Code Crim. Proc.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant patient sought review of a summary judgment from the Civil Court at Law No. 4, Harris County, Texas, entered on appellee dentist's motion in appellant's malpractice suit. Appellant contended that the limitations period in Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. art. 4590i, &sect; 10.01 (Supp. 1997) had not run on her claim.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A fax letter adduced in evidence at summary judgment indicated that appellant patient knew that appellee dentist had cracked the root of her tooth at the time that it happened, and that, in fact, she had told him so at that time. In light of the two year limitations period of Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. art. 4590i, &sect; 10.01 (Supp. 1997), an action commenced by appellant more than three years after this dental surgery was untimely, and the court affirmed the summary judgment for appellee. The court held that although art. 4590i, &sect; 10.01, contained three variants for determining when a cause of action accrued, it was clear that if a specific instance of negligence was alleged the cause of action arose at that incident. The court noted that the complaint alleged no other negligence, and although it did relate certain additional treatment provided by appellee, or in some cases that he failed to provide, this was not a case involving a course of treatment. Because appellant was immediately aware that something went wrong, there was no issue of discovery or concealment, and there was no question of a violation of the Texas constitutional open courts provision.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff nonresident appealed from the order of the 114th District Court of Smith County (Texas) that sustained the special appearance of defendants foreign journalist, foreign editor, and foreign magazine, pursuant to Tex. R. Civ. P. 120(a), and dismissed, for lack of personal jurisdiction, plaintiff's action alleging that defendant foreign journalist slandered plaintiff during a telephone call from Belgium to two residents of Texas.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff nonresident brought a defamation action in Texas court against defendants foreign journalist, foreign editor, and foreign magazine. The complaint alleged that defendant foreign journalist had telephoned two Texas residents from Belgium and slandered plaintiff. The parties were all Belgian residents and none of them engaged in any business in Texas. Accordingly, defendants filed a special appearance pursuant to Tex. R. Civ. P. 120(a) and moved for dismissal for lack of personal jurisdiction. The trial court sustained the special appearance and dismissed the complaint. Plaintiff appealed. In affirming, the court ruled that defendants had not established sufficient minimum contacts with Texas and an assertion of long-arm personal jurisdiction over defendants by Texas courts, where the only contact was a telephone call, would violate traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice so as to deny defendants due process of law. The state of Texas had no substantial interest in the dispute, there was no showing that there was not a convenient forum in Belgium, and it was unreasonable to require defendants to defend themselves in a Texas court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order sustaining defendants' special appearance and dismissing plaintiff's complaint was affirmed because plaintiff failed to show defendants had sufficient minimum contacts with Texas and the assertion of jurisdiction would not comport with notions of fair play and substantial justice; long-arm jurisdiction was not established when all the parties were nonresidents and the only contact with Texas involved a telephone call into the state.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state appealed from the 366th District Court, Collin County (Texas), which dismissed prosecution against appellee and barred further prosecution. The state asserted error where appellee was indicted before a habeas corpus hearing, Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 32.01and 28.061 (1989) were in violation of the separation of powers doctrine, and the trial court abused its discretion in finding no good cause for delay of the indictment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee was arrested and indicted for sexual assault and for aggravated sexual assault. Appellee filed an application for writ of habeas corpus requesting that the sexual assault indictment be dismissed because the state had not obtained the indictment pursuant to Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 32.01 (1989). The lower court dismissed the prosecution pursuant to art. 32.01 and barred further prosecution pursuant to Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 28.061 (1989). The state sought review. On appeal, the court reviewed the timing of grand jury indictments and the rules governing dismissal in detail. The court determined that the state was entitled to protection under the separation of powers doctrine and art. 28.061 violated the separation of powers doctrine. As such, the law was unconstitutional. Also, because the state could proceed with its case against an accused and seek an indictment after a dismissal under art. 32.01, appellee was required to obtain a ruling on his art. 32.01 motion before the grand jury returned an indictment or the question was moot. Therefore, the court reversed the order dismissing the indictments against appellee and remanded the cases for trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court's order dismissing the indictments for sexual assault and aggravated sexual assault against appellee and remanded the cases for trial because the criminal rule limiting appellee's prosecution under the facts of the case violated the separation of powers doctrine and was therefore unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant city challenged a judgment from the 140th Judicial District Court of Lubbock County (Texas), which granted appellee officers' motion for summary judgment and declared Tex.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court granted appellee officers' motion for summary judgment against appellant city, declared Tex. Loc. Gov't. Code Ann. &sect; 143.057 (1988) constitutional, and issued a writ of mandamus ordering the city to comply with the statute. Appellant challenged the order, contending the statute was unconstitutional because it deprived them of their due process and equal protection rights and conferred legislative authority on a private entity without providing guidelines for the selection of arbitrators. The court reversed the trial court's judgment. First, the court overruled appellant's contention that its rights had been violated because appellant was a political subdivision of the state and could not assert rights of a person. Secondly, the court held that appellant had standing to challenge the statute because it affected appellant's interests, where the city had a duty to operate within the confines of the state law, when it believed the state law to be unconstitutional. Finally, the court held the statutory language was impermissibly vague as to the qualifications of the arbitrators, and because no standards were set forth by the legislature, &sect; 143.057 was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court's grant of summary judgment in favor of appellee officers'. The underlying statute regarding the qualifications of arbitrators to hear appellees' grievances was vague and unconstitutional. Additionally, the court reasoned that appellant city had standing to challenge the statute where its interests were adversely affected when the statute failed to provide guidelines for the arbitrators.</SPAN></P>

The court examined the details of the interrogation and found that appellant was given proper warnings and the court found that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by concluding that appellant knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily waived his statutory and constitutional rights before giving his oral and written confessions. The court also examined issues regarding the jury and found that, although a juror was excludable due to a criminal record, the fact that the juror remained on the panel was not in and of itself reversible error.

Appellant challenged the trial court's ruling in that it denied his request for damages. Under Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat.

The court held that recovery of the $ 100 reward was conditioned on the successful maintenance of a suit and that because appellant had not succeeded in his suit, he was not eligible to recover the reward.

Prac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann. &sect; 16.009 (1986). The trial court correctly ruled for appellees because they proffered uncontroverted proof that their improvements were substantially completed more than 10 years before appellants brought the action. The court ruled that each appellee's substantial completion of its share of the project constituted an improvement to real property which then triggered the statute of repose. Therefore, the court rejected appellants' contention that the statute was not triggered until the entire construction project was completely finished and held that appellants' action was time-barred.

He also claimed that &sect;&sect; 502.002, 545.351 violated his constitutional right to travel on public roads. The court affirmed the judgment of defendant's guilt on grounds that the county court had jurisdiction over defendant, as he could not unilaterally immunize himself from the laws of the state. The county court was under no obligation to prove its jurisdiction and Tex. Transp. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 502.002, 545.351 (1997) was a valid constitutional exercise of the state's police power. The court noted that driving was a privilege, not a constitutionally protected right, and that motor vehicle registration fees were a constitutional levy on the privilege of operating a motor vehicle on public roads.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment upon a jury verdict finding defendant guilty of speeding and operating an unregistered motor vehicle was affirmed where the county court had jurisdiction over defendant, as he could not unilaterally immunize himself from the laws of the state. The statute under which defendant was found guilty was a constitutional exercise of the state's police power, and the county court was under no obligation to prove its jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed, rejecting appellant's contention that the trial court erred in ruling that he was required to prove actual damages in order to recover under the Act. He contended that a person who established a violation of the Act was automatically entitled to the measure of damages set forth in subsection (c) thereof without regard to whether the person had suffered actual damages. The court found that this section provided a minimum amount of damages for parties who successfully proved violation of the Act that resulted in actual damages. Appellant alleged various physical and psychological injuries but did not link them to the actual violation of which he complained. He failed to establish conclusively that he had suffered actual damages related to the violations, therefore he failed to carry his burden of proof on summary judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Obscene calls were traced to appellant's place of business, and appellant was convicted under Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 42.07(a)(1) (1993) for telephone harassment. Appellant sought review, and the court affirmed. Appellant claimed ineffective counsel because counsel had failed to obtain a ruling on a motion to produce telephone recordings and records. While there had been no ruling, the court found counsel's actions reasonable and any harm cured by a ruling on appellant's objection to the introduction of documents on the same grounds. Similarly, the court held that counsel's failure to object to the admission of payroll records and to leading questions would not make counsel's actions unreasonable when the record was silent as to why counsel had not objected. The court also found that &sect; 42.07(a)(1) was not unconstitutionally vague because it made clear to a person of ordinary intelligence the distinction between what was forbidden and what was lawful. Finally, the court found sufficient testimony to establish the necessary predicate for admitting telephone records under Tex. R. Crim. Evid. 803(6), and sufficient evidence to support the conviction.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of murder under Tex. Penal Code &sect; 19.02(b) (1994) in the District Court of Burnet County 33rd Judicial District, (Texas), and he was sentenced to a long term. On appeal, defendant claimed, inter alia, that &sect; 19.02(b) was unconstitutional, the jury charge was erroneous, an instruction was improperly refused, the search warrant affidavit was insufficient, and the state did not name a punishment witness before the hearing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A person had raped defendant's sister, so defendant killed the person. He was convicted of murder under Tex. Penal Code &sect; 19.02(b) (1994). On appeal, the court held that &sect;19.02(b) was constitutional even though voluntary manslaughter was not a separate crime. Although sudden passion was later held to be a factor in the punishment phase, shifting the burden of proof did not violate substantive due process rights. The court stated that defendant's challenge was to the sufficiency of the indictment, which was a claim he had not preserved. Nor did the statute violate the separation of powers by abridging the duties of district attorneys and grand juries. The factual evidence was sufficient because the court could not say that the jury's finding was manifestly unjust. Evidence did not support a requested instruction on voluntary intoxication, and any error was harmless. The search warrant affidavit was not in the record, so it could not be reviewed. Even if the court assumed that the trial court had abused its discretion in allowing the state's nondisclosed witnesses to testify, the error made no contribution to the punishment because the evidence was cumulative. The court affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the murder conviction because the statute was not unconstitutional and the factual evidence was sufficient.

There was no review of the search warrant affidavit because it was not in the record.</SPAN></P>

The trial court granted appellees' motions. Appellants challenged that decision. On appeal, the court reversed the summary judgment granted to appellee treating physician and affirmed the summary judgments granted to other appellees. Appellants' claim against appellee treating physician was timely because the limitations period did not start to run until the final day of appellee treating physician's continuing course of treatment. Appellants' claims against the other appellees, who only had one-time encounters with appellant wife, were time-barred.

Penal Code Ann. &sect; 38.03 (1994), and additionally convicted appellant husband of failure to identify, pursuant to Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 38.02(a) (1994).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Observing that appellants husband and wife were not wearing seat belts, police pulled over their vehicle. Appellant husband, the driver, refused repeated requests to produce his license or proof of insurance. An officer informed appellants they were under arrest. Each appellant allegedly struggled with one or more of the officers. After his arrest, appellant husband refused to give the officers his name, address, or date of birth. The officers eventually found his driver's license, and a computer search showed that he had an outstanding arrest warrant for speeding. The trial court convicted each appellant of resisting arrest, Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 38.03 (1994), and additionally convicted appellant husband of failure to identify, Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 38.02(a) (1994). On appeal, the court affirmed, rejecting appellant husband's challenge to the constitutionality of &sect; 38.02 as applied to him. Because police had a specific basis for believing appellant had committed a traffic offense and appellant was under lawful arrest when he refused to give the police his name, address, or date of birth, the court held that his rights under U.S. Const. amend. IV were not violated.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, convicted of capital murder of a bank's night depositor, argued trial court error in denying his motion to discover the identity of the confidential informant who &quot;fingered&quot; appellant. The court disagreed, ruling that the exception to appellee state's right to withhold the identity of an informer under Tex. R. Crim. Evid. 508(a) was not met by appellant, in that he failed to show that the informer could have supplied evidence relative to appellant's guilt or intent to kill. Moreover, Tex. R. Crim. P. 613, precluding witnesses from hearing each other's testimony, did not bar appellee from speaking with the state's witnesses as a group. And appellant cited no authority in support of his claim that the capital murder statute was unconstitutional. Further, no jury instruction was necessary on how the parole law applied to a defendant for whom the death penalty was waived when the jury had yet to decide appellant's guilt. That appellee &quot;spoke to appellant&quot; during final argument was not error as appellee was moving around and pointing to a chart behind appellant.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment affirmed convicting appellant of capital murder and sentencing him to life imprisonment, because appellant not entitled to learn identity of informant who &quot;fingered&quot; him, as he failed to show that informant could have provided evidence of his innocence, because no authority was cited in support of unconstitutionality of murder statute, and because trial court lacked jurisdiction to rule on new trial motion not timely filed.</SPAN></P>

The court held that allowing a 14-year-old victim with the emotional maturity of a six or seven-year-old and a six-year-old eyewitness to testify by closed-circuit television did not violate appellant's due process rights or right to be presumed innocent where the procedure was necessary to protect the welfare of the children who would be traumatized and suffer emotional distress by the presence of appellant. Even though an additional instruction that televised testimony was not to be taken as a comment on appellant's guilt should have been given, the court held that the instructions given were adequate where appellant did not request a special instruction and the trial court gave instruction that state statutes authorized closed-circuit televised testimony. The court held that confession that was typed and read to appellant who claimed he could not read or write was admissible where appellant signed each page of the confession and the voluntary statement form and officer testified that he gave appellant required warnings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged the judgment of the 331st Judicial District Court, Travis County (Texas), which convicted appellant of felony murder pursuant to Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 19.02(b)(3) (1994). The felony murder charge was based upon the underlying felony of deadly conduct, Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 22.05 (1994), which was itself the act that caused the homicide.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of felony murder, Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 19.02(b)(3) (1994). Appellant challenged his conviction, alleging that the felony murder rule had no application because the underlying felony of deadly conduct, Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 22.05 (1994), which was used as the basis for the felony murder charge was the very act which caused the homicide. The court held that in enacting &sect; 19.02(b)(3) the legislature exempted only manslaughter as an underlying felony for a felony murder charge. The court held that this inclusion of the manslaughter limitation excluded all other limitations. The court held that the legislature had not expressly adopted the merger doctrine. Therefore, the court held that deadly conduct could serve as the underlying felony for a felony murder charge. The court held that appellant's conviction for felony murder with the underlying felony being deadly conduct by repeatedly firing a firearm into an automobile known to be occupied which, in fact, caused the homicide was proper.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment convicting appellant of felony murder because the felony of deadly conduct, which served as the basis of the felony murder charge, was not statutorily exempted as an underlying offense for felony murder, and the legislature had not expressly adopted the merger rule. Thus, it was proper to use the offense of deadly conduct as the predicate offense even though this conduct caused the homicide.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After appellant was arrested for possession of morphine and Demerol, the grand jury failed to return an indictment. Under Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art 32.01 (1989), appellant sought to have prosecution dismissed because of the delay. The trial court denied, and appellant sought review. The court affirmed and found that a dismissal pursuant to art. 32.01 would be denied if good cause for the delay was shown. The court found good cause for the delay because the state was confronted with a short three-month court term, another district court in the county had six-month grand jury terms, and the state was ready to submit appellant's case to the next grand jury. Furthermore, the court found that the state did not have to show good cause until appellant sought dismissal under art. 32.01. In addition, the court found that the state, as a matter of policy, had not sought an indictment until the contraband was analyzed, which was held to be a prudent course of action, and found that there was no evidence showing that the state had deliberately delayed the prosecution. Finally, the court found, in addressing an argument by the state, that art. 32.01 was constitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed an order that denied the dismissal of appellant's prosecution for possession of controlled substances because although the state, as required by statute, had not presented an indictment against appellant prior to the next term of the court held after appellant's arrest, the state had shown good cause for the indictment's delay once appellant sought a dismissal pursuant to statute.</SPAN></P>

Appellant failed to preserve a number of the points of error for appellate review. Further, inter alia, Tex. Penal Code &sect; 43.25(a)(2) was not unconstitutionally vague. Appellant failed to show a deleterious impact on his ability to prepare a defense as a result of alleged defects in the indictment. The trial court did not err in denying appellant's motion for a new trial. The evidence was legally and factually sufficient to support appellant's conviction.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants sought review of the denial of their petitions for habeas corpus relief by the 279th District Court of Tarrant County (Texas), contending that the &quot;Trial Court C' of Tarrant County was unconstitutional due to the manner of its creation and operation, and that the judicial assignments made to that court were done in violation of statutory authority.</SPAN></P>

It held that the proper assignment of the trial judge in one district court authorized him to sit in the other district courts of the state, and that Tex.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of the revocation of his deferred adjudication by the 184th District Court, Harris County, Texas after appellant was convicted of aggravated sexual assault of a child and placed on deferred adjudication probation for 10 years.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After appellant violated the conditions of his probation, he was adjudicated guilty. Appellant argued that Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 42.12 &sect; 5(b) (1994), which prohibited him from appealing such adjudication, denied him his rights of due process and equal protection. Specifically, appellant contended that article 42.12 &sect; 5(b) denied him of his right to seek appellate review of the trial court's determination to adjudicate his guilt, whereas another defendant, who received regular probation, could have sought appellate review of the sufficiency of the state's allegations. Appellant's right to appeal was statutory and not constitutionally guaranteed; therefore, an adjudication of guilt did not violate his rights under either the United States or the Texas Constitutions. Furthermore, the court noted that a regular probationer was found guilty before being placed on probation, whereas under deferred adjudication probation, there was no finding of guilt unless the terms of probation were violated, thus, if the adjudication probationer successfully completes his probation, he will have no criminal record.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Because the right to appeal was statutory and the constitution expressly authorized the legislature to regulate appeals, appellant's constitutional rights were not infringed upon, and the case was affirmed, by the Texas legislature's decision to deny appeals from a trial court's decision to adjudicate guilt after the revocation of a deferred adjudication probation.</SPAN></P>

Under the doctrine of the law of the case, where determinations as to questions of law have already been made on prior appeal to a court of last resort, the court held it was bound by its previous conclusion that the constitutional challenge was a nonjurisdictional issue. Further, the court held that once appellant made her no contest plea, she waived any nonjurisdictional defects occurring before the entry of the plea. The court also held that the second prosecution was permissible and did not violate double jeopardy as appellant's first conviction was set aside.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed because the issue of vagueness of the indictment had been previously decided in appellant's first appeal as nonjurisdictional and therefore the court would not review it.

Tax Code Ann. &sect; 42.08 was proper given appellee had failed to pay disputed taxes before filing suit and counterclaimed that &sect; 23.12(a) was unconstitutional. The trial court found &sect; 23.12(a) constitutional and &sect; 42.08&nbsp;unconstitutional. Appellant sought review. The court affirmed the trial court judgment for the appellee because &sect; 23.12 did not create an unreasonable tax classification, nor did it create an arbitrary or capricious method of valuation that departed from the ad valorem tax market-value approach mandated by the legislature or exempt real estate inventory from taxation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial judgment for appellee operating company who successfully had brought suit and had a tax statute allowing an inventory classification scheme to be used that produced a reasonable estimate of market value, and not any specific method. The court concluded that giving effect to the tax statute did not violate state constitutional provisions mandating a market value approach in the ad valorum tax valuation of property.</SPAN></P>

Penal Code Ann. &sect; 49.04(a) (1994) (DWI statute) after a plea of nolo contendere. The court affirmed the conviction. It rejected the contention that the trial court should have quashed the information because it did not allege a culpable mental state as required under Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 6.01 (1994). The court found that the offense of DWI never required a culpable mental state even though the DWI statute did not, at the time of the offense, specifically require a mental state or explicitly dispense with one. The court also disagreed with the contention that the DWI statute was unconstitutionally vague as applied. Appellant did not file a pretrial motion on this issue and did not obtain permission to appeal thus, the court could only consider jurisdictional issues. Appellant's challenge to the statute as applied was not jurisdictional and could not be considered as it would not render the statute void. The court noted that there was also no evidence in the record that would have permitted it to determine whether it was unconstitutional as applied.</SPAN></P>

Finding that appellee manufacturer's relationship to the conveyor's installation was that of a general contractor, the court concluded that appellee manufacturer constructed the conveyor as an improvement.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, the Texas Commission of Licensing and Regulation, sought review of the declaratory judgment of the District Court of Travis County, 201st Judicial District (Texas), that appellee, a model search company, was not required to obtain a certificate of registration under the Texas Talent Agency Act, Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. arts. 5221a-0. 911 (Supp. 1997), and that the Act was inapplicable to appellee.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee, a company that provided training and advice to aspiring models for a fee, filed suit against appellant, the Texas Commission of Licensing and Regulation, seeking a declaratory judgment that it was not required to obtain a certificate of registration and that rules regulating talent agencies under Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. arts. 5221a-9, 9100, and Tex. Admin. Code &sect; 78.20(b) were inapplicable. The trial court entered judgment in favor of appellee, and appellant sought review. The court reversed the trial court judgment and dismissed the action. It held that the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction under the Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act (Act), Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann. &sect; 37.004, because the Act did not in itself create subject matter jurisdiction in the district court to review an otherwise non-reviewable agency action. The court further held that the district court lacked jurisdiction because appellant had not attempted to enforce against appellee any consequences of operating a talent agency without a certificate of registration, but had merely offered the opinion that appellee was obligated to obtain the certificate.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was engaged to a girl and conceived a child with her. The relationship ended, and the girl accused defendant of abusing their daughter.

Defendant was convicted and sentenced for telephone harassment. Defendant appealed, contending the harassment statute,&nbsp;Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 42.07(a)(2) (1997), was unconstitutionally void for vagueness and overbreadth. Defendant argued that the trial court erred by denying his motion to quash the information because defendant's statement was constitutionally protected speech, as it could be said in a context where it did not constitute a threat under Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 42.07. The reviewing court stated that U.S. Const. amend. I did not protect threats. The reviewing court took defendant's statement in context and found that the statement was not constitutionally protected.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of a decision from the 184th District Court, Harris County (Texas), which, based upon the state's motion to adjudicate appellant's guilt on a charge of credit card abuse, adjudicated appellant guilty and sentenced appellant to a term of imprisonment pursuant to Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 32.31, 12.34 (1974).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant entered a plea of guilty to the offense of credit card abuse.

The lower court adjudicated appellant's guilt and assessed punishment at six years confinement pursuant to Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 12.34 (1974). Appellant contended that the lower court erred in not sentencing him under the new penal code, and that his sentence constituted cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the federal and state constitutions. The appellate court affirmed the sentence, holding that because the legislature specifically included a savings provision clause within 1993 Tex. Gen. Laws 3586 and 3714, the law in effect at the time appellant's offense was committed governed the disposition of his case. The appellate court applied a substantial deference standard and determined that because appellant's sentence was well within the statutory provision for the offense committed, the punishment did not offend either the Texas or the United States Constitution's prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant juvenile challenged a juvenile judge's ordering transferring his aggravated robbery prosecution to the adult division. Appellant argued that the juvenile judge erred when he ordered his case transferred to the adult division based on an inadequate statement of reasons, and when he based his transfer decision on an involuntary and unconstitutionally acquired custodial statement. The court rejected both arguments and affirmed. As to the juvenile judge's rationale for transfer, the court held that the judge had properly identified all required factors and had articulated his rationale for transfer. The mere fact that his transfer order parroted the language of the transfer statute was not erroneous. As to appellant's custodial statement, the court opined that even if that statement would be inadmissible at appellant's trial, it was admissible at his transfer hearing because it was the sort of evidence which would be admissible before a grand jury.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order transferring appellant juvenile's case from the juvenile court was affirmed.

The court stated that appellant had not properly preserved his contention of error that the prosecutor had made an improper argument.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants challenged forfeiture proceedings in the 357th District Court of Cameron County (Texas) regarding a home where 1,500 pounds of marijuana were discovered by the police, title to which residence was forfeited to the State of Texas.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant son's wife was convicted for possession of 1,500 pounds of marijuana found in a home. At the time of the warrant execution, title to the real property was vested in a third party, but utility services for the home were obtained by appellant mother, who did not live in the home. Essentially contemporaneously with the trial for possession of the marijuana found in the home, title was transferred to appellant. The state filed a petition for forfeiture pursuant to Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 59, naming appellant mother, appellant son, and third party owner, who waived interest in the property, as defendants. A bench trial resulted in forfeiture. The court affirmed the judgment on the basis that appellants failed to establish their innocent owner defense, Tex. Code Crim. Proc. 59.02(c), as appellant mother did not prove her ownership interest in the property arose before date of discovery of the marijuana, there was no written contract of sale or evidence of parol sale as the testimony of third party owner did not corroborate the authenticity of receipts for payment of consideration, and there was no evidence that permission had been obtained to make repairs to the property.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of forfeiture was affirmed because appellants' innocent owner defense was not conclusively established and was never properly raised in the trial court. As some evidence supported the trial court's failure to find that appellants were innocent owners, in light of the entire record, the determination was not manifestly unjust.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, sports bar and owners, sought review of an order from the 96th District Court of Tarrant (Texas) that issued a permanent injunction to prevent them from operating a &quot;sports bar&quot; that featured exposed female dancers. The trial court found that operation of the &quot;sports bar&quot; violated appellee City of Fort Worth's zoning ordinance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The issue in this appeal from the permanent injunction was whether the trial court erred in upholding the applicable provisions of the Comprehensive Zoning Ordinance (CZO) against claims that the definition of nudity in the ordinance violated the Texas Equal Rights Amendment. Appellants, sports bar and owners, claimed that the CZO restrictions were unconstitutional on first amendment grounds. On appeal, the court held that the CZO restriction on sexually oriented businesses was content-neutral because the city's predominant concern in passing the ordinance was to limit the negative secondary effects of sexually oriented businesses. It was narrowly tailored because it effectively promoted the city's stated interest. It provided alternative channels for communication because appellants had not proved that there were an insufficient number of available sites that did not have legal or physical barriers to development. Therefore, the court affirmed the judgment and permanent injunction of the trial court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's judgment against appellants, sports bar and owners. The court ruled in favor of appellee City of Forth Worth, holding that its comprehensive zoning ordinance's time, place, and manner restrictions passed constitutional muster because it was content-neutral, narrowly tailored to serve a significant government interest, and left open ample alternative avenues of communication.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged a judgment of the County Criminal Court No. 4, Tarrant County (Texas), which denied appellant's petition for a writ of habeas corpus following the court's modification of the terms of bond related to charges against appellant of driving while intoxicated.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After being arrested for driving while intoxicated (DWI), appellant argued that the trial court's decision to require the installation of an interlock device on appellant's vehicle as a condition of bond was improper. Appellant also contended that the statute authorizing the imposition of such a condition was unconstitutional. The court first held that the trial court, after finding that appellant had been previously convicted of DWI and that installation of the interlock device was in the best interests of justice, was required to order installation of the interlock device, pursuant to Tex. Code Crim. P. Ann. art. 17.441 (1997). Because the trial court did not have the inherent power to ignore the statute's express provisions, the court held the trial court had not abused its discretion in complying with the statute. The court then held that requiring the installation of the interlock device pursuant to art. 17.441 served a narrow government purpose and was less severe a punishment than revocation of a driver's license, which the court noted had previously been upheld as a constitutionally valid punishment. Thus, the court held that art. 17.441 was constitutionally valid.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment denying appellant's motion for a writ of habeas corpus because the modification of the terms of appellant's bond to mandate the imposition of an interlock device on appellant's car was not an abuse of the trial court's discretion, and the statute allowing for such a modification was constitutionally valid.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, eleven bar owners, sought a judgment declaring that the recently enacted &quot;good conduct&quot; bond requirements of the Texas Alcoholic Beverage Code, Tex.

The trial court determined &sect;&sect; 11.11 and 61.13 were constitutional and denied the requested relief. Appellants sought review. As a preliminary matter, the court held that appellants had standing to challenge only the actual imposition of the bonds (addressed in &sect;&sect; 11.11(a) and 61.31(a)) but not their forfeiture (addressed in &sect;&sect; 11.11(b) and 61.31(b)), and modified the trial court's judgment to address only &sect;&sect; 11.11(a) and 61.31(a). The court affirmed the judgment as modified, holding that appellants were not entitled to due process of law because the alcohol beverage permit was merely a privilege. Appellants had no constitutionally protected interest in obtaining it. The court held that the state had a rational basis for making a distinction between businesses licensed for more and less than three years and for increases in the bond amount depending on the business's location.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant school district challenged the order of the District Court of Travis County, 345th Judicial District (Texas) that dismissed appellant's lawsuit against appellees, city, public corporation, private corporations, and public officials, challenging the constitutionality of the application of an ad valorem tax exemption to property owned by a public corporation for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee public corporation was created to purchase property owned by appellee private corporation. Appellee public corporation leased the property back to appellee private corporation. Public property is exempt from ad valorem taxation. Tex. Tax Code Ann. &sect; 11.11 (1992); Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 5190.6, &sect; 4B(k) (1997). The parties anticipated application of a tax exemption to the property. Appellant school district filed suit to prevent the application of a tax exemption to the property. On appeal, the court affirmed the order of the trial court dismissing the action because the case presented no justiciable controversy. According to the record, the county appraisal district, which is in charge of initially determining the applicability of a tax exemption, had not considered applying a tax exemption to the property. The court found that there was no indication that the appraisal district intended to apply an exemption to the property. The court held that it was forbidden to issue advisory opinions and could not issue an opinion in this case because whether the appraisal district would in fact apply a tax exemption depended upon hypothetical, contingent facts.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged his conviction in the District Court of Travis County, 147th Judicial District (Texas) for aggravated robbery, asserting that the trial court erred in admitting in evidence before the jury a witness's in-court identification of appellant because that identification was tainted by an impermissibly suggestive pretrial identification procedure and by improperly submitting an Allen charge to the jury during its deliberations.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant appealed his conviction for aggravated robbery with a deadly weapon, claiming that the trial court erred in admitting a witness's in-court identification into evidence and by submitting an Allen charge to a jury that was not deadlocked. The court affirmed appellant's conviction, finding that the witness's pre-trial, inadvertent viewing of a copy of appellant's photograph was not shown clearly and convincingly to have been impermissibly suggestive. The witness's in-court identification of appellant was properly admitted into evidence, and therefore, admission of the in-court identification into evidence did not violate appellant's federal due process rights or state due course of law rights. The court also held that the trial court did not err in giving the Allen charge to the jury before it indicated it was unable to reach a verdict and deadlocked. The Allen charge did not deprive defendant of federal due process, and the Allen charge did not deprive defendant of his state due course of law rights.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed appellant's conviction, holding that the trial court correctly ruled that the in-court identification of the appellant was reliable and not the result of an improperly suggestive pre-trial procedure, and that the Allen charge was not premature, and did not violate appellant's federal due process rights or state due course of law rights.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant landowner challenged an order from the 6th Judicial District Court, Red River County (Texas), which declared that a portion of appellant's property was a public road by implied dedication and that appellee adjacent landowners had an easement over the road. Appellant alleged inconsistent holdings, an error in a Batson challenge, insufficient evidence, and an erroneous finding on his counterclaim for damages.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee adjacent landowners brought a successful declaratory judgment action against appellant landowner. The trial court declared that a strip of property on appellant's property was a public road and that appellees had an easement in the road. The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court. The court found that it would have been inconsistent for the trial court to find that the property was both a public road by implied dedication and an easement. The court held that the property was a public road and that the easement references were only an alternative determination in the event an appellate court did not uphold the public road determination. Secondly, the court held that the trial court's Batson ruling on appellees' peremptory challenge was deemed correct, even though there were no findings of fact or conclusions of law. Third, there was legally sufficient evidence to support the jury's finding of a public road, and the finding was neither clearly wrong nor unjust. Fourth, the determination that appellees had established that the property was a public road defeated appellant's counterclaims for damages for its use.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed and held that with direct evidence of appellant's guilt, the court could not hold that the verdict was contrary to the great weight of the evidence. There was sufficient evidence to show the identities of the victims. It was within the discretion of the judge to determine the credibility of witnesses when there was conflicting evidence in relation to alleged jury misconduct and the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying appellant's motion for new trial. The trial court's sustaining of state's objection of questions posed to a juror at hearing for a new trial was improper but constituted harmless error because it was the lack of diligence on the part of appellant's counsel that was responsible. No error occurred in relation to the vicinage provision of the Sixth Amendment in the transfer of appellant's case. The court held that the trial court erred by conducting voir dire and excusing veniremen in the absence of appellant, violating appellant's rights under the U.S. and Texas constitutions, but found that appellant was not harmed by his absence.</SPAN></P>

App. P. 40(b)(1) bars an appeal by general notice of appeal from a plea-bargained conviction based on nonjurisdictional errors. As to appellant's contention that Tex. R. App. P. 40(b)(1) violated due process because it made his ability to appeal contingent upon court approval, the court held that there was no constitutional infringement because the right of appeal is not of constitutional dimension. The court held further that appellant's reference to due process requirements in probation revocation hearings did not address his contention that Tex. R. App. P. 40(b)(1) was unconstitutional and that a case holding that a defendant had a right to raise a complaint on appeal that a negotiated plea was unknowing or involuntary was inapposite where those were not the facts of appellant's case.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant student attended appellee university in Texas.

The parties filed cross motions for summary judgment, and the trial court granted appellee's motion and denied appellant's motion. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's decision. The court found that appellant's intent to establish a permanent home in Texas did not establish a 12-month residence in Texas for purposes of 19 Tex. Admin.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee property owners filed suit to compel appellants, appraisal district and review board, to conduct a hearing pursuant to Tex. Tax Code Ann. &sect; 25.25(d) to correct what appellees alleged were excessive 1993 appraisal values on their recently purchased properties. Both appellees and appellants filed motions for summary judgment. The trial court entered summary judgment for appellees and ordered appellant review board to conduct a hearing. The parties challenged. The court rendered an opinion, and appellees moved for a rehearing. The court granted appellees' motion and substituted this opinion for its original one. The court held that appellees did not have standing under Tex. Tax Code Ann. &sect; 25.25 to challenged the 1993 appraisal values because the previous owners had already challenged the appraisals and entered into a settlement agreement with appellants. The court further held that appellees were not denied procedural due process because the previous owners' due process satisfied appellees' right to due process. Accordingly, the court reversed the trial court's judgment and rendered the judgment that the trial court should have rendered, that appellees take nothing.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted appellee property owners' motion for rehearing, vacated its original judgment, and substituted with its revised opinion. Upon rehearing, the court reversed the trial court's summary judgment for appellees and rendered a judgment that appellees take nothing because the previous owners of appellees' properties had already challenged the appraisal values. Therefore, appellees did not have standing to challenge same.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged his conviction for driving while intoxicated from the Criminal County Court No. 8 of Dallas County (Texas), arguing that the trial court erred in failing to suppress evidence gained as the result of an unlawful arrest and of his refusal to take a breath test. Defendant also argued that it was error to refuse to allow evidence of a negative finding in an administrative proceeding.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of driving while intoxicated. The court affirmed. Defendant had moved to suppress the evidence gained from the traffic stop on the theory that his arrest was pursuant to an unconstitutionally vague statute, Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 6701d, &sect; 545.060(a) (1977). The court found that the officer had probable cause for a warrantless arrest for a traffic offense. The evidence discovered as a result of the bona fide arrest for the traffic offense was admissible in the prosecution for the offense of driving while intoxicated. Defendant moved to suppress the evidence of his refusal to take a breath test, arguing the trial court erred in refusing to allow the admission of testimony as to the negative finding in an administrative hearing. The court held that collateral estoppel did not bar reconsideration of the administrative law judge's ruling. Finally, defendant had made a motion in limine to conduct voir dire of an expert witness for underlying facts of an expert opinion, outside the jury's presence. It was granted, except as to nystagmus. Although trial court error, the court found it made no contribution to defendant's conviction or punishment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction. The arresting officer had probable cause to conduct a warrantless search subsequent to the traffic offense. The evidence discovered was admissible for the offense. Collateral estoppel did not bar reconsideration of the administrative judge's ruling. Although the trial court erred in not allowing voir dire of an expert to be held outside the jury's presence, it was harmless error.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">One of relator city aldermen filed a complaint seeking to remove a mayor from office in a general-law municipality pursuant to Tex. Loc. Gov't Code Ann. &sect; 21.002. The mayor filed suit, claiming that the action was improper and unconstitutional. Respondent judge of the district court issued a temporary restraining order, which enjoined relators from proceeding with a hearing on the complaint. Relators filed mandamus proceedings with the appellate court, which granted leave to file a mandamus petition and stayed respondent's orders. After a hearing on the removal complaint, a relator signed a judgment removing the mayor. The mayor sought a second temporary restraining order in the trial court cause, which respondent granted, enjoining the enforcement of the removal. The appellate court stayed respondent's order while it considered the mandamus petition. The appellate court then conditionally granted relators' petition for writ of mandamus, holding that the legislature had provided an administrative procedure for removal of the mayor, vested by statute in relators, and that respondent had abused his discretion in enjoining the operation of the statutory scheme.</SPAN></P>

Appellee university could not be sued under 42 U.S.C.S &sect; 1983 because it was not a person under the statute. As for appellant individual, while he was not entitled to immunity on appellee's state claims where he did not act within the scope of his authority, he was nonetheless entitled to judgment in his favor.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged his conviction for sexual assault of a child from the 118th District Court of Howard County (Texas), alleging that the victim did not comply with either the former or amended outcry and corroboration statutes, that Tex. Code Crim. P. Ann. art. 38.07 (1997) was unconstitutional as applied to him, that error occurred when the jury was not instructed on art. 38.07, and that the state's closing argument was improper.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of sexual assault of a child. On appeal, the court affirmed appellant's conviction for several reasons. First, because the victim was under the age of 14 when appellant assaulted her, it was not necessary to corroborate her testimony nor for her to have made an outcry under Tex. Code Crim. P. art. 38.07 (1983) or as amended under Tex. Code Crim. P. Ann. art. 38.07 (1997). The court found more than sufficient support in the record that the sexual assaults occurred when the victim was 12 and 13 years of age. Second, because the victim was under 14 years of age when she was sexually assaulted, the amendment of art. 38.07 did not affect her. Third, because the record supported a finding that the victim was under 14 years of age the trial court did not err by not giving an instruction on art. 38.07. The court noted that even if error occurred, it was not egregious after examining the entire jury charge, the evidence, the arguments of counsel, and other relevant information. Fourth, the state's remarks were supported by the record and were proper jury argument regardless of the fact that appellant had failed to preserve the issue for appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant's conviction was affirmed for several reasons. First, because the victim was under 14 years of age when she was assaulted, the statute on outcry or corroboration was inapplicable. Second, because sufficient evidence showed the victim was less than 14 years of age, the trial court did not err by failing to give an instruction on outcry. Fourth, appellant's objection to the state's remarks was not preserved for appeal.</SPAN></P>

Additionally, the court noted that the existence of disputed facts precluded mandamus. With respect to appellant's motion for summary judgment, the court held that due to its holding on the issue of mandamus and the paucity of appellant's summary judgment evidence, he was not entitled to summary judgment.

Gov't. Code Ann. &sect; 500.08. The court held that even under the most lenient reckoning appellant had failed to file in timely fashion. Further, the court found that because there was no fundamental error the constitutional challenge raised by appellant for the first time on appeal was waived.

Appellants contended that the trial court erred in overruling their objection when the prosecutor referred to matters outside the record during her final argument in the guilt/innocence stage of the proceedings. The court reversed and held that the trial court erred in overruling appellants' objection to the prosecutor's closing argument. The court held that the prosecutor's references to facts that were neither in evidence, nor inferable from the evidence were improper and outside the parameters of proper jury argument. Such a misstatement of the evidence could only have confused and prejudiced the jury's deliberation, because a juror would have most likely placed a significant amount of weight on this error. Because the statement prejudiced the decision-making process of the jury, the court concluded that appellants were denied a fair trial.</SPAN></P>

When the parties discussed the signing of the original contract in 1990, appellant asked whether his wife could join him for the trip to New York. Prior to trips in 1991 and 1992, appellant advised the contractor's officials that his wife would be joining him. On appeal of his conviction, appellant contended inter alia that the trial court erred in admitting evidence regarding the university's ethical policies on solicitation and spousal travel. He argued that the admission of this evidence confused the issues because it allowed the jury to convict him because he violated policy rather than the law. The court held that the solicitation policy did not unduly distract the jury. Thus, the court could not say that the lower court's decision to allow the recitation of the policy was outside the zone of reasonable disagreement. The court affirmed the judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of the judgment of the Criminal District Court, Jefferson County (Texas), which convicted appellant of aggravated sexual assault, where appellant challenged the constitutionality of Tex. R. Crim. Evid. 412, as applied, and also contended that the trial court erred by failing to grant his motion for mistrial and by improperly admitting certain evidence concerning his parental rights.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of aggravated sexual assault of his 12-year old daughter. On review, the court affirmed the conviction. The court limited appellant's constitutional challenge of Tex. R. Crim. Evid. 412, to an analysis of appellant's confrontation rights under U. S. Const. amend VI, and noted that appellant was not denied the opportunity to cross-examine the victim, because no evidence of the victim's sexual conduct was presented to the trial court and because appellant was not prevented from questioning the victim as to any material fact or element of the alleged offense. The court also ruled that a mistrial was not warranted, because the error created by the prosecution's outside the record argument was cured by the trial court's instruction to the jury to disregard and because the argument was not improper or extreme. The court also held that evidence of appellant's relinquished parental rights was admissible, because it was relevant to the case and because appellant waived his objection to any error by not invoking the trial court's duty to weigh the probative value of the testimony against its prejudicial effect, appellant waived error under Rule 403.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed appellant accused's conviction for aggravated sexual assault because the court found: that appellant's constitutional confrontation rights were not violated, that the prosecution's outside the record argument was cured by the trial court's instruction to disregard, and that evidence concerning appellant's parental rights was admissible because it was relevant to the issue of whether he sexually abused his daughter.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of unlawful possession of a firearm by a felon. At trial, he testified that stress from his HIV-positive status brought on by the death of his friend from AIDS-related causes prevented him from realizing he was carrying a handgun outside his apartment. On appeal, he alleged error in failing to charge the jury on the insanity defense, ineffective assistance of counsel, and constitutional violations. The court affirmed. Appellant failed to object to the lack of insanity charge at trial, and the trial court had no duty to charge the jury on all defense theories raised. Appellant failed to overcome the presumption that counsel's actions were the result of sound trial strategy. Counsel consciously chose not to pursue an insanity defense and narrowed the case for the jury to whether appellant intentionally or knowingly possessed a firearm.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following an undercover action where appellant and an accessory purchased and transported 24 bundles of marijuana, appellant was convicted for possessing marijuana and for financing or investing funds to further the commission of the possessory offense in violation of Tex.

Subsequently, appellant sought review, contending that the evidence was legally insufficient to sustain his conviction for illegal investment and that section 481.126, was unconstitutionally vague. On review, the court affirmed the conviction. The court noted that, pursuant to Tex.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants individually and as next friends of their minor children challenged the decision of the District Court of Travis County, 53rd Judicial District (Texas), which granted summary judgment in favor of appellees in appellants' action against them averring causes of action for negligence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants parents filed an action alleging that their children were physically and sexually abused at a day-care center. Appellants alleged that appellees witnessed the abuse and that the failure to report the abuse breached common law and statutory duties pursuant to Tex. Fam. Code Ann. &sect; 261.101(a) (1996) and proximately caused injuries to appellants and their children. The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of appellees. On the common law negligence claim, the court held that appellants did not allege that appellees controlled the premises where the abuse allegedly occurred or that appellees created a dangerous situation, therefore dismissal was affirmed. On the negligence per se claim the court determined that scienter was implicit in the requirements of controlling statutes. The court also that the statutes defined the conduct of a reasonable person; therefore, a violation could be the basis for a negligence action. Accordingly the judgment dismissing appellants' negligence per se claim judgment was reversed as the court held that the trial court erred in ordering as a matter of law that appellants take nothing by the claim.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was affirmed on the common law negligence claim. The judgment was reversed and remanded on the negligence per se and gross negligence under that theory as a statutory standard of conduct could be implied. The court stated it remained the burden of appellants to persuade the fact finder concerning a violation of the statutory duty and proximate cause and the burden of appellees to prove a permissible excuse.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant corporation sought review of the decision of the 156th District Court of McMullen County, Texas, that granted summary judgment in favor of appellees, McMullen County and its commissioners, after appellees passed an ordinance barring any solid waste disposal facility from operating within three miles of Choke Canyon Lake.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant corporation bought land within two miles of Choke Canyon Lake and filed for a permit with the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission (TNRCC) to build a solid waste disposal facility. Before the permit was issued, appellees, McMullen County and its commissioners, passed an ordinance barring any solid waste facility from operating within three miles of the lake. The lower court granted summary judgment in favor of appellees, and the court affirmed. The court held that appellees' ordinance was not an unconstitutional taking of appellant's property, as the mere fact that a regulation prevented one use of the property did not establish a taking. The court held that the ordinance was not unconstitutional, as it was not so arbitrary that it deprived property without due process and as it was rationally related to a legitimate government interest because appellees had an interest in protecting the lake. The court held that summary judgment was appropriate even though the matter involved complex land issues, and appellees' action was not preempted by the TNRCC action. The lower court did not abuse its discretion when it did not consider appellant's additional evidence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the lower court's grant of summary judgment in favor of appellees, the county and its commissioners, and held that appellant corporation had not shown that the ordinance that prohibited appellant from operating a solid waste facility on its property two miles from a lake did not deprive appellant of use or value of its property.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant police officers challenged a ruling of the 49th District Court of Webb County (Texas), which granted appellee city summary judgment and denied appellants' motion for summary judgment in appellants' action for a writ of mandamus and injunctive and declaratory relief for alleged violations of the Open Meetings Act.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee city held meetings under the Open Meetings Act to select a police chief. One such meeting was recessed for two days and then resumed again, with no notice of the second meeting, which appellee considered an extension of the first meeting. At the resumed meeting, a new police chief was selected, and the new chief suspended one appellant police officer for alleged official misconduct. Appellant police officers filed an action against appellee, seeking a writ of mandamus and injunctive and declaratory relief for alleged violations of the Open Meetings Act. Appellants sought to have the police chief appointment nullified. Both parties filed motions for summary judgment, and appellee's motion was granted by the trial court for unspecified reasons. Appellants challenged that ruling. On appeal, the court reversed, rendered judgment for appellants, and held that the Open Meetings Act required notice for each meeting under the Act, even a continuation of a previously recessed meeting. The court held that appellants' challenge was proper, as public officials' offices were properly challenged under either quo warranto proceedings or alleged violations of the Open Meetings Act.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court ruling, which granted appellee city summary judgment and denied appellant police officers' motion for summary judgment in appellants' action for a writ of mandamus and injunctive and declaratory relief, because appellee appointed the police chief during a meeting of which appellants did not receive notice, and notice was to be provided for all meetings under the Open Meetings Act.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged her conviction for public lewdness. The court affirmed the conviction. It held that it was proper to deny defendant's motion to suppress the pre-trial and in-court identifications and refuse to submit a jury instruction on the identifications because defendant voluntarily surrendered, there was no pre-trial identification, defendant was never in a lineup or photospread, and the confrontation between defendant and the police officer was an arrest, not a pre-trial identification procedure. The court held that defendant could not complain that she was not charged by her true name because did she not raise the issue at the trial level. The court held the variance between the business name in the information and its true name was not fatal because a reasonable jury could have concluded they were one and the same. The court held that the statutes defining public lewdness did not substantially reach constitutionally protected activity and rejected the facial overbreadth challenge. It held defendant was charged under the proper statute because the public lewdness statute required a knowing act of sexual conduct in public, while the prostitution statute did not.</SPAN></P>

Following appellant's violation of his probation, the trial court adjudicated appellant guilty of the underlying offense and he was sentenced to life in prison.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted for the felony offense of possession with intent to deliver a controlled substance. He pleaded guilty to the offense and was then placed on deferred adjudication for ten years. The state filed a motion to adjudicate appellant guilty of the underlying offense after he allegedly violated the terms of his probation. Appellant pleaded guilty to five probation violations and stipulated to the evidence in support of the violations. The trial court accepted his pleas and adjudicated appellant guilty of the underlying offense, and sentenced him to life in prison. Appellant argued that he did not receive effective assistance of counsel and the state did not meet its burden of proving that he was convicted of an offense in violation of his deferred adjudication. Further, appellant alleged his life sentence was cruel and unusual punishment and the trial judge abused his discretion by failing to recuse himself from presiding over appellant's motion for rehearing. The appellate court affirmed the order because the record revealed that appellant was fully admonished of his rights by both his attorney and the trial court, thus his case was not prejudiced.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court affirmed appellant's conviction for the felony offense of possession with intent to deliver a controlled substance following his probation violation because appellant's claim of ineffective assistance of counsel regarding his hearing to determine whether the trial court should have proceeded with an adjudication of guilt was not allowed to be raised on direct appeal and he did not show that his guilty plea was involuntary.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, patient's estate and heirs, brought a medical malpractice action against appellee physician. The suit was brought over two years after the alleged medical negligence occurred.

Stat. Ann. art. 4590i &sect; 10.01 (1997). Appellants sought further review. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that the Act imposed an absolute two-year statute of limitations. The Act alsoabolished the discovery rule in health care liability claims. The court held that &sect; 4590i did not violate the open courts provision of Tex. Const. art. I &sect; 13, because at common law a personal injury claim did not survive an injured party's death nor did a deceased's heirs have an action for their own losses.

The court affirmed the dismissal of claims for malicious prosecution based on the one-year statute of limitations. The discovery rule was inapplicable because appellants had constructive notice of the dismissals, which were part of the public record. Summary judgment was proper on claim of intentional infliction of emotional distress because the alleged conduct was not outrageous.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged his convictions for aggravated sexual assault and aggravated kidnapping from the District Court of Travis County (Texas). Appellant had been tried and convicted of those offenses, along with the offense of capital murder, in another venue. The murder conviction was appealed directly to the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals, which affirmed the death penalty conviction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was found guilty of capital murder and the separate offenses of aggravated sexual assault and aggravated kidnapping. The death penalty was imposed on the capital offense and the jury also assessed life imprisonment for each of the other two offenses. The capital murder conviction was appealed directly to the criminal appellate court, which affirmed that conviction. Appellant then challenged the non-capital offenses. The court reversed the conviction for sexual assault on grounds that it was not supported by any evidence other than that of the accomplice witness. Accomplice witness testimony could not, as a matter of law, form the basis of a conviction. The court upheld the conviction for aggravated kidnapping because there was evidence by non-accomplice witnesses, along with the accomplice testimony, which connected appellant to the crime, which was legally sufficient to support the verdict on that charge. The court found that the imposition of separate punishments for the capital offense and the non-capital offenses did not constitute double jeopardy because they were separate offenses and the sentences were consistent with the legislature's intent.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed appellant's conviction for aggravated sexual assault because it was supported solely by the testimony of the accomplice witness, which was insufficient corroborating evidence as a matter of law. The court upheld the conviction for aggravated kidnapping because non-accomplice testimony also connected appellant to the crime. The imposition of separate punishments for separate offenses did not constitute double jeopardy.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged a trial-court judgment convicting him of driving while intoxicated. A police officer arrested appellant after observing his erratic operation of an automobile on a public way, his appearance and demeanor, a smell of alcohol about him, and his inability to perform three field-sobriety tests requested by the officer. Over appellant's objection, the trial judge permitted the jury to view an edited version of the videotape, a silent version showing only appellant's attempts to perform the sobriety tests. Appellant argued that testimony regarding his refusal to take a breath or blood test and the edited videotape, when admitted in evidence over his objection, violated his constitutional right against self-incrimination. The constitutional right extended, however, only to testimonial evidence and did not encompass purely physical evidence or evidence of physical characteristics. The judgment was affirmed because the trial judge therefore did not err by admitting in evidence the edited version of the videotape.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review from the 187th District Court of Bexar County (Texas) in an accelerated appeal from an order denying a reduction in bail. Appellant's request for a reduction was denied after an evidentiary hearing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court considered an accelerated appeal from an order denying a reduction in bail. Appellant contended that the trial court erred in failing to reduce the bond. The state responded by asserting that the trial court was without jurisdiction to enter the order. The reviewing court found that the trial court had jurisdiction to deny the reduction and affirmed the order. Appellant had been charged with knowingly and intentionally causing the death of another by shooting him with a firearm in the course of committing and attempting to commit a robbery. Evidence was presented that appellant was previously convicted of assault, that he was arrested for failure to identify himself, that he had two cocaine offenses, and that charges were pending against appellant for theft by check. Furthermore, evidence indicated that appellant was associating with individuals who were previously convicted, who had intentions of committing additional crimes on the night of the murder, and who were suspected in other crimes, including at least one additional murder. The court found that appellant posed a potential danger to the community as a whole based on his prior history.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order denying a reduction in bail was affirmed. The trial court had jurisdiction to deny the reduction. In affirming the denial, the court considered the evidence, particularly the violent nature of the crime, the absence of evidence regarding appellant's individual resources, and appellant's past history and the potential danger he posed to the community.</SPAN></P>

The court overruled appellee's motion for rehearing. The court opined that in arguing a taking, appellee had to show that appellant, purporting to act in the role of a neutral arbiter, acted for its own advantage and against appellee's economic interest. Noting that the issue was not just one of statutory construction but required review of all of the summary judgment evidence to determine whether appellant had acted to its own advantage in denying the plat, the court found that appellant had denied the plat as it failed to meet the technical requirements of the applicable statute and thus a fact issue existed as to whether appellant had completely prohibited development of appellee's property.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was conviction for stalking under Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 47.02(a)(7), and challenged her conviction, claiming ineffective assistance of trial counsel. The court held that the statute under which appellant was convicted was previously declared unconstitutional for vagueness and therefore reversed appellant's conviction and rendered a judgment of acquittal. While appellant did not challenge the constitutionality of the statute in the trial court, nor raise the issue in her appellate brief, nor file an amended brief raising the issue following the court's previous decision holding the statute unconstitutionally vague, the court held that appellant's actions did not amount to a waiver. The court noted that generally an unconstitutional statute was void from its inception and could not provide a basis for any right or relief; however, the rule was not without exception. The court concluded that the exception was not applicable to the facts, and accordingly, on direct appeal from a conviction under a void statute, the court held that the judgment was void.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of the order from the 232nd District Court, Harris County (Texas) which revoked his deferred adjudication for aggravated assault on a police officer.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant contended that the trial court erred when it revoked his deferred adjudication for aggravated assault on a police officer. The court noted that appellant had waived indictment and entered a negotiated plea of guilty to aggravated assault on a police officer. Pursuant to the plea agreement, the trial court placed appellant on deferred adjudication probation for four years. During that time the state filed a motion to adjudicate appellant's guilt of aggravated sexual assault of a child. Appellant was found not guilty. The trial court then revoked appellant's deferred adjudication and assessed his punishment. The court stated that the case law indicated that the prohibition against a direct appeal of the trial court's determination to adjudicate was total. The court stated that it lacked jurisdiction to review the claim of error, and dismissed the appeal for want of jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An appeal of the trial court's determination to adjudicate a defendant's deferred adjudication was dismissed for lack of jurisdiction because the prohibition against direct appeal of the trial court's determination was total.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of orders of the 176th Judicial District Court of Harris County (Texas) that entered judgment, upon a jury verdict, convicting appellant of the offense of aggravated sexual assault, and that assessed punishment at confinement for life.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was indicted for aggravated sexual assault. When the date scheduled for trial arrived, appellant filed a motion for continuance. The trial court granted the motion, provided appellant with an investigator, and reset trial. On the date set for trial, appellant filed a second motion for continuance. The motion was heard and denied, and trial commenced. After the state presented its evidence, appellant again sought more time. The request was denied, and trial proceeded. After the jury found appellant guilty, he filed an unsuccessful motion for a new trial. Based upon appellant's criminal record, a life sentence was imposed. Appellant then sought review, contending the indictment was flawed, the second motion for a continuance was denied in error, and the sentence was enhanced improperly. The court affirmed the conviction, because the indictment put appellant on notice of the charges against him, he failed to raise a pre-trial objection to any substantive defects, and it was not an abuse of discretion to deny the second continuance motion. However, the court reversed the sentence and remanded, because the state failed to show appellant's prior murder conviction was final.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant inmate had accrued good conduct time. After his mandatory supervision was revoked, appellee department refused to restore the good conduct time pursuant to a policy change by appellee board. Appellant sued appellees, and the trial court dismissed the suit as frivolous pursuant to Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann. &sect; 13.001. Appellant sought review, and the court affirmed in part and reversed in part. The standard of review of a &sect; 13.001 dismissal was whether the trial court abused its discretion. The trial court abused its discretion if it dismissed a case that had an arguable basis in fact or law. Appellant's claim seeking a declaratory judgment pursuant to Tex. Gov't Code &sect; 2001.038 was properly dismissed because the procedure set out in that statute did not apply to a rule or internal procedure of appellee board that applied to any inmate or other person under its custody or control. However, appellant's claims that appellee board exceeded its statutory authority and divested appellant of a property right should not have been dismissed. Sovereign immunity did not prevent appellant from alleging that appellees deprived him of property without due process of law.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed in part and reversed in part judgment dismissing appellant inmate's suit as frivolous. The trial court properly dismissed his declaratory judgment claim because the statute under which relief was sought did not apply to rules or internal procedures of appellee board that affected inmates. The trial court should not have dismissed the claim that appellee board exceeded its authority and deprived appellant of a property right.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of capital murder, aggravated robbery, and engaging in organized criminal activity. Appellant sought review of the convictions contending that the double jeopardy clauses of the Texas and United States constitutions were violated when he was adjudged guilty and punished for three offenses arising out of the same transaction. U.S. Const. amends. V, XIV; Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 14. With respect to appellant's conviction for aggravated robbery, the court reversed that conviction. Every element of the alleged aggravated robbery with serious bodily injury, including death, was included within the alleged capital murder in the course of robbery offense, and it was impossible for the state to prove the latter offense without also proving the former. The state relied on two opinions to justify appellant's convictions for both capital murder and aggravated robbery. The court distinguished these cases because, in each case, the two offenses challenged had a unique element and passed the Blockburger test. The court affirmed appellant's other convictions because they were not susceptible to appellant's double jeopardy attack.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment that convicted appellant for aggravated robbery because all elements of aggravated robbery were included within capital murder as the two offenses were alleged in the indictment. Therefore, it is presumed that the two offenses were the same for double jeopardy purposes. The court affirmed convictions to capital murder and engaging in organized criminal activity, as double jeopardy did not apply.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state contended the trial court abused its discretion by granting defendant's motion to suppress heroin. The court found that the discovery of marihuana in defendant's motel room may have yielded probable cause but that alone was not sufficient to justify a search of his luggage without a search warrant or exigent circumstances. The court found that with defendant in police custody at the hospital and his belongings secure that there was no emergency and no reason the police could not delay the search until a warrant was obtained. The court found that defendant paid in advance for his room, so the motel manager had no property interest in the bags in the way of a hotel lien. The manager never took actual possession and control of the bags nor did he express any intent to do so, so the court concluded that the manager could not give consent to the police to open the bags. The court affirmed and found that there was no proof of a voluntary intent by defendant to abandon his bags, so his right to privacy in his belongings remained intact subject only to a valid search warrant.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs in a products liability action sued defendants alleging that they were injured by implants placed in their temporomandibular joints. The trial court granted summary judgments in favor of defendants, raw material supplier and medical college, and granted the special appearance and plea to jurisdiction for defendant university. On appeal, plaintiffs alleged that defendant raw material supplier had a duty to warn, arguing that the Teflon supplied to the implant manufacturer was defective due to contamination. Plaintiffs also alleged that defendant medical college was negligent in hiring the implant designer, and that defendant university was liable because one of its employees helped design and develop the implant. The court affirmed. The court held that defendant raw materials supplier did not have a duty, independent of the implant manufacturer, to analyze the design of the completed product that incorporated its non-defective component part. The court also found that defendant medical college was not negligent in hiring the implant designer. Further, the court affirmed the plea to jurisdiction sustained in favor of defendant university.</SPAN></P>

Appellants also challenged the plea to the jurisdiction granted in favor of appellee foreign medical school. Appellants had brought the action for injuries they allege were caused by implants placed in their temporomandibular (jaw) joints (TMJ).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court granted appellees, supplier and medical school, summary judgment on appellant patients' claim for injuries resulting from defective TMJ implants. Appellee supplier provided raw materials for manufacturing the implants. Appellee supplier had supplied the implant manufacturer with a medical use disclaimer letter. Appellee medical school employed the doctors who designed the implant. Affirming the judgment, the court held that appellee supplier was not strictly liable and had no duty to warn appellants because it did not provide a defective or inherently dangerous product to the implant manufacturer, who had an independent duty to warn appellants of the implant's dangers. Also, appellee supplier's investigation of a joint venture for a different product did not create a duty to warn appellants about the implants. Regarding appellee medical school, the court held there was no evidence that employing the doctor who designed the implant proximately caused appellants' injuries. Finally, out of deference to the foreign state's venue statute, the court could decline jurisdiction over appellee foreign medical school because it was a state university in the foreign state.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed summary judgement in favor of appellee supplier and appellee medical school. The court also affirmed appellee foreign medical school's plea to the jurisdiction. Appellee did not supply a defective product to the manufacturer of implants that injured appellant patients. Appellee medical school did not cause appellants' injuries by hiring or employing the doctor who designed the implants.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant indicted for capital murder appealed the decision of the 226th District Court of Bexar County (Texas), which denied defendant's application for a writ of habeas corpus seeking dismissal of the charges because the indictment was returned during the third term of court following defendant's arrest.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was indicted for capital murder of his son. Defendant filed an application for writ of habeas corpus seeking a dismissal with prejudice because the indictment was returned during the third term of court following his arrest. The trial court denied relief and defendant appealed. Defendant contended that the trial court abused its discretion in failing to dismiss the prosecution with prejudice when the indictment was delayed beyond the second grand jury term. The court held that the state was required to meet the requirements of Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 32.01, which stated that the state must either indict before the next term or show good cause for delay, and when the state failed to meet this burden, the trial court had no choice but to dismiss the indictment with prejudice. The court concluded that the state may have had good reasons for delaying the indictment that were never explored because the matter seemed moot as a result of a recent decision of the court. Thus the state should have an opportunity to be heard on the issue of good cause for delay, and the court remanded the case.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court remanded the case to the trial court for consideration of whether or not there was good cause for the state's tardy indictment of defendant on murder charges. If no good cause was found, the indictment would have to be dismissed with prejudice because the state failed to indict defendant in the next term of court held after defendant's submission to bail.</SPAN></P>

The court remanded to the trial court to reconsider appellant's motion for a new trial with legal representation. The trial court ultimately affirmed the denial of the motion for a new trial. The court held that the visiting trial judges docket entries granting a new trial, that was revisited by a different judge that denied the motion for a new trial was not error because the scope of the remand limited the trial courts review, which required a new hearing on the motion for a new trial, not a new trial automatically.

The court found that the administrative license suspension did not constitute punishment for the purposes of double jeopardy.

The trial court followed the plea agreement in sentencing. Appellant then filed a general notice of appeal contending that his right to jury trial was not voluntarily waived as he did not do so in writing, that evidence was insufficient to support imposition of restitution, and that he received ineffective assistance of counsel in filing his notice of appeal. State contended that the court did not have jurisdiction to consider any of appellant's points of error because his appeal did not comply with Tex. R. App. P. 40(b)(1), which required permission to appeal from the trial court, or that the matters appealed were raised by pretrial motion. The court agreed with state and held that because appellant filed a general notice of appeal and raised nonjurisdictional issues, it did not have jurisdiction to review the claims. Accordingly the appeal was dismissed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged the judgment of the 263rd District Court, Harris County (Texas), which convicted him of aggravated robbery, arguing that the trial court erred in denying his challenges, in denying his motion to suppress, and in making an affirmative finding of a deadly weapon.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged the judgment convicting him of aggravated robbery, arguing that the trial court erred in denying his challenges, in denying his motion to suppress, and in making an affirmative finding of a deadly weapon. In affirming the judgment of conviction, the appellate court concluded that because there was no discriminatory intent in the prosecutor's justification of its peremptory strikes, appellant failed to establish purposeful discrimination. Further, the motion to suppress was properly denied, as the evidence was obtained following a valid stop. Where the officer had a reasonable, articulable suspicion that appellant was involved in criminal activity, he had probable cause to detain appellant for purposes of an investigation, and such an investigative detention did not amount to an unlawful arrest. In modifying the judgment, however, the appellate court agreed with appellant's contention that the trial court erred in entering an affirmative finding of a deadly weapon. Where there was no specific finding that appellant knew that a deadly weapon would be used by his accomplice in the commission of the crime, the finding was redacted from the decree.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of conviction was affirmed, as appellant failed to establish the prosecution's purposeful discrimination in exercising peremptory challenges and as evidence was legally obtained where an investigatory stop was conducted on the basis of probable cause. The judgment was modified, however, as the trial court erred in making a deadly weapon affirmative finding without finding that appellant knew his accomplice planned to use a weapon.</SPAN></P>

The trial court revoked defendant's probation and defendant contended there was insufficient evidence to support such revocation. On appeal, the court reversed the decision. The state failed to prove by a preponderance of evidence that defendant placed repeated calls to her husband's ex-wife. Telephone records established that four calls were made from defendant's home to the ex-wife's home. Defendant admitted that she made two of the calls and hung up when she reached an answering machine. The remaining 50 hang up calls were not traced to defendant's home and there was no evidence that defendant made the calls.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following a jury trial, appellant was convicted for aggravated sexual assault of a child under age fourteen and sentenced to life imprisonment. On appeal, the court held that the evidence was sufficient to prove that he had penetrated the girl's vagina. A psychologist testified that the victim had told him that appellant had raped her and an examining physician confirmed that her vagina had been torn. The victim had testified pursuant to Tex.

The trial court had determined that the procedures were necessary to protect the welfare of the victim who would be traumatized by appellant's presence. The court held that the procedure did not violate appellant's right to confrontation under U.S. Const. amend. VI.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant mother sought review of the judgment of the 326th District Court of Taylor County, Texas, which terminated her parental rights after the jury was instructed that it could use constructive abandonment under Tex.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant mother's children had been in the custody of the Department of Protective and Regulatory Services (Department) for 32 months; the newly enacted constructive abandonment amendment to Tex. Fam. Code Ann. &sect; 161.001 (1996), had been effective for five months when the department sought termination of appellant's parental rights. The jury found that appellant's parental rights should be terminated, and although there was no indication on which of five grounds the decision was based, one of the grounds advocated was appellant's constructive abandonment of her children under Tex. Fam. Code Ann. &sect; 161.001(1)(N) (1996). On appeal, the court reversed, finding that inclusion of the constructive abandonment provision as a grounds for the termination decision was unconstitutional, because the the Department could not retroactively apply &sect; 161.001(1)(N), even though appellant's children had in fact been in their care for more than the statutorily required one year period. The court found that the parental relationship was protected by U.S. Const. amend. XIV, and Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 16, which prohibited the statute's retroactive application, and its use constituted reversible error.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed and remanded for a new trial because the jury rendered an improper verdict on the basis of the constructive abandonment instruction, which was an unconstitutional ex post facto application of a newly enacted amendment to Texas' family law code.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant pleaded guilty to attempted aggravated sexual assault of a child and was assessed 10 years' confinement. His sentence was changed to a 10-year term of community supervision, which required that he register with appropriate law enforcement authority as a sex offender. In separate appeals consolidated before the court, he sought modification or reversal of the judgment to have the registration requirement deleted from the trial court's order and to keep confidential any information he provided under the sex offender registration law. The court dismissed for lack of jurisdiction because no statutory authority existed for a direct appeal from the trial court's order placing appellant on shock probation. Alternatively, if treated as an appeal from the judgment of conviction, the appeal was not timely perfected and was without merit. Further, there was no ex post facto application of the registration law because appellant's conviction was announced after the law was in place, and he could not show that the law was being applied to him unconstitutionally since he had not yet registered under the law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court dismissed the appeal on the basis that the court lacked jurisdiction to entertain such appeal that was not timely perfected. Even if reviewable, there was no statutory or constitutional violation where the law was in place when appellant was convicted, and, at the time of the appeal, he had not yet registered as a sex offender under the law.</SPAN></P>

The court held that it was bound to accept factual allegations in appellant's petition when reviewing trial court's decision. The court held that since appellee was not a political subdivision separate from the state, it was protected by the state's immunity. The court ruled that a state was not liable for damages for due process violations, but a person's whose constitutional rights have been violated may receive equitable relief. The court concluded that appellant had a property interest because she could be fired only for &quot;just cause.&quot; The court reversed and remanded judgment in part with respect to the claim for equitable relief.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment of trial court which held that appellee state agency was immune from appellant former employee's civil rights suit on the basis of sovereign immunity was reversed in part because while appellee could not be held liable for damages for due process deprivations, appellant could receive equitable relief for violation of constitutional rights. To allow a state to impose a sovereign immunity defense would render due process meaningless.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant patient challenged the decision of the 193rd Judicial District Court, Dallas County (Texas) granting summary judgment to appellee physicians and hospital in a medical malpractice case, claiming that various issues of material fact precluded summary judgment and that the trial court erred in dismissing with prejudice her claims against appellee hospital because it could have imposed a lesser sanction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After elective plastic surgery, appellant patient sued appellee physicians and hospital, alleging negligence, breach of warranties, and failure to obtain her informed consent. The trial court granted summary judgment to appellee physicians and dismissed appellant's claims against appellee hospital as a sanction against appellant. The court affirmed the trial court, holding that no material issue of fact existed as to whether appellee surgeon negligently performed the surgery, a bad result alone being insufficient to establish negligence. The court also held that appellant's Deceptive Trade Practices Act (DTPA) claim was barred by the statute of frauds and that it did not violate the open courts provision of Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 13 for the statute of frauds to bar appellant's DTPA claim. The court found summary judgment proper as to appellant's informed consent claims because appellant offered no controverting evidence to expert testimony establishing the absence of causation. The court determined that the trial court's dismissal of appellant's claims against appellee hospital was not an abuse of discretion, given appellant's gross misconduct and abuse of the judicial system.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was charged and convicted of capital murder under Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 19.03(a)(2) after he was identified as one of a group who assaulted and shot a woman they were attempting to rob. On review, appellant raised a number of arguments, all of which were rejected by the appellate court. In one argument, appellant contended that the trial court erred by admitting testimony regarding an extraneous offense that appellant was involved in prior to the incident at issue. The court examined whether the probative value of the extraneous offense was substantially outweighed by unfair prejudice. It found that in view of appellant's testimony and his version of the facts, it could not say that the state had no need to offer the extraneous offense. In addition, although the state had other evidence to establish appellant's guilt, a rational jury could have found the extraneous offense to be both convincing and compelling evidence of appellant's intent. Therefore, the court found that the trial court was well within its discretion in admitting the challenged evidence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant's conviction for capital murder was affirmed because the court was not persuaded that any of appellant's contentions had merit, including appellant's contention that the trial court erred by admitting evidence of an extraneous offense. The court found that the probative value of the extraneous offense was not substantially outweighed by unfair prejudice.</SPAN></P>

Appellants contended that the Act created an impermissible distinction between full-time and part-time peace officers and violated the unity of subject requirement for legislation. The court found that the applicable provisions of the Act were directly related to the general subject matter of the statute as expressed in the senate bill caption and that the statute was clearly intended to regulate the private security industry. The court concluded that the statute was rationally related to the legitimate state interest of protecting the public from unqualified or inexperienced officers. The court affirmed the trial court's order convicting appellants, finding that it was rational for the legislature to conclude that, as a class, part-time peace officers were not as qualified as full-time officers.</SPAN></P>

The trial court deferred adjudication until the state alleged violations of probation. Appellant was adjudicated guilty and claimed that he was denied counsel during the proceedings.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant pleaded nolo contendere to the charge of sexual assault of a child. Appellant was represented by appointed counsel throughout his plea.

In his motion to abate, appellant claimed that he was denied counsel during the time period for filing a motion for new trial and was forced to do so pro se. In denying the motion to abate, the court ruled that the mere filing of certain motions pro se did not mean that appellant was without counsel during the time in which other motions could have been filed. According to the court, appellant simply failed to timely request appointed counsel and did not show that he was denied counsel at any time.

However, the court agreed that the judge's comments about the sentencing, which led appellant to waive his right to have the jury assess his punishment under Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 37.07(b) (1977), warranted reversal for a new sentencing hearing. The remaining issues on appeal were moot because of the sentencing reversal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed appellant attackers' conviction because the jury's verdict that appellant did not act in self-defense was not so contrary to the overwhelming weight of the evidence as to be clearly wrong and unjust. The court agreed with appellant that he was deprived of his statutory right to have a jury assess punishment because of misleading comments by the court. It reversed the sentence and remanded the case for a new punishment hearing.</SPAN></P>

Penal Code Ann. &sect; 42.01(a)(2) (1991), for exposing her chest in public.

Appellant sought further review and contended that the trial court erred in overruling her motion to quash the complaint and her motion for a directed verdict, because the prosecution violated her right to equal protection of the laws by engaging in selective prosecution of her as a woman in violation of Tex. Const. art. 1, &sect;&sect; 3 and 3a, and the Equal Protection Clause of U.S. Const. amend. IV. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that appellant had failed to prove her claim.

The jury returned a verdict in favor of appellee.

Therefore, the judgment was affirmed as to appellee's breach of contract claim. However, trial court erred in allowing appellee to recover under his Bivens and state constitutional tort claims.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of possession of cocaine with intent to deliver after he waived indictment and trial by jury and entered a plea of guilty. Appellant sought review, contending that Tex. Code Crim. Proc.

The court overruled appellant's point of error because the court had already held that article 1.15 was constitutional under the same attack that appellant had mounted in a prior case. The court also held that the trial court had not erroneously entered a judgment of guilt after it accepted appellant's guilty plea where the record did not reflect that appellant waived his right to compulsory process because there is no requirement that appellant specifically waive his right to compulsory process. The court affirmed the conviction.</SPAN></P>

On review, appellant raised numerous arguments, including that the drawings did not reflect trade secrets. With reference to one of the companies, the court agreed that the company did not take adequate measures to prevent the drawings from becoming available to persons other than those they designated. Therefore, the evidence was insufficient to support a finding that those drawings were trade secrets. However, as to other drawings, the court found sufficient evidence that the company maintained substantial secrecy of their trade secret drawings and the evidence was sufficient to maintain appellant's conviction.

The trial court did not have jurisdiction over the claim for commercial bribery. Although money was wired to appellant from Texas and, presumably in exchange, documents were sent to Texas, these acts were not elements of the offense. For Texas to have had jurisdiction, appellant mush have solicited, accepted or agreed to accept a benefit from within Texas. However, the trial court did have jurisdiction over the state's allegations for theft of trade secrets because the offense was not completed until the communication of the trade secret was received in Texas. Thus, the trial court erred in denying appellant's motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction as to commercial bribery, but did not err in denying appellant's motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction as to theft of trade secrets.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant's conviction for theft of trade secrets was affirmed, but his conviction for two counts of commercial bribery was reversed because the court was without jurisdiction where none of the elements of the crime occurred in Texas.</SPAN></P>

The court held that appellant could not assert the public duty defense because his actions were not reasonable in light of the available alternative courses of conduct, and that he could not assert the defense of entrapment because he attempted to prove that he did not commit the charged offense.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant club owner operated a bar where women danced topless. After appellee city enacted an ordinance prohibiting nudity or semi-nudity in establishments serving or permitting the consumption of alcoholic beverages, appellant filed a declaratory action to determine the ordinance's validity. The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of appellee, and appellant sought review. The court affirmed. When reviewing the validity of the city ordinance, the court presumed the ordinance was valid. The court lacked the authority to interfere unless the ordinance was unreasonable and arbitrary. The burden of showing that a city ordinance was invalid rested on the party attacking it. Appellee city was a home rule city; therefore, it had the full power of self-government and authority to do anything the state legislature could have authorized it to do. The Texas Alcoholic Beverage Code preempted only the regulation of the sale of alcoholic beverages. Other activities that took place on premises where alcohol was sold were subject to local regulation. Further, the state legislature had placed no restrictions on municipalities to regulate unwanted secondary activity.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of perjury after he submitted a sworn affidavit with his application to be placed on a general election ballot which falsely stated that he had never been convicted of a felony for which he had not been pardoned or had his full rights of citizenship restored by other official action. Appellant had thirteen prior felony convictions for which he had not been pardoned. At his trial, appellant testified that he was confused by the language of the affidavit. Appellant sought review of his conviction, and the court affirmed. Under Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 37.02, a person committed a perjury offense if, with intent to deceive and with knowledge of the statement's meaning, he made a false statement under oath. The state did not need to allege or prove that appellant knew the statement to be false when he made it. Under &sect; 37.02, if a jury believed that appellant thought his statements was true, they would be unable to find that he intended to deceive, and acquittal would be required. However, because appellant was confused, no acquittal was required. Appellant would have known if some official action exonerating him of his prior felonies had taken place.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant city refused to settle an accident within tort limits, which resulted in a judgment that exceeded tort limits for which appellee employee was liable. Appellee entered into a covenant with plaintiffs, dismissed his appeal of the judgment, and sued appellant city and appellant company, alleging bad faith. The court reversed and remanded as to appellant city and reversed as to appellant company. Appellant city acted in a proprietary capacity when it acted as a self-insurer and was not immune from liability, but the trial court committed reversible error by excluding the covenant because it was relevant to show bias under Tex. R. Civ. Evid. 408. Appellee was not a third-party beneficiary of the agreement between appellant city and appellant company; therefore, appellant company was not negligent because it did not owe appellee a duty of good faith and fair dealing. Appellant city had a disqualifying conflict of interest because of its limited liability and appellee's unlimited liability and because of appellee's assertion that the tires on his vehicle caused the accident (which hurt appellant city and helped appellee) that supported the jury's finding of negligence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant cities sought review of a judgment on remand to the 162nd District Court, Dallas County (Texas), which denied defendants' counterclaim against plaintiffs, airport board, member cities, and airport users, that the Texas Municipal Airports Act, 1995 Tex. Gen. Laws 1025, 1046-57 (codified as Tex. Transp. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 22.001-.159 (1997)) was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court rendered a declaratory judgment in favor of plaintiffs, airport board and airport users, on defendant cities' challenge to the constitutionality of the amended Texas Municipal Airports Act (Act), 1995 Tex. Gen. Laws 1025, 1046-57 (codified as Tex. Transp. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 22.001-.159 (1997)). The case had been remanded to the trial court for consideration of the validity, constitutionality, and applicability of 1993 amendments to the Act. The court determined that it lacked subject-matter jurisdiction to review the defendants' constitutional challenge because related litigation had disposed of the actual controversy concerning the constitutional issues in the case. The court concluded that the legislature had withdrawn defendants' eminent domain power over all roads within the airport's geographic boundaries and given that power to the Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport Board. The court held that the definitions of a municipality and a local government in the Act encompassed home rule cities.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court dismissed defendant cities' counterclaim against plaintiffs, airport board, member cities, and airport users, for want of a continuing justiciable controversy to the extent that it sought declaratory relief as to the constitutional issues because the constitutional challenge was moot. The court affirmed the judgment in all other respects because the trial court correctly interpreted the amended Texas Municipal Airports Act.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court affirmed and found that defendant's general notice of appeal did not confer jurisdiction on the court to address matters that were not ruled on by the trial court, or matters that the trial court did not grant defendant permission to appeal. The court found that defendant's pre-trial motions did not challenge the sufficiency of the evidence to support an indictment. The court rejected defendant's assertion that art. 179e, &sect; 14.06 subjected him only to administrative penalties, because Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. 179e, &sect; 15.01 (Supp. 1996) supplied a penalty for defendant's act.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sheriff was convicted of three felony offenses of tampering with governmental records, one felony offense of misapplying fiduciary property, and eight misdemeanor offenses of tampering with governmental records. Appellant wife was convicted of one felony offense of tampering with a governmental record. The offenses related to a jail commissary run by appellants. Finding that reimbursement forms are governmental records under Tex. Penal Code &sect; 37.01 (1994) even though the commissary operated under Tex. Loc. Gov't Code Ann. &sect; 351.0415, the court held appellants could have been criminally liable for falsifying or destroying the pertinent records. The court rejected appellants' claim the tampering statute was unconstitutionally vague because it gave fair notice concerning appellant's duties toward the receipts, vouchers, and other financial documents for the commissary. Affirming the convictions, the court rejected claims of ineffective assistance of counsel.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the convictions of appellant sheriff and his wife for offenses connected to operating the jail commissary. The court affirmed the appellant sheriff's convictions for felony offenses of tampering with governmental records and misapplying fiduciary property, misdemeanor offenses of tampering with governmental records, and appellant wife's for felony offense of tampering with a governmental record.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After appellant was arrested for keeping a gambling place and his cash seized, the state brought two successive criminal proceedings. In the initial forfeiture matter, appellant agreed to surrender over $ 9,000 in cash seized from him upon arrest. In a subsequent criminal trial, appellant attacked the proceeding as violative of double jeopardy and cruel and unusual punishment principles, and challenged the state's application of old statutory penalties in his case. The trial court denied appellant's application for a writ of habeas corpus. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that the local criminal statute authorizing forfeiture was neither criminal nor punitive in nature for purposes of United States or state double jeopardy provisions. The court further denied habeas corpus relief, finding that appellant had an adequate remedy by appeal and would waste judicial resources. The court also refused to consider the penalty range issue, as its opinion thereon would only be advisory.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant juvenile challenged the trial court's decision that certified appellant to stand trial as an adult for the death of a four-year old child that was the result of a drive-by shooting. The court affirmed and found that the trial court had probable cause to believe that appellant committed the murder, and therefore to have allowed the waiver of jurisdiction and the prosecution of appellant as an adult. The court found that Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 19.03 required intentional and knowing conduct for a prosecution for capital murder, but did not contain an additional mens rea requirement that attached to the age of the victim. The court rejected appellant's assertion that the trial court abused its discretion in waiving jurisdiction because the age of the victim was not a required element of capital murder, and there was factually sufficient evidence under Tex. Fam. Code Ann. &sect; 54.02(f) that supported the transfer of appellant to the criminal court. The court found that there was no requirement that the trial court find appellant mature and sophisticated and failure to do so did not violate appellant's due process rights under the United States and Texas Constitutions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury found that defendant employer wrongfully terminated plaintiff employee, an attorney, and awarded damages but not prejudgment interest. Defendant appealed the judgment. Plaintiff appealed the trial court's denial of prejudgment interest. The issue was whether plaintiff should be allowed to maintain a cause of action for retaliatory discharge under the Sabine Pilot exception to the employment-at-will doctrine. Under the Sabine Pilot exception, an employee could not be fired for refusing to perform an illegal act. Defendant asserted that plaintiff's claims were barred because of the nature of the attorney-client relationship. The reviewing court concluded that plaintiff's status as in-house counsel did not preclude him from maintaining a claim for wrongful termination if the claim could be proved without any violation of the attorney's obligation to respect client confidences. The reviewing court reversed the judgment, holding that plaintiff could not maintain his action without exposing attorney-client confidences.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged an order of the 372nd District Court, Tarrant County (Texas), that revoked appellant's probation for aggravated possession with intent to deliver a controlled substance, that adjudicated appellant guilty based on his previous plea, and that sentenced appellant to imprisonment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant pled guilty to aggravated possession of a controlled substance with intent to deliver, without benefit of a plea bargain. Appellant's adjudication was deferred. After he violated the conditions of his probation, the trial court adjudicated appellant guilty and sentenced him to imprisonment. Appellant challenged, arguing the trial court was not authorized to place him on deferred adjudication. The court held that the deferred adjudication statute that was in effect at the time appellant was charged, Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 42.12, &sect; 5(d), prohibited deferred adjudication for appellant's crime because appellant's crime was listed under Tex. Health &amp; Safety Code Ann. &sect; 481.107. The judgment placing appellant on deferred adjudication was void. Because appellant's guilty plea was voluntary, and not induced by the trial court's initial sentence, the guilty plea stood. The court reversed appellant's sentence, and remanded the case for acceptance of appellant's guilty plea, adjudication of guilt, and sentencing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Order adjudicating appellant guilty and sentencing him to imprisonment was reversed as void because deferred adjudication was not a valid sentence for appellant's crime at the time it was imposed. The case was remanded for acceptance of appellant's guilty plea, which remained valid, for adjudication of guilt, and for sentencing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff cities brought an action against defendant power company, alleging that it under-calculated franchise fees. Plaintiffs claimed breach of contract, specific performance, fraud, civil conspiracy, negligent misrepresentation, tortious interference with contract, and quantum meruit. Plaintiffs requested declaratory relief. They moved for class certification, and the trial court granted certification. Defendant sought review and contended that the trial court abused its discretion when it granted class certification under Tex. R. Civ. P. 42. The court affirmed. It found that the requirements for class certification were met because the class was so numerous that joinder of all members was impracticable, because there were questions of law or fact common to the class, because the claims or defenses of the representative parties were typical of the claims or defenses of the class, and because the representative parties would fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class. The court further found that a class action was superior to other available methods for the fair and efficient adjudication of the controversy.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state appealed the decision of the County Criminal Court No. 2, Dallas County (Texas), which granted appellee's motion to suppress blood test specimens obtained after he was arrested for driving while intoxicated because the police department procedures for administering alcohol tests to Spanish-speaking persons violated appellee's constitutional right to equal protection.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee, who spoke only Spanish, was arrested for driving while intoxicated. A Spanish-language audiotape was used to give the statutory warnings and requested only a blood test, but did not offer a breath test. The trial court granted appellee's motion to suppress the blood test on equal protection grounds. The state appealed and the court reversed, holding that the police department's procedure only needed to bear a rational relationship to a legitimate government interest. The court found that the state's procedures did not treat appellee differently based on a suspect factor. Therefore, the police department's procedures did not deprive appellee of any fundamental right because the arresting officer had the sole discretion to offer a blood or breath test, and were not a denial of equal protection rights. The court held that the police department's procedures were rationally related to obtaining admissible and accurate evidence of a suspect's alcohol concentration level. The court held that the equal protection provisions of Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 3 did not provide a broader protection than the United States Constitution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court's decision to grant appellee's motion to suppress evidence, holding that a Spanish speaking audiotape that only gave the option of a blood test in advising appellee of his rights after arrest for driving while intoxicated bore a rational relationship to a legitimate governmental interest in obtaining admissible and accurate evidence of a suspect's alcohol level, and was not a violation of equal protection.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant client challenged an order of the 166th Judicial District Court of Bexar County (Texas), which granted appellee attorney's motion for summary judgment on appellant's claim for fraud, legal malpractice, and violation of the Deceptive Trade Practices Act, Tex. Bus. &amp; Com. Code Ann. &sect; 17.01 et seq., arising out of appellee's prior representation of appellant in a criminal matter.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee attorney had represented appellant client in a criminal trial, after which appellant brought an action against appellee for fraud, legal malpractice, and violations of the Deceptive Trade Practices Act, Tex. Bus. &amp; Com. Code Ann. &sect; 17.01 et seq. The trial court granted appellee's motion for summary judgment, and the court affirmed. In so ruling, the court held that the action was barred by the statute of limitations under Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann. &sect; 16.001 (1996), under which imprisonment was not a legal disability. Further, the court noted that appellant demonstrated access to the courts by filing the instant suit while in prison, as well as filing a prior federal action for the same representation, which action had been dismissed. All of appellant's criminal appeals were exhausted when he filed the instant action, and he provided no support for his contention that the statute of limitations was unconstitutional. The court also held that because appellant had brought suit against appellee in federal court based upon the criminal representation, his suit was also barred by res judicata under Fed. R. Civ. P. 18(a).</SPAN></P>

Rejecting appellant's claim that the jury should have been instructed on lesser included offenses, the court decided that there was no evidence to show appellant acted recklessly rather than intentionally and no evidence to show that he had not already formed an intent to rob the victim before he shot him. The court found that a statement made to a Pennsylvania police officer was admissible because it was not made in response to custodial interrogation. Tex. Fam. Code Ann. &sect; 51.09(2) (1996).

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant wife challenged a judgment of the 102nd Judicial District Court, Bowie County (Texas), which entered a judgment dividing marital property in connection with appellant's divorce from appellee husband. A divorce was granted earlier in the case and appellant previously appealed from the property division. The court's remand on the previous appeal was on the property division only.</SPAN></P>

The court found that there was no need for the additional requested findings and conclusions based on its opinion. The court found that appellee husband's expert could testify on rebuttal to a ranch's value using new comparable sales that were not included in discovery. The court found that three accounts should have been considered as part of appellee's property award and that an accounting was required for community funds spent by appellee on another woman. The court found that the only item remaining to be determined after appellant's first appeal was the division of the community estate, so temporary spousal support and attorney's fees set forth in the trial court's first judgment were not final. The court set aside as void the portion of the order denying appellant the use of estate assets pending appeal and set aside the order limiting appellant's freedom of speech. The court affirmed the property division, because the errors, at the most, amounted to three percent of the community estate.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant ex-wife sought review of a judgment of the 224th Judicial District Court of Bexar County (Texas) rendering a take-nothing judgment against her in her lawsuit against appellee ex-husband for partition of his teacher retirement benefits and fraudulent conversion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant ex-wife filed suit against appellee ex-husband for a division of his retirement benefits and fraudulent conversion. Appellee unequivocally repudiated appellant's ownership interest in the benefits and communicated that to appellant, orally or in writing, before the lawsuit, so the trial court rendered a take-nothing judgment against appellant. The court affirmed the judgment, finding error one waived by appellant's failure to plead the unconstitutionality of Tex. Fam. Code Ann. &sect; 3.90(c). In error two, there was nothing to review because the fraud action did not appear in the transcript, which was the only record on appeal. No evidence was claimed to communicate the repudiation of the interest, but in the absence of a statement of facts, the court had to presume that sufficient evidence existed. Last, because appellant had provided the court with no ruling, no transcript of the charge conference, no requested questions, no record references, and no authority supporting error in bifurcating the trial by striking the fraud claim and submitting to the jury only a limitations and laches defense, appellant's point of error was waived under Tex. R. App. P. 52(a).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the take-nothing judgment against appellant ex-wife in her suit against appellee ex-husband for a division of his retirement benefits and fraudulent conversion where appellee unequivocally repudiated appellant's interest, and error was either waived or unreviewable due to a lack of record, lack of evidence, or lack of statement of facts; and presumptions favored appellee.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the state obtained a dismissal of its first indictment against appellee for attempted murder, it reindicted him. At the time for trial on the reindictment, the trial court denied the state's motion for a continuance, and the state filed a motion to dismiss. The trial court told the state the case would be tried or dismissed with prejudice. The dismissal order declared that the case was dismissed, but the trial judge added by interlineation that it was dismissed with prejudice. In his motion to dismiss the third indictment, appellee claimed that because the reindictment was dismissed with prejudice, jeopardy barred the state's third indictment on the same charges. The court reversed the second dismissal and remanded for trial. The court held that the dismissal order was void because the state did not consent to dismissing the case with prejudice. The court stated that jeopardy did not attach because a jury was not impaneled and sworn. The court observed that the trial court did not have the authority to dismiss the case with prejudice because the state did not agree to it.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Relator municipality prosecuted defendants, the real parties in interest, for violations of the adult entertainment ordinance. Defendants challenged the constitutionality of the ordinance and petitioned for writs of habeas corpus and for a stay of proceedings. The trial court issued the writs and granted the stay. Relator petitioned court for a writ of mandamus to compel respondent trial court to lift the stay and to terminate the writs. Respondent's position was that relator lacked standing to seek mandamus relief and that only the county district attorney could prosecute. The court granted the writ of mandamus. It found that relator had standing to petition for relief because relator had a justiciable interest in the validity of a municipal ordinance. It further found that under Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 45.01, the city attorney, not the county district attorney, was required to prosecute. Furthermore, it was an abuse of discretion to grant the writs because a writ of habeas corpus was proper only where an applicant was actually restrained or deprived of liberty. The filing of a complaint in municipal court alone did not confine defendants or restrain their liberty.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After exhausting its administrative remedies, appellee corporation-taxpayer sued appellants, comptroller and other state officials, in district court for a refund of franchise taxes paid under protest. The district court granted summary judgment in favor of appellee, overruling appellants' motion for summary judgment, and appellants sought review of that order. The court reversed the district court's judgment and remand the cause, finding that appellee's future tax liability was not a sum certain and that it could not be deducted from its tax debt under Tex. Tax Code Ann. &sect; 171.109(a)(1) (1992). The court also found that the federal Employee Retirement Income Security Act, 29 U.S.C.S. &sect;&sect; 1001-1461, did not preempt the state legislature's enactment of &sect; 171.109(a)(1); thus, the legislation was valid. Finally, the court determined that the state statute did not violate the requirement that all taxpayers be subject to the same tax and deductions.</SPAN></P>

The cause was remanded.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of his conviction for capital murder from the 198th Judicial District Court of Kerr County (Texas), claiming that the trial court erred in denying his pretrial motions to suppress his oral and written statements.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In oral and written statements, appellant admitted to planning and killing the victims. Before trial on the charge of capital murder, appellant moved to suppress the statements, alleging that the statements were unconstitutionally taken after invoking his right to counsel and were not taken in compliance with Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 38.22, &sect; 39(a)(2). The trial court denied the motions and, thereafter, found appellant guilty as charged. Appellant sought review, claiming that the trial court erred in denying his pretrial motions. The court affirmed the decision. Although unrebutted allegations of coercive acts rendered a confession inadmissible as a matter of law, the rule applied only when the accused established that the unrefuted allegations standing on their own initially showed coercion. Implicit in the trial court's ruling that appellant waived his invoked right to an attorney freely and voluntarily, without promises threats, or coercion was the finding that appellant's will was not overborne by a police officer's threat to throw appellant to the wolves if he did not cooperate.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed appellant's capital murder conviction, holding that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying appellant's motions to suppress. Allegations of coercive acts did not render appellant's confession inadmissible because appellant failed to show that the allegations standing alone showed coercion.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a jury found him guilty of capital murder, appellant sought review of his conviction and life sentence imposed by the District Court of Bell County, 27th Judicial District (Texas). Appellant challenged the admission of crime-scene photographs, hearsay testimony, and the sufficiency of the evidence. He contended that the capital-murder punishment statute was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was found guilty of capital murder and sentenced to life imprisonment in the robbery and fatal stabbing of a pawnshop clerk. On appeal, the court held that the admission of photos of the victim for their probative value was not an abuse of the trial court's discretion. Noting that statements by a coconspirator made during the course and in furtherance of the conspiracy were not hearsay, the court held that the exception applied to testimony by accomplice witnesses. The court held that the evidence showed that appellant had agreed with his coconspirators to rob the pawnshop and kill the clerk, which was corroborated by non-accomplice testimony and evidence. Appellant had not objected to much of the evidence that linked him to the crime. Based on the jury charge of the parties on the offense and the law, the court affirmed his conviction, holding that the evidence was sufficient for the jury to find that appellant had taken part in the robbery and murder. The court rejected appellant's claim that the capital murder sentencing statute was unconstitutional because of mitigation of the death penalty as statutorily granted by his status as a minor and resulting life sentence.</SPAN></P>

The trial court previously deferred an adjudication of guilt and placed appellant on probation for a term of 10 years after he pled guilty without the benefit of a plea agreement.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant entered a guilty plea to aggravated sexual assault of a child and was placed upon probation. On appeal, the court affirmed the adjudication. Appellant contended that the admonition of the trial court, asking appellant if he understood that he could be sentenced to life in prison if he violated the conditions of his probation, failed to adequately warn him of the possible consequences of a violation and rendered his plea involuntary. The court found that Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 42.12 (Supp. 1996) did not require that appellant be informed of the possible consequences of a probation violation prior to his plea. The court rejected appellant's contention that the trial judge was required to admonish appellant that if he was not a citizen, he could face the possibility of deportation, because the judge asked appellant whether or not he was a citizen and he responded that he was. The court found that while Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 1.15 (Supp. 1996) applied only to cases where a defendant has chosen to enter a plea of guilty or nolo contendere, it did not prevent appellant from offering exculpatory evidence; thus, the statute was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant state education agency and appellee parents each sought review of the judgment of the 295th District Court, Harris County (Texas) which enjoined appellant from administering the Texas Assessment of Academic Skills test unless appellee was given an opportunity to view a correct copy of the test after it was administered and graded.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee parents brought suit against appellant state education agency, alleging that their constitutional rights had been violated. The trial court found, under the then existing statute, that the statute unconstitutionally infringed upon the fundamental right of parents to direct the upbringing and education of their children. Thereupon, the trial court enjoined appellant from administering the Texas Assessment of Academic Skills test unless appellee was provided the opportunity to view a true and correct copy of the test after it had been administered and graded. In addition, the court did not award attorney's fees to appellee. On review, the court vacated the injunction, set it aside as moot, and affirmed the denial of attorney's fees. The court noted that the legislature had subsequently repealed the statute in question and therefore the constitutionality of that statute was moot. In addition, the court found that appellee was not entitled to attorney's fees under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1988, because appellant was not a &quot;person&quot; subject to liability under a 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 claim.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged an order entered by the 73rd District Court of Bexar County, Texas, which transferred jurisdiction of appellant's capital murder case from the juvenile court to the criminal district court. Appellant claimed that his constitutional and statutory rights were violated by the admission of references to his statements, criminal history, hearsay reports, and a report from a psychological evaluation based on an ex-parte order.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After appellant's capital murder case was transferred from the juvenile court to the criminal district court, appellant claimed that his constitutional and statutory rights were violated because the transfer hearing judge admitted statements he made to the police, his criminal history, reports based on hearsay, and a psychological report that was ordered on an ex-parte basis. The court affirmed the transfer. The court held that any error in the admission of the statements was harmless error because the statements were not critical to finding of probable cause because there was other independent evidence that established it. The court held that Tex. Fam. Code Ann. &sect; 54.02(e) required appellant's prior criminal history to be considered in the transfer hearing. The court held that Tex. R. Civ. Evid. 101(b) permitted the juvenile court to consider reports that were otherwise hearsay. The court observed that appellant not only had notice that the hearsay reports were going to be introduced, but also had a copy of the reports. Finally, the court held that there was no constitutional violation in admitting the psychological evaluation because appellant was given a copy of it.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant mother was treated by appellees doctor and hospital in the emergency room prior to the birth of her child. After the birth and subsequent death of that child, appellants mother and father filed a wrongful death action against appellees, and the trial court granted summary judgment in favor of appellees based on the statute of limitations as an affirmative defense. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court order, holding that in wrongful death actions based on medical malpractice, Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 4590i, &sect; 10.01 was the controlling limitations statute, not Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann. &sect; 16.003(b) (1986). The court found that the trial court correctly calculated the limitations period from the precise date of the alleged breach of duty, not from the date of the child's birth. The court rejected appellants' claim that the continuous course of treatment doctrine applied, holding that appellant mother was treated on a specific date and that her seven-day wait for lab results was inconsequential to her claim that appellee failed to diagnose her condition. The court concluded that appellants' wrongful death action was barred by art. 4590i, &sect; 10.01.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant juvenile sought review of an order from the 313th District Court of Harris County (Texas) that imposed a lengthy determinate sentence with appellant being transferred to the institutional division of the department of corrections. Appellant claimed she was unconstitutionally imprisoned as the result of a civil proceeding, which was neither criminal nor a conviction. She also claimed that her sentence was not supported by the evidence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant juvenile was hired by the complainant's estranged relatives to kill the complainant for the sum of seventy-five dollars. The complainant, an elderly woman, suffered serious continuing injuries from the attempted murder. After conviction, during the punishment proceeding, the trial court, in its findings was moved by the gravity of appellant's offense finding that murder-for-hire was a repulsive and serious offense and that crime was attempted in a premeditated and stalking fashion. The court found no conflict between the determinate sentencing statute and the constitution. The court also noted that, the trial court was under no duty to follow the recommendations of the youth commission and that the determinate sentencing system was designed to strike a balance between the criminal justice system's goal of protecting the public by punishing offenders, and the juvenile system's purpose of providing for the care, the protection, and the moral, mental, and physical development of children. Finally, the court noted that the trial court had sufficient evidence before it from which to make a rational choice as to what punishment to impose.</SPAN></P>

Appellant's sentence was proper as it was guided by the evidence and the statutory factors.</SPAN></P>

The state argued that there was no evidence that warnings were not given and that no objection was made to the testimony of the doctor. The court affirmed and held that defendant did not object to the doctor's testimony and therefore waived any rights on appeal. The court held that defendant was not denied effective assistance of counsel because it was possible that some of counsel's decision were strategic. The court held that there was a strong presumption in favor of reasonable professional assistance and defendant failed to overcome that presumption.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of failure to wear an approved motorcycle helmet pursuant to Tex. Rev. Stat. Ann. art. 6701c-3 (1995). The trial court assessed a $ 50.00 fine against defendant. Defendant challenged his conviction and alleged the statute he was convicted under was unconstitutional. The court affirmed defendant's conviction. The court noted that because defendant's punishment did not exceed one hundred dollars, the court could only address whether the statute was void on its face and not whether it was unconstitutionally applied to defendant. Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art 4.03 (1996). The court held that because article 6701-3 could be constitutionally applied to a motorcyclist ridding without a helmet or with a helmet that lacked the required labeling, the statute was not facially unconstitutional. The court reasoned defendant was required to establish that no set of circumstances existed under which the statute would be valid.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of his conviction of assault from the County Court at Law, Denton County, Texas, where he pleaded nolo contendere pursuant to a plea bargain agreement and was assessed punishment of 90 days in the county jail plus a fine of $ 100, probated for 12 months, in accordance with the state's recommendation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of his conviction of assault following his plea of nolo contendere. Pursuant to Tex. R. App. P. 40(b)(1), the court determined that it lacked jurisdiction to review defendant's claims of a right to counsel and the alleged involuntariness of his plea, which were nonjurisdictional defects. The court found that defendant had the opportunity to request permission to raise both complaints on appeal in the proceedings related to his motion for new trial, but he failed to do so. Because defendant did not request permission to appeal these issues, the court was without jurisdiction to consider them. The court dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court dismissed defendant's appeal of his assault conviction. The court held that it lacked jurisdiction because defendant's claim that he did not make a knowing and voluntary waiver of his right to counsel was not jurisdictional and could not be reviewed unless permission to appeal was obtained from the trial court.</SPAN></P>

Ann. art. 37.07, &sect; (3) in the admission of an extraneous offense in the punishment phase of his trial. Appellant claimed that Tex Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 37.07, &sect; (3) was unconstitutional because a ruling was not required within a reasonable time prior to trial. The court found that appellant had filed a notice and objection under said statute approximately two weeks before trial and that the trial court had made a ruling within a week of his request. The court found that appellant had not made any specific objection at trial comporting to the errors raised on appeal and concluded that those errors had not been preserved for appeal. The court found that there was no authority for imposing a reasonable time frame on decisions under art. 37.07, &sect; (3), and even if there were, the actions taken by the trial court were timely. In addition, the court determined that the right to a jury trial did not extend to the punishment phase so that appellant's jury election for his punishment did not involve a constitutional right.

The issue was whether the limitations period of the Medical Liability Act, Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 45990i, &sect; 10.01 (1996) controlled over a survival statute, 1955 Tex. Gen. Laws 239, 294 (current version at Tex. Bus. Corp. Act Ann. art. 7.12 (Supp. 1996)).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant parent's son was born with injuries at appellee hospital. Shortly thereafter, appellee increased its malpractice insurance. Appellee dissolved without notifying appellant. When appellant sued for malpractice, the trial court granted summary judgment against him based on the expiration of the corporate survival statute, 1955 Tex. Gen. Laws 239, 294 (current version at Tex. Bus. Corp. Act Ann. art. 7.12 (Supp. 1996)). On appeal, the court noted that appellant had timely filed within the statute of limitations provided by the Medical Malpractice Act, Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 45990i, &sect; 10.01 (1996). The court held that the corporate survival statute governed the case. However, 1967 Tex. Gen. Laws 1717, 1725 (current version at Tex. Bus. Corp. Act Ann. art. 6.04 (Supp. 1996)), required appellee to have given notice of the dissolution to all &quot;known claimants.&quot; The court held that there was a material issue of fact as to whether appellant was a &quot;known claimant.&quot; Appellee had no basis in the record to argue otherwise. Any issue of appellant's failure to plead the issue had been waived. Therefore, summary judgment was not proper. The court reversed and remanded.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed and remanded. The court held that the corporate survival statute governed the case, not the statute of limitations.

Any issue of his failure to plead it had been waived. There was no evidence excluding the possibility that appellant was a known claimant.</SPAN></P>

The trial court granted summary judgment for appellees.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff company purchased an insurance policy from defendant insurer to cover jewelry and precious stones. The jewelry was subsequently stolen out of the trunk of one of plaintiff's salesman while the salesman was away from the car. Defendant insurer denied plaintiff's claim for coverage of the loss. Plaintiff filed suit and the trial court granted summary judgment favoring defendant insurer and defendant agent. The court affirmed. It was undisputed that the loss occurred while the jewelry was in transit. The insurance policy provided that the insured property was covered while in transit only if it was in the possession of the person who was transporting it. The policy expressly disclaimed coverage for losses associated with a vehicle that was left unattended. The court rejected plaintiff's contention that the assignment of the judge in the matter was violative of the state constitution. The court held that the legislature was authorized to assign a judge when the elected judge was absent, disabled or otherwise disqualified. Notice to the parties of such assignment was not required. Procedural defects regarding the summary judgment motions and hearing were harmless.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the entry of summary judgment by the district court, favoring defendant insurer and agent. The jewelry which plaintiff insured under a policy with defendant insurer was left unattended in a vehicle at the time of the theft and therefore was excluded from coverage under the express language of the policy. The judge deciding the motion was authorized to do so and procedural defects pertaining to the motion were harmless.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged the trial court's judgment dismissing his case for want of jurisdiction to hear his appeal from a final decision of the Texas Workers' Compensation Commission. Appellant had been injured in an on-the-job accident. He filed for and received workers' compensation but was dissatisfied with the award. He appealed within agency guidelines, and the appeals panel affirmed the award. He then sought judicial review of the decision, alleging that the award was not supported by the evidence and that the new version of the Workers' Compensation Act was unconstitutional. The trial court ruled that it lacked jurisdiction and dismissed the case. The appellate court reversed and remanded. The constitutionality of a provision of the workers' compensation act was subject to judicial review. The fact that the outcome was questionable or even that a loss on the merits was likely did not divest the trial court of jurisdiction over the constitutionality issue. Even if it appeared from a surface reading of the petition that appellant would have lost on the merits, that would not have divested the trial court of jurisdiction over the case.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged the decision from the Criminal District Court No. 5, Dallas County (Texas), which revoked his deferred adjudication probation, found appellant guilty of burglary of a habitation, and assessed his punishment at 10 years confinement and a fine.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant pled to burglary of a habitation and later had his deferred adjudication probation revoked and was found guilty for the offense. He appealed his conviction arguing, inter alia, that his plea was not voluntarily given because he was not properly admonished about the consequences of a violation of probation. The court held that, although the information requirement was mandatory, the trial court's failure to admonish him before accepting his plea did not render his plea involuntary. The court held that the legislature placed the informational requirement after the acceptance of the plea language thereby showing that it did not intend the informational requirement to be a condition precedent to a voluntary plea. The court also held that, because appellant filed a general notice of appeal, he failed to confer jurisdiction on the appellate court to hear anything other than jurisdictional issues. The general notice of appeal foreclosed even review of constitutional issues. The court therefore dismissed the other errors for want of jurisdiction and affirmed the trial court's judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant's conviction was affirmed because the trial court's failure to admonish him as to the consequences of a probation violation did not render his plea involuntary, and because appellant failed to confer jurisdiction on the appellate court to hear his other issues by filing only a general notice of appeal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged his conviction from the 158th District Court of Denton County (Texas) of aggravated sexual assault. The court previously handed down an opinion and published only those portions of the opinion addressing the speedy trial and venue points of error. Appellant filed his amended motion for rehearing in the case, which the court granted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury convicted appellant of aggravated sexual assault. On appeal, he argued that the state violated his right to a speedy trial because his punishment was tried two years and five months after the United States Supreme Court denied certiorari on his first case. He argued that the court incorrectly applied an abuse of discretion standard in reviewing the trial court's analysis of a speedy trial claim. The court held there was not a valid reason for a delay. Because the state did not meet its burden in excusing the delay, the delay weighed against the state. However, because appellant delayed in asserting his right for over two years, filed his motion with 32 others, failed to separately set it for hearing, and pursued a dismissal rather than an accelerated trial setting, the court could not say that he timely asserted his right. Appellant argued the delay impaired his defense. The court held appellant failed to make a prima facie showing of prejudice caused by the delay because of missing character witnesses. While there was prejudice when the jury considered the convictions in appellant's extraneous offenses, the prejudice weighed equally between the parties. The court affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed appellant's conviction for aggravated sexual assault. The court applied a balancing test de novo to find that while the delay triggered the speedy trial analysis, and there was no valid reason for the delay, defendant failed to timely assert his right and this contributed greatly to the impairment of the defense.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a fatal accident at the workplace of appellant employer, the Workers' Health and Safety Division of the Texas Workers' Compensation Commission identified appellant as an extra-hazardous employer pursuant to the Extra-Hazardous Employer Program (Program), Tex. Lab. Code Ann. &sect; 411.041(b) (1996). Although appellant challenged this designation, it complied with the statutory requirements, and the commission removed appellant's extra-hazardous status. Appellant filed a petition in the trial court seeking a declaratory judgment that the Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA), 29 U.S.C.S. &sect; 651, preempted the Program, but the trial court denied appellant's request. On appeal, the court reversed the trial court's order, holding that a controversy still existed and that appellant could challenge the constitutional validity of the Program outside of the statutory remedy. The court determined that the Program addressed workplace safety issues for which an OSHA standard was already in effect; therefore, the Program was preempted by OSHA.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of his murder conviction entered in the 90th District Court of Stephens County (Texas). Defendant contended that a defendant must have had knowledge that the murder victim was under the age of six years to be convicted under Tex. Penal. Code. Ann. &sect; 19.03(a)(8) (1994). Defendant also argued that state improperly commented upon his failure to testify at trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of murder. The record showed defendant murdered his 23-month-old step-daughter. Defendant hit the victim with his fist above her eye, causing her to fall against the couch. Defendant then hit the victim's head again. Then, defendant picked the victim up and shook her until he noticed blood coming out of her mouth. He washed her off, put her in the car, and took her to the nursing home where his wife was working. The victim was unconscious when she arrived at the nursing home and remained unconscious until she died four days later. The victim died from trauma to her brain due to blunt force injuries of the head. The court affirmed the conviction and found that any impropriety in state's remarks were invited by defendant and, because he did not object, the error was not preserved for review. The court noted that defendant's remaining issues turned on his contention that the statute required that he have knowledge that the victim was under six years of age. The court found that the language of the statute contained no such requirement.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction for murder because defendant's lack of knowledge that the victim was under six years old did not show that his conviction was improper because knowledge of the victim's age was not an element of the offense. Moreover, the statute was not unconstitutionally vague, and state's arguments, if improper, were not preserved for appellate review.</SPAN></P>

She further contended the statute was unconstitutional because it deprived persons between the ages of 18 and 21 from their common law cause of action. The court found no violation of the Equal Protection Clause as its purpose was not arbitrary and capricious. The court held that appellant child's comparative negligence defense, which barred all or part of appellant's recovery and had the same effect on the parent's recovery for loss of consortium.

The court rejected appellant's argument that the juvenile court erred in refusing to permit appellant to make an offer of proof after the juvenile court had ruled appellant's alibi witnesses could not testify.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of an order of the 182nd District Court, Harris County (Texas) that convicted defendant of aggravated sexual assault of a child on the ground that he was denied the right to compulsory process, that there was no waiver, that the sentence was cruel and unusual, and that the trial court erred in reviewing a presentence report prior to the verdict and in considering an extraneous unadjudicated sexual assault allegation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with aggravated sexual assault of a child and pled guilty without an agreed recommendation as to punishment. The trial court withheld a finding of guilt until a presentence report had been prepared and then entered a finding of guilt and assessed punishment. Defendant contended his conviction and sentence were improper because he was unconstitutionally denied his right to compulsory process, his plea of guilty did not contain a waiver of his right to compulsory process, his sentence constituted cruel and unusual punishment, and the trial court erred in reviewing his presentence report prior to entering its finding of guilt and in considering an extraneous unadjudicated sexual assault allegation during the punishment phase of trial. The court affirmed the judgment and held that Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 1.15 was not unconstitutional and did not deprive defendant of compulsory process. The court found defendant waived any rights by entering a guilty plea and that the presentence report did not influence the trial judge except to determine an appropriate sentence. The court ruled that defendant's failure to object to admitting evidence waived any error.</SPAN></P>

Moreover, the sentence imposed was within the range prescribed by statute, and the review of the presentence report did not influence the trial judge. Finally, defendant waived any error regarding cumulative testimony by failing to object at trial.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the state did not give defendant notice of its intent to seek a deadly weapon finding until the Friday before her Monday trial date. In addition, the notice that was faxed to defendant's counsel did not specify the nature of the deadly weapon. The court concluded that the state failed to provide adequate notice of its intent to submit a deadly weapon special issue, and that this failure constituted fundamental error. The court determined that the jury was concerned about the effect of a deadly weapon finding based upon a note it sent to the trial court asking about the implications of the special issue. Thus, the court could not conclude that the error in submitting the special issue to the jury was harmless.</SPAN></P>

Upon appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that the injunction did not violate the open courts doctrine of Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 13. The court acknowledged that prior to the injunction, appellants filed a dozen different lawsuits that all involved transactions that occurred ten years prior and that the injunction was ordered to try and put an end to prolific litigation.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged the judgment of the 225th Judicial District of Bexar County (Texas), which found him guilty of aggravated sexual assault of a child, claiming that the trial court erred in refusing to instruct the jury on the defense of mistake of fact, and that the state sexual assault statute unfairly discriminates based on age.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant adult male had sexual intercourse with a 14-year old female, whom he thought was 15. Appellant was tried and convicted of aggravated sexual assault of a child. Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect;22.021 (1996). Appellant challenged his conviction, arguing that the trial court erred in refusing to instruct the jury on the defense of mistake of fact, and that the state sexual assault statute unfairly discriminated against him on the basis of age. The court held that when a charge of any sexual offense against a child is made, mistake of fact or appellant's ignorance of the victim's age was not a valid defense. The court also determined that the classification created by the statute was justified in protecting children under a certain age who are more vulnerable to the emotional trauma brought on by sexual contact. The court stated that enhanced punishment for aggravated sexual assault bore a fair and substantial relation to the objective of protecting children under the age of fourteen. The court concluded that appellant was correctly charged with aggravated sexual assault and therefore could not use the defense that he and the victim were less than three years apart.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant trustee challenged the ruling of the trial court which issued an injunction in favor of appellees. Appellant contended that the trial court exceeded its postjudgment jurisdiction when it granted the injunction, that the injunction was erroneous because it constituted an unconstitutional garnishment of appellant's wages, and that the injunction was erroneous because it seized property exempt by statute. The parties were involved in litigation for several years, and appellees sought an order compelling appellant to turn over certain partnership stock and stock interests. Appellant was enjoined from receiving or taking any money or property from the partnership. The court held that the trial court did not modify its earlier judgment. Rather, it accorded appellees relief based on postverdict/postjudgment events pursuant to its inherent postjudgment jurisdiction. The court also stated that the trial court's order did not violate the Texas Constitution; however, the trial court's order did prevent appellant from receiving wages from specified entities. This constituted interference with appellant's possessory interest in his current wages.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the court affirmed in part and reversed in part the trial court's ruling because the trial court abused its discretion when it enjoined appellant trustee from receiving current wages.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his conviction of misapplication of fiduciary property. On appeal defendant argued that the evidence was insufficient to support the conviction because defendant paid back a certain amount of the funds therefore making unlikely the property would be recovered as opposed to there being a substantial risk of loss. The defendant also argued that the trial court erred in not setting aside his conviction and dismissing the indictment pending defendant's appeal. The court affirmed and stated that substantial risk of loss need not rise to a level of substantial certainty, but had to be a positive possibility. The court held that a rational trier of fact could have found that the funds would not have been recovered if defendant were not confronted. The court held that the trial court's authority to take any action not expressly permitted by statute remains suspended until they received the mandate from the court. The court held that defendant's terms of probation did not commence until the clerk of the trial court received the mandate of the appellate court.</SPAN></P>

VIII and XIV. The court affirmed and held that when a defendant pleads nolo contendere, he cannot be convicted upon his plea alone without sufficient evidence. The court stated that defendant waived in writing the appearance, confrontation and cross-examination of witnesses and consented to a stipulation of evidence by affidavits. The court held that the evidence defendant stipulated to encompassed the factual allegations and embraced every essential element of the offense charged.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of possession of cocaine in the 363rd District Court of Dallas County, (Texas), and on appeal, she contended that the evidence was legally and factually insufficient to support the conviction, and that appellant should have been punished as a state jail felon.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged her conviction for possession of cocaine. On appeal, the court held that the evidence was legally and factually sufficient to prove that appellant possessed the cocaine as charged. Since appellant did not object to other points at trial, she waived any error. After forensic evidence was introduced, the court held that the evidence was legally and factually sufficient to prove that the substance possessed was cocaine. The court found a number of affirmative factors that, together with the presence of cocaine and appellant in the same premise, although exclusive possession was not shown, provided support for affirming the conviction. Further, since appellant committed this offense before the relevant statutory amendment went into effect, she was properly sentenced within the punishment range for a first degree felon. In short, the appellate court affirmed the lower court's judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court affirmed appellant's conviction for possession of cocaine, finding the evidence was legally and factually sufficient, appellant had waived some errors by failing to object at trial, and that she was sentenced according to the appropriate statute, which was not the state jail felon statute, as it had been amended prior to the offense.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pled guilty to the offense of murder without an agreed recommendation as to punishment. The trial court entered a finding of guilt after an investigation report was prepared and then sentenced defendant to 60 years confinement. On appeal, the court affirmed defendant's conviction and sentence. The court determined that Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 1.15 (1996), which required that the state introduce evidence into the record showing defendant's guilt where he pled guilty or nolo contendere, was not unconstitutional because defendant was not prohibited from offering rebuttal evidence. The court further determined that defendant's plea of guilty constituted an affirmative waiver of his right to compulsory process. Moreover, the court determined that because defendant's sentence fell within the statutorily prescribed range, it was not cruel or unusual. The court concluded that because defendant had pled guilty, had signed a confession, and had stipulated to evidence of his guilt, the trial court's review of the presentence report could not have influenced the judge, except in considering the appropriate punishment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An undercover police officer negotiated a sale of cocaine with a narcotics broker, who arranged for his sources to deliver the cocaine to his apartment. Shortly after the officer arrived at the apartment, defendants joined him and produced a package that actually contained dominoes but that appeared to the officer to be cocaine. Defendants were arrested and convicted of delivery of a controlled substance. On appeal, the court reversed. The court found that defendants should have been indicted for the lesser offense of delivery of a simulated controlled substance because it was the more specific statute and because it proscribed the particular conduct of which they were accused. A prior case dictated that the offense of delivery of a controlled substance was complete when someone offered to sell what he represented to be a controlled substance, but the statute making delivery of a simulated controlled substance had not been enacted at the time the prior case was decided.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant employee sought review of the order of the County Court at Law, Harris County (Texas) that granted summary judgment in favor of appellee employer in appellant's breach of contract action for recovery of severance pay under appellee's written severance plan. Appellant claimed that a wage claimant was not required to exhaust all administrative remedies through the Texas Workforce Commission before filing a civil lawsuit.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant employee brought a breach of contract action for severance pay benefits owed him under appellee employer's severance plan. The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of appellee, holding that The Payday Act, Tex. Lab. Code Ann. 61.001-.095 (1996) provided that an administrative wage claim through the Texas Workforce Commission (commission) was a mandatory prerequisite to filing a civil suit. On appeal, the court reversed and held that appellant did not have to exhaust administrative remedies before filing suit for severance pay. Appellee argued that appellant was prohibited from relying on an unpublished case pursuant to Tex. R. App. P. 90(1) to support its position on appeal. The court held that the prohibition against citation to &quot;unpublished&quot; opinions only prohibited citation to opinions not designated for publication. The court further held that the exhaustion of administrative remedies through the commission was not a mandatory prerequisite to filing a civil action.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, city and civil service director, argued that the terms &quot;neutral&quot; and &quot;qualified&quot; were unconstitutionally vague in a provision under Tex.

The court found that the terms had commonly understood meanings that were not vague in the contest of the statute. The court affirmed because appellants had sufficient means to address their concerns about a hearing examiner's qualifications because each party had the right to strike three names from a list of seven that were proposed to be the hearing examiner. The court modified the order so that the hearing officer had the same powers and duties as the civil service commission, because to allow otherwise would impermissibly delegate authority to the hearing examiner.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of a judgment from the 278th District Court, Grimes County (Texas), which convicted him of murder. Appellant complained of errors in the refusal of the trial court to, among other things, instruct on self-defense, on lesser included offenses, and in disregarding the prosecutor's argument on sudden passion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed appellant's conviction for murder and reformed the judgment to show the correct commencement date of his sentence. The victim had been stabbed with a knife on a sidewalk after an altercation in a nightclub. The court found that the trial court did not err in refusing to submit a jury instruction on self-defense, because the evidence did not raise the issue of self-defense. The evidence showed that the victim did not utilize deadly force. The trial court did not err in refusing to charge the jury on the lesser included offenses of involuntary manslaughter and criminally negligent homicide because all of the evidence showed that appellant intended to kill the victim. Appellant's claims that the trial court erred in failing to instruct the jury to disregard the prosecutor's argument on sudden passion were overruled by the court because appellant waived error by not asking for an instruction to disregard or a mistrial. The court found that the trial court did not err under Tex. R. Crim. P. 405(a) in allowing the state to cross-examine two of appellant's character witnesses during the punishment phase about appellant's prior arrest for possession of cocaine.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed appellant's conviction for murder because the trial court properly refused to instruct on self-defense where the evidence showed that the victim did not utilize deadly force. An instruction of lesser included offenses was not required since there was nothing in the record to suggest that the stabbing was anything but intentional.</SPAN></P>

Prop. Code Ann. &sect; 92.252 (1995), against appellees, his landlords and the apartment manager, for their failure to have a working smoke detector in his apartment where his wife and child died in a fire.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The wife and child of appellant, a tenant, were killed in a fire in an apartment they rented from appellee landlords and which was managed by appellee manager. Appellant sued appellees for common law negligence and under the Texas smoke detector statute,&nbsp;Tex. Prop. Code Ann. &sect; 92.252 (1995), alleging that his smoke detector wasn't working. The jury rendered a verdict for appellant, but the trial court granted a judgment n.o.v. to appellees. On review, the court held that because appellant did not request appellee landlords to inspect the smoke detector as required by Tex. Prop. Code Ann. &sect; 92.259 (1995 and Supp. 1996), because only the landlords were statutorily liable and the statutory remedies were in lieu of common law under Tex. Prop. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 92.001(2) (1995) and 92.252(a) (1995), appellant had no claims against appellee landlords and no statutory claims against appellee manager. However, because appellee manager inspected the smoke detector when appellant rented the apartment, appellant had common law claims against him. Therefore, the court affirmed the judgment n.o.v. except for the common law claim against appellee manager, and remanded the case for a new trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed only the judgment n.o.v. on the common law claims against appellee manager on appellant, a tenant's, claims for his family's death in an apartment fire and remanded the case for new trial. Because appellant did not ask appellee landlords to inspect his smoke detector as required by the smoke detector law he had no claims against them but appellee manager's inspection of the detector gave appellant common law claims against him.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of his convictions for aggravated sexual assault and indecency with a child under Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 21.11 and 21.021 (1994 &amp; Supp. 1996). The court affirmed appellant's conviction, finding no fundamental error at trial. The court rejected the argument that it was fundamental error to permit a convicted felon to sit on the jury. The court explained the juror received a probated sentence for a felony burglary as a teen. The court determined that the state of Texas and Illinois, where the juror was convicted, did not have a strong policy against permitting previously convicted persons from sitting on juries if they successfully completed terms of community supervision and the charges were then dismissed against them. The court further explained, assuming it was error to allow the juror to sit, appellant's knowledge of the information during voir dire constituted consent and the verdict was not void. The court next determined there was no abuse of discretion in the lower court's refusal to disqualify jurors for cause when the jurors were vacillating on the ability to consider the full range of punishment, but ultimately indicated an ability to do so.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 4590i, &sect; 10.01 (1996), barred their action to hold appellee, a physician, liable for medical negligence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, a wife and husband, brought a medical negligence action against appellee, a physician, under the Medical Liability and Insurance Improvement Act, Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 4590i, &sect; 1.03(a)(4) (1996). The court affirmed the take-nothing summary judgment entered in favor of appellee because appellants' action was barred by the statute of limitations of that act, art. 4590i, &sect; 10.01. The court held that because the record lacked any evidence to raise a fact issue as to whether four months from the discovery of the negligence was a reasonable time for appellants to bring their action, they did not rebut appellee's summary judgment evidence supporting the application of this statute of limitations. The court ruled that art. 4590i, &sect; 10.01 served to abolish the &quot;discovery rule&quot; in health care liability claims in appellants' alternative common law cause of action under Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann. 16.003(a) (Supp. 1996). The court ruled that the open courts provision of Tex. Const. art. I, &sect;13, rendered art. 4590i, &sect; 10.01, unconstitutional only insofar as it purported to cut off a cause of action before it was known to exist or before suit could be brought.</SPAN></P>

Sniff dogs searched the vehicle and marijuana was discovered in the trunk. Appellant was convicted and sentenced for possession of marijuana pursuant to Tex. Health &amp; Safety Code Ann. &sect; 481.002(38) (1992). On appeal, the court affirmed the conviction, holding that the evidence was sufficient for a trier of fact to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that appellant possessed marijuana by knowingly exercising actual care, custody, control, or management over it. The court determined that a reversal of the conviction was not warranted just because the circumstantial evidence failed to eliminate every innocent hypothesis. The court also found that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying appellant's motion to suppress the evidence because the initial stop was valid and the officers had reasonable articulable suspicion to continue the detention, which was sufficiently brief and minimally intrusive.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of judgment from the 47th Judicial District Court of Potter County (Texas) that convicted him of capital murder and sentenced him to life imprisonment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of his capital murder conviction claiming that the trial court erred by denying defense counsel's request for the appointment of an independent psychiatrist to examine him on the issue of insanity. The court found appellant failed to make the required threshold showing that his sanity was likely to be a significant factor at trial and entitled to the appointment of a independent expert. The court held that appellant waived any error, resulting from the trial court's failure to appoint an expert, by his refusal to submit to a court-ordered psychiatric examination and subsequent withdrawal of his insanity plea. The court found that appellant was represented by competent counsel, who expressly acknowledged in the motion to withdraw the insanity defense that he had advised appellant to invoke his Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights, and that appellant concurred with such advice. The court held that this was sufficient to show a knowing and voluntary waiver of known rights. The court rejected appellant's argument that certain statements made by the prosecutor during the jury panel voir dire were prejudicial. The court affirmed appellant's conviction.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed appellant's capital murder conviction, holding that appellant failed to show that he was entitled to the appointment of a independent psychiatrist and waived any error by his refusal to submit to a court-ordered psychiatric examination and his subsequent withdrawal of an insanity plea. The court held that appellant was not prejudiced by appellee state's comments during voir dire and had waived this error also.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant movie theater corporation challenged an order of the 345th Judicial District Court of Travis County (Texas), dismissing appellant's suit for declaratory and injunctive relief against appellees, state and attorney general, for want of jurisdiction under the Uniform Declaratory Judgment Act, Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 37.001-.011.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant movie theater corporation sought declaratory and injunctive relief against appellees, state and attorney general, that the obscenity statutes found in Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 43.21-.26 were unconstitutional. The trial court dismissed the action, finding it had no jurisdiction under the Uniform Declaratory Judgment Act (UDJA), Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 37.001-.011. On appeal, the court affirmed, because appellee attorney general had no power to enforce the criminal obscenity statutes. Instead, that power belonged to the county and district attorneys under Tex. Const. art. V, &sect; 21. Consequently, the court found that a declaratory judgment would not terminate the controversy between the parties as required by the UDJA, because no controversy existed. Additionally, injunctive relief could only run against persons engaging in the activity sought to be enjoined, which did not include appellees.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order was affirmed. Appellant movie theater corporation's suit for declaratory and injunctive relief regarding the constitutionality of obscenity statutes was properly dismissed, because appellee attorney general lacked authority to enforce the statutes.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant attorney challenged the grant of appellee state officials' motion for summary judgment, and the denial of appellant's motion for summary judgment, by the District Court of Travis County, 250th Judicial District (Texas), which held that the Attorney Occupation Tax, Tex. Code Tax Ann. &sect;&sect; 191.141-191.145, was constitutional and refused to provide appellant relief from the tax owed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant attorney challenged Texas' attorney occupation tax, Tex. Code Tax Ann. &sect;&sect; 191.141, 191.142 (1996), on the grounds that it was inequitable and unconstitutional in that appellee state officials did not collect the tax from state-employed attorneys. Appellees' theory was that they were simply offsetting monies received by monies dispersed. The court affirmed the grant of summary judgment in favor of appellees, holding that the tax was constitutional. The court agreed with appellees that their policy merely offset monies they would have collected by monies that would be dispersed, and appellees' policy was rationally related to its purpose of efficiently collecting and remitting taxes. This was not an unconstitutional transfer of public funds to private persons because the policy provided a public benefit, that of providing an incentive to work for the state. The court affirmed the denial of summary judgment for appellant because even if the tax were unconstitutional, he offered no proof that he was entitled to relief of his tax burden because he could not demonstrate that his taxes were excessively higher because the other group was not taxed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The grant of summary judgment in favor of appellee state officials and the denial of summary judgment to appellant attorney were affirmed because an occupation tax that was not collected from state-employed attorneys was not an unconstitutional equal protection violation. Appellant would not have been entitled to relief anyway because he did not offer proof that his taxes were excessively higher because the other group was not taxed.</SPAN></P>
