</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Prosecution appealed reversal of defendant's conviction for first-degree burglary because of counsel's failure to appear and advocate on his behalf at a reverse waiver hearing for trial in juvenile court, alleging that defendant's counsel's ineffectiveness impacted only the waiver hearing, not the constitutional fairness of the subsequent trial, and that a new trial was not warranted. The court found that the potentially ameliorative benefits of juvenile court jurisdiction were still available to defendant. However, even if the trial court were to find that district court jurisdiction was nonetheless appropriate, the court found no errors warranting reversal of his conviction because the punishment for first-degree burglary was appropriate and did not constitute cruel and unusual punishment, the court properly balanced defendant's right to impeach witnesses against confusion to the jury, and that the jury could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant's claim of self-defense was unfounded.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was charged with first-degree murder, a forcible felony. Therefore, he was not subject to juvenile court jurisdiction and was prosecuted as an adult.

He appealed, claiming Iowa Code &sect; 232.8(1)(c) (1997) violated the Equal Protection Clauses of the federal and state constitutions. However, the court found that appellant could challenge his sentence, since his guilty plea did not waive challenges that did not affect the validity of the conviction. The court further found that a rational basis existed for the statute challenged by appellant. The legislature could reasonably distinguish between juveniles of different ages based on their presumed maturity and judgment, according more severe punishment to older juveniles.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, formerly an Iowa inmate, sued the State and prison officials, claiming he was incarcerated beyond his proper release date, due to excessive discipline for his violation of prison rules. Plaintiff claimed a liberty interest grounded in a right to a reduction in his sentence based on good-conduct time that he has already earned, as opposed to a right to earn good-time credits in the first instance. The court agreed, holding plaintiff had a liberty interest of &quot;real substance&quot; because the discipline at issue affected not simply the type of restriction imposed on plaintiff, but whether there was any restriction on him at all and reversed summary judgment granted individual defendants. However, the court affirmed the dismissal of plaintiff's claim against the State because it found no indication the legislature intended to create a tort claim cause of action when it created Iowa Code section 903A.3(1) (1993).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant's sentence, after pleading guilty to commodities fraud, was reconsidered twice, pursuant to Iowa Code &sect; 902.4 (1997). He appealed following reimposition of a ten-year sentence, complaining that the trial court improperly considered unproven charges from another state when it revised the judgment so as to reimpose sentence. The statute stated that the trial court's decision to take the action or not to take the action was not subject to appeal. The State contended this language deprived the court of authority to consider appellant's challenge. The court found that Iowa R. App. P. 304 placed substance over form, allowing it to consider the notice of appeal, where appropriate, as a petition for a writ of certiorari. The court granted the writ, and found that the existence of the out of state charges were established without objection at the final reconsideration hearing.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant stole a pellet gun and a knife from a store. When the store manager confronted defendant, he pointed the knife toward the manager. Defendant then set the stolen merchandise down and attempted to flee. Defendant was convicted of first degree robbery, a forcible felony, in violation of Iowa Code &sect;&sect; 711.1(1), 711.1(2), and 711.2 (1997), and was sentenced to a 25-year term of incarceration. Defendant appealed his sentence arguing that Iowa Code &sect; 902.12, under which he was required to serve the maximum term of his sentence without possibility of parole, violated the state constitution's prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment as well as his right to equal protection under both the state and federal constitutions. The appellate court affirmed the sentence, rejecting defendant's claim of mitigating circumstances. The court determined that the first degree robbery statute considered and specified certain circumstances and that the evidence at trial established all of the elements of first degree robbery.

Here, the county zoning ordinance specifically balanced competing interests by permitting quarries as a special use in an agricultural district, thereby minimizing the commercial impact on the land once the resource had been exhausted. The court found no error in the lower court's conclusion that the zoning ordinance did not violate the county's comprehensive plan. It saw nothing unconstitutionally vague, and held that the standards were general enough to deal with unforeseeable circumstances, yet not so specific as to defeat a flexible means of accomplishing use changes without rezoning. It determined that nothing here was arbitrary or capricious. The court concluded that there was no basis for setting aside the special use permit, and affirmed the judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Based on defendant's arrest warrant, police arrested him outside of his motel room. He was not allowed to re-enter the room but a police search found drug use items. Defendant struggled with the jailer and methamphetamine fell on the floor. He was charged with possession with intent to deliver a controlled substance, a drug tax stamp violation, introduction of a controlled substance into a detention facility, and assault resulting in bodily injury. Defendant moved to suppress the motel room evidence, but the motion was denied. Defendant argued he was a drug informant. The trial court found him guilty. On appeal, the court held the admission of the motel room evidence was not harmless error since the search was not valid as incident to arrest or under the exigency exception, thus the conviction for possession with intent to deliver was reversed and the case remanded. The court affirmed the remaining convictions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed defendant's conviction on the charge of possession with intent to deliver because the warrantless search of his motel room was not a valid search incident to an arrest nor did it come within the emergency aid exception.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The licensee was adjudicated as a habitual offender because he had two driving-under-suspension (DUS) convictions and one operating-while-intoxicated (OWI) conviction within a six-year period. He applied for a temporary restricted driver's license, and the trial court granted his application. The plaintiff Department of Transportation objected to the temporary restricted driver's license and argued that the licensee did not meet the qualifications for a temporary restricted license. The defendant trial court determined that there was no rational basis for treating the licensee differently because of his combination of predicate offenses. The plaintiff brought a certiorari action to challenge the trial court's order. The court vacated the trial court's order and found the trial court erred when it ordered the plaintiff to issue a temporary restricted license. The court found that the statutory scheme was not a denial of equal protection and that the licensee failed in his burden to show that the classification clearly, palpably, and without doubt infringed on the Constitution. Furthermore, the scheme classification was rational and furthered a legitimate state interest.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff insurance company issued motor vehicle insurance polices containing family member exclusion provisions to defendants. After an accident in which defendants' family members were killed, defendants, as administrators of the family members' estates, argued for reversal of prior caselaw that upheld the validity of family member coverage exclusions. Defendants contended the exclusions were an unconstitutional restriction on the ability to contract and had no basis in fact to support them. The court first refused to apply the principle of reasonable expectations to invalidate the family member exclusion provision because a lay person would not be confused concerning the scope of coverage. The court then held that insurers' general unwillingness to provide policies without family member exclusions was insufficient, in the absence of applicable regulatory statutes, to invalidate the exclusions. The court also held that the potential for family discord or collusion was not sufficiently great to warrant invalidating the exclusion on public policy grounds. As a result, the court followed its prior caselaw in upholding the validity of the exclusion.</SPAN></P>

The court rejected defendant's equal protection claims and held that the repeal of the early restoration provisions and the statutory changes deleting from consideration, for revocation purposes, offenses more than 12 years old did not result in a denial of defendant's vested rights.

However, the court determined that appellant had a liberty interest in challenging paternity and that Iowa Code &sect; 600B.41A(3)(a)(1) violated the state constitution to the extent that it denied appellant standing to overcome paternity. The court concluded that a putative father of a child born into a marriage may have a right to standing to challenge paternity under the Due Process Clause of the state constitution but that the right could be lost by waiver. The court remanded the case to the trial court for a factual inquiry as to whether appellant could pursue his claim.</SPAN></P>

Appellant alleged he had ineffective assistance of trial counsel based on counsel's failure to preserve for appeal the proposed jury instruction on specific intent. The court affirmed the conviction and found there was no ineffective assistance of trial counsel because the offense of stalking was a general intent crime, as the trial court instructed the jury. The court determined that to prevail on a claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel, appellant had to show his counsel failed to perform an essential duty and prejudice resulted. The court concluded that in interpreting the stalking statute, its plain and clear meaning indicated it was not intended to be a specific intent crime as the focus of the statute was not on appellant's mental state but on the result his purposeful acts caused in a reasonable person. The court concluded that stalking was a general intent crime, and because the trial court so instructed the jury there was no prejudice to appellant by his counsel's failure to preserve the specific intent instruction for appeal.</SPAN></P>

The record showed that defendant was never advised of the possibility of consecutive sentences being imposed, either by the judge or by any other source. The court reversed and remanded the conviction because Iowa R. Crim.

The court found that the letter of the law and the spirit of the law that required that the guilty plea be made voluntarily and intelligently, mandated by Iowa R. Crim.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff department of transportation filed an application for writ of certiorari after the trial court reinstated defendant's driving privileges, pursuant to Iowa Code &sect; 321J.4(3)(b) (repealed), which provided an opportunity for defendants, who had licenses which were revoked for six years after a third conviction for operating while intoxicated, to have their eligibility for a driver's license restored after two years.

The court sustained the writ of certiorari, and found that defendants had no accrued right under Iowa Code &sect; 4.13(2), which provided that the repeal of a statute did not affect any right or privilege previously acquired, accrued, or accorded thereunder, because &sect; 321J.4(3)(b) merely granted the right to an evidentiary hearing, and savings statutes, such as &sect; 4.13(2), did not apply to an interest in a certain procedure.

The department claimed that the district court's ruling was illegal because defendants did not lodge their single subject rule challenge to the legislation before its codification in the Iowa Code. The court agreed with the department and held that defendants failed to timely raise a single subject challenge to 1996 Iowa Acts 1218, &sect; 68 prior to its codification in the 1997 Iowa Code and accordingly, any defect concerning the subject matter was cured upon codification. Therefore, the district court acted illegally in refusing to revoke defendants' driver's licenses in the underlying criminal proceedings. Defendants argued that someone else raised a valid challenge prior to codification and that challenge insured to defendants' benefit.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant county board of supervisors granted intervenor applicants' request to have an area, which included their land, designated an agricultural area. Plaintiff neighbor filed a declaratory judgment action challenging the board's decision. The Iowa District Court for Kossuth County held that the board's decision was arbitrary and capricious but rejected the neighbor's constitutional arguments. The neighbors appealed the decision.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Under Iowa Code &sect; 352.11(1)(a), once land was designated an agricultural area the owners were immune from nuisance suits. The neighbors contended that the approval with the attendant nuisance immunity resulted in a taking of private property without the payment of just compensation in violation of federal and state constitutional provisions. The court concluded that the nuisance immunity provision in &sect; 352.11(1)(a) created an easement in the property affected by the nuisance in favor of the applicants' land because the immunity allowed the applicants to do acts on their own land which, were it not for the easement, would have constituted a nuisance. The court held that in enacting &sect; 352.11(1)(a), the legislature exceeded its authority by authorizing the use of property by the applicants in such a way as to infringe on the rights of neighboring landowners by allowing the creation of a nuisance without the payment of just compensation. Therefore, the court determined that the statute violated the Fifth Amendment to the federal constitution and Iowa Const. art. I, &sect; 18.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court's decision and remanded the case for an order declaring that the portion of the statute that provided for immunity against nuisances was unconstitutional and without any force or effect.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the district court's summary judgment because (1) an object left deliberately in the patient's body did not trigger the foreign body exception, (2) no material facts remained unresolved, and (3) Iowa Code &sect; 614.1(9) was constitutional because it bore some fair relationship to a legitimate public purpose.</SPAN></P>

The members brought suit against the treasurer, challenging the issuance of tax and revenue anticipation notes (TRANs). The members argued the manner in which the proceeds of the TRANs were used created debt in violation of Iowa Const. art. VII, &sect; 2. They also argued the State should be required to use Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) to determine compliance with Iowa's constitutional prohibition against the state incurring contractual debt in excess of $ 250,000. The district court concluded the members were not entitled to the relief they sought, dismissed the petition, and the court affirmed. The Series 1991A TRANs were validly issued based on the anticipated revenues for the fiscal year. The budget basis accounting methods used to project the financial position of the State were not unreasonable. Further, the use of TRANs did not create &quot;core&quot; debt nor was the cash raised by the sale of the TRANs used illegally. Finally, the reimbursement agreement between the State and the banks did not constitute unconstitutional debt.</SPAN></P>

The court noted that it afforded substantial deference to the legislature in setting criminal penalties. The court also held that defendant had used a dangerous weapon, specifically, a CO(2) pistol, when he committed his robberies. The risk of death or serious injuries to the persons present at the robberies had been high. In the opinion of the court, a 25-year prison sentence with a requirement that defendant serve at least 85 percent of the sentence did not lead to an inference of gross disproportionality.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The wife had been married to her husband for several years and had a master's degree in counseling and psychology. The marriage started causing stress in the family. The wife was voluntarily hospitalized for one week. She was prescribed medication for depression, but she discontinued using it because she was concerned about possible side effects. Later, the wife and her children went to a battered women's shelter. The husband filed an application alleging serious mental impairment. The wife was picked up and taken to a psychiatric unit. After a hearing, the hospitalization referee found that the wife was seriously mentally impaired and ordered outpatient commitment. The district court upheld the order on appeal. The wife appealed. The court reversed, holding that there was not clear and convincing evidence to support the order. The court reasoned that the wife's decision to discontinue her medication because she preferred psychotherapy did not indicate a lack of responsibility in light of her educational background. Further, any emotional trauma that resulted from the wife's decision to go to the shelter should not have been considered in the decision.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed finding the statutes and ordinance were presumed constitutional and that the property owners had the burden of proving the unconstitutionality and had to negate every reasonable basis upon which the ordinance may have been sustained. Traditional takings were to promote public health and welfare or involved condemnation proceedings under the power of eminent domain. The court conclude that the city ordinance which required the property owners to mow grass and weed at their own expense constituted a valid exercise of police power and did not effectuate an unconstitutional taking. The court held that a law did not become unconstitutional because it caused a hardship. Finally, Iowa Code &sect; 364.12(2)(c) was a legitimate exercise of the city's home rule authority.</SPAN></P>

The court reasoned that the revocation of driving privileges had a rational relationship to the legislative objective of public safety on the highway. The court concluded that punishment in the form of a license revocation was rationally related to the goals of the legislature in punishing and deterring the commission of crime. Further, the court concluded that &sect; 901.5(10) did not violate defendant's equal protection rights.

Moreover, the search-incident-to-citation statute,&nbsp;&sect; 805.1(4), was not constitutionally infirm.

The court was asked by certified questions whether 1996 Iowa Acts 1196, &sect; 12, prohibiting nonutility use of equipment paid for by utility customers, violated various provisions of the Iowa Constitution. Plaintiff was a utility corporation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Section 12 provided that a rate-regulated gas or electric public utility should not use vehicles, tools, or employees, the costs, salaries, or benefits of which were recoverable in the regulated rates for electric service or gas service to install or service appliances. The corporation provided natural gas to customers in Iowa and had begun an appliance maintenance program through which customers could pay a fee for appliance maintenance. The corporation filed suit in the district court seeking a declaratory judgment that &sect; 12 was unconstitutional. In answering the district court's certified questions, the court held as follows: (1) &sect; 12 did not violate Iowa Const. art. III, &sect; 29 because it encompassed one topic and amended nothing other than various provisions in the public utility chapter of the Iowa Code. No citizens should have been surprised to find the subject of 1996 Iowa Acts 1196, &sect;12 considered under the act's title. Thus, the single-subject and title requirements were met. (2) Section 12 did not violate the privileges and immunities clause of the Iowa Constitution because &sect; 12 did not create any classifications and the corporation was not singled out.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested after a drug sting operation, and was convicted of possession with intent to deliver, conspiracy to possess with intent to deliver, and failure to affix a drug stamp. Defendant appealed, and the court affirmed as modified. The court held that amendment of a trial information by the state to charge an offense with a higher penalty was valid, because the amendment neither charged a wholly new offense nor prejudiced defendant's rights. The court held that the trial court did not commit error in submitting the conspiracy count, but because conspiracy was an alternate means of violating Iowa Code &sect; 124.401(1), defendant could be sentenced only for a single offense and not for both possession and conspiracy. The court therefore severed the conspiracy sentence. Defendant's objection to a jury instruction defining &quot;constructive possession&quot; was waived, because he did not make a specific objection at trial. Defendant's motion for acquittal on the drug stamp charge was properly denied, because there was substantial evidence to support the conviction.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged the trial court's evidentiary rulings that allowed evidence of marijuana that had been obtained by warrantless search of defendant's person and car after he was issued a traffic citation. The State did not contend that there was probable cause to search under the warrant standards. The court found on appeal that the officer's election to search defendant and defendant's car was based solely on the perceived authority to search conferred by Iowa Code &sect; 805.1(4). Defendant argued that the statute was unconstitutional. The court held that Iowa Code &sect; 805.1(4) provided authority to search when a traffic violation occurred that constituted grounds for an arrest. Defendant's suggestion that the constitutional basis for the &quot;search incident to an arrest&quot; exception was an actual arrest was belied by those decisions that held that the timing of the arrest need not precede the search. The search here produced an independent ground for an arrest on a more serious charge; the foregoing of an arrest for the traffic violation did not defeat the authority to search. The court also concluded that defendant's further detention for purposes of making a lawful search was proper.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Iowa District Court for Polk County, which convicted him of threat of arson based on statements he made to employees of a government agency. Defendant claimed the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction, and that the statute under which he was convicted, Iowa Code &sect; 712.8 (1995), was overbroad and vague.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The agency denied defendant unemployment benefits. Defendant was visibly angry and used profanity in an agency office to express his dissatisfaction with that decision. Defendant said, &quot;Just remember what happened in Oklahoma City.&quot; Subsequent calls to the agency by defendant stated he would blow them up and harm them. All the threats were reported to the police, and extra security measures were taken by the agency. Defendant was charged under &sect; 712.8, and his pretrial motion to dismiss was overruled. The court affirmed the judgment, finding that &sect; 712.8 proscribed statements that a reasonable person of average intelligence would construe as an expression of intention to place an incendiary, explosive, or destructive device or material in a place where it would harm people or property. There was substantial evidence to support the trial court's finding that defendant violated the statute. True threats, the speech proscribed by &sect; 712.8, were not constitutionally protected. Because the statute reached only speech the State could regulate, it was not impermissibly overbroad, nor was &sect; 712.8 vague as applied to defendant's conduct, which clearly fell within the scope of the statute.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with two counts of first-degree murder in 1978. That charge was dismissed after the alleged murder weapon was suppressed as evidence. Approximately 15 years later, defendant was charged with the same murders, and a second warrant was executed in order to seize the same weapon. Defendant's motion to suppress was again granted, but on the ground that principles of collateral estoppel, or issue preclusion, prevented the State from relitigating the admissibility of the weapon. Further, the district court determined that the results from testing the weapon were a fruit of its illegal seizure, and ruled the results to be inadmissible as well. The court granted the State's request for an interlocutory appeal. Upon review, the court reversed the order of suppression and remanded for further proceedings. The court held that collateral estoppel was inapplicable because the two suppression hearings involved facts and issues that were not identical. Further, the court held that the second warrant was supported by probable cause, and that the taint of the illegal search 15 years earlier was so attenuated that it did not invalidate the second warrant.</SPAN></P>

Defendant contended that the evidence from the search should have been suppressed because the stop was unwarranted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The officer heard defendant's car despite being inside her vehicle with the windows up and her police radio on. She stopped the car suspecting it violated the statute against excessive muffler noise. Defendant's license was suspended and there was an outstanding warrant for his arrest. The officer arrested defendant and discovered drugs during an inventory search of the car. A later inspection showed that the muffler was in good working condition. Defendant argued the district court erred in denying his motion to suppress evidence, that the statute upon which the stop was initiated was unconstitutionally vague, and claimed ineffective assistance of counsel. The court held that the officer's auditory perception was reasonable suspicion to believe the car violated Iowa Code &sect; 321.436. The type of offense necessitated the use of hearing to determine a violation. The fact that the muffler was later found to be working properly did not invalidate the otherwise lawful stop.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A committee informally organized to implement Iowa Code &sect; 232.143 (1993) approved the immediate placement of two juveniles for group foster care placement. The juvenile court ordered the placements and the Department appealed, contending that the juvenile court improperly allowed testimony from a department official regarding budgeting decisions within the discretion of the Department, the governor, and the legislature. The Department also contends the juvenile court erred in overriding the fiscal constraints of the local regional group foster care plan when it ordered the placements rather than ordering the implementation of a new plan. The court held that the Department suffered no prejudice from the admission of the testimony because the juvenile court did not rely on the challenged testimony in reaching the ultimate decision. Secondly, the court concluded that the juvenile court committed no error because under separation-of-powers principles the court was not required to order a group foster care plan, the legislative delegation of power to the juvenile court and the Department to devise such a plan was unlawful, and there was money available to fund the placements.</SPAN></P>

Defendant's car was searched and the officer found a pipe that contained marijuana residue and a small amount of unburned marijuana, two syringes, a plastic case containing a beige substance which later was revealed to be methamphetamine, a knife, and a spoon. Defendant was arrested and convicted of a drug stamp violation. On his appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that probable cause to search defendant was present given the alligator clip and the marijuana odor smelled by an experienced police officer. Because the search of defendant's person was lawful, his arrest based on the marijuana found during the search offended no constitutional principles.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner purchased a vehicle that had been totaled from an insurance company. Under Iowa Code &sect; 321.52(4)(a) (Supp. 1995) the vehicle was a wrecked or salvage vehicle so once it was repaired the title had to display a salvage designation, which the owner contended would reduce its value. On appeal, the court held that the district court did not err when it granted the Department's motion for summary judgment. Regardless of the definition found in Iowa Code &sect; 321.52(4)(d), the vehicle was automatically deemed to be a wrecked or salvage vehicle pursuant to Iowa Code &sect; 321.52(4)(a). The insurer did not certify to the state treasurer that the repairs would not exceed $ 3000, and, as a result, the salvage certificates of title were proper. The owner's equal protection argument failed because it was reasonable for the legislature to treat insurer's differently from other purchasers, as an insurer would not acquire a vehicle unless it was &quot;totaled&quot; and its cost of repair equaled or exceeded its value. There was no taking because the owner knew the vehicle had a salvage title and the statutory restrictions existed prior to the owner's purchase.</SPAN></P>

A prior client testified that defendant had inappropriately touched her also. On appeal, defendant argued that &sect; 709.15 was unconstitutionally vague and that his attorney was ineffective for failing to properly attack it. The court held that defendant's counsel was not ineffective because his constitutionality claim had no merit. The statute properly defined &quot;counselor&quot; and the type of touching that was considered inappropriate and illegal. The expert testimony was admissible because it aided the jury in understanding the issues.

The department collected the taxes by seizing and selling the embezzlers' assets.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that the money collected by the department for delinquent taxes was not subject to the insurer's subrogation claim. The department suffered two losses: a direct loss of embezzled funds, and a loss of tax revenue on income generated by the embezzlement. The insurer furnished coverage for the embezzlement loss, not the tax loss. Because neither loss sustained by the department had been fully compensated, there was no unjust enrichment. The court rejected the insurer's contention that its liability for the loss sustained by the department should be reduced by sums recovered on the embezzlers' tax debts. No amounts had been recovered from the embezzlers to satisfy the department's direct loss. The amounts recovered from the embezzlers reduced their delinquent tax debt. The court also held that the department's seizure of the embezzlers' assets did not constitute a breach of the department's contractual obligation with the insurer or an unlawful confiscation of property without due process. Under the policy, the insurer had the right to seek recovery, not a right to recover. By statute, the department had a duty to pursue tax debtors.</SPAN></P>

The execution of the second warrant turned up the contraband that resulted in defendant's current convictions.

The court held that defendant was liable for the drug tax within the meaning of Iowa Code &sect; 453B.1(3)(b), although he was convicted of possessing an amount less than that required by the statutory definition of &quot;dealer,&quot; because the tax was presumed valid due to defendant's failure to appeal the assessment. The court also held that by statute the assessment was a jeopardy assessment entitling the State to collect using summary procedures, regardless of the fact that defendant owned property that could be attached.

The officer mailed defendant the traffic citation the next day. Defendant claimed that the marijuana should have been suppressed on the ground that because the officer chose to issue a citation, defendant could not have been searched. The court held that the evidence was properly not suppressed. The court reasoned that the delay in the issuance of the citation did not render the officer's search invalid. Also, the authority to search in Iowa Code &sect; 805.1(4) was not unconstitutional under the Fourth Amendment or under Iowa Const. art. I, &sect; 8. Because defendant could have been arrested pursuant to Iowa Code &sect; 805.1(6), the officer had the right to search defendant. It was a search incident to a lawful arrest, even if the officer only intended to issue a citation.

The franchisee had falsified sales information to the franchisor in order to claim dealer and customer cash incentives. When asked whether it forged endorsements on rebate checks, the privilege against self-incrimination was asserted. The franchisee urged two principal bases for reversal. It first contended that the trial court and Department misinterpreted Iowa Code &sect; 322A.15 (1993), the guidelines for determining &quot;good cause&quot; for termination under Iowa Code &sect; 322A.2 (1993), by failing to accord equal weight to eight statutory factors.

The city was immune under Iowa Code &sect; 670.4(12) (1995). The patron argued it was error to dismiss his claims against the city, permit the tortfeasor to claim the city's conduct was the sole proximate cause of his injury, and refuse to grant a new trial based on the verdict's inadequacy. The tortfeasor challenged the refusal to allow the jury to allocate a fault percentage against the city. The court held that the action fit the statutory broad classification of claims relating to a swimming pool and that the statute was not constitutionally infirm. Fostering community activities and water safety training was a rational basis for denying municipal swimming pool accident victims the legal protections afforded persons injured at other entertainment and recreation places. Evidence supported the sole proximate cause instruction. The verdict was supported by the record and was far from being so small as to shock the conscience. Immunity precluded the tortfeasor from reducing his liability by factoring the city's alleged fault into the equation.</SPAN></P>

The mushrooms contained psilocybin, a hallucinogenic substance that was prohibited by &sect; 124.204(4)(s).

The court held that &sect; 124.204(4)(s) was not unconstitutionally vague as applied to defendant. The court found that the legislature's use of the phrase &quot;any material which contained psilocybin&quot; in &sect; 124.401(1)(4) lead it to the conclusion that psilocybe mushrooms fell within the proscribed category of hallucinogens, regardless of whether defendant was actually engaged in extracting the psilocybin from them. The court noted that scienter was a required element to convict under &sect; 124.204(4)(s).

The minor asserted that the statute was ex post facto as to him, and was void for vagueness. The court affirmed the judgment, holding that Iowa Code &sect; 692A was a regulatory or remedial statute, not punitive, and was therefore not ex post facto when applied retroactively. The court held that the trial court's construction of &sect; 692A.2(1) was a reasonable construction and was thus sufficient to uphold the constitutionality of the statute in the face of a vagueness challenge.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The District Court for Clinton County (Iowa) challenged the constitutionality of Iowa Code &sect; 252C.5(2) (1995), a statute authorizing appellant department of human services agents to prepare orders for child support and present them to the trial court for summary approval. The trial court ruled that &sect; 252C.5(2) limited its ability to carry out its judicial function and violated the separation of powers doctrine.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The department placed a child in foster care and conducted administrative proceedings to establish appellee mother's obligation for current and accrued foster care costs. Counsel for the department then mailed the trial court a standardized administrative order for support, filled in with information pertaining to the mother's circumstances, and asked the trial court to approve it in accordance with &sect; 252C.5(2). The trial court refused and challenged the constitutionality of the statute. The court reversed the judgment of the district court, holding that, viewed in a cooperative light, the statute posed no threat to the separation of powers doctrine. The common goal evident in &sect; 252C.5(2) was an intergovernmental sharing of a tremendous administrative burden, not an unconstitutional encroachment by the executive branch on the judiciary. The department conceded the trial court's inherent discretionary authority to review any order presented under &sect; 252C.5(2) for substantive, as well as procedural, irregularity. Fundamental to the tripartite structure was the notion of shared governmental power and the need for harmonious cooperation among the coordinate branches.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowners' property was next to land converted into a hog feeding and hog confinement facility.

A year later, the landowners filed a nuisance action and the facility owners answered, asserted affirmative defenses, and counterclaimed. The case was tried solely on the landowners' nuisance claim. The trial court found that the hog facility was a temporary nuisance, and awarded damages for the landowners' pain and suffering up until the day of trial, but refused to grant injunctive relief. Both parties sought review. The court found: 1) that the facility was a permanent nuisance; 2) that Iowa Code &sect; 352.11(1) provided the facility owners no defense; 3) that the trial court's award of damages was appropriate for past, present, and future damages, and not just damages through the trial date; and, 4) that injunctive relief was properly denied.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The police executed a search warrant at the claimant's residence. His girlfriend gave a handwritten statement that she witnessed three visits per night to the home for buying marijuana, that she was present when he delivered drugs, that he used his car to deliver drugs and replenish his marijuana supply, and that selling drugs supplemented the claimant's part-time job. The police found drugs, scales, and plastic bags in the home and marijuana cigarettes in the car. The trial court found that the girlfriend's written statement was more credible than her later court testimony and in conjunction with the items found in the search and the officer's testimony, provided sufficient evidence that the car was used to facilitate the claimant's drug dealing. On appeal, the court affirmed. There was undisputed evidence that the claimant was in possession of marijuana cigarettes found in his car and his possession of drugs found in the car provided a sufficient ground for forfeiture. There was evidence that the car was used to facilitate his drug dealing sufficient to uphold the forfeiture. The forfeiture of a car with equity of approximately $ 8,000 did not constitute an excessive fine.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The attorneys challenged fee guidelines that provided compensation at a rate of $ 40 - $ 60 per hour with maximum fees for certain forms of court-appointed client representation. The attorneys argued that the fee schedules deprived their clients of effective representation of counsel. The court first held that the attorneys did have standing to raise the constitutional issues of their clients, because issues of a defendant's right to effective representation and an attorney's right to fair compensation were found to be inextricably linked. The court affirmed the denial of relief, however, because there was no showing that any particular client had been prejudiced by the fee schedules. The court noted that the lower and usual fees could be increased in particular cases with court approval. Furthermore, ethical requirements imposed on attorneys worked to insure that clients got effective representation even if the attorney was paid less. The guidelines had sufficient flexibility to meet the statutory requirement of reasonable compensation and they did not violate the constitutional rights of indigents.</SPAN></P>

The trial court further declared that coal mining and landfilling were existing nonconforming uses.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The company engaged in strip mining within the county and then prepared to begin landfill operations. The county enacted an ordinance to deter the landfill operations, and the court in a prior decision upheld an ordinance and found no regulatory taking of one site and found that a determination could not be made for another site because the cause was not ripe. In a new action, the trial court found a regulatory taking of both sites and that the county tortiously interfered with the company's business expectancy. On appeal, the court held: 1) the takings claim and nonconforming use claim required dismissal because the matters were not ripe for adjudication; 2) the tortious interference with contract claim was timely filed and was a proper claim against the county, under Iowa Code &sect;&sect; 670.2, 670.4, with sufficient evidence to generate a jury question on the county's predominate motive; 3) neither the tortious interference or nonconforming use claims were barred by res judicata because the claims were not adjudicated in the prior action; and 4) the county had no standing to challenge the trial court's failure to dismiss some of the claims because the county was not aggrieved.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court held that defendant's arrest was constitutionally valid. The court held that therefore the trial court did not err in overruling defendant's motion to suppress the evidence discovered during the search of his person incident to his arrest for theft. The court ruled that there was substantial evidence to support the trial court's findings that defendant was a &quot;dealer&quot; for purposes of the drug tax stamp charge, and that defendant had the intent to deliver for purposes of the possession with intent to deliver charge. The court held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in sentencing defendant to concurrent terms of incarceration for his convictions on these charges.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted for possession of a controlled substance with intent to deliver and failure to possess a drug tax stamp, under Iowa Code &sect;&sect; 124.401(1)(c)(5), 453B.3, 453B.7 (1995). The court affirmed the lower court's decision, finding that a warrantless search of defendant's vehicle did not violate the search and seizure provisions of U.S. Const. amend. IV because police had probable cause and there were exigent circumstances. Similarly, the court found that defendant's conviction, coupled with civil asset forfeiture under Iowa Code &sect; 809, did not constitute a double jeopardy violation under U.S. Const. amend. V because the forfeiture statute was found to be neither criminal nor penal. The court noted that the applicable test of whether a forfeiture was punishment depended on Congressional intent and the degree to which the forfeiture scheme was punitive. A proposed jury instruction submitted by defendant was properly refused because it was not based on the evidence. The court held that drugs seized from defendant were contraband and not protected by the Commerce Clause, U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 8, and that evidence proffered by defendant had not been relevant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Wearing only his underwear and sexually aroused, defendant photographed his 12-year-old daughter in provocative poses, partially undressed in a motel room. He was convicted of sexual exploitation of a minor in violation of &sect;&sect; 728.12(1) and 728.1(6)(g). On appeal, he argued that &sect; 728.1(6)(g) was void for vagueness because it did not contain a definition of the term &quot;nudity&quot; or of the phrase &quot;for the purpose of arousing or satisfying the sexual desires.&quot; He also claimed that First Amendment rights were implicated. The court held that the statute was constitutional because it did not criminalize the &quot;mere nudity&quot; of a minor, but required an element of scienter by requiring that the activity have been for the purpose of arousing or satisfying the sexual desires of a person. The statute clearly applied to defendant, who was in his underwear and aroused when he took the photographs. Although there may have been a few cases where nude photographs of minors may have had a scientific purpose, the potential infringement on protected expression was too insubstantial to give defendant standing to claim the statute was unconstitutionally vague on its face.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court upheld the trial court's judgment convicting defendant of attempting to entice away a child. Specifically, the court rejected defendant's argument that a person of ordinary intelligence was not given fair notice of what was prohibited because the word &quot;entice&quot; was not defined and its meaning was unclear. Instead, the court held that despite the lack of an express definition, a statute was not unconstitutionally vague if the meaning of the words could have been fairly ascertained by reference to their ordinary and usual meaning. Thus, in this situation, the court held that the commonly understood meaning of &quot;entice&quot; was specific enough to provide guidance and fair notice of what actions were proscribed. Likewise, the court held that no person of ordinary intelligence would have been left in doubt regarding the meaning of &quot;away.&quot; Lastly, the court concluded that the meaning of &sect; 710.10(2) was clear from its terms, that its language provided fair notice, and that it provided an explicit standard for those applying the law.</SPAN></P>

Defendant subsequently withdrew his not guilty plea and pleaded guilty to all charges. On appeal defendant contended that &sect; 453B gave him a reasonable time following his possession of the cocaine to obtain and affix the tax stamps. The court reasoned that the word immediately as used in Iowa Code &sect; 453B.3 meant without delay. Consequently, the court held that &sect;&sect; 453B.3 and 453B.12 were not inconsistent because both required that tax stamps have been affixed to the taxable substance prior to or at the time of the transaction. The court held that no grace period or window of opportunity was provided to allow the payment of tax and affixation of the tax stamp within a reasonable time following the transaction.

The court applied that standard and held that impoundment of defendant's vehicle was constitutional because (1) the police followed reasonable standardized criteria in deciding to impound her car and (2) objectively there was an administrative reason for the impoundment. The court held that the inventory of the car's contents was also constitutional because the police followed the standard policy of the department.

The newspaper challenged the Iowa District Court for Polk County's grant of summary judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The district court granted the motion for summary judgment filed by the secretary and administrator based upon a finding that the senate's policy involved a textually demonstrable constitutional commitment of power to the senate and, therefore, the matter was a non-justiciable political question. On appeal, the newspaper and council argued that the district court erred in granting the motion on various grounds, including that the court improperly applied the political question and separation of power doctrines and that the court erred in finding that the matter was a non-justiciable legislative issue. The court found that (1) the senate's decision to keep the records in question confidential fell within the power of the senate, pursuant to Iowa Const. art. III, &sect; 9, to determine its rules of proceedings; (2) due to the existence of a textually demonstrable constitutional commitment of the issue to the senate, neither the judiciary, nor the department of general services, a department of the executive branch, had the power to interfere with or contradict those procedures; and (3) the secretary did not have the authority to release the phone records without the senate's permission.</SPAN></P>

The court held that notice to the inmate of postconviction disciplinary proceedings against him was adequate to inform him of the alleged wrongful conduct in which he engaged. The deletion of confidential information from the notice was justified because of the need to maintain order, peace, and tranquility at the prison facility. The notice generally informed the inmate of the date the alleged rule infraction occurred. The notice stated the gang activity in which the inmate allegedly took part occurred after he was transferred to the facility. More specific information may have threatened the security at the facility by revealing the identity of the informant. The court found that the rule that the inmate was charged with violating plainly informed him of what general categories of behavior subjected him to the rule.

The wife alleged that she had been sexually abused when she was a child. The parents and brothers filed motions for summary judgment. The trial court determined that the matter involved issued on which the court had not ruled. Thus, nine questions were certified to the court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The wife claimed that she did not tie her psychological problems to incidents of sexual abuse as a child until she began therapy. The trial court certified questions to the court in the wife's action against her parents and brothers. The court held that Iowa Code &sect; 614.8A did not apply retroactively to claims that were barred by a prior existing statute of limitations. Section 614.8A applied to the liability theories that were recognized in law to the extent that the wife sought recovery for sexual abuse injuries. Because a reasonable person would not have been forced to guess as to its scope, &sect; 614.8A was not void for vagueness. The wife remembered some specific acts of sexual abuse, so she was entitled to rely on the discovery rule in the instances where the nexus between the acts and the injuries was not discovered until a time less than two years prior to commencement of the action. Iowa did not recognize &quot;failure to protect&quot; as a separate and distinct action. The parents did not have immunity from the negligence claim if they knew of and allowed the abuse. Parental immunity applied to the parents' actions whether or not they occurred on the premises controlled by the parents.</SPAN></P>

Defendants' adjoining property was located outside the city limits. They raised miniature horses on their land. A controversy arose between the parties about the construction and maintenance of a partition fence. The township trustees, sitting as fence viewers, required the parties to maintain separate portions of the fence. The trial court found that the fence-viewing statute, Iowa Code Chapter 359A (1995), was unconstitutional as applied to plaintiffs. It also found that the statute was preempted by Iowa Code &sect; 364.1, the home-rule statute for cities. Defendants appealed from that judgment, which was reversed. The matter was remanded. The court found that Iowa Code Chapter 359A (1995) applied equally to all adjoining landowners, without regard to their use of the land. In that regard, a law did not become unconstitutional because it caused a hardship. The home rule provisions, Iowa Const. art. III, &sect; 38A and Iowa Code &sect; 364.1, withheld that power where it conflicted with state law.

After the court ordered the DOR to refund monies wrongfully taxed on federal civil service employees' pensions, a hearing was held, and the trial court ruled for the law firm and ordered five percent of the common fund to be paid by the DOR directly to the law firm. An appeal was taken. The court held that the DOR's actions did not amount to the trial court having control over a common fund. The DOR's decision to hold back five percent of each refund was made at the trial court's suggestion during a hearing on attorney fees. Each refund was the individual property or money of each taxpayer. Thus, the trial court had no authority to instruct the DOR to withhold the refunds pending the trial court's ruling on the common fund issue. In addition, the collective amount of approximately 13,000 separate refunds, segregated or not, did not and could not represent a common fund from which the law firm could draw a fee.</SPAN></P>

The court held that postconviction proceedings were law actions and ordinarily were reviewed on error. However, the court stated that when there was an alleged denial of constitutional rights, the court's review was de novo. The court stated that the inmate's punishment comported with due process requirements because the prison rule was meant to encompass insolence or disrespect to another person, and the inmate subjected another person to insolence and disrespect and therefore violated the rule. The court also stated that the rule was not unconstitutionally vague because it clearly prohibited the inmate's verbal abuse. Finally, the court concluded that the rule did not violate the inmate's right to free speech because it did not apply to the content of the speech, but merely to the manner of his expression.

The court found the questioned language was ambiguous, but franchisor's urged interpretation that the statute was inapplicable to out of state franchisees who operated an instate franchise would frustrate the statute's purpose which was to provide greater protection to franchisees. The court further concluded the ambiguous language contained in Iowa Franchise Act, Iowa Code &sect; 523H.6(1) (1993), when construed consistent with legislative purposes, did not apply to a franchisor who sought to establish a new outlet or company owned store located in another state but within reasonable proximity to a franchisee located in Iowa.</SPAN></P>

Defendant appealed the conviction and argued that the drug tax stamp conviction and his conviction under Iowa Code &sect; 201.401(1)(d) for the manufacture of a controlled substance violated his right against double jeopardy. The court affirmed and held that defendant waived his right to his double jeopardy claim when he resisted consolidation of the drug tax stamp charge with his prosecution for manufacture of a controlled substance involving the same marijuana. The court found that the tax was not a criminal penalty. Because it was not a criminal penalty, the sentence on the drug tax stamp conviction did not constitute a second punishment violative of defendant's right against double jeopardy. It was not conditioned on the commission of a crime, nor was it exacted only after defendant was arrested. The court found that defendant suffered no actual prejudice because of the prosecutorial delay. The court found no error in the lower court's refusal to permit defendant to make certain offers of proof as they were not relevant and evidence of his guilt was overwhelming.</SPAN></P>

The charter included initiative and referendum provisions for adoption, amendment, or repeal of ordinances by voters at an election. However, based upon opinions of the Iowa Attorney General that initiative and referendum elections were not authorized, the auditor refused to place a referendum issue on the ballot at a city election. As such, the city sought a declaratory judgment that the initiative and referendum provisions of the city's charter were not contrary to Iowa law. The trial court agreed with the auditor that the initiative and referendum provisions were inconsistent with state law. On appeal, the court agreed with the city and held that for the auditor to require specific statutory authority to permit an initiative or referendum vote was contrary to the intent of Iowa Const. art.

The district court determined that the nurses' constitutional challenge was precluded by a decision in a declaratory judgment action.

The district court's decision on the nurses' constitutional claim was affirmed. However, the court reversed the district court's decision that the board abused its discretion by imposing inpatient treatment and aftercare as a condition of the nurses' probation. The court held that the district court's previous finding was substantial evidence that supported the board's finding of habitual intoxication. Further, the board did not abuse its discretion in requiring the nurse to undergo inpatient treatment or in ordering any of the other conditions of her probation. There was ample evidence that the nurse had an alcohol problem. As a health care provider, alcohol posed a serious concern for public health and safety.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The ward challenged the constitutionality of the Iowa guardianship statute on due process grounds and urged that in a guardianship termination proceeding, the guardian bore the burden of persuasion to show that the guardianship should continue.

The court held that guardianship involved such a significant loss of liberty that a ward was entitled to the full panoply of procedural due process rights comparable to those present in involuntary civil commitment proceedings. A district court could make a finding of incompetence only if the court found that the ward's decision making capacity was so impaired that the ward could not care for himself. In termination cases, the ward was required to make a prima facie showing of some decision making capacity, then the burden of persuasion shifted to the guardian to show by clear and convincing evidence that the guardianship should be continued. When guardianship was ordered to commence or continue, the district court was required to consider if a limited guardianship was appropriate.</SPAN></P>

Appellants, by writ of certiorari, challenged the trial court's decision declaring the disparate wage increases unconstitutional and invalid. The court rejected the public employees' challenge and reversed the contrary holding by the trial court because the two groups were not similarly situated. One was unionized; the other was not. The unionized group was subject to a court order compelling a set pay increase; the other group was not subject to that order. The State could have rationally determined not to expend equal pay increases to nonunion employees for economic reasons. Therefore, the public employees did not meet their burden of showing no rational basis for the different pay raises.In addition, even if the pay bill conflicted with the public employment relations Act, the salary bill prevailed because it was both more specific and later enacted.</SPAN></P>

The trial court found that &sect; 153.34(7) was not unconstitutionally vague or overbroad and affirmed the dental board's decision. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's judgment. The court determined that the dentist could not prevail on his vagueness challenge because his conduct was clearly proscribed under &sect; 153.34(7). The dentist's conduct was dishonorable because he misrepresented the dental board's action against his dental partner in an attempt to retain patient patronage, and the misrepresentation was likely to mislead patients about the nature and severity of the action against his wife.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner claimant appealed from the judgment of the Iowa District Court for Polk County, which affirmed the industrial commissioner's decision denying him additional workers' compensation benefits. Appellees, the claimant's employer and its insurer, denied that the claimant's broken leg had also caused injury to his body as a whole. The claimant contended the scheduled injury provisions of Iowa Code &sect; 85.34(2) (1993) were unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The deputy industrial commissioner concluded that the claimant's earlier broken leg did not cause his alleged injuries. He also found he did not have jurisdiction to address the claimant's constitutional challenge. The industrial commissioner adopted the deputy's proposed opinion and affirmed the denial of benefits. The district court affirmed, finding that Iowa Code &sect; 85.34(2) (1993) was constitutional. The court affirmed the district court. In considering the claimant's equal protection challenge, the court rejected the claimant's argument that the scheduled injury provisions of &sect; 85.34(2) should be subject to strict scrutiny. While an employee who did not suffer a scheduled injury was able to obtain recovery for loss of earning capacity and an employee who suffered a scheduled injury was not, the U.S. Supreme Court had not found this distinction involved a suspect class or a fundamental right. The court then found that the scheduled injury provision had a rational basis. The purpose of the schedule was to make certain the amount of compensation in the case of specific injuries and to avoid controversies. Thus, the court held that the claimant's equal protection challenge failed.</SPAN></P>

On cross-appeal, appellee Board of Review of the City of Des Moines claimed that the trial court erred in reducing the 1991 assessed values of the properties. The property owners claimed that the reduced assessments were still inequitable based on comparable properties.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owners challenged earlier assessments by the board and the trial court had entered a decree establishing fair market values for the subject properties. Despite the trial court's ruling, the city did not change the assessments on any of the properties. In the present case, the trial court ordered the assessor to use a percentage no higher than the highest percentage used for any of the comparable properties. The court modified the decree to change the ratio used for assessment and affirmed the decree as modified. The court held as follows: 1) the property owners did not offer the testimony of two disinterested witnesses as required by Iowa Code &sect; 441.21(3) (1993), so the burden remained on the owners to prove that the valuations were excessive; 2) the property owners were assisted by a presumption arising from the trial court-established 1988 valuations of the properties because the board did not prove a change in value; and 3) the ratios calculated for commercial property by the director of revenue and finance were adopted as fair and equitable percentages to be applied to the market values of the subject properties for purposes of determining their assessed values.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was a professional photographer. He arranged for a minor to dance at bachelor parties and perform sexual acts for money. Defendant also took nude photographs of the minor and her boyfriend engaged in sexual acts, arranged for the minor to seduce and have sex with a pizza delivery man, and eventually had sex with her himself. Defendant was convicted of sexual exploitation of a minor and pandering. The court affirmed because knowledge of the age of a minor was not an element that was needed to prove a violation of &sect; 728.12(1). The court interpreted &sect; 728.12(1) as written. There was no indication in the statutory language that knowledge of age was an element of the offense. The court also determined that defendant was not denied his constitutional right to equal protection of the law, and the denial of a defense based on mistake did not chill defendant's First Amendment rights. Finally, the court held that the evidence presented by the State sufficiently supported defendant's conviction for pandering. The evidence showed that defendant persuaded, arranged, coerced, and otherwise caused the minor to become a prostitute in violation of Iowa Code &sect; 725.3(2).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The board and the auditor claimed that the commission's proposed charter was an illegal form of government, and thus, was not to be put on the ballot. The court held that the charter proposed a legal form of a combined county and city government, to wit, a commonwealth government. The creation of a commission for the mayors of the county's cities to meet was valid because the mayors' commission was advisory and had no power to make any binding decisions. Thus, it was irrelevant that the commission violated the one-person, one-vote rule where each mayor had one vote, despite the sizes of their constituencies. Despite the parties' contrary stipulation, the County Home Rule Amendment, Iowa Const. art. III, &sect; 39A, applied to the charter. Thus, the mayors' commission, and not just the city councils, had the authority to mutually agree to transfer municipal services. There was no legal prohibition of the charter's office of commonwealth mayor. The charter did not have to state a specific mathematical formula on how to levy taxes because a methodology was provided. The commission's preliminary report merely had to be available at the public meeting and did not have to be distributed.</SPAN></P>

Whether the instruction on intent was an error was not resolved because even if the jury was instructed as defendant wanted, defendant failed to show that there would have been a different result. Further, an ineffective assistance claim required prejudice. There was no prejudice because, again, the result would not have been different.

In affirming, the court held that although the safety of the proposed crossing was a relevant consideration, it did not follow that the DOT had to discuss each variable, item by item. Moreover, a review of the order revealed that the DOT administrative law judge discussed many of the variables listed in Iowa Code &sect; 812.4, such as vehicle traffic, the existence of switch tracks, and switching and through train movements.

Defendant was allowed to remain with his mother, but was ordered to comply with a probation contract. Defendant was again referred to the trial court on further offenses and his probation contract was continued. A disposition hearing was later held and it was determined that defendant had violated the terms of his probation contract. The State recommended foster care, but there was no opening for defendant, so the trial court placed defendant with a State training school. Defendant sought review and the trial court permitted defendant to remain with his mother. Defendant violated the terms of his contract and was again placed with the State training school. Defendant sought review and argued that the placement denied his due process rights. The court found that the issues regarding the trial court's initial placement of defendant with the State training school were moot, that defendant had no constitutional right to be placed in foster care when there were no spots available for him, and that allocating foster care on a first-come first served basis was did not violate defendant's equal protection rights.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following an adjudicatory hearing, the district court, sitting as a juvenile court, found the child to be a child in need of assistance. The district court issued an ex parte order to remove the child from her grandparents' home. The ex parte order was later confirmed and temporary custody was transferred to the Department for foster care placement until a dispositional hearing. Following the dispositional hearing, the district court continued the legal custody of the child with the Department for placement in foster care. The mother appealed the adjudicatory, removal, and dispositional orders. Upon review, the court affirmed. The court found that there was clear and convincing evidence to support the adjudicatory order that the child was a child in need of assistance. The court further found clear and convincing evidence supported the dispositional order, and that the transfer of custody of the child to the Department for placement in foster care was the least restrictive disposition appropriate. The mother, by failing to file a timely Iowa R. Civ. P. 179(b) motion in juvenile court, waived her due process and statutory challenges to deficiencies in the dispositional order.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The billing system the anesthesiologist used for post-operative patients made it look like he was billing multiple patients for the same time, but in fact he was adjusting the time to reflect only the actual time spent with each patient. At a hearing, other anesthesiologists testified as to the propriety of the anesthesiologist's billing methods. One testified that he thought the billing method was not proper because it did not distinguish between anesthesia time and other time. Other anesthesiologists testified approvingly of the billing method. A panel of the Board proposed that the anesthesiologist be suspended and then put on probation. The Board adopted the panel's decision. The district court affirmed the decision, but the court reversed the decision and remanded. The court held that the Board's decision not to resolve the anesthesiologists' billing dispute made it clear that they did not find the anesthesiologist guilty of billing for services that he did not perform. It would take more than a finding that the anesthesiologist's billing could be misleading to meet the legal requirement of substantial evidence to support imposition of discipline.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed the decision that found that the state statutes and regulations which hindered the child's out of state placement unconstitutional. The court found that these statutes and regulations did not violate any of the child's substantive rights under the Due Process Clause. The court reasoned that there was an in-state facility capable of providing minimally adequate treatment, and the child was not constitutionally entitled to more. The court then found that the limitation on rates paid for group foster care and the requirement that facilities must contract with the state were valid restrictions on the juvenile court's power, and therefore, the juvenile court erred in placing the child out of state without first assuring that this placement complied with the applicable statutes and regulations.</SPAN></P>

Her partner complained to police that defendant was embezzling from the partnership and defendant was charged with second-degree theft. Defendant claimed that a partner could not be found guilty of embezzling partnership assets. The trial court agreed and dismissed the State's case. The court reversed, finding that partners were not immune from conviction for embezzling partnership property. It noted that prior to passage of the Uniform Partnership Act (UPA), the court had held that a partner could not be convicted for embezzling partnership funds; however, the UPA changed the common-law nature of partnership property. Under the UPA, partners held profits derived from the partnership as trustees and partners, and as trustees of the partnership property, fell within the scope of the theft statute. Further, under the entity theory, the partnership, not the partners, owned the property and when defendant took the partnership property, she stole the property of another. Finally, application of the theft statute to defendant in this case did not violate defendant's due process rights.</SPAN></P>

The dispute arose because they had no right to vote in a successful school bond election. While conceding they had no statutory right to vote in or contest the election, they nevertheless argued that they were entitled to bring an equity action to challenge the election pursuant to a prior holding of the court pertaining to elector-taxpayers. The school district argued that a 1976 statutory amendment uprooted the court's prior holding by supplying the statutory right to contest the election to elector-taxpayers. The nonresident landowners argued that they were left in precisely the same dilemma as the electors-taxpayers faced before the court's previous decision. They too were excluded from access to the statutory challenge, and they argued that they should be granted the same equity rights. The court agreed with the district that the court's equitable remedy was accorded as an elector's right, giving electors the right to contest a kind of school election the legislature failed to include in the statute.

The court held that landowner 2's proposed route was not unobstructed or unquestioned. The court also held that the route landowner 1 chose most nearly met the criteria set by Iowa Code &sect; 471.4(2) because only that route passed along subdivision and &quot;forty&quot; lines. The proposed route would not interfere with access to landowner 2's buildings or cemetery unless the grade was raised too high. Therefore, the court ordered that any such road allow for access. Section 471.4(2) was not a taking for private use, as the resulting road would be public. Neither was it an improper delegation of sovereign power in violation of Iowa Const. art.

On appeal, the court affirmed. The court found that the district court correctly dismissed the school district as a party to the suit. The court reasoned that a school district was a legislative creation, and therefore not a &quot;person,&quot; within the meaning of any bill of rights or constitutional limitation. The court also reasoned that the general rule controlled, and did not grant an exception for &quot;great public importance.&quot; The court also concluded that &sect; 282.18(8) did indeed have a rational basis. The court reasoned in part that open enrollment worked for each student to have roughly the same amount of money for his or her education wherever that student was educated.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the decision that denied the school district standing to challenge a financing mechanism in the state open enrollment statute and upheld the constitutionality of the financing mechanism.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The creditor obtained a substantial judgment against the debtor on the debtor's personal guarantees made on defaulted leases. When the creditor attempted to levy on the debtor's federal court claim against the creditor and 11 other defendants, the debtor sought a stay of execution. In affirming the district court's denial, the court rejected the debtor's contention that the stay should have been granted under Iowa Code &sect; 626.58 (1991) because allowing the creditor to execute on the debtor's federal claim would have rendered the proceedings ineffective. The creditor did not dispute the debtor's contention that if the creditor were substituted as the plaintiff in the debtor's suit, the creditor would simply dismiss it. The creditor had received offers from other defendants in the federal court claim to contribute to the claim and, thus, the court found that the creditor would have been prejudiced if the stay had been granted since the debtor's claim was valueless if a defense verdict were rendered. Further, the court noted that the debtor would still receive something from her federal suit because the creditor would have to give the debtor credit on the judgment against her.</SPAN></P>

Had defendant limited his attack on the victim to mere words, the First Amendment would have protected his right to do so.

The board placed the optometrist on three years probation with conditions. The court upheld the judgment on appeal because it contained no error. The court decided that the optometrist lacked standing to challenge the statute and the rule on the basis that they were overbroad, either on their face or as applied. The court found that the optometrist failed to assert any violation of his rights under the First Amendment. The court rejected as meritless the optometrist's contention that the statute's and the rule's language was unconstitutionally vague under the Due Process Clauses of the Iowa and U.S. Constitutions. The court was not persuaded by the optometrist's contention that the board's combination of investigative, prosecutorial, and adjudicative functions contravened the Due Process Clauses of U.S. Const. XIV and Iowa Const. art. I, &sect; 9. The court concluded that the optometrist did not satisfy the burden imposed in a challenge to agency action.</SPAN></P>

The trial court noted that evidence of continuing loud music would not ordinarily have sufficed to constitute a refusal by defendant to obey the prior order.

Defendant was arrested after a conservation officer observed him diving for mussels on the Iowa side of the Mississippi River. The State alleged that defendant fraudulently obtained a resident commercial mussel license and charged him with one count of fraudulent practices in violation of Iowa Code &sect; 714.8(3) (1991). On appeal, the court found that lying on an official document was not to be compared to fishing without a license. The legislature could have reasonably concluded that the fraud was the greater wrong. The court also rejected defendant's argument that his fraudulent answer should have been excused because it was in answer to a question that should not have been asked on an analogous constitutional basis.

The court held that the dismissal of the taxpayers' first action and the treasurer's decision did not operate as adjudications on the merits of the taxpayer's claims so as to preclude their litigation in the second action. The taxpayers' raised valid factual and legal questions regarding the treasurer's duty and obligations that could not be resolved on a motion to dismiss.

The provider also argued that it charged the same rates as other collect call providers who did file tariffs. The evidence showed, though, that the provider charged the highest day rate for all calls regardless of the time of day they were placed. Appellant Office of Consumer Advocate, Iowa Department of Justice, who had intervened in the action also sought review of the judgment, arguing that the provider should have been deprived of all of its revenue. On appeal, the court agreed that the provider was required under &sect; 476.91(1)(a) to file a tariff with the Board because it was an alternative operator service (AOS).

The psychologist was not under investigation, but the patient was previously a patient of a psychologist whom the Board was investigating. The district court entered an order enforcing the subpoena pursuant to Iowa Code &sect; 258A.6 (1991).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The patient sought the professional services of the psychologist being investigated, whom she eventually married. The patient then engaged the subpoenaed psychologist as her counselor. The Board received a complaint concerning some alleged conduct between the couple during their psychologist-patient relationship. The court held that Iowa Code &sect; 622.10 did not bar disclosure of the records because that section was limited to disclosure of confidential communications by the giving of testimony. A subpoena duces tecum did not compel disclosing confidential communications by the giving of testimony. The court further held that Iowa Code &sect; 258A.6 (1991) was broad enough to reach the records in the possession of the psychologist not under investigation. Section 258A.6 authorized the Board to issue a subpoena to compel the production of professional records in the custody of any mental health professional. The court remanded to allow the district court to determine whether the Board's need for the records substantially outweighed the patient's privacy interest. The appropriate procedure was an in camera hearing with a protective order prohibiting disclosure of any evidence presented.</SPAN></P>

The trial court rejected the first action on a finding that it was time-barred and rejected the second action on the basis of res judicata. The trial court rejected the instant action on the ground of claim preclusion based upon the dismissal of the second suit. The trial court found that the 1990 amendment to Iowa Code &sect; 252A.5A did not save the State's claim because &sect; 252A.5A addressed only previous dismissals on statute of limitations grounds. The court reviewed the State's equitable action de novo under Iowa R. App. P. 4. The court agreed with the trial court for expanded reasons. The court opined that the 1990 amendment to Iowa Code &sect; 252A.5A may have been a legislative response to the outcome of the first action. The court ruled that the 1979 judgment of dismissal in the first action placed the matter beyond the reach of the legislature because no subsequent legislation could alter that judgment due to its legal effect and finality.</SPAN></P>

The arresting officer's sworn statement had been admitted without objection from the driver. The court found that: (1) although the arresting officer's sworn statement by itself might have lacked sufficient probative force to support the requisite reasonable grounds, the sole question on review was whether the belated hearsay challenge had been correctly rejected; (2) raising the issue on review at the Department had not been sufficient to preserve the issue for review; and (3) the failure to object to the admission of the statement into evidence or raise the issue prior to that time meant that the issue was unpreserved.</SPAN></P>

Defendant and his friends were arrested and charged with terrorism and criminal gang participation. Defendant was convicted. On appeal, he challenged the constitutionality of the criminal gang participation statute, but the court found it was constitutional. The court found that the statute was not void for vagueness, in violation of U.S. Const. amend. V, XIV or Iowa Const. art. I, &sect; 9, because the statute gave a person of ordinary intelligence fair notice of what it prohibited and provided an explicit standard for those who applied it. The court considered the statute as applied to defendant and found that it was not unconstitutionally vague. The court found that the statute was not overbroad because it did not proscribe the protected activity of freedom of association, but only prohibited association when combined with aiding and abetting a criminal act.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee was involved in an airplane crash in Sioux City, Iowa, while she was en route from Colorado to Illinois.

The district court reversed the Commissioner's decision that penalized the employer pursuant to Iowa Code &sect; 86.13. The court affirmed the district court's judgment. Section 86.13 imposed a penalty on an employer if it delayed in the commencement of benefits without reasonable or probable cause or excuse. The employer's challenge to the exercise of in personam jurisdiction over it by the Commissioner presented a fairly debatable issue. Iowa Code &sect; 85.3 was a long arm statute which provided that nonresident employers were subject to the Commissioner's jurisdiction if their employees performed services within Iowa. The court determined that the interpretation of &sect; 85.3 in regard to whether the employee's activities were sufficient to confer in personam jurisdiction over the employer in Iowa was capable of fair debate.

The arrestee claimed damages for violation of his civil rights under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 and his common law rights to recover for wrongful detention and negligence. His wife claimed loss of consortium. The trial court dismissed the action because two years had elapsed since the cause of action accrued, and plaintiffs were time barred under Iowa Code &sect; 614.1(2). In reversing and remanding, the court held that the statutory provisions of Iowa Code &sect; 613A.5, which extended the period for filing an action if written notice of the claim was given, were applicable. The court had previously held that the &quot;not to exceed 90 days&quot; provision of &sect; 613A.5 was unconstitutional because it violated equal protection. However, the remaining provisions of &sect; 613A.5 could be severed, and a person could commence a tort action against a municipality within two years after giving timely notice.

The court held that &sect; 148.7(9) as applied to the anesthesiologist denied equal protection. Any appeal for judicial review would have taken longer than the anesthesiologist's suspension. Thus, &sect; 148.7(9)'s prohibition against stays effectively eliminated his statutory right to judicial review. The statutory prohibition against granting stays under &sect; 148.7(9), rooted in the public's strong interest in protecting its citizens at the earliest time allowed by law, was inapplicable because the Board admitted that the anesthesiologist was no threat to the public. The only purpose served in withholding the stay would have been to single him out as a physician for more severe punishment by denying him an effective review. Thus, there was no rational basis for prohibiting the anesthesiologist from seeking the stay that was available to other licensees.</SPAN></P>

The mother and son sued the father under the father's homeowner's policy, and the insurer obtained a declaratory judgment that the family exclusion clause in the parties' policy negated coverage for the father's liability and the son's medical expenses. The mother and son appealed but the court affirmed the district court. The court noted that the son was an insured person under the policy by virtue of his residing in the household of the mother and father, who were also insureds under the policy. The court rejected the insureds' contention that it should find the family exclusion void as against public policy merely because insurance carriers refused to supply the type of insurance the insureds sought. Rather, the court said, such a policy decision was up to the Legislature. The court held that Iowa Const. art. I, &sect; 6, and U.S. Const. amend.

Although the court construed the two statutes as defining the same offense under the Blockburger test, the legislature authorized cumulative punishment under them in a single trial. The court also rejected defendant's self-incrimination claim because drug dealers buying drug tax stamps were assured anonymity. Likewise, the court rejected defendant's due process claim because the &sect; 421A.12 tax was not conditioned on the commission of a crime, which indicated the legislature's intent to treat it as a civil sanction, not additional punishment.</SPAN></P>

The court rejected appellant's suggestion that he should have midweek visitation rights and be given the first option to baby sit for the child. The court could not find special circumstances that would have justified a deviation from the guideline amount with regard to child support. Therefore, it affirmed the child support award.

The court affirmed the district court's judgment, concluding that the ordinance rationally related to the valid interest in reducing the costs of maintaining the gravel roads near the Agency's property and that the ordinance did not conflict with the terms of Iowa Code &sect; 445D.9 because it did not bar establishing a compost facility. The fact that ordinance imposed a hardship on the Agency did not render it unconstitutional on the ground that it was arbitrary or unreasonable; the Agency retained access to its property and was only restricted it from driving the vehicles that exceeded the weight limit on the embargoed roads.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city passed an anti-nepotism resolution. On learning of the policy, the associations filed a lawsuit. The trial court refused to rule on the validity of the resolution, but opined that the city's act was within its &quot;home rule&quot; powers, did not violate constitutional rights of the associations, and was not overbroad. The court reversed in part and affirmed in part. Iowa Code &sect; 20.7 granted to public employers the exclusive power to hire, transfer, and discharge public employees. That removed the case from the exclusive jurisdictional sphere of the Public Employment Relations Board (PERB). The ultimate relief sought by the associations was not to negotiate procedures to implement the anti-nepotism policy, but to have the policy declared invalid. That decision was properly for the courts to decide rather than PERB. The anti-nepotism policy was not arbitrary action as prohibited by Iowa Code &sect;&sect; 400.18, 400.19. Reasonable regulations that did not significantly interfere with decisions to enter into the marital relationship could be legitimately imposed.

The court ruled that the county had not substantially deprived the coal company of its use and enjoyment of its one mine, therefore there was no taking upon which to sustain the claim of compensation.

Based on the juvenile court's findings, the individual sought to have his name expunged from the registry. The department refused to amend the registry. The district court concluded that &sect; 235A.19(2)(a) denied the individual equal protection and due process. The individual conceded that he has been treated the same as all other alleged abusers. The court stated that as long as members of the same class were treated equally, and the classification itself was reasonable, the equal protection standard was not violated. The court also held that the six-month time period to apply for expungement or correction of the registry was not violative of due process in light of the urgent need to protect potential victims and the prompt notice given to the alleged perpetrators. The district court's order was reversed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The county had adopted a lease-purchase agreement after the track experienced cash-flow problems. It contended on appeal that the taxpayers' action was time-barred. The taxpayers argued that the 15-day limitation period under &sect; 331.443(2) was inapplicable because the county's notice on the lease-purchase was inadequate and because the arrangement was merely a means of providing credit support for bonds, and that the agreement and its line of credit violated the state constitution. The court affirmed the judgment. The court found that the substance of the agreement was consistent with the denomination of the contract, and rejected the contention that the arrangement was merely a means of providing credit support. The court determined that the taxpayers' challenge was filed several years after the time period provided in &sect; 331.443(2). The court concluded that the county substantially complied with the notice requirements of &sect; 331.443(2). The court held that the county was entitled to summary judgment on its defense. The court rejected the constitutional claims, finding that the county's advancement of funds did not cause it to loan its credit or assume a private corporate debt.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the district court's denial of adoption and affirmed the court of appeals' decision to reverse termination of the natural mother's parental rights. The district court properly denied adoption for the adoptive parents because the exclusive termination of parental rights provided for in Iowa Code ch. 600A was not met. The father established paternity of the child, had not abandoned the child, and had not terminated his parental rights. Therefore, adoption could not proceed. The best interests of the child could not override the requirements of ch. 600A. The juvenile court did not lose jurisdiction to hear the natural mother's motion to vacate her release of custody based on the adoptive parents' filing of a petition for adoption. The termination case was remanded for a consideration of whether the natural mother terminated her custody rights under Iowa Code &sect; 600A.4(2) when her release failed to satisfy the 72-hour requirement.</SPAN></P>

The court found that &sect; 512A.9 prohibited the incorporation of any benevolent associations on or after July 1, 1988 and that the benevolent society was an unauthorized insurer. Because the ex post facto clauses of the federal and Iowa constitutions did not prevent the legislature from imposing a penalty on the continuance of once lawful conduct subsequently declared illegal, the court found no constitutional violation.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The child was removed from her mother's custody six months after she was born.

The juvenile court denied the father's motion and continued custody of the child with the Department. The father argued that the juvenile court erroneously placed the burden of proof on him. Upon review, the court found that the father had the burden of showing there was a change of circumstances that would allow for the child's return by a preponderance of the evidence. The court concluded that the father's due process rights were not violated by this burden because the privacy interest affected was less weighty than in a termination proceeding; placing the burden on him best minimized the risk of an erroneous deprivation because he had better access to the necessary information; and the interests of parties were better served by placing the burden on him.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court vacated the order of the lower court that placed the child in her father's care the supervision of the Department. The court affirmed the juvenile court's order that maintained custody of the child with the Department.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The merger of the predecessor corporation into the first successor corporation and the merger of that successor into the appellant successor corporation occurred while the suit against the predecessor corporation was progressing through the various civil trial stages. On appeal, the court held that because Iowa law granted both the privilege to collect amounts due and, under Iowa Code &sect; 496A.73(4), (5), placed liability on the successor corporation, the merger itself was a sufficient minimum contact warranting the assertion of personal jurisdiction over the successor. Having recognized that personal jurisdiction could be asserted over a successor corporation based upon the conduct and actions of the constituent corporation, the court saw no reason why, on the facts before the court, personal jurisdiction should not be established over a successor corporation resulting from a series of mergers. The court held that prejudgment interest was to be awarded from the date the original suit was filed on the compensatory damage award, and postjudgment interest from the date of the final order in that case.</SPAN></P>

The fundamental rights allegedly implicated by the ordinance were freedom of religion, speech, assembly, and association. All but association were expressly mentioned in the First Amendment. All were within the term &quot;liberty&quot; as protected by the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment against infringement by the states. Emancipated minors were not exempt from the provisions of the ordinance. The ordinance made no exception for 17-year-olds who were eligible to vote at precinct caucuses. The court held that there was too much opportunity for selective enforcement. The ordinance was not drawn narrowly to provide exceptions for emancipated minors and fundamental rights under the First Amendment. For those reasons the court held that the ordinance was unconstitutionally overbroad. In cases in which the overbreadth challenge was not sustained, the ordinance was drawn narrowly to protect First Amendment rights.</SPAN></P>

Defense counsel specifically stated at trial that the materials were not being offered to show similarity to the materials allegedly sold by defendants.

The court found that there was sufficient evidence that other remedies available to the non-profit entity were inadequate and would lead to a multiplicity of suit and that the elements for an injunction existed. Because the protestor's conduct was contrary to valid and neutral laws of general applicability, the court determined that the injunction did not violate her rights of free exercise of religion and freedom of speech.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the order permanently enjoining the protestor from trespassing on the premises occupied by the non-profit entity.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Initially, defendant was charged with possession of a controlled substance. After laboratory tests revealed that the substance was not a controlled substance, the State amended the information to charge him with possession of a simulated controlled substance. A jury convicted defendant. Defendant argued that Iowa Code &sect; 204.401(1)(c) (Supp. 1989) was unconstitutionally vague and that the evidence was insufficient to sustain his conviction. The court observed that to withstand a vagueness challenge, a penal statute had to give a person of ordinary intelligence fair notice of what was prohibited and provide an explicit standard for those who applied it. A reasonably intelligent person would understand the meaning of the phrases &quot;expressly represented&quot; and &quot;impliedly represented&quot; in &sect; 204.401(1)(c). The challenged language provided sufficient notice of the coduct that was prohibited and adequate guidance to those who enforced it. There was ample evidence that defendant possessed a substance and intended to deliver it. The conversation between defendant and the arresting officers made out a case of both an expressed and an implied representation that it was a controlled substance.</SPAN></P>

Both parties sustained bodily injuries and property damages. Defendant was not wearing a seat belt at the time of the accident.

The trial court denied plaintiff's request to declare &sect; 321.445(4)&nbsp;unconstitutional as violative of equal protection, due process, and a plaintiff's right to trial by jury. In affirming, the court held that there was no common law duty to wear a seat belt. Thus, &sect; 321.445(4) did not violate the constitutional right to a jury trial. Moreover, the five percent limitation contained in &sect; 321.445(4) bore a rational relationship to the legitimate governmental interest of reducing the public costs associated with serious injuries and deaths caused by automobile accidents.

The officers also discovered a &quot;cutting agent&quot; in the automobile and certain drug paraphernalia in defendant's bedroom. A narcotics officer also testified as an expert that the large amount of cash and the close proximity of the drugs to the cash, coupled with other drug paraphernalia, indicated the selling of drugs. The trial court ordered the forfeiture of the cash and the automobile, finding that they had been used in the commission of a criminal offense. On appeal, the court held that: (1) the cash was forfeitable because the amount of the cash, its location, and its close proximity to the drugs fit well within the pattern of making change in a drug operation; and (2) the automobile was forfeitable because it was a criminal offense for defendant to possess the controlled substance found in the automobile, and it was apparent that the vehicle was used to facilitate that possession.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant city passed an ordinance requiring vicious dogs to comply with special licensing and confinement requirements. The ordinance attempted to define vicious dog by including certain recognized breed classifications, but it also referred to unrecognized breeds that were allegedly commonly known as pit bulls, pit bull dogs, or pit bull terriers. The owner of a dog affected by the ordinance and two organizations with affected members brought an action requesting a determination that the ordinance was unconstitutionally vague and asking that the city be enjoined from enforcing the ordinance. The district court upheld the constitutionality of the ordinance and denied injunctive relief. The court reversed the judgment that found the provisions of the ordinance referring to &quot;pit bulls, pit bull dogs, or pit bull terriers&quot; was constitutional, holding that the use of unrecognized breed classifications and the classification of dogs based on subjective criteria were fatally vague and had to be severed from the ordinance.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant city was granted review of the judgment of the Iowa Court of Appeals that upheld the trial court's judgment on a general jury verdict awarding damages to plaintiff property owner in an action under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983, which alleged that the city's denial of his application for building permits constituted a taking of property without compensation, as well as a violation of his &quot;property rights and freedom rights.&quot;</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner's shop predated the city's zoning ordinance and it operated as a nonconforming use. When the owner applied for a permit to expand his shop, it was denied, as were as requests for rezoning and variances. The owner sued. Following a trial, where the jury was instructed on both a regulatory takings theory and a violation of substantive due process, the jury returned a verdict for the owner without specifying which theory it was based on. The appellate court affirmed and the city sought further review. In reversing, the supreme court ruled that, even if the owner had shown a violation of due process, which was not barred under &sect; 1983 by the existence of some other postdeprivation state remedy, the verdict could not stand because it could not be determined from the general verdict if that was the theory relied upon by the jury. A verdict on the takings claim could not stand because it was not ripe for adjudication under &sect; 1983, given that the owner had failed to exhaust other available state remedies, including a claim for inverse condemnation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the court of appeals was vacated, the trial court's judgment was reversed, and the case was remanded for further proceedings on the due process claim and for dismissal of the regulatory takings claim for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>

The court found that &sect; 725.11 was not vague or overbroad. The language of the statute was sufficiently clear to give a person of ordinary intelligence fair notice of what was prohibited and provided specific standards for those who enforced it. The court also found that the search warrant was based on probable cause, that being information from an informant. The trial court did not err in not ordering the prosecution to disclose the identity of the informant because the general rule was that the prosecution was not required to divulge the informant's identity. The court found that where the search warrant was executed at a barn open to the public, there was no knock and announce or notice requirement before the warrant could be executed. Finally, the court found that the speedy trial provisions of Iowa R. Crim.

Third party defendants, the alleged negligent driver and another, approached the intersection at a point governed by a yield sign. The alleged negligent driver failed to yield and collided with the mother's car. The issue was whether the county and the city were liable under Iowa Code &sect; 668.10(1) for placing signs that misled. Plaintiffs contended that the alleged negligent driver was not provided with a &quot;yield ahead&quot; sign when he approached the intersection. The court found that the trial court correctly rejected plaintiffs' contentions. Plaintiffs' complaint concerning the sign selection and placement went only to their sufficiency to have warned the motoring public, a matter that &sect; 668.10(1) clearly immunized from tort liability. There was nothing in plaintiffs' complaint to suggest that the motoring public could have been misled.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The corporation, subjected to Iowa income tax, received dividends from subsidiaries in foreign countries. Under Iowa's income tax statutes, those dividends were required to be included in the corporation's net income, even though dividends from domestic subsidiaries were not. The corporation complained that this action violated the commerce clause and denied it equal protection under the United States and Iowa Constitutions. The district court rejected those arguments, and the corporation appealed. The court granted review and affirmed the decision. The corporation alleged that local Iowa businesses were advantaged because taxpayers which received dividends from domestic subsidiaries were benefited in the form of a lower Iowa income tax than if dividends from both foreign and domestic subsidiaries were taxed alike. The corporation was incorrect in comparing Iowa businesses to each other; the question was whether Iowa businesses were benefited at the expense of foreign businesses. Because the Iowa tax did not differentiate between in-state or out-of-state taxpayers, no impermissible discrimination existed and the statute did not violate the commerce clause.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The police officer moved to the city to comply with the residency requirement, then requested an exception to the rule so that she could move to the farm of her fiance, approximately 18 miles from her workplace. The city voted to strictly enforce the 10-mile residency requirement. Appellants filed a petition for declaratory judgment, claiming that the 10-mile residency restriction was unconstitutional and contrary to Iowa statutory law. The district court denied the petition and dismissed the action. Appellants claimed that Iowa Code &sect; 400.17, by allowing reasonable maximum distances, imposed upon the city a requirement that it make a factual determination of what the maximum possible distance could be and then structure the ordinance in conformance with that finding. The court affirmed, finding that the clear meaning of &sect; 400.17 was that the city could establish a maximum distance for residency purposes so long as that distance was reasonable. The burden was on appellants to prove that the 10-mile distance was unreasonable, which they failed to do. Appellants also failed in their constitutional challenge to negate every reasonable basis upon which the ordinance could be sustained.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother gave birth to her child at the age of 16. The mother's parents entered into an agreement with the alleged father on behalf of the mother and the child that, if the alleged father paid $ 5500, the mother's parents would not file a paternity suit against the alleged father. Three day's before the child's eighteenth birthday, the mother brought her action to establish paternity, to compel the alleged father to pay future support and care, and to compensate the mother for the child's past care. The trial court held that, even though Iowa Code &sect; 675.33(1966) had been repealed, the statute was in effect at the time of the child's birth, and that the action was barred by the two-year statute of limitations of &sect; 675.33. The court held that the trial court erred in dismissing the action.

Although the prior process had given inmates three hearings, due process only required two hearing and the ch. 908 procedure that provided an initial hearing for probable cause before a detached magistrate and the later hearing before the parole board provided adequate process. Iowa Const. art. III, &sect; 1 permitted the legislature to authorize the parole board to fill in the details of the legislative policy. Iowa Code &sect; 906.5 provided sufficient procedural and substantive rules that guided the parole board's decisions, which was supported by detailed administrative regulations.

The court determined that the right of first refusal in &sect; 524.910(2) did not apply to the state bank's assignment of the sheriff's certificate because it was not a sale of a vested title in the land.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the repeal of former Iowa Code &sect; 906.5 (1983), under which he was sentenced, and its immediate reenactment as Iowa Code &sect; 902.11 (1989) effectively withdrew the impediment to his eligibility for parole. The court held that defendant's statutory impediment to early parole was not affected by the legislation that moved the provision from former Iowa Code &sect; 906.5 (1983) to Iowa Code &sect; 902.11 (1989) because the simultaneous repeal and reenactment of all or a part of a legislative act left unaffected all rights, interests, and liabilities arising under the earlier provision; there was no interruption in the statute's operation. Defendant also argued that former Iowa Code &sect; 906.5 (1983) was unconstitutional as a violation of separation of powers. The court held that because parole board decisions were subject to judicial review under the administrative procedure act, and defendant's case arose as just such a proceeding, the courts were given review of the sentences originally imposed by the courts. The parole board's implementation of former &sect; 906.5 was merely ministerial. Defendant's due process and equal protection challenges also were rejected.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed, holding that there was no violation of the Free Exercise Clause of either the state or federal constitutions because there was no indication that payment of the tax violated the church's sincere religious beliefs or imposed a constitutionally significant burden on the church's practices. There was no excessive government entanglement into religious affairs, and the church failed to prove that the tax had a chilling effect on the church's right to freedom of the press.

The district court vacated the board's decision. On appeal, the court reversed the district court's decision and reinstated the decision of the board. The court held, inter alia, that: (1) the full mouth extraction of the patient's teeth, without an independent diagnosis of mercury toxicity or other valid diagnostic evidence, was well below the standard of care for dentists in the state of Iowa; (2) one incident of malpractice was sufficient to suspend the dentist's license; (3) the dentist's malpractice was appropriately characterized as &quot;gross malpractice;&quot; (4) the board could have properly considered the effect of the dentist's malpractice on the patient; and (5) all of the indicia of fraud were found by the board and were thoroughly substantiated by the evidence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Iowa Department of Revenue and Finance found the publications in question to be different from newspapers in that they were printed monthly or bimonthly. They were more costly, had a substantially longer useful life than newspapers, and targeted a smaller audience that was interested in a specific subject matter. The court agreed that the Department had substantial evidence to support its finding based on those facts and that the publications were properly classified as &quot;magazines&quot; or &quot;periodicals&quot; and not &quot;newspapers.&quot; The court held the tax structure did not create a special tax that applied only to certain publications protected by the first amendment. The Iowa law did not scrutinize the content, but rather the form and frequency of publication. While the government could not deny a benefit to an organization that decided to exercise its constitutional rights, the government was not required to subsidize those rights. The tax was not aimed at interstate commerce as such. It applied to all taxpayers for services rendered within the state. Since the publisher was not the prevailing party it was not entitled to the award of a reasonable attorneys' fee.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Iowa Department of Revenue issued a notice of assessment against the taxpayer for delinquent fuel taxes. The taxpayer filed a protest of the assessment and also filed an application, pursuant to Iowa Code &sect; 421.8A, that it be permitted to post a bond in an amount as determined by the hearing officer. When the Department objected to the application, the taxpayer claimed that the bond requirement before a formal hearing was an unconstitutional denial of due process. The hearing officer allowed the taxpayer to post a bond in lieu of paying the tax but set it at an amount equal to that claimed by the Department. Upon the taxpayer's petition for judicial review, the district court upheld the hearing officer's bond and rejected the taxpayer's constitutional challenge. On appeal, the court held that: (1) a predeprivation hearing was not constitutionally required because a such a requirement would result in mass chaos and would paralyze the collection of tax revenue; and (2) a postdeprivation hearing was constitutionally required because, under the procedure provided by the tax revenue scheme, the taxpayer, due to its financial plight, could not contest the assessment at any stage.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the district court's decision with respect to a predeprivation hearing, reversed the district court's decision with respect to a postdeprivation hearing, and remanded the cases to the district court for transfer to the Department with directions to proceed with the taxpayer's protest of the assessment as a contested case.</SPAN></P>

The jury found defendant to be a habitual offender under Iowa Code &sect; 902.8.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant alleged that his verdicts of guilty were unconstitutionally ambiguous and that he was incorrectly sentenced. On appeal, the court affirmed defendant's convictions and affirmed the appellate court's decision. Defendant was not entitled to reversal of his convictions for delivery of a controlled substance because the verdicts which convicted him on those counts conclusively showed that his case was submitted to the jury on the &quot;conspiracy&quot; ground alone and that the convictions were supported by ample evidence. Although the jury did not specify which ground of the statute it relied upon in convicting defendant on the charge of possession of a controlled substance with intent to deliver; the jury was not required to have been unanimous as to the mode of commission of the crime as long as it was unanimous as to the commission of the crime. The appellate court correctly determined that the trial court imposed an illegal mandatory minimum prison sentence of three years under Iowa Code &sect; 902.8 rather than the requisite five years under Iowa Code &sect; 204.413. Defendant was properly sentenced as a habitual offender where he had three prior felony convictions.</SPAN></P>

The court determined that a parent's right to custody and control of a child was not absolute.

The state asserted that the statute was presumed to be constitutionally valid and defendant had not established that it failed to give a person of ordinary intelligence fair notice of what was prohibited or failed to establish explicit standards for application. The court reversed and remanded for a new trial because it determined that &sect; 809.1 provided fair notice of what constituted prohibited conduct because the use of facilitate to describe the scope of property subject to forfeiture meant that there had to be a substantial connection between the property and the crime that was the basis for the application of forfeiture. The court also determined that because there was not a requirement that the state apply for forfeiture in each case did not meant that the statute was void because of erratic application.</SPAN></P>

The court held that because the discriminatory practice continued within the limitations period, the claim was timely.

When the trial court found for the borrowers, the bank and the transferee sought review, claiming &sect; 524.910(2) was unconstitutional as a denial of equal protection and due process. In affirming, the court held that even though &sect; 524.910(2) only applied to state banks, the statute did not deny equal protection because: 1) the statute served the legitimate state purpose of regulating real estate disposal and favoring prior owners of land; and 2) the legislature had a rational basis for applying the preemption only to state banks. The court also rejected the contention that &sect; 524.910(2) was unconstitutionally vague under the due process clause because a &quot;reasonable state bank&quot; would have acted according to the statute's terms, notwithstanding any other law generally applicable to foreclosures of agricultural mortgages.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The bank foreclosed its mortgage on January 6, 1986, and the sheriff's sale on March 4, 1986 left a substantial deficiency judgment. I receivership was established on March 10, 1986 and was terminated on March 22, 1987. The mortgagors claimed that the bank lost its right to collect the deficiency judgment by waiting more than two years after the entry of judgment under Iowa Code &sect; 615.1 (1987). The bank claimed that Iowa Code &sect; 654.6 (1987) imposed a collection moratorium until July 1, 1991 and suspended the two-year period of Iowa Code &sect; 615.1 (1987). On appeal, the court found that Iowa Code &sect; 654.6 (1987) applied because the bank's deficiency action was pending on June 1, 1986 while the receivership was in effect. However, &sect; 654.6 was unconstitutional because there was no rational basis to apply the moratorium only to certain lenders, and, thus, the statute violated state and federal equal protection guarantees. In order to protect both debtors and lenders, the court held that lenders were granted two years from July 1, 1990 to enforce their deficiency judgments and that no action to enforce the deficiency judgments could be commenced before July 1, 1990.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>

In order to get its plans and specifications for the project approved by the county, the association agreed to a 55-foot setback from the centerline of the county right-of-way for all pipelines laid on private property. The association violated the setback agreement. The association was thereafter officially notified that it would have to relocate sections of its pipeline to accommodate the county's road improvement project. The association sought a writ of mandamus to compel the county to begin condemnation proceedings, or, in the alternative, to pay money damages. The district court dismissed the action. The association appealed and the court affirmed, holding that the association's failure to abide by the conditions to which it had voluntarily agreed was the reason it was forced to relocate the pipelines and this circumstance precluded it from forcing condemnation or from recovering money damages from the county. There was no basis for invalidating the setback requirement and its presence in the agreement estopped the association from now claiming compensation for a taking of its property.</SPAN></P>

The court agreed with the trial court's ruling that &sect; 85.20 did not deny equal protection under U.S. Const. amend. XIV and Iowa Const. art. I, &sect; 6. Section 85.20 did not infringe a fundamental right. The judicial process was not essential to the exercise of any fundamental right belonging to workers' compensation claimants. The employee failed to meet his burden to prove that the distinction in liability between members of the same class, employer-tortfeasors and co-employee tortfeasors, did not rationally further the purposes underlying the workers' compensation law. Section 85.20 provided the exclusive remedy for the employee. Thus, the trial court did not have jurisdiction to decide the case.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged the trial court's denial of his motion for a directed verdict, claimed that there was insufficient evidence to have supported a conviction for kidnapping, and alleged that &sect; 710.1 violated due process because of vagueness. Defendant, in essence, requested the court's rejection of a &quot;kidnapping by deception&quot; theory. On appeal, the court affirmed and held that the end result was the same regardless of whether the removal of defendant's victim to a remote location before shooting him and stealing his car was accomplished by force or artful deception. The court ruled that &sect; 710.01 did not require confinement or removal to have been substantial or forcible. A deceptive ploy and the resultant transport exceeded the movement reasonably associated with the crime of murder. The harm that &sect; 710.1 was designed to prevent was the removal of a victim from one place to another with attendant risks to the victim. The court concluded that the means by which the removal element was accomplished need not have been articulated with precision to have passed constitutional muster.

The court affirmed in part and reversed in part the district court's order and remanded the matter to the district court.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the parties were divorced, the father was ordered to pay child support for each of his two children. When a substantial delinquency developed, the mother began an action under the Uniform Support of Dependents Law, Iowa Code &sect; 252A. The father's employer was served with a copy of an order by the Child Support Recovery Unit (CSRU) for mandatory income withholding pursuant to Iowa Code &sect; 252D.1(3) (1987). The father filed a motion under &sect; 252D.2 to quash the withholding order. The lower court granted the father's motion on the grounds that an order by the CSRU unconstitutionally invaded the province of the court. The court concluded that: (1) the finding by the CSRU, that the father was at least one month delinquent, was more administrative than judicial; (2) in cases where activities of coordinate branches of government rub shoulder-to-shoulder, as they did in child support cases, the court had to view the concept of separation of powers with a certain amount of pragmatism and cooperation; and (3) &sect; 252D was constitutional under both Iowa Const. art.

The court ruled that defendant's claims failed to resemble those liberty interests that the United States Supreme Court had explicitly recognized to be part of the right of privacy implicit in the Due Process Clause of U.S. Const. amend. XIV. The court was unwilling to add a right of privacy to decide whether to wear a safety belt when there was no textual basis or a clear historical precedent for such a right. The court held that Iowa's seat belt law did not violate any right to privacy arising out of Iowa Const. art. I, &sect; 9, nor were there any fundamental rights implicated in defendant's claim. The court ruled that &sect; 321.445(2) did not violate the Due Process Clauses of the federal or Iowa constitutions by lying beyond the reach of the state's police power, because both public safety and public welfare were served by the seat belt statute, and preventing and reducing injuries was a valid state interest.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the loitering regulation was quite clear. The fact that its language did not specify which inmate or inmates should leave the area if more than two were loitering did not make the prohibition against more than two unconstitutionally vague. The challenge to the verbal abuse regulation similarly failed. The inmate's comment violated the regulation, which encompassed insolence or disrespect to another person.

The court held that the underlying action was a civil forfeiture suit, and the owners failed to meet the threshold requirement of being a claimant pursuant to Iowa Code &sect; 809.9. The court held that the owners' claim failed because they failed to claim an ownership or possessory interest in the property seized. The court held that it was not sufficient to have claimed merely an interest in the premises or area in which the contraband was found. The court rejected the owners' argument that requiring them to claim an interest in the property and forcing them to choose between their privilege and their lawsuit made assertion of the privilege &quot;costly.&quot;</SPAN></P>

The litigants were agents for the insurer operating in another state. The court affirmed the trial court's rejection of the litigants' jurisdictional challenge. The court held that Iowa Code &sect; 506C.4, under which the action was brought, was constitutional on its face because the provision incorporated the requirements of necessary minimum contacts embodied in Iowa R. Civ. P. 56.2.  Iowa Code &sect; 506C.4 thus adopted the minimum contacts requirement for jurisdiction. Section 506C.4 was constitutional as applied because minimum contacts existed. Though contact was contractual and by telephone, the relationship was capable of providing the future consequences and actual course of dealing that formed the basis of jurisdiction. Sufficient contacts existed between the litigants and the insurer's Iowa office to allow personal jurisdiction consistent with due process.</SPAN></P>

The court ruled that, although the residents were younger and more aggressive than in previous years, the facility continued to provide care for disabled persons. The court ruled that the present use was not substantially different from the original use and the effect on the surrounding area was not different than the prior use. The court found no evidence of a material change in the structure itself, nor any substantial adverse impact on the neighborhood or reports of acts of violence by the residents. The court concluded that the fact that the nature of the residents' disabilities had changed from impaired mental functions due to the aging process to those caused by mental illness was not enough to constitute a use different in kind in its effect on the surrounding area.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The seller was a farmer who contracted with defendant purchaser to produce and deliver popcorn.

The seller remained unpaid and brought an action in replevin. On appeal from the trial court's grant of summary judgment in favor of the bank, the court held that the seller was not entitled to possession of the popcorn because, pursuant to Iowa Code &sect; 554.2401 (1987), title to the popcorn passed on delivery, in spite of nonpayment, and became a part of the security for the purchaser's debt to the bank; thus, with the passing of title, the seller's interest in the popcorn was unperfected and inferior to that of the bank. The court further held that &sect; 554.2401 did not unconstitutionally deny the seller equal protection of the laws because &sect; 554.2401 and other Uniform Commercial Code provisions constituted eminently reasonable legislative regulations of commercial transactions.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The debtor filed for bankruptcy and the creditor foreclosed on the debtor's farmland because of the debtor's default. The debtor filed subsequent bankruptcy petitions to invoke the automatic stay and delay the sale of his property. The district court ruled that the debtor was entitled to redeem only the homestead portion of the farmland because of Iowa Code &sect; 628.4 (1987). The debtor contended that &sect; 628.4&nbsp;unconstitutionally extinguished his right of redemption. The creditor argued that &sect; 628.4 also applied to the homestead. The court affirmed the order as to the farmland, but reversed and remanded the order as to the homestead. The court noted that under &sect; 628.4, a party who stays execution on a judgment is not entitled to redeem. The court concluded that this statute intentionally balanced the interests of the debtor and the creditor and was not violative of the debtor's due process or equal protection rights. The court also found no violation of the Supremacy Clause, because the statute did not conflict with the bankruptcy provisions. The court determined, however, that &sect; 628.4 also applied to the homestead for which the debtor had obtained a stay of judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the order, which held that the debtor did not have a right to redeem the farmland foreclosed on by the creditor, but reverse and remanded that portion of the order, which held that the debtor's right to redeem the homestead was not extinguished by the bankruptcy stay.</SPAN></P>

The Iowa District Court for Polk County dismissed the case upon appellees' motion. The candidate appealed, and the Secretary of State moved to dismiss his appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The candidate alleged that the caucus procedures violated various state and federal statutory and constitutional provisions. The court held that the issues raised were moot because the nominating process was over. It noted that the candidate had not challenged the caucus system generally but only as it was being conducted in 1988 specifically. The court stated that the issues the candidate raised were truly academic because nothing it could do would affect the 1988 caucuses. As to the &quot;public interest&quot; exception to the mootness doctrine, the court stated that the questions the candidate presented to it were private, rather than public, in nature and, as such, public officials had no need for the court's guidance. Further, the court stated, the likelihood of the recurrence of the issues was purely speculative. The court noted that a cursory examination of the candidate's substantive arguments indicated that they were without merit.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The cable company owned property that fell into three categories retained for taxation under ch. 427A. The cable company claimed that the statute was unconstitutional, based on Iowa Const. art. I, &sect; 6; Iowa Const.&nbsp;art. III, &sect; 30; and U.S. Const. amend. XIV. The challenge to the classification scheme was based solely on the statute's impact in Marion County, Iowa. On review, the court concluded that the cable company did not sustain its heavy burden to show that the statute was facially unconstitutional. The court noted that the statute applied statewide, yet the cable company addressed only its application to one county. The county in issue was mostly rural, yet the cable company also operated in other counties. The court concluded there was no indication of disparate treatment in larger or more commercial counties under the statute, and there was no demonstration that it was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

A note was written below the judge's signature on the judgment regarding where to pay fines and costs. Defendant challenged the judgment entered against him. The court modified the judgment by striking the interest provision and affirmed the judgment as modified. The court determined that the district court did not have authority to impose interest on the restitution amount because interest was not expressly included as a component of restitution pursuant to Iowa Code &sect; 910.2 (1987). The court concluded that any change in the availability of interest on a restitution amount was the legislature's responsibility. The court found that the note at the end of the judgment was intended to be purely informational.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The vehicle's driver maintained that she was forced off the road by an unidentified driver and vehicle. The injured passenger commenced a cause of action against the insurer under the policy's uninsured motorist clause. The court found that the determinant issue was whether an unknown vehicle with an unidentified driver which forced the insured vehicle off of a highway, without contact between the vehicles, was an uninsured motorist under the terms of the policy. In ruling on a motion for summary judgment, the trial court had held that contact between the vehicles was a prerequisite to coverage under the policy definition of an uninsured motorist. The court affirmed that judgment. The injured passenger maintained that the policy could be interpreted under the doctrine of reasonable expectations to permit coverage. The court disagreed, finding that under the policy's specific provision requiring the phantom car to strike the insured vehicle, the injured passenger could not recover under the policy. Finally, the court held that the uninsured motorist statute,&nbsp;Iowa Code &sect; 516A.1, was not unconstitutional as violative of equal protection.</SPAN></P>

She filed an action for damages against the facility when she turned 18 and the trial court dismissed the action as filed beyond the applicable two-year statute of limitations under the Iowa Tort Claims Act (Act). On review, the patient argued that the tolling provisions of Iowa Code &sect; 614.8 (1987) applied to toll the statute during her minority, and that she was denied due process of law because minors injured by private individuals get the benefit of the tolling statute, while those injured by state do not. The court disagreed and affirmed, holding that the tolling provision did not apply and that the absence of a tolling provision was not unreasonable. The court found that without a specific tolling provision for claims against the state, none could be implied based on statutory interpretation. The court also determined, using the rational basis test to test the constitutionality of the Act, that the state had a right to limit the actions that could be brought by individuals because state immunity was the general law, unless and until the immunity was modified by the legislature.</SPAN></P>
