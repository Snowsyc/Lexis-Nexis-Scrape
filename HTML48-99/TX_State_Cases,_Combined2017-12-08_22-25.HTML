</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged his conviction by a jury for theft of property of the value of $ 200.00 or more but less than $ 10,000.00 from a trial court (Texas). Appellant raised three points of error and in one asserted that the first statement he made, which was to a police intern, was illegally obtained and improperly admitted into evidence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of theft of property of the value of $ 200 or more but less than $ 10,000 by a jury. Appellant had been apprehended after a chase by a police intern who had appellant on the ground, pointing his finger in the back of appellant's head and telling appellant not to move or he would kill him. He asked appellant why he was running and appellant stated that the car was stolen. An officer arrived and after giving appellant his Miranda rights, appellant made more incriminating statements. The court reversed the trial court's judgment and held that it could not be seriously contended that the state proved appellant's response, made while he was led to believe a gun was being held to his head, was voluntarily made, and that the trial court erred in admitting the statements. The court held that a statement could be involuntary and thus inadmissible even if made to a non peace officer interrogator, and that the state had the burden of showing that the statement was freely and voluntarily made if it sought to use the statement against appellant. Due to the likelihood of retrial, the court briefly addressed appellant's remaining issues, which were all overruled.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment and remanded the cause to the trial court and held that the trial court erred in allowing appellant's statements before the jury and indicated that the state could not seriously contend that appellant's statement made to the police intern, while he was led to believe a gun was being held to his head, was freely and voluntarily made.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged the judgment from the 126th Judicial District Court of Travis County (Texas) convicting him of murdering his mother. Appellant alleged, on statutory and constitutional grounds, that the trial court erred in several of its rulings related to his defense of insanity pursuant to Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. arts. 46.02, 46.03, particularly the admission of expert psychological testimony from four witnesses of appellee state.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After being convicted of murdering his mother, appellant sought review on grounds related to his defense of insanity under Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. arts. 46.02, 46.03. The court affirmed the conviction and held that the admission of testimony of psychological expert witnesses called by the state to testify in rebuttal of similar testimony was not error. The court concluded that the testimony did not violate appellant's U.S. Const. amend. V rights because he waived his privilege against self-incrimination by attempting to prove his insanity through expert psychological testimony. Article 46.03, &sect; 3(a), authorized court-appointed psychological experts to testify as to appellant's sanity at any trial or hearing on the issue. Therefore, the Fifth Amendment was not implicated when the court-appointed psychiatrist inquired, in a competency interview, about appellant's mental state at the time of the murder, even in the absence of an order which directed the psychiatrist to make a sanity examination. U.S. Const. amend. VI did not entitle appellant to have his counsel present at examinations by court-appointed experts to determine competency and mental state.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment convicting appellant of murder and held that appellant, by pleading and attempting to prove his insanity through expert testimony of psychological witnesses, waived his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination. Moreover, the Sixth Amendment did not require the presence of counsel at any of the psychological examinations.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that defendant's right to a speedy trial pursuant to Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art 17.151 (1982) was not violated because his trial was conducted within 120 days of the commencement of the criminal action of intentionally and knowingly possessing a short-barreled firearm. The court found that the trial court's refusal to reduce bail did not operate as a denial of his right to a speedy trial. The court also held that defendant's weapon met the statutory definition of a short-barreled rifle and noted that the jury was allowed to view the weapon. Finally, the court held that Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 46.06 was not unconstitutional because it failed to define the term &quot;rifle.&quot; The court held that a statute which forbids the doing of an act must be so vague that men of common intelligence must guess as to its meaning and the court found that the term &quot;rifle&quot; was not void due to vagueness.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court and upheld defendant's conviction of intentionally and knowingly possessing a short-barreled firearm because his rights to a speedy trial were not violated by failure to be released on bail, the weapon met the statutory definition of the crime charged, and the statute was not unconstitutional due to vagueness for not defining the term &quot;rifle.&quot;</SPAN></P>

Penal Code Ann. &sect; 38.07 (1974), after he escaped from custody following two previous convictions of felony offenses. On appeal, the court affirmed appellant's convictions. The court held that the offense of escape as was described in Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 38.07 (1974), was not void for vagueness or indefiniteness because it furnished an adequate warning to anyone of ordinary intelligence of precisely what kind of conduct it condemned, and the statute was sufficiently restrictive to prevent arbitrary or erratic convictions. The records of appellant's previous convictions were introduced into evidence without objection. A state witness identified appellant as the person who was the offender in those records, and the defense did not controvert or rebut that evidence. The court found that the evidence was sufficient to support the necessary implied findings required by the penal code for fixing appellant's punishment at life imprisonment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">By interlocutory appeal, appellants challenged the order of the 55th District Court, Harris County (Texas) appointing a receiver for the assets of appellant corporation, in appellee's derivative action on behalf of appellant corporation to prevent appellant individual from engaging in corporate transactions. Appellant alleged the unconstitutionality of Tex. Bus. Corp. Act Ann. art. 7.05 (Supp. 1980) and the trial court's equity jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee asserted a derivative action against appellant corporation and asked for a temporary restraining order and temporary injunction to restrain appellant individual from making financial transactions on behalf of appellant corporation. Both provisional remedies were granted. The trial court went forward as to receivership. A receiver was appointed under Tex. Bus. Corp. Act Ann. art. 7.05 (Supp. 1980) to determine whether the corporate assets should be liquidated under Tex. Bus. Corp. Act Ann. art. 7.06 (Supp. 1980). Appellants based their appellate arguments on the unconstitutionality of the appointment statute, lack of due process, and a trial court violation of its equity jurisdiction. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment. It found no unconstitutionality on the face of, or in the application of, Tex. Bus. Corp. Act Ann. art. 7.05 (Supp. 1980). It found no unconstitutionality in the exercise of the trial court's equity jurisdiction in appointing a receiver to conserve the assets of the corporation, to avoid damage to the parties at interest, and to determine whether or not the corporation should make application for a receiver to liquidate its assets.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's order, holding that the appointment statute was not unconstitutional, did not violate due process, and was not an unconstitutional exercise of the trial court's equity jurisdiction to appoint a receiver. The trial court, acting in equity, had the inherent power to appoint a receiver independently of statutory authority.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged his conviction for theft from the person by the 268th District Court, Fort Bend County (Texas), asserting errors in the excusal of juror, problems with jury instructions, a speedy trial violation, deficiencies in the indictment, insufficient evidence, and that Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 31.03(d)(4)(B) (Supp. 1982), which makes theft a third degree felony, was unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of his conviction for theft from the person. The court affirmed his conviction, overruling his nine grounds of error. Appellant could not complain about the exclusion of a juror for cause because he failed to show injury. The jury instructions were proper because they correctly defined the element of fear, they did not authorize the jury to find appellant guilty of an offense not alleged in the indictment, and they properly referred to theft as a lesser included offense of robbery. Appellant was not denied a speedy trial because the state announced ready for trial in advance of 120 days following his arrest. The indictment, which used the term &quot;appropriate&quot; instead of the statutory language &quot;obtain or maintain control,&quot; was not deficient because the terms were substantially similar. The evidence was sufficient because complainant's misidentification of appellant was overcome by the testimony of the arresting officers, and there was no requirement of an actual touching. Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 31.03 (d)(4)(B) (Supp. 1982), making theft a third degree felony, was not unconstitutionally vague because it gave adequate warning of the conduct it criminalized.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed appellant's conviction for theft from a person because the trial court did not abuse its discretion in excusing a juror, the jury instructions were proper, the indictment was not deficient, there was no speedy trial violation, the evidence was sufficient to support the conviction, and the statute making theft a third degree felony was not unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Officers seized films from appellant's place of business. At trial the parties stipulated that the films would be found obscene by a jury under current community standards. The trial court convicted appellant of the commercialization of obscene films in violation of Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 43.23. Appellant contended that the trial court erred in finding him guilty, as the term &quot;patently offensive&quot; within the meaning of &sect; 43.23(a)(4) was unconstitutional as overly broad. The court held that an instruction limiting the community standard to tolerance was sufficient to save the statute, however because appellant's cause was tried before the trial court without jury and because no findings of fact or conclusions of law were made by the trial court, it was presumed that application of the statute was not unconstitutional. The court held that &sect; 43.23(e) and (f) provided an evidentiary presumption as to culpability and that there was no error in the presumption that appellant had knowledge of the contents of the films.

Penal Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 43.21(a)(4) and (a)(5) and 43.23(e) and (f) were unconstitutional. The court affirmed the judgment for the following reasons. The term &quot;patently offensive&quot; in &sect; 43.21(a)(4) was not void for vagueness, as it allowed a jury to consider what was tolerated by the average person as one factor in determining the community standard of decency. &sect; 43.23(e) and (f) did not violate U.S. Const. amend. XIV, as the sections did not eliminate the necessity of proving scienter because there was a presumption that appellant had knowledge of the content of the material. The court did not consider the constitutionality of the statutory definition of &quot;promotes,&quot; in &sect; 43.21(a)(5), when read in conjunction with the definition of obscene material and obscene devices, as no possible exception to &quot;promotion&quot; existed in the case.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, she raised 26 grounds for reversal, with the primary claim being that the statute was unconstitutional both facially and as applied due to its presumptions of law. The court, in agreement, reversed the conviction, finding that certain statutory presumptions violated U.S. Const. amend. I, V, IV. The presumption created by Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 43.23(e) included an impermissible conclusion that one who promotes obscene materials or devices does so with knowledge of their content or character. In criminal law, a presumption was required to be rebuttable, or there was a denial of due process. Conclusive presumptions, such as that here in issue, which assumed that certain actions were intentional, conflicted with the assumption of innocence until proven guilty. Thus, the court ordered charges against appellant to be dismissed.</SPAN></P>

He claimed his conviction exceeded legislative authority, as the county lacked authority to impose a permit requirement on all sexually oriented commercial enterprises regardless of the geographical location. He claimed his due process rights were violated because the definition of &quot;sexually oriented commercial enterprise&quot; was unconstitutionally vague, and county regulations did not sufficiently define the specific conduct or action constituting violations of law. On appeal, the court disagreed with these arguments and affirmed the conviction. Proof that appellant knew that a county permit was required was not necessary. The state met its burden of proving that the appellant intentionally and knowingly operated a sexually oriented commercial enterprise without a permit. Tex. Rev. Stat. Ann. art. 2372w provided the county the necessary authority to adopt regulations restricting sexually oriented commercial operations.</SPAN></P>

Penal Code Ann. &sect; 43.21. His punishment was assessed at three days in jail and a fine. Appellant challenged his conviction. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded the cause for a new trial. Because the name of the film described one particular form of sodomy, the criminal information adequately informed appellant of the allegedly obscene acts depicted in the film. Also, the lack of a statutory definition for the term &quot;prurient interest in sex&quot; did not render &sect; 43.21 constitutionally deficient because that term had been interpreted by the courts and legislature. The court, however, held that Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 43.21(a)(4) was unconstitutional because it permitted the allegedly obscene material to be judged on community standards of decency. The court severed the unconstitutional portion and sustained the validity of the remainder of &sect; 43.21. The court was forced to remand the cause for a new trial based on its assumption that the trial court, sitting as the trier of fact, judged the depicted conduct on the basis of community standards of decency rather than of tolerance.</SPAN></P>

The order required appellant to pay monthly child support, birth expenses, and medical expenses maternal grandparents paid on behalf of appellee mother, also a minor. The trial court also ordered appellant to pay attorney's fees. Appellant contended that appellee's parents should have filed the Tex. Fam.

The court affirmed paternity, but reversed the orders for support and for payment of the expenses. The court held that it would have been error for the trial court to join the grandparents as parties to the support action because the statutory provisions of &sect; 13.01 did not provide third parties, such as the grandparents, with standing to sue for and recover child support.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, the Public Utility Commission, issued an order that set rates for water service supplied by appellee water company to customers in four counties. Appellee filed an administrative appeal claiming that appellant ignored the command of Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 1446c, &sect; 87A when it determined the company's rate base. Appellant's view was that &sect; 87A was unconstitutional and, as a result, it was free to disregard that section. After a hearing, the district court held that &sect; 87A was constitutional and rendered judgment setting aside appellant's order. The case was remanded to appellant for further proceedings. On appeal, appellant again argued that &sect; 87A created a closed class and was unconstitutional. After consideration, this court concluded that the closed class test was an over simplified and inaccurate way to analyze whether the statute was a local or special law. Section 87A was sufficiently reasonable in relation to the purpose of the act and was not a local or special law that violated the Texas Constitution.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Relator ex husband and his spouse were divorced on October 30, 1979, and an order partitioning property, including U.S. Navy military retirement, was entered awarding both parties a portion of the retirement fund. Relator was constituted a trustee for the benefit of his ex-spouse in all sums received by him for her benefit. Relator failed to pay his ex wife her portion of said retirement benefits and was detained for contempt of court. Relator contended that a federal decision regarding pensions did away with his obligation to pay his ex wife under the decree. The court determined that the decision was not appropriate for retroactive application. The court stated that family law matters needed to final at some point and that the retrospective application of new law was detrimental to all parties involved. The court sought to prevent uncertainty and confusion that could undermine the conclusive character of judgments. The court found that there were strong policy considerations for the preservation of stability in family law matters. Accordingly, the court remanded relator to custody of the sheriff.</SPAN></P>

The court determined that retrospective application of case law to relator's divorce decree would have disturbed the finality of the judgment.</SPAN></P>

Appellant claimed that the informations were defective because her acts or conduct were not within the definition of delinquency found in art. 2338-1a, and the statute was unconstitutionally vague, indefinite, and uncertain. The court affirmed the convictions. The court held that the informations alleged the offenses in plain and intelligible language sufficient to have enabled appellant to prepare her defense, and they specifically described the conduct that was charged. The court reviewed art. 2338-1a and noted that it proscribed any act that tended to debase or injure the morals, health, or welfare of a minor. The court concluded that the statutory language was sufficiently plain to inform persons of reasonable intelligence of acts that tended to debase or injure the morals or welfare of a minor.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his conviction for a violation of Tex. Alco. Bev. Code &sect; 104.01(6) on grounds that &sect; 104.01(6) was unconstitutionally vague. The court found that under &sect; 104.01(6), a licensed beer purveyor and his employees were prohibited from permitting either lewd or vulgar conduct on the licensed premises. &quot;Public lewdness&quot; was defined under Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 21.07 as an act of sexual contact in a public place. &quot;Sexual contact&quot; was defined under Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 21.01 as any touching of the anus, breast, or any part of the genitals of another person with intent to arouse or gratify the sexual desire of either person. While these statutes sufficiently apprised defendant of the lewd conduct proscribed, the term &quot;vulgar&quot; was not defined and was broader in meaning than &quot;lewd.&quot; Accordingly, the court found that the statute was unconstitutionally vague insofar as it permitted defendant to be convicted of a vulgar act. The court rejected defendant's claim that his requested charge on circumstantial evidence was error where there was direct evidence that defendant witnessed a customer place his hands on an employee's breasts. The judgment was reversed and remanded.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed on the issue of punishment, however, and remanded for a new penalty phase, because the state was precluded from further efforts to utilize appellant's prior conviction charged in the first enhancement count to increase the range of punishment. The court held that an announcement of ready by the state to an original indictment carried forward to a subsequent indictment, which did not change the offense, but only affected the punishment in the case.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed, holding that Tex.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury convicted appellant of promoting obscene material. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded for a new trial holding that the trial court's charge may have erroneously led the jury to believe that it could convict appellant if it found he sold the magazine, even if it did not find the magazine to be obscene. Since appellant timely objected to the trial court's failure to define &quot;prurient interest in sex&quot; for the jury and provided the trial court with an essentially correct instruction, the refusal to so charge the jury was error. The court held that obscenity required proof that the material appealed to a &quot;prurient interest in sex,&quot; and the definition of &quot;prurient&quot; was a matter directly in issue. Thus, the failure of the trial court to properly define the term &quot;prurient interest in sex&quot; was calculated to injure the appellant's rights and denied him a fair and impartial trial. The court also held that the jury instruction on the definition of &quot;patently offensive&quot; violated U.S. Const. amend I because it employed a standard of community decency rather than community tolerance.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged his jury conviction for murdering a deputy sheriff with a shotgun blast to the head at close range in violation of Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 19.02 (1974). Defendant also challenged the trial court's denial of his motion for new trial. A man carrying a long shiny object, recognized by two eyewitnesses as defendant, approached the deputy as he sat in a camper in a rough neighborhood of town. The deputy's body was found in the driver's seat. Defendant's alibi was that he was in California at the time of the crime. On appeal, the court held that the state presented sufficient circumstantial evidence to convict. The eyewitnesses positively identified defendant as the man who approached the deputy's truck, although they did not actually see him pull the trigger. Defendant's alibi was less than airtight. Although defendant produced some evidence showing he boarded a bus to California four days before the murder and stayed at various motels with his girlfriend, the state produced evidence that impeached that alibi. A new trial was not warranted based on a post-trial sworn statement by defendant's fellow prison inmate. The court affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the jury verdict convicting defendant of murdering a sheriff's deputy because circumstantial evidence was sufficient to place defendant at the scene of the crime with an object resembling a shotgun, even though eyewitnesses did not actually see defendant pull the trigger. A new trial was not justified because newly-discovered evidence, i.e., a prison inmate's exculpatory sworn statement, did not cast doubt on the conviction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court dismissed for want of jurisdiction appellant bank's constitutional and statutory claims against appellees, the state banking commissioner et al. Appellant challenged the dismissal. The court held that the right of judicial review of administrative agency actions could be given by statute, but if vested property rights were invaded by such actions, the right existed independent of the statute. Thus the court found that the trial court had jurisdiction over appellant's constitutional due process claim independent of the statute. The statute specifically provided, however, that the trial court of another county where appellant was domiciled had exclusive jurisdiction over appellant's statutory claim. Accordingly, the court reversed the dismissal of appellant's constitutional claim and remanded it to the trial court but otherwise affirmed the judgment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, mother, father, and child challenged the trial court's determination that their claims for negligence on the part of appellees, doctor and medical center, which alleged that appellees failed to properly diagnose appellant mother as a carrier of Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy was barred by the statute of limitations. Appellants also claimed that summary judgment was improper as the pleadings stated a valid cause of action for wrongful life. The court affirmed the judgment. The court held that the statute of limitations began to run when the negligence occurred not upon discovery. The court stated that any re-examination of the occurrence rule for limitations in medical malpractice cases was for the state supreme court. The court held that summary judgment was properly awarded on the wrongful life claim, as claims for wrongful life were not recognized in Texas.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of burglary of a building. He appealed, contending that Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 30.02, the statute he was convicted under, was unconstitutional, because the subsection that escalated the offense to a first degree offense was unconstitutionally vague. The court held that the clear import of the subsection that elevated the offense of the actor injured anyone during the commission of a burglary, was to deter physical injury to people and therefore, was constitutional. Defendant also argued that the indictment under which he was prosecuted was fundamentally defective, because the state was required to plead and prove culpable mental state, not only in commission of the burglary, but also in commission of the injury to the victim. Affirming the conviction, the court held that culpability was required in the allegation of the primary offense, but was not necessary with reference to the aggravating circumstance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment convicting defendant for burglary was affirmed, because no additional culpability needed to be alleged for the same offense to be elevated from a second degree to a first degree felony, due to the occurrence of an aggravating factor contained in the statute.</SPAN></P>

The record showed appellant gave her child to appellees after appellees told her they would take him only if the arrangement were permanent. Appellant had no contact with the child for almost three years and she signed an affidavit of relinquishment. While the instrument was defective and thus could not serve as the proof necessary for termination, it was evidence of appellant's intent not to return.

The trial court declared the ordinance void insofar as it affected appellee's properties, holding appellant's action was arbitrary and capricious.

The court held that there was nothing in the record concerning the effect of the paving assessment lien on appellee's properties, nor was there evidence of any other injury to such properties resulting from the enactment of the assessment ordinance. The court held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying appellee's attorney's fees and denied appellee's cross-points. The judgment appealed from was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

The court held that &sect; 43.23 (c)(1) was designed to regulate the criminal activity of promoting obscene material or devices and did not regulate the same criminal activity as Tex.

The court held that because &sect; 43.23 (c)(1) and &sect; 43.22 were different statutes regulating two different criminal activity, the state could not have properly brought a charge against defendant under &sect; 43.22.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of one of two judgments from the 209th District Court, Harris County (Texas), which convicted him of two offenses of murder following jury verdicts. Defendant claimed with respect to one of the sentences that his right to due process had been violated because he had been denied a speedy appellate review of his conviction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a conviction for murder, contending that his due process rights had been violated because he had been denied a speedy appellate review of his conviction. On appeal, the court found that the constitutional guarantee of a speedy trial did not apply to appellate review. Nor did the record show a denial of due process. Although defendant employed an attorney who did nothing on defendant's behalf, the attorney was an agent of defendant. The court noted that the court was not in any position to know if defendant was being adequately represented unless defendant complained to the trial court. Moreover, defendant also did nothing for more than a year after his case had been affirmed on appeal without a record or brief. After the neglect of the attorney was called to the trial court's attention, defendant was permitted an out-of-time appeal. Although it took 2 years to reconstruct a missing part of the trial record, that was not the fault of the criminal justice system. Thus, the court found no factual basis for defendant's claim. The court also found the charge to the jury on the meaning of &quot;intentional&quot; to be proper. The court affirmed the judgment.</SPAN></P>

The statute was not unconstitutional simply because the term &quot;impersonate&quot; was not specifically defined.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After leaving appellant wife in Mexico, appellee husband filed for divorce in Parmer County.

The court reversed the trial court's judgment. The court held that the evidence was factually insufficient to show that appellant used due diligence to locate the whereabouts of appellant. The court also held that citation by publication did not pass constitutional muster because publishing notice in a Parmer County newspaper was not reasonably calculated to apprise appellant who lived in Mexico of the action and afford her an opportunity to present objections to it, particularly when appellee knew where to find appellant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee buyer bought items from appellant retail installment seller on credit under three contracts.

The court held that appellee was a &quot;retail buyer.&quot; All contracts were made in the name of appellee, he was a signatory to the first contract, and appellant joined appellee as a party in the underlying suit and treated him as a retail buyer throughout. The filing of plaintiff's original petition constituted a &quot;charging,&quot; and amending it so as to rebate the unearned time-price differential did not nullify the violation. Appellant was charged more than double the amount of allowable interest, time-price differential and other authorized charges when it claimed the unearned time-price differential. Tex. Rev. Civ.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant landowner sought review of a judgment of the 33rd Judicial District Court, Llano County (Texas), which affirmed and incorporated into the judgment a final determination made by appellee, the Texas Water Rights Commission. Appellant argued that appellee's determination effected an unconstitutional taking of his riparian rights, in violation of Tex. Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 16 and 17.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant landowner challenged the final determination of appellee, the Texas Water Rights Commission insofar as it affected his riparian rights. The trial court held that appellant's rights to reasonable use of the water adjacent to his property were not unconstitutionally taken by appellee's determination. On appeal, the court held that the restrictions placed on appellant's exercise of his vested riparian rights were not justified by either the Conservation Amendment, Tex. Const. art. XVI &sect; 59, or as a legitimate exercise of the state's police power. However, because lands patented after July 1, 1895 did not include the grant of riparian rights, appellee was justified in declaring that appellant had no such rights as to those tracts of land. The court also found nothing unconstitutional in the provisions of the Water Code as to the scope of review, or as applied to appellant's claims. Therefore, the court affirmed the judgment as to appellant's land acquired after July 1, 1895, and reversed as to appellant's land acquired before that date.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury convicted appellant of rape of a child, Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 21.09(1982).

The trial court ordered that appellant serve not less than 2 nor more than 12 years prison, and to pay a $ 5,000 fine plus costs. Appellant sought review, challenging his sentence. The court affirmed. The court held that the trial court did not err in sentencing appellant, because appellant would have been able to serve the 12-year sentence with enough additional time to discharge his fine and costs in less then the 20 year maximum term of imprisonment allowed for the offense, Tex.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, landowners, sought review of a decision of the District Court of Williamson County, 26th Judicial District (Texas), which granted summary judgment in favor of appellees, city and officials, in appellants' suit to have declared invalid and unconstitutional two of appellee city's zoning ordinances.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee city annexed land belonging to appellants, landowners. Under appellee city's original zoning ordinance, the land automatically received a temporary classification as a residential district. Appellants applied for a permanent general business district classification, but the city council voted to give the tracts a permanent residential classification through its enactment of two ordinances. Appellants brought suit against appellees, city and officials, to have the ordinances declared invalid. The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of appellees, and appellants sought review. The court dismissed the appeal as moot. The court held that by repeal of the old comprehensive ordinance and adoption of a new one, the challenged ordinances had been repealed, and appellants' land had, in effect, been zoned again. The court noted that the situation was not capable of repetition yet evading review, because the new ordinance was designed to apply far into the future and appellants still had the right to contest the permanent zoning of their properties.</SPAN></P>

The court held that spelling mistakes did not render invalid an otherwise proper indictment, as long as the sense was not affected and the meaning could not be mistaken. The court held that appellant was not improperly arraigned and that he did not properly preserve his grounds that a pistol and hubcaps found in his vehicle when he was arrested were improperly as admitted extraneous offenses. The court held that appellant had been lawfully stopped for speeding and that the hubcaps were in plain view in the backseat. The court found no error in the prosecutor's argument to the jury because it was based on a reasonable deduction of evidence presented in appellant's defense, and was based on common knowledge.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellantwas convicted by a jury of aggravated robbery, and sentenced to 75 years of imprisonment. Appellant challenged his conviction and the court affirmed. The court held that the trial court judge was a competent witness under Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 38.13, and his testimony was valid because he testified only to facts within his certain knowledge and he offered no opinions. The court also held that the failure of the clerk to administer the oath to the trial court judge was harmless error, and appellant did not object and therefore any error was waived. The court determined that the trial court properly refused to instruct the jury not to be influenced by any opinion of the trial court, because the requested instruction would have been improper because the trial court judge had already testified. The court further held that the keys, which were found at the scene of the robbery and were later determined to belong to appellant, were relevant and the chain of custody had been established. Finally, the court held that the photograph of the victim's injuries showed the seriousness of the wound inflicted by appellant and was admissible.</SPAN></P>

The pharmacist, suspicious of the prescription because of its form, refused to fill it. Appellant then left the premises, taking the form with him.

From these photographs, the pharmacist identified appellant as the person who had presented to him the prescription. Appellant was arrested and later convicted of attempting to obtain possession of a controlled substance by misrepresentation, deception and subterfuge in violation of the Controlled Substances Act, Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 4476-15, &sect; 4.09(a)(3) (1982). On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's decision.

</DIV>

Appellant biological father filed a petition to legitimate his parental rights.

The trial court also denied appellant's petition to legitimate his parental status and foreclosed all of his rights to the baby. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's decision, holding that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by denying appellant's petition for voluntary legitimation. The court, applying Tex. Fam. Code Ann. &sect; 13.21(1981), held that it was in the best interest of the child to deny appellant's petition. Moreover, the court held that &sect; 13.21 was not unconstitutional and that it did not violate the equal protection clause or the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, U.S. Const. amend.

Because sufficient probable cause existed to arrest appellant for public intoxication, and because the wallet and the methamphetamine contained therein were seized incident to a lawful arrest, the methamphetamine was properly admitted into evidence before the jury. The court found that Tex. Penal Code &sect; 42.08 (1974) was not vague because it gave a person of ordinary intelligence fair notice that his contemplated conduct was forbidden by the statute. The court found that appellant failed to preserve for review error in allowing evidence of a prior judgment because the objection made in the trial court was not the same as that urged on appeal and appellant later testified about the same offenses without objection.

The court found that the ordinances were not constitutionally defective and held that the ordinances were validated. The court found that the doctrine of laches applied. It was uncontested that the ordinances challenged by plaintiffs were originally passed in 1969, yet the action was not filed until 1980 and that the intervenors had changed their positions in reliance on the rezoning both by purchasing the subject property as commercial property and by expending money to develop said property. No evidence was offered to justify the delay in the bringing of the suit.

Subsequent to granting probation, appellant was arrested for theft. After a hearing on the state's motion to adjudicate guilt, the trial court found appellant had violated the terms and conditions of probation and sentenced him to 10 years confinement. Appellant argued that the trial court abused its discretion in revoking probation and adjudicating guilt because the evidence was insufficient to show the offense of theft. The court affirmed, holding that Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 42.12, &sect;3d made it clear that a court's decision to proceed with the adjudication of guilt was not appealable as the trial court's decision to proceed with an adjudication of guilt was one of absolute discretion. The court held that while appellant's argument raised important constitutional concerns, it failed to persuade the court that due process of law could only be achieved through appellate review. The court held that the right to appeal was statutory, not constitutional, and there was no statutory appellate review under &sect; 3d(b).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged a judgment of the County Criminal Court at Law No. 7 of Harris County, (Texas) which convicted her of promotion of an obscene device, a dildo. Appellant alleged that the trial court improperly overruled her motion to quash the information, erroneously allowed the introduction of copies of photographs, and erred in failing to properly instruct the jury on the definition of &quot;obscene.&quot;</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of promotion of an obscene device, a dildo. The court held that the information paralleled Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 43.23, 43.21 (Supp. 1980-1981). The court held that use of the word &quot;dildo&quot; in the information was not inflammatory, but was simply used to accurately describe the object. The court also held that this term had a clear and definite meaning, which provided appellant with sufficient notice. The court held that alleging &quot;an obscene device, namely, one dildo&quot; sufficiently identified the property. Thus, the information alleged the offense sufficiently to show that an offense was committed and to apprise appellant of the charge against her. The court held that certain photographs were admissible to demonstrate that the design and use of a dildo, which was a required element of state's case under Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 43.21(a)(7) (Supp. 1980-1981). The court held that a dildo was obscene per se if it was marketed as useful primarily for the stimulation of human genital organs.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed appellant's conviction of promotion of an obscene device, a dildo. Appellant was sufficiently informed as to be able to prepare her defense, and this judgment would have barred subsequent prosecution for the same offense.

That standard set forth the following basic guidelines for the trier of fact to determine whether expression went beyond the limits of constitutional protection: whether the average person, applying contemporary community standards would find that the work, taken as a whole, appealed to the prurient interest; whether the work depicted or described, in a patently offensive way, sexual conduct specifically defined by the applicable state law; and whether the work, taken as a whole, lacked serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of murder and sentenced to life in prison after the jury returned a guilty verdict of a lesser included offense of that charged, capital murder of a peace officer. The court found no error in the trial judge's exclusion of certain cross-examination of a police officer because all of it was on collateral matter, not material or in any way related to the issues of the trial. The court determined that there was no violation of any right under U.S. Const. amend. VI when a sheriff's deputy discovered trial notes left in his squad car by defendant. The notes were discovered before the trial concluded, and were turned over to the prosecutor who refused to return them to defendant. The court disapproved of the practice but failed to find error of constitutional magnitude requiring reversal of defendant's conviction. The court instructed that the trial judge should have forthwith ordered the prosecutor to return the notes as elemental fairness and justice required no less. The court affirmed the conviction and found no error when the trial judge allowed many veniremen to be excused from jury duty because of financial, vacation, or child care concerns.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant offender appealed a judgment from the trial court (Texas), which entered a jury conviction for aggravated robbery. The defendant asserted that the trial court erred in failing to consider appellant's application for probation, admitting as a business record an unauthenticated invoice, and admitting unqualified expert testimony.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant offender approached the three victims as they walked from closing a fast-food restaurant and demanded their wallets. Defendant was convicted of aggravated robbery and asserted that the trial court erred in failing to consider appellant's application for probation because Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 42.12 &sect; 3f (1979) was unconstitutional and denied defendant equal protection of the laws as guaranteed by U.S. Const. amend. XIV and Tex. Const. art. IV, &sect; 11A. The court affirmed and held that any right the courts may have to grant probation on a conviction for aggravated robbery had been properly divested by Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 42.12, &sect; 3f(a)(1) (E) (1979). Defendant also asserted that the trial court erred in admitting the invoice in question as a business record. The court held that the invoice had been sufficiently qualified and defendant's objection was insufficient to preserve error on appeal. Finally, defendant challenged the qualifications of a police officer to make fingerprint comparisons. The court held that the testimony was based upon judicially recognized fact which would have been assumed in the absence of proof and so was not error.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment convicting defendant of aggravated robbery because the court found that the present penal code no longer required a description of the property, that there was sufficient evidence to support a conviction, and the trial court did not err in denying defendant's motion to suppress.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of attempted capital murder after shooting a police officer during a dispute in a lounge. Appellant challenged his conviction on several grounds, but the court affirmed appellant's conviction. The introduction of the officer's bloody shirt was probative on disputed issues of intent and knowledge. The court also held that the exhibition of the officer's surgical scar enabled the jury to pass on the seriousness of the wound and aid in their decision regarding appellant's intent to kill. Next, the court held that photographs of the crime scene were not irrelevant or unfairly prejudicial. The court further held that the conviction for enhancement under 21 U.S.C.S. &sect; 174 was proper under Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 12.42(d), although it was repealed, because it was subsequently recodified in a slightly altered form in 21 U.S.C.S &sect; 960. Even if it no longer was a felony under federal law, enhancement would still be proper because felony conviction under former penal code could still be used for enhancement purposes. The court also held that comment by trial judge was not a comment on the evidence nor impinging on the accused's presumption of innocence.</SPAN></P>

Ins. Code Ann. art. 20a.01-20a.35 (1981). The lower court entered a take nothing judgment against appellant. Appellant argued, on appeal, that the act was unconstitutional in that it imposed the tax upon corporate health maintenance organizations (HMOs) but not upon noncorporate HMOs. The court affirmed in part, but reversed the judgment in part. The court held that art. 20a.33(a) was unconstitutional in that it was a regulatory act, which discriminated against corporate HMOs with no reasonable basis for the unequal treatment. However, the court held that art. 20a.33(b) was a valid exercise of the state's taxing powers and had as the rational basis for the dissimilar treatment of corporate and noncorporate HMOs the privilege of doing business in the state.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged his conviction from the 262nd District Court of Harris County (Texas) for arson alleging that the lower court erred in failing to set aside appellant's indictment due to the unconstitutional arbitrariness of Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 28.02, failing to set forth the law in the jury charge, and failing to define intent and knowledge in the jury charge.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">State convicted appellant of arson and appellant sought review of the conviction on the grounds that appellant's indictment was based upon Tex.

I, &sect; 3, that the lower court did not properly set forth the law of the case or define intent and knowledge in the jury charge. On appeal, the court held that the mention of a rule for a distinct geographical area as set out in &sect; 28.02 was not unconstitutional because there was a reasonable basis for the distinction, in that the dangers of arson to life and property were greater and more immediate within city limits, and all persons similarly situated in the same place were equally treated. The court also held that it was not necessary for the lower court to read substantive law as to the offense into the jury charge because it was sufficient to apply the law to the facts of the case. Finally, the court held that the definitions of intent and knowledge were of commonly acceptable meanings readily understandable to jurors and that it was highly unlikely that the jury was misled or confused by lack of the definitions in the charge.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant's conviction for arson was affirmed on the grounds that the indictment was based on a constitutionally sound statutory provision, as the statute had a reasonable basis for stipulating a geographical distinction for the offense, and that the lower court was not required to include substantive law unrelated to the facts of the case or the definitions of intent or knowledge in its charge to the jury.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court affirmed, and held that appellant was not entitled to impeach the credibility of his own witness on that witness's prior criminal record. Appellant failed to lay the required predicate by showing that the testimony came as a surprise due to prior inconsistent statements made by the witness. Also, the court concluded that Tex. R. Civ. Proc. 182, which permitted a party to call any other party and to impeach that party if he gave adverse testimony, did not apply to criminal cases. Nor did Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 38.28 (1979) permit appellant to impeach his own witness because the purpose of such proof would be to show the witness to be of bad character, and therefore unworthy of belief. The court held that appellant was not denied a fair and impartial trial because the trial court permitted counsel to make closing arguments after he prematurely announced his decision. Finally, Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 42.12, &sect; 3f(a)(2) (1979), did not deny appellant equal protection because he chose to fall within its provisions by his voluntary waiver of a trial by jury.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee homeowners in a subdivision brought suit to enjoin appellant landowner-lessor from leasing his property as a group home for the handicapped, in violation of a restrictive covenant which required that homes in the subdivision be used as single family residences only. The trial court granted the injunction, and the court affirmed. Appellant argued that the restriction was only on the type of structure built, not on who lived in it, but the court held that the language of the covenant expressed a clear intent to restrict the use of the property to single family residences. The court defined a family as a household, including parents, children and servants, and lodgers or boarders, and this definition could not encompass four unrelated single adults. Finally, the court rejected appellant's argument that for public policy considerations, his use of the property to provide sheltered living arrangements for handicapped persons should receive preferential treatment. The court held that to grant preferential treatment to the handicapped would be unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court which enjoined the use of the property as a group home for the handicapped, because such use clearly violated the restrictive covenant which required that homes in a subdivision be used as single family residences only, and because public policy did not require selective non-enforcement of the covenant on behalf of the handicapped.</SPAN></P>

Appellant contended that the regulations were unconstitutionally vague in that they furnished no adequate guidelines or standards for the denial or granting of a permit and did not define &quot;improper land use.&quot; The court found that the regulations identified a range of considerations that might be involved in determining whether or not a particular location is appropriate, and overruled the &quot;void for vagueness&quot; challenge.

Appellants filed suit for a violation of their civil rights under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 and U.S. Const. amends. I and XIV, in which they claimed that appellee prosecutors had a policy of not protecting women against domestic violence. The trial court dismissed the case on the basis that appellants had not alleged a protected right and that appellants had failed to state a cause of action because appellees had absolute prosecutorial immunity. The court affirmed. The court first held that the common-law immunity for prosecutors from civil actions for malicious prosecution applied equally to alleged failures to act. The key to immunity as a prosecutor was whether the acts alleged to have been wrongful were committed by the officer in the performance of an integral part of the judicial process. The court also held that the broad conclusions alleged in the complaint did not present actionable rights of appellants that were violated by appellees.</SPAN></P>

The trial court awarded damages for appellee's costs in excess of the contract price to complete the construction, and for the value of appellee's services in supervising construction. The trial court trebled the actual damages. The court affirmed, holding that, contrary to the provisions of Tex. R. Civ.

The court held that Tex. Bus. &amp; Com. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 17.46(a), 17.50(a)(2), 17.50(a)(3) did not require proof of intent to deceive.

Defendant's contention that the statute under which he convicted was unconstitutional because it failed to define the terms &quot;make,&quot; &quot;receive,&quot; &quot;record,&quot; and &quot;settle&quot; was rejected. The court stated that the challenged words were clear, specific, and readily understandable. The indictment against defendant was legally sufficient because it tracked the applicable portions of Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 47.01(2), 47.03(a)(1), and his conviction was sufficiently supported by the evidence. Moreover, defendant's requested jury charge on accomplice testimony was inappropriate because under Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 47.09(d), a conviction could have been sustained by the uncorroborated testimony of a party to the offense. Defendant was also not entitled to a lesser-included offense charge because the evidence failed to raise the possibility that he was only guilty of a lesser-included offense.

Penal Code Ann. &sect; 30.04 and the trial court assessed punishment at 10 years. On appeal, the court affirmed. Defendant claimed that &sect; 30.04 was unconstitutional because it was capable of unequal application to thefts under different circumstances, but the court found that &sect; 30.04 was founded upon a reasonable basis and had not prescribed arbitrary or unreasonable punishment. 10 years being within the range of punishment set by the legislature for such offenses, the court declined to hold that such punishment was improper or illegal. Additionally, the evidence showed that defendant was assessed the punishment after his criminal record disclosed three prior felony convictions. In addressing the trial court's failure to instruct the jury on circumstantial evidence and it failure to grant a mistrial, the court deemed those matters waived in view of defendant's judicial confession at the punishment phase of the trial.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of obscenity under Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 43.23(c)(1) (1980-9181) after he was found to be offering artificial vaginas, among other items, for sale. Defendant challenged the lack of specificity in the warrant, the constitutionality of the obscenity statute, and the failure of the trial court to give the jury a charge on justification. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court found that defendant was not entitled to a jury charge on justification in the absence of an order or judgment specifically authorizing him to sell the items. The court found that the definition of an obscene device itself was not vague and gave fair notice of the forbidden conduct. Finally, the court found that the nature of the objects themselves, the manner in which they were displayed in the store, and the remarks of defendant concerning the use and cleaning of the devices was sufficient evidence to support the jury's finding that the devices were designed and being marketed as useful primarily for the stimulation of human genital organs.

He appealed and argued that the Texas Controlled Substances Act was not violated as the minuteness and potency of the heroin delivered was such as to be unusable. In affirming the conviction, the court held that the evidence was sufficient to support the conviction because Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 4476-15, &sect; 4.03(a) (1976) did not require a &quot;useable quantity&quot; in order to constitute an offense, and it was shown that defendant knowingly possessed and delivered heroin. The court ruled that the punishment assessed was proper as the offense was a first degree felony and defendant's sentence fell within the applicable statutory range.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was sentenced to life imprisonment after the trial court found him guilty of aggravated rape and found that his punishment should be enhanced by two prior convictions under Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 12.42(d) (1974). Defendant sought review of the trial court's judgment alleging, among other things, that a prior conviction, which was introduced for enhancement purposes, was void. The court affirmed the trial court's decision because the prior conviction was not void, even though defendant was convicted at the age of 17 under a statute that unconstitutionally defined a child as a female under the age of 18 and a male under the age of 17, because the court reviewing the statute simply excised language of the statute so that a child was anyone under the age of 17 so his conviction was still proper. Furthermore, the court held that the trial court did not err in overruling defendant's challenge for cause for a juror who stated that she thought the defendant was guilty because she also stated she would lay her opinion aside and base her verdict on the evidence, and that defendant's dissatisfaction with his counsel was insufficient to prove his claim of ineffective assistance.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiffs argued that the body of the act contained no provisions of the purposes for which defendant was established. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's judgment, holding that the trial court did not err because legislative intent was to be ascertained from the whole act including the caption. The court also held that in creating defendant, the legislature fixed and determined that its boundaries would be the same as those of the county.

The court held the language &quot;for his own welfare and protection or the protection of others&quot; incorporated a dangerousness standard before a mentally ill person could be involuntarily committed. The court found that appellant could not challenge the factual insufficiency of the evidence to support her commitment in her habeas corpus proceeding. After examining the evidence, the court found that there was sufficient evidence to support appellant's commitment, and there was no violation of her constitutional rights. The court concluded the evidence that appellant had a paranoid disorder, was found with a loaded gun in her car, and had started a fire in her kitchen that she did not recall was sufficient to establish appellant posed a serious and immediate risk to herself or others if she was not confined for treatment.

The hearing to determine financial assistance eligibility was not an adversary proceeding, and appellant was not deprived of any property right at the time of the hearing. Appellant was given notice and a full opportunity to contest his parentage in the action for reimbursement pursuant to Tex. Hum. Res. Code Ann. &sect; 46.003(a) and Tex. Fam. Code Ann. &sect; 40.2. The trial court's admission of the blood tests without a witness was harmless error because the remaining evidence supported the trial court's finding of parentage.

The court stated that not only must the contestant prove that voting irregularities were present, but also that they did in fact materially affect the results of the election. The court held that appellee failed to prove that the alleged fraudulent or illegal votes would have materially affected the outcome of the election. The court held that the trial court was under no duty to compel a voter to reveal for whom he voted until fraud or illegality was established.

Appellant asserted that the ordinance was overbroad on its face and abridged the right of free speech and press secured by the due process clause of U.S. Const. amend. XIV, and Tex. Const. art.

The court found that appellee could have achieved its goal by a more narrowly drawn ordinance, and that appellee's ordinance on its face was unreasonably restrictive.

Appellants challenged the constitutionality of the Worker's Compensation Act, which limited their recovery to the compensation, medical, and death benefits they received. The trial court granted appellee employer's motion for summary judgment. On appeal, the court affirmed, finding that appellants had not provided any authorities to support the points of error. Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 8306, &sect;&sect; 3a &amp; 3c (1967) provided that having accepted employment with an employer who was a subscriber under the workers' compensation act, an employee was conclusively deemed to have notice that the employer had paid for compensation under the act. An employee was required to give notice in writing of his waiver of benefits and his election to claim a right of action at common law in order for it to be effective. No one had a vested or property interest in the rules of the common law and, therefore, no one was deprived of a constitutional right by their change through legislative enactment.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sellers inherited land from their mother and received their predeceased brother's share of the land that they contracted to sell to appellee purchasers. The deceased brother's illegitimate minor daughter claimed an interest in the land and appellees filed suit against appellants for specific performance of the contract. Appellants sought review of the judgment that awarded 30 percent of the land to the minor daughter and ordered appellants to convey the remaining 70 percent to appellees. The court reversed and reformed the judgment because Tex. Prob. Code Ann. &sect; 42, as it existed at the time of the predeceased brother's death, prevented an illegitimate child from inheriting paternally. The brother had predeceased before &sect; 42 was ruled in violation of the equal protection clause of U.S. Const. amend. XIV because it treated legitimate and illegitimate children differently. The court held the ruling did not have retroactive effect because that would have caused chaotic title conditions. The court held that the errors in jury argument were curable, and in the absence of proper objection were waived.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff restaurant appealed from the judgment of the 250th Judicial District Court of Travis County (Texas) that was entered for defendant officials in a suit that sought, on equal protection grounds, a refund of taxes levied under Tex. Civ. Stat. Ann. &sect; 202.02, which imposed a tax of 10 percent of gross receipts from sales of mixed alcoholic beverages, while airlines paid a tax of only five cents per drink, under Tex. Civ. Stat. Ann. &sect; 34.04.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff restaurant objected to the taxes assessed against it under Tex. Civ. Stat. Ann. &sect; 202.02, which imposed a 10 percent gross receipts tax on sales of mixed alcoholic drinks. Plaintiff claimed the tax rate violated its equal protection rights under U.S. Const. amend. XIV and Tex. Const. art. VIII, &sect;&sect; 1 and 2, because Tex. Civ. Stat. Ann. &sect; 34.04 imposed a tax on airlines of only five cents per mixed drink. Plaintiff paid the extra taxes under protest and sued defendant officials for a refund. Judgment was entered that plaintiff take nothing and it appealed. In affirming, the court ruled that the different tax rates were not violative of equal protection because there was a rational basis for the separate classifications for airlines and sellers of mixed drinks, such as restaurants. Although they both sold alcoholic drinks, the nature of their businesses and the way they conducted business were different, which was sufficient to support the classifications.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment that plaintiff take nothing on its claim was affirmed because the 10 percent tax imposed on its gross receipts did not violate equal protection even though airlines were taxed at only five cents per drink; the reason for differences in taxation rates upon separate classifications of airlines and sellers of mixed drinks was not arbitrary, but had a rational basis due to the differences in the natures of the businesses.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After plaintiff father's son was killed when he fell down an open elevator shaft, plaintiff filed a wrongful death action against defendant elevator company, alleging that defective elevator design caused the accident. The trial court granted summary judgment for defendant, finding that Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 5536a (1980) barred plaintiff's action because the suit was filed more than 10 years after the elevator was substantially completed and defendant was not in control of the elevator. On appeal, the court affirmed, finding that Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 5536a, &sect; 2 (1980) applied to defendant and that there was no evidence that defendant was in control of the elevator. The court also found that application of the statute of repose to plaintiff did not violate Tex. Const. art.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant city was party to an eminent domain case against appellee owners. The trial court found for appellees and awarded damages and compounded prejudgment interest. While appellant was willing to concede the prejudgment interest, it sought review of the trial court's decision to award compound, rather than simple interest. The court agreed with appellant, holding that compound interest would only be appropriate after a separate judgment that the original prejudgment interest was unpaid. Even if some equitable rule existed to permit the assignment of compounded interest, the court held it would be inappropriate to apply such a rule to appellant, who was not responsible for any delays in the progress of the trial.</SPAN></P>

Appellee filed an action under Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 7345f to challenge the board's assessment. The jury found in favor of appellee. The court affirmed, concluding that appellant's challenge to the constitutionality of art. 7345f, &sect; 4(b), was without merit as the section applied evenly to all school districts, it was clearly worded, and it plainly authorized a district court or jury to assess the market value of property upon a determination that the taxing authority's valuation was incorrect. The court also found that art. 7345f, &sect; 4(c), which rendered a district court's or jury's valuation binding on the taxing authority, did not violate the uniform taxation requirement of Tex. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 1. Further, the court found that the evidence was sufficient to support the jury's valuation of appellee's property. The court also found that appellee was not bound by its sworn renditions of the value of the property because it exercised good faith in its assessment and art. 7345f committed the valuation decision to the trier of fact.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. VII, &sect; 50(2). The Commission ruled that appellee electric cooperative was authorized to service four subdivisions and an elementary school in Cameron County.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant utility board extended its lines into several of appellee's electric cooperative areas without first obtaining a certificate of convenience and necessity from the Public Regulatory Commission (commission). Appellee filed an application with the commission for a cease and desist order, requesting that appellant be prohibited from extending its lines into areas singly certificated to appellee. Ultimately, the commission held that appellant must transfer its facilities in one of the areas to appellee; that appellant was singly certificated in three other areas; and that the last three areas and the elementary school belonged to appellee. Appellant brought an action in district court to challenge the commission's holding; however, the district court affirmed the holdings. The court affirmed the district court's judgment, holding that appellee which had its facilities and equipment installed and ready to serve all customers who wished service, was &quot;lawfully furnishing service to that area.&quot; The court reasoned that appellant could not serve a customer where another utility was furnishing service without first obtaining a certificate which included that area.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, state and local tax authorities, challenged the judgment entered by the 165th District Court of Harris County (Texas), which declared that certain ad valorem taxes were unconstitutional with respect to appellee corporation and enjoined them from the collection of such taxes from appellee.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, state and local tax authorities, sought review of the trial court's judgment which declared ad valorem taxes assessed against appellee corporation were unconstitutional. Appellant contended that the trial court erred when it found that the property was not subject to state and local ad valorem taxes under U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 10, cl. 2, and U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 8, cl. 3. The court reversed the judgment because neither the commerce clause or the import-export clause of the U.S. Constitution prohibited the assessment of ad valorem taxes. The court found that the ad valorem taxes applied to all stored goods whether imported or not. The commerce clause did not prohibit the assessment of ad valorem taxes on goods that were ware housed for the owner's convenience until a sale was made. Appellant county was not estopped from collecting taxes it had previously exempted.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant taxpayer challenged the trial court's denial of his request for injunctive relief from liability for ad valorem taxes; appellant contended that appellee county used the wrong method or scheme to calculate ad valorem taxes on his property and penalties should not have been assessed. The court affirmed the trial court's order because appellant did not demonstrate any error that would justify a change in the judgment. The attacks on the trial court's judgment were not merited because the court's finding of constitutional compliance was supported by the evidence. The taxing authorities' arbitrary disregard of the true and legal basis of the calculation of assessed valuations did not, without proof of a substantial injury to appellant, entitle appellant to relief. To avoid statutory penalties, appellant needed to tender to the registry of the court the amount of ad valorem taxes legally due.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee city owned and operated its gas and electric systems. Appellants, school districts and hospital district, withheld payment of their gas and electric rates on the theory that Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 1446c, &sect; 48 exempted them from paying rates which were used to make or cover the cost of making payments in lieu of taxes to the municipality by which the public utility is owned. Appellee claimed &sect; 48 was inapplicable because a municipally-owned utility was not a &quot;public utility&quot; as defined in the statute. The court noted that appellants lost a large portion of their tax base when appellee acquired the gas and electric systems and that the purchase was approved by the voters in part because of a promise to pay appellants regular &quot;in lieu of tax&quot; payments. The court concluded that the legislature enacted &sect; 48 with the intent of bringing some financial relief to school and hospital districts and their taxpayers where a municipality owned a utility service. Because appellee's interpretation gave &sect; 48 no meaning, the court held that appellee's utility was a &quot;public utility&quot; under &sect; 48. The court reversed and rendered judgment for appellants.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the award of summary judgment to appellee city and rendered judgment in favor of appellants, school districts and hospital district, because the legislature clearly intended the statute exempting appellants from paying electric and gas rates to apply to municipally-owned utilities such as that owned by appellee.</SPAN></P>

Appellee applied to the Texas Air Control Board (board) for a permit to build new facilities. A permit was granted and just over a year later, an agreed judgment was entered in a TCAA enforcement action by appellant. The judgment permanently enjoined appellee from violating specific board rules and regulations limiting emissions rates. Appellee determined it was necessary to switch to a sulfide process and was notified that appellant would not agree to a modification of the original agreed judgment. Appellee filed a motion to modify the judgment and the trial court entered a modified judgment which allowed appellee to begin using the sulfide process. Appellant sought review and the court affirmed the judgment of the trial court. The court held that the trial court, after entering an injunction forcing operation under the terms of the judgment, could subsequently modify its own permanent injunction to provide relief from the unexpected and irreparable injury resulting from compliance with the order.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, the comptroller of the state of Texas, sought review of a decision in a consolidated action in a Texas trial court, which held that appellees, natural gas companies, were not liable for franchise taxes, under Tex. Tax Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 12.01-12.22 (1969), on the proceeds from their sale of natural gas to interstate transmission companies for resale outside of Texas.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a consolidated action, the trial court held that appellees, natural gas companies, were not liable for franchise taxes under Tex. Tax Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 12.01-12.22 (1969) on the proceeds from the sale of natural gas they sold to interstate transmission companies. The court reversed, and rendered a judgment that appellees were liable for the tax because, in spite of the fact that the natural gas eventually was delivered by third parties to destinations outside of Texas, the sale of the gas was completed within the state and therefore was taxable. The court found that the transactions began and ended within the state and therefore clearly was covered by Tex. Tax Code Ann. &sect; 12.02(1)(b)(i) (1969). The court held that the tax did not place an undue burden on interstate commerce in violation of U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 8, cl. 3. The court found that the sale of the gas was the basis of the tax, that there was no claim that the tax was unapportioned, and that the tax did not violate U.S. Const. art. VI, cl. 2. Opinions by the Texas attorney general and the comptroller's office could not invalidate the clear and unambiguous tax statute.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed, and rendered judgment for appellant, the comptroller of the state of Texas, because the franchise tax, as levied on appellees, natural gas companies, fit squarely within the statute governing franchise tax.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff commercial farmers bought and planted certain soybean seed which was tested and sold by defendant seed processor. The seed had been mislabeled and was not the type plaintiffs intended to purchase. After the crop produced a poor yield, plaintiffs sought damages for lost profits under the Deceptive Trade Practices-Consumer Protection Act (DTPA), 1973 Tex. Gen. Laws, Ch. 143, &sect; 1 at 322. The trial court entered judgment in favor of plaintiffs and defendant appealed. The court affirmed the judgment and held that the DTPA was applicable because plaintiffs were &quot;consumers, &quot; and individuals under &sect; 17.45(4) of the DTPA, and the seeds were &quot;goods.&quot; The court held that the evidence was sufficient to support plaintiffs' award of damages for lost profits. An implied finding that the sale of the mislabeled seed directly caused the poor crop was justified and plaintiffs were entitled to pursue a damaged crop measure of recovery.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Under 1979 Tex. Gen. Laws ch. 843, art. III, the Texas legislature passed a rider clause to an appropriations bill to create an Approval Board (board) made up of executive officials and the governor to oversee the purchase of land to build a new prison. Appellant taxpayers obtained a temporary injunction pending review of the judgment not to invalidate the rider or the board's decision to purchase certain land. Appellee state officials sought review. The court affirmed, dissolved the injunction, and found that the rider clause did not violate Tex. Const. art. II, &sect; 1, art. IV, &sect; 14, or art. III, &sect; 35 where the board did not create a new agency or office. There was not an excessive delegation of power where the board only operated in a limited and negative manner to veto proposed purchases. The rider was a valid means to decide when and under what conditions land was to be purchased. The board's meeting was not held in violation of the Texas Open Meetings Act, Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, mental health patients, sought review of the judgment of the trial court, Bexar County (Texas), which held that the Texas Mental Health Code, Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 5547, &sect; 66 was constitutional and that provisions of the Code had been complied with in the detention of appellants. Appellees claimed that the case was moot, as appellants had been released from confinement.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, mental health patients, were retained at a state hospital pursuant to orders for protective custody and petitioned for habeas corpus. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment that Texas Mental Health Code, Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 5547, &sect; 66 was constitutional on its face, and reversed judgment regarding the application of the statute to appellants. The court held that due to the severity of the consequences from a determination of mental illness and the brevity of emergency committals, the case was not moot under the &quot;collateral consequences&quot; and &quot;capable of repetition by evading review&quot; exceptions. The court held that confinement for up to 14 days under &sect; 66 without a hearing was not unreasonable, and that Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 5547, &sect; 33 provided for notice, service and appointment of counsel. In appellants' case, counsel had been appointed to represent 23 people in the custody hearing and had not received the information in a timely manner. The court held that this resulted in ineffective assistance of counsel and denial of due process, and the writs of habeas corpus were granted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's judgment that the Texas Mental Health Code was constitutional, but reversed the judgment that provisions of the Code had been complied with in appellants' confinement because appellants were denied effective assistance of counsel. Although appellants were no longer confined, the appeal was heard under exceptions to the mootness doctrine.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, natural child and natural grandchild of deceased, brought an action to determine heirship. On appeal, the court reversed the trial court's summary judgment in favor of defendant administratrix, the wife of decedent, holding that Tex. Prob.

Because the statute was unconstitutional, the summary judgment proof did not establish as a matter of law that plaintiffs were unable to prove that they were the heirs at law of the decedent.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee insurers promulgated and Texas State Insurance Board (Board) adopted a new insurance policy form (Endorsement 243) to comport with the requirement of Tex.

Appellant insureds asserted that the endorsement was facially inconsistent with art. 5.06-3 and that Board had been enticed to adopt the endorsement by the deceptive practices of appellees. The trial court granted summary judgment to appellees, and appellants challenged the order. The court affirmed the trial court's order and found that an exclusion concerning unscheduled vehicles in Endorsement 243, which was not included in art 5.06-3, did not act to invalidate the endorsement. Additionally, the court held that a provision in Endorsement 243, that allowed an injured person to recover 80 percent of lost income, did not constitute an additional exclusion and provided a full, fair payment for loss of income and was in harmony with art. 5.06-3. Because Endorsement 243 was not in conflict with art. 5.06-3, the court ruled that there was no need to reach any of appellants' deceptive practice claims.</SPAN></P>

The jury awarded actual and treble damages to appellee after deciding that appellant had engaged in a false, misleading, or deceptive act or practice. Appellant challenged the decision and the court affirmed it in favor of appellee. Appellant argued that the special issues submitted to the jury were not supported by the pleadings and evidence presented, but the court found this objection was not properly preserved for review, and that it was thereby waived by appellant. Appellant then argued its actions were not wrongfully intentional, and the court held that proof of intent was not required under &sect; 17.46(b).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After appellee permit applicant received commercial building permits from appellant city, appellant issued a stop work order because the permit application failed to reveal that the property was subject to a restrictive covenant limiting it to residential use. Reversing the decision of the trial court awarding appellee damages pursuant to 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983, the court held that appellant was not liable because the permits were void upon issuance due to appellant's failure to comply with Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 974a-2. The court reasoned that appellee had no constitutional right to proceed under a permit declared void by a valid state law. The court found that the statute did not violate the separation of powers provision of Tex. Const. art. 2, &sect; 1, because it did not authorize appellant to make a judicial determination as to whether deed restrictions were valid. The court also found that the statute did not authorize an unconstitutional taking of property or deny equal protection, that the city ordinances did not deny due process or authorize an arbitrary and capricious use of power, and that there was no evidence that the permit denial was a policy or custom of appellant.</SPAN></P>

Appellant did not issue notice of the contest to appellee and waited another five years, eleven months, and nineteen days before filing a motion for a show cause hearing. The court found that although Tex. Prob. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 33(a) and 93, which required that a will contest be filed within two years of probate, did not expressly require appellant to provide notice to appellant of the filing of the contest, because Tex. R. Civ. P. 72 applied to probate proceedings, appellant was required to give notice of the contest. The court found that the trial judge did not abuse its discretion in dismissing appellant's will contest because it was not only appellant's duty to file suit within the statutory time period, but was also appellant's duty to exercise diligence to see that notice was given or process issued and served.

The trial court dismissed the application because appellant had not prayed for quo warranto, the only course of relief available. Appellant challenged the order, arguing that quo warranto was not the exclusive remedy, and that the issues were properly raised by mandamus and declaratory judgment actions. The court held that quo warranto applied only to proceedings that challenged a person who would usurp, intrude into or lawfully hold or execute any office or franchise. The court added that appellant's petition did not merely contest the manner in which the election was conducted or the qualifications of the candidates to hold office, but rather challenged on constitutional grounds the authority under which the board was established. Therefore, the court held that quo warranto was not the sole and exclusive remedy by which appellant could obtain judicial determination of the issues.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, bank and shareholders, sought review of a judgment from the lower court (Texas), which upheld the tax levied by appellees, county, tax assessor-collector and board of equalization, on bank shares under Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 7166, and denied appellants' request for mandamus, injunctive, and declaratory relief. Appellants had contended that the tax plan was illegal under state and federal law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the court held that appellees, county, tax-assessor-collector, and board of equalization, had authority to tax shares of bank stock under Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 7166. The court found that Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 7150.6, which exempted most intangible property from taxation, did not repeal art. 7166 by implication; instead, art. 7166 was susceptible to a construction that allowed it to fall within an express exception to the exemptions in art. 7150.6(a). The court then found that the deliberate omission of taxation on shares of non-banking corporations and most intangible personal property did not render the cited statutes unconstitutional under Tex. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 1, noting that such taxation was not mandatory. The court further noted that the tax plan implicated no equal protection concerns because the subject classification was founded upon a reasonable distinction in state policy. The court concluded that the bank share tax was constitutional and affirmed, finding that appellees' method of assessment was permissible under the federal exemption statute because the statute did not operate to prevent local taxation of shares in state banks.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment that denied the relief requested by appellants, bank and shareholders, and upheld the validity of the tax plan levied by appellees, county, tax assessor-collector, and board of equalizer, on bank shares, concluding that such taxation, as well as taxation on federal bank shares, was permitted under the relevant federal exemption and consent statutes and the cited provision of the Texas Constitution.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant public utility sought review of a judgment from the 147th Judicial District Court of Travis County (Texas), which denied an injunction and dismissed its cause of action against appellee commission, which used its statutory power to order summarily that appellant cease certain conduct pending an evidentiary hearing, for lack of jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant public utility brought suit and sought an injunction after appellee commission summarily ordered appellant to cease certain conduct. The district court denied the injunction and dismissed the cause of action claiming lack of jurisdiction. On appeal, the court determined that there was no applicable constitutional authorization, however appellee was granted general and broad powers under the Public Utility Regulatory Act, Tex. Rev. Civ. Sat. Ann. art. 1446c. The court continued that it found no statutory provision which granted appellee the authority to issue a summary order directing appellant cease any kind of conduct especially without a hearing. The court held that the order did not comply with the fair notice requirement of due process. The court continued that the district court had both the inherent power and the statutory power to entertain and determine appellant's action seeking a declaration of the order's validity or invalidity, and to grant injunctive relief if it found the order to be invalid. The court declared the order of appellee void insofar as it required appellant to stop certain conduct and remanded for entry of an injunctive order.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court declared the order of appellee commission that appellant public utility to cease certain conduct void and remanded to the district court for entry of an appropriate injunctive order. The court held that the questioned part of the order was beyond the statutory authority of appellee to enter without a hearing and that denial of a hearing would violated the fair notice requirement of due process.</SPAN></P>

Reversing the judgment of the trial court, the court held that appellants did not meet their burden of proof for damages because the measure of damages was the market value of the probable yield of the crop, less unincurred expenses, and appellants failed to offer sufficient evidence of reasonably similar conditions as the basis for probable yield estimates. The court found that the trial court's charge to the jury did not properly define the measure of damages, and instructions charging the jury to consider only estimates of probable yields which were based on production under reasonably similar conditions should have been included. The court held that the award of prejudgment interest was proper because damages were established as of a definite time and the amount was determinable, but such interest could not be trebled.</SPAN></P>

Appellant had sought permission from appellee to construct a new above ground 1000 barrel asphalt storage tank to replace its two 400 barrel underground tanks, which were a lawful nonconforming use in an area zoned residential, and the city building official had denied the request.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant asphalt emulsion facility, which operated within the city, sought permission to construct a new above ground 1000 barrel capacity asphalt storage tank to replace its two 400 barrel underground tanks, which had developed leaks. The tank was to be located in a zoning district restricted generally to residential use. Appellant operated the facility there as a lawful nonconforming use. The court affirmed holding that it was the burden of appellant to prove that it was merely &quot;repairs&quot; for which it made application and this burden was not discharged because there was no sworn evidence of any kind offered or received. The court held that by the state of the evidence, both as before appellee city and the trial court, the application was for enlargement and alteration, and not repairs. As a result, the court held it was not burdened to pass on the constitutionality of the zoning ordinance on its face. The court held that because appellant never introduced any legally material evidence before the city in support of its petition, there could not have been any error or abuse of discretion by the failure to grant the petition.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state legislature passed a bill which purported to abolish the office of county treasurer in an individual county and shift its duties to the county auditor upon a vote of a majority of qualified voters. The trial court held the bill to be unconstitutional. The court affirmed, holding that a county treasurer was a constitutional officer, and a constitutional office could not be abolished without authorization. The court further held that Tex. Const. art. III, &sect; 64 did not abolish the constitutional status of all county officers. Section 64 provided a mechanism for consolidation of governmental offices and functions of any one or more political subdivisions comprising or located within any county. The court held that county government was not intended to be included as such political subdivision. Therefore, the house bill at issue was unconstitutional because there was no constitutional authority to warrant its provision for the abolition of a constitutional county office.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the trial court finding unconstitutional the house bill authorizing consolidation of the office of county treasurer into the office of county auditor was affirmed.

The purported constitutional authority for such abolishment in a section of the constitution did not apply to county government.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant company filed a petition for condemnation of appellee landowners' property for the purpose of building a pipeline. A special commission was formed to determine the award to the appellees. Appellant contested their award in the trial court. The trial court sustained appellees' pleas to jurisdiction which stated that appellant lacked the right of eminent domain, while denying the appellant's motion for partial summary judgment. Appellant contended that as a corporation engaged in the activities of transporting crude petroleum that it was subject to statutory powers allowing it to be a common carrier that could seek condemnation of property through eminent domain powers. Appellant sought review but the trial court record in this case contained no statement of facts. The court noted the power to determine the question of necessity to take particular land for public use under eminent domain was validly delegated in this case and could be delegated under law, and that appellant had met its burden of strict compliance with statutory and constitutional prerequisites for jurisdiction. The trial court judgment for the appellees was reversed and the case was ordered reinstated.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court judgment against the appellant company and ordered the case reinstated. The court concluded appellant met jurisdictional requirements and that no probative evidence existed supporting any legal theory the trial court judgment could have been based on. Therefore, given appellant's strict compliance with law, and its status as a common carrier, it had authority to pursue condemnation against the appellees.</SPAN></P>

The tumor was eventually removed by another doctor, and appellant filed suit more than two years after her last treatment by appellee, but less than two years after the tumor was removed. Appellant argued that the discovery rule should apply, and that the statute violated her constitutional right to equal protection. On review, the court found that the statute met the rational relation test, because it was reasonable, not arbitrary, and had a fair and substantial relation to the object of legislation, so that all persons were treated alike.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Two psychiatrists pursuant to a trial court order examined appellant mentally ill person and testified at appellant's indefinite civil commitment hearing regarding his condition. Appellant asserted that a waiver of a patient-professional privilege was required under the Tex. Mental Health Code Ann. art. 5561h, &sect; 4(a) to admit the testimony. The court held that a waiver was not required because appellant was informed by the psychiatrists, as required by &sect; 4(a), that the communications were not confidential, and could be used against him in a court of law. Appellant also asserted that counsel was required at the psychiatric examination to explain the patient professional privilege of art. 5561h, &sect;&sect; 2(a), 4(a), and that his due process rights under the United States Constitution were violated because the procedural requirements of a criminal hearing were applicable at an indefinite civil commitment hearing.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants sought review of an order of the 37th District Court of Bexar County (Texas) denying appellants' application for a temporary injunction to restrain appellees, state, county, and tax assessor, from seizing appellants' property for failure to pay taxes pursuant to Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 7266 (1960).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants applied for a temporary injunction to prevent appellees, state, county, and county tax assessor, from seizing appellants' property, pending resolution of appellee county tax assessor's actions against appellants to recover past-due taxes. The trial court denied appellants a temporary injunction. The court reversed the trial court's decision. In so ruling, the court held that Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 7266, which permitted the seizure of property by the tax collector upon failure to pay imposed taxes, denied appellants their property without due process, in violation of U.S. Const. amends. V, XIV. In reaching this conclusion, the court held that art. 7266 did not provide taxpayers with an opportunity to contest the validity of the tax or assessed liability, either prior to or after the seizure. Specifically, the court observed that, unlike other state seizure statutes, under art. 7266, the taxpayer had to obtain legislative permission to sue the state before he could claim a refund. This, the court found, was not an adequate remedy, making art. 7266 unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the trial court declared that appellant city's ordinance void, appellant challenged the judgment. The ordinance, Wichita Falls, Tex., Code of Ordinances ch. 30 &sect; 3849 (1979), prohibited persons from using a mobile home as a dwelling in the city outside of designated areas. The court affirmed the trial court's findings of fact that the ordinance was void because appellant failed to give notice of the ordinance in a newspaper before enacting it, as was required by Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 1176b-1 (1963). Moreover, as the ordinance prohibited the use of buildings and land use, Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 1011d (1963) required that appellant hold a public hearing on the ordinance before it could have become effective. Appellant failed to hold such hearing. Finally, as the ordinance provided for a criminal penalty for its violation, appellant was required to publish the ordinance in a newspaper and failure to make such publication rendered the ordinance void. As appellant did not challenge the trial court's finding that no such publication was made, the ordinance was void.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee clubs had small numbers of individuals that were permanent members in good standing. As such, appellees paid state license fees for only those members. When an audit determined that appellees had actually been treating numerous other individuals as if they were members in good standing, appellant, the Texas Alcoholic Beverage Commission, requested that appellees pay license fees for these individuals as well. Appellees paid the fees under protest and filed an action to recover the amounts paid. The trial court found for appellees and ordered the return of fees paid. Appellant challenged that ruling. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that only for the small number of persons who were actually members in good standing was a license fee required. While it was obvious that appellees were abusing the license fee regulations by treating others as such members, the court held that the state had remedies available for that type of conduct including suspension of permits, criminal proceedings, and injunctive relief.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant city sought relief after it was enjoined from prohibiting appellee townhouse association from participating in its garbage collection cost reimbursement sponsorship program and required to reimburse it for damages. The appellate court affirmed the judgment. It found that the implementation of the program violated appellee's constitutional rights. The written program specifically excluded townhouse associations. However, testimony indicated several such associations were permitted to participate. Because appellee was denied the right to participate, the court found that the program was not applied equally to persons falling within the same class. As such the court determined that the program was being implemented on an arbitrary and capricious basis and in bad faith, and that such actions deprived appellee of its constitutional rights. The court concluded that a municipality fell within the definition of persons for purposes of civil right violations prohibited by 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 and that, therefore, appellant was liable pursuant to that section.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee city sought and received declaratory judgment under Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 717m-1 (Vernon Supp. 1980) that an amendment to the city charter that limited appellee's taxing power as to its authority to issue general obligation bonds was invalid. The trial court found the amendment void in its entirety. In affirming, the court held that appellants' constitutional challenge to art. 717m-1 was improper because appellants did not suffer from that of which they complained and were precluded from asserting injuries to others. The validity of the amendment was a proper question for the trial court to determine under art. 717m-1. The amendment violated U.S. Const. art. 1 &sect; 10 and Tex. Const. art. 1 &sect; 16, regarding impairment of contracts, because it affected appellee's ability to pay holders of outstanding bonds by limiting tax increases.</SPAN></P>

Appellee filed a motion for summary judgment alleging that Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 6701b, &sect; 1(a) (1977) (the guest statute) barred the action. Appellee's father was appellant father's cousin, but appellee's stepfather had adopted him, and the parental rights of appellee's father had been terminated.

The court held that when paternal rights were terminated, and a child was legally adopted, all ties with the natural parent and his relatives were completely severed within the meaning of Texas' guest statute.

Defendant city required that injured parties file a notice of claim within 90 days of the incident. Houston, TX, Charter art. IX, &sect; 11. A jury entered a verdict in favor of plaintiff. The jury found that plaintiff had no reasonable basis for believing that he had a claim for damages against defendant during the period of time specified in the notice-of-claim provision and that defendant was not prejudiced by the delay in filing the required notice. The trial court entered judgment in plaintiff's favor. The court affirmed. The court held that the trial court did not err in determining that plaintiff's failure to strictly comply with the notice-of-claim provision did not, as a matter of law, bar his cause of action against defendant. The court held that an arbitrary application of the notice-of-claim provision would deprive plaintiff of his common-law right against defendant solely because he did not take action that, under the jury's findings, he had no reasonable basis for taking under the circumstances then existing.

Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 1396-50.01 (1980). Appellee was not an association of five or more individuals or two or more associations; instead, it had only one member.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant real estate developer claimed that it was error for the trial court to overrule appellant's motion for summary judgment and to grant appellee's motion for summary judgment because it was established as a matter of law that the Park Dedication Ordinance, Missouri City, Tex., Ordinance 0-77-28, was in violation of Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 17 and U.S. Const. amends. V and XIV. The court agreed and reversed the judgment of the lower court and held that it was beyond question that the ordinance involved a taking, or property loss to the owner not common to the general public and, therefore, could not have been accomplished without compensation to the property owner. Further, the provision of the ordinance, which permitted appellee to receive funds in lieu of realty, left no room for the contention that appellee was merely regulating the use of appellant's realty. Appellant's realty was no longer involved once appellee exercised that option. Consequently, the court held that the ordinance was void as violative of appellant's constitutional rights under Tex. Const. art. 1, &sect; 17.</SPAN></P>

The trial court granted the writ. The court found that Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 5154c-1, known as the Fire and Police Employee Relations Act (Act), allowed firefighters and policemen to engage in collective bargaining. The court found that Tex. Const. art. XI, &sect; 5 permitted local adoption of this Act because art. XI, &sect; 5 provided that no city charter could contain provisions inconsistent with the general laws of the state. The court affirmed the judgment and held that the provisions of art. 5145c-1 directed that reasonable alternatives must be provided to avoid strikes and work stoppages, and mandatory arbitration was such an alternative.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's award of summary judgment in favor of appellee trustee in its action to enforce a testamentary bequest made by the testatrix to a mausoleum special gifts trust fund because, contrary to appellant executors' contention, such bequest did not violate the rule against perpetuities under Tex. Const. art. 1, &sect; 26. The court held that, under Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 912a, &sect; 15, the mausoleum fund became a perpetual care cemetery with a perpetual fund. Construing &sect; 15 in pari materia with Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 912a, &sect; 18, the court concluded the legislature intended to exempt special care funds from the rule against perpetuities once such funds came into the hands of the trustee of the perpetual care fund. The court further held that appellee was authorized to take and hold special care funds donated by the testatrix, irrespective of whether the funds came to it directly or by way of the mausoleum fund, because to hold otherwise would result in nullifying the powers expressed in the statute and would essentially render &sect; 18 meaningless.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff buyer sued defendants, seller and manufacturer of 55-gallon drums, for defendants' failure to line drums with SL-254 lining in accordance with sample pans furnished plaintiff. Plaintiff obtained a jury finding of breach of express warranty by defendant seller, but the jury also found plaintiff negligent in failing to test the drums and that such negligence proximately caused 25 percent of plaintiff's damages. Both plaintiff and defendant manufacturer appealed. The court reversed the judgment against defendant manufacturer and modified plaintiff's judgment against defendant seller by eliminating the 25 percent reduction of damages. The court held that because an express warranty was a creature of contract, plaintiff could recover for a breach of that warranty regardless of a failure to exercise reasonable care to discern whether the goods were defective. Plaintiff had a right to rely on defendant seller's warranty. The court also held that because a fact issue existed with respect to whether the sample pans tested were part of the basis of the bargain in the sale, judgment against defendant manufacturer was reversed.</SPAN></P>

Appellant argued that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment because the criminal trespass statute should not be interpreted to encompass his conduct because it would violate his right to fee speech. Appellant argued that if the statute was to be applied in that manner, it was unconstitutional. The court affirmed the judgment, finding that, assuming appellant's distribution of the circulars was protected by U.S. Const. amend.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city council of appellant, the city of West Lake Hills, passed an ordinance, on the city's sole initiative, that attempted to control pollution flowing from private sewage facilities by requiring inspection and licensing of all such facilities existing within the city's limits or within the city's extraterritorial jurisdiction. Enforcement of the ordinance was by criminal action brought in the city's municipal court. Appellee coalition filed suit to enjoin enforcement of the ordinance as to facilities located outside the city's corporate limits. The trial court granted a permanent injunction against enforcement of the ordinance outside city limits. Appellant argued that Tex. Water Code Ann. &sect; 26.177 was a broad, general grant of power to cities to formulate plans to control pollution, including licensing of private facilities and criminal enforcement. The court held that &sect; 26.177 was not intended to authorize cities on their own initiative to regulate sewage facilities outside their city limits by licensing, and the municipal court had no jurisdiction to try violations of the ordinance that might occur in the extraterritorial jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>

Appellant's daughter and a friend entered three houses one day, plugged drains, and caused flooding damage to each house in the amount of $ 5,000 or more. Appellant challenged the trial court judgment, contending that the trial court erred in failing to limit recovery to a total of $ 5,000 by erroneously concluding that &sect; 33.02 only limited recovery to $ 5,000 per willful and malicious act, rather than per episode as appellant argued. The court disagreed and affirmed the trial court judgment. The court held that to construe &sect; 33.02 as limiting recovery to $ 5,000 per willful and malicious act made the act more effective in achieving its purpose of protecting property owners. The court also held that such a construction of the statute afforded property owners the greatest recovery possible while providing the greatest amount of encouragement for parents to train, control, and discipline their children.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of orders of the juvenile court of Bexar County (Texas), which adjudged him to be a delinquent, and committed him to the custody of the Texas Youth Council for a period not extending beyond his 18th birthday. Appellant claimed that the judgment and order of commitment were based on an erroneous assumption that he was guilty of a charge which the state had in fact waived, and concerning which the jury had made no finding.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was charged with delinquent conduct by committing the offense of arson and burglary. A judgment declaring appellant to be delinquent was entered, probation was denied, and he was ordered committed to the youth council. Appellant sought review. The court found that the jury charge explained only the law of arson, that the instructions were irrelevant to burglary, and that burglary was the only issue submitted to the jury. The court found that because of the failure to instruct on the law of burglary, the jury was not informed under what circumstances they should or should not find that appellant committed burglary. The court held that the jury's finding that appellant had engaged in delinquent conduct because he had committed the offense of burglary was fundamental error, that appellant was denied rights which were available to an adult in criminal proceedings as a constitutional guarantee of a fair and impartial trial, and that the denial of rights was not offset by the state's waiver of the only two charges of criminal conduct in its petition. The court found that the errors were fundamental, required reversal, and the issue was remanded.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the trial court contained fundamental errors requiring reversal and the cause was remanded for further proceedings to determine whether appellant was guilty of delinquent conduct. The court held that it was error to fail to instruct the jury on the law of burglary and such error denied appellant his right to a fair and impartial trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant child challenged the judgment of the District Court of Dallas County (Texas), which held that appellant's cause of action to establish paternity was time-barred by the statute of limitations in Tex. Fam. Code Ann. &sect; 13.01 (Supp. 1980). The statute provided that the action must have been brought before appellant's first birthday.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant child filed an action seeking to establish his paternity. The trial court held that pursuant to the statute of limitations found in Tex. Fam. Code Ann. &sect; 13.01 (Supp. 1980), appellant's action was time-barred because it was not brought before his first birthday. On appeal, the court affirmed. Appellant contended that &sect; 13.01 was subject to the same tolling provisions as all other Texas statutes, and, therefore, he argued that his action to establish paternity was tolled during his minority. The court rejected appellant's argument. The court noted that the language of Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 5535 (Supp. 1980), was self-limiting. Specifically, art. 5535 limited its effect to any action mentioned in its subdivision of its title. Therefore, because the Texas Family Code was not in that subdivision, the tolling provisions did not apply to it. Further, no provisions existed within the Texas Family Code for tolling &sect; 13.01. Therefore the court held that &sect; 13.01 was not tolled as to appellant's cause of action to establish paternity. The court also held that &sect; 13.01 did not deny illegitimate children equal protection or due process of the law.</SPAN></P>

The court found that there was sufficient evidence that the rate of interest inserted in one of the loans was not a bona fide error, that the award of attorney's fees was not excessive, that checks from third parties were properly admitted because they were probative evidence of how much money was loaned and were not hearsay, that refusal to allow appellant to introduce character evidence as to his veracity was harmless error because it was collateral to the ultimate issues of the case and, thus, did not cause an improper judgment, and that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in severing appellant's cross-action for slander because severance was proper to prevent confusion of the issues.</SPAN></P>

The trial court rejected appellant's argument and set aside the order suspending appellee's license. The court reversed and dismissed the case because appellee's action was governed by the APTRA, which, as the later enacted statute, had amended the PEA to require persons dissatisfied with appellant's actions to move for rehearing before commencing an appeal.

The court held appellant failed to prove that his failure to answer was not intentional or the result of conscious indifference, and the evidence supported finding that appellant's actions with respect to switching engines fell under the Act. However, the finding with respect to the paint damage was erroneous as it was based on an estimate which was pure hearsay.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner father sought habeas corpus relief from an order of a district court of Bowie County (Texas), which found him in contempt for failure to make child support payments and ordered him jailed until he purged himself by paying arrearages in child support and court costs.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother of his child brought a motion for contempt against relator father for back child support. The trial court found relator in contempt and ordered him to pay a portion of the arrearage immediately, which relator did. At a later hearing, the trial court withdrew its prior order and ordered relator jailed for contempt. On petition for habeas corpus, the court granted the petition, holding that the second order was void because it violated the double jeopardy clause. Had relator not already paid the judgment pursuant to the trial court's first order, the court could have set aside its first judgment of contempt and entered a new judgment of contempt increasing the sentence. Because relator had already purged himself of contempt, the trial court was without authority to impose a new judgment of contempt absent any new acts of contempt. The record did not support relator's contention that he had no source from which he might be expected to obtain the arrearage and that he was unable to purge himself of contempt because it was impossible for him to perform the order. The court observed that imprisonment for failure to make child support payments would not be unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Relator father's request for habeas corpus relief was granted, relator was ordered discharged, and he and his sureties were discharged from obligation under his bail bond. The court held that, because relator had purged himself of a prior contempt order and had engaged in no other acts of contempt, the trial court erred in ordering him jailed for contempt.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, bank and its shareholders, filed suit for mandamus, injunction, and declaratory judgment against appellees, county, county tax assessor-collector, and county board of equalization. Appellants alleged that the 1979 county tax plan, which taxed shares of stock in banks, was illegal under state law, or was illegal as implemented under federal law, or, if not prohibited by state or federal law, was unconstitutional. Appellants sought review of the judgment for appellees. The court reversed and remanded with instructions. Only the last sentence Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 7166 was impliedly repealed by Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 7150.6. After reading the two statutes together, and giving effect to both to the extent possible, the court held that appellee county had authority to tax bank shares. 31 U.S.C.S. &sect; 742 as amended exempted United States obligations from being considered in the computation of any state or municipal or local tax. The tax plan was illegal because the plan did not make a proper assessment of taxable value. Appellants showed substantial injury. Because the tax was illegal under federal law, the court did not reach the constitutional arguments.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court reversed. It held that to have members of the board sit in judgment with their fellows one day and appear as investigators and witnesses before them the next created an intolerable risk of unfairness. Voluntary non-participation of the two members who appeared as witnesses did not cure the unfairness, but contributed to it because the number of members remaining to deliberate on the decision was reduced.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant Department of Human Resources, assignee of a mother's child support rights, sought review of an order of the 36th District Court of San Patricio County (Texas), which granted summary judgment to appellee, the child's alleged father, and dismissed, as time-barred, appellant's paternity action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee, alleged biological father, argued that a paternity suit brought by appellant, Texas Department of Human Resources, as assignee of a mother's child support rights, was properly dismissed because the action was not commenced within one year of birth pursuant to Tex. Fam. Code Ann. &sect; 13.01 (1980). The court agreed, noting first that a four-year limitations period had applied before the effective date of the statute applying to the illegitimate child here. Citing a previous ruling upholding the constitutionality of the statute, the court ruled that the one-year period did not deprive the illegitimate child, the real party in interest, of his rights to due process and equal protection under the federal or state constitutions. Moreover, the court added, appellant was not entitled to have the statute tolled during the minority of the child. Because the purpose of the suit was to establish appellee's duty as the purported biological father to support a child born out of wedlock, tolling the statute would allow the child to bring suit for child support once he was no longer a child. To rule otherwise would effectively emasculate a substantive part of the code.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant property owners challenged the judgment of the 105th District Court of Nueces County (Texas), which held that the public had acquired the right of use and easement to and over the beach area adjacent to appellants' motel, ordered appellants to remove the motel structure from the beach area, and permanently enjoined appellants from erecting any structures on the beach area in the future.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee Attorney General of Texas sought to enforce the Texas Open Beaches Act, Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 5415d, against appellant property owners, concerning beachfront motel property. The jury found that the motel was on public property acquired by easement, dedication, and custom and interfered with the public's right of way and right to use the beach. The trial court ordered the removal of the motel from the beach area and permanently enjoined appellants from erecting any structures on the beach area in the future. The court affirmed, holding that appellants' mortgagee was not an indispensable party and that appellants' attempted counterclaim alleging appellee's tortious interference with licensing procedures and construction permit procedures did not state a cause of action. The court affirmed the jury charge of the statutory definition of public beach. The court held that the judgment was supported by evidence, described with reasonable certainty the limits of the public easement, and did not presume revocation or impeachment of grants and patents but rather the acquisition of private property. The court held that the Open Beaches Act was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellees were the employer of an employee who was killed in a job-related elevator accident. His survivors filed suit against appellees and against appellant, a business which serviced elevators, among others.

Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 8306, &sect;&sect; 3 and 3a insulated them from liability. On appeal, the court affirmed, and held that art. 8306, &sect; 3 expressly prohibited appellants from their action for contribution, and appellants could not use the common law rule of contribution to sidestep the express provisions of the statute. Also, Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 8306, &sect; 5, which permitted listed parties to sue the employer for exemplary damages under some circumstances, did not apply to appellant; moreover, art. 8306, &sect; 5 concerned exemplary damages, and appellant was seeking contribution for compensatory damages.

Defendant contended that the injunction was unconstitutionally broad. The court agreed, holding that certain paragraphs of the &quot;limited exception&quot; were improper. It was not the role of a court of equity to tell pickets what words they must use to express their ideas or to whom they may talk. Such restrictions and prior restraints upon speech were inconsistent with U.S. Const. amend. I when less drastic means were available. However, the error by the trial court in granting a temporary injunction that was overly broad did not constitute fundamental error in the judgment as a whole. The court therefore modified the judgment and affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee, the city, entered into certain exclusive franchise agreements for garbage collection without competitive bids. Appellant brought suit seeking a declaration that these ordinances and contracts are unconstitutional, null and void. The trial court ruled for appellee city. The city had enacted an ordinance granting an exclusive franchise for garbage without a competitive bid. Appellant argued that the trial court erred in finding the ordinance and contract valid because (1) a municipal corporation is prohibited from granting an exclusive franchise and contract to a private corporation; (2) a municipal corporation cannot award a contract for the collection without competitive bids; and (3) a municipal corporation cannot by contract barter away its governmental powers. The court disagreed finding that the city could grant an exclusive franchise and contract to a private corporation and that the city did not barter away its governmental powers because there were numerous safeguards requiring city supervision in the contract. The court also found that the city could expend funds to protect the public health without requiring competitive bids.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A student was caught by a school district employee sitting in a parked car on a street adjacent to the school campus in possession of a bag of marijuana. Appellant school district sent appellee parents a letter of its intent to expel the student. After a hearing before the school board, the student was ordered expelled for one quarter of the school year. Appellee parents successfully challenged the ruling in the trial court, which found that procedural requirements were not followed in carrying out the expulsion. The court affirmed, holding that the policy for expelling pupils for misconduct when other means of correction failed was not followed because no alternate means of correction were attempted, and that the letter sent to appellee parents failed to include a report of the measures taken by the administration in trying to bring about proper conduct on the part of the student, as required by the board's rule. The court found that because the student was not acting disruptively, the rule extending the school campus 500 feet did not apply and that appellant did not by signs alone fairly apprise students that they could be expelled for possession of marijuana off the campus.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant son, age 19, sued appellees, hospital and health care providers, for his father's wrongful death 16 years earlier. The lower court granted appellees summary judgment on grounds that suit was time-barred by Tex. Ins. Code Ann. art. 5.82 (repealed 1987). The statute provided a two-year statute of limitations for malpractice claims against licensed health care providers, but required plaintiffs under the age of six to file claims before their eighth birthday. Appellant claimed that but for the intervening enactment of art. 5.82, his suit could have been filed before his 20th birthday as provided by Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. arts. 5526, 5535. The court found that retroactive application was not unconstitutional if it afforded a reasonable time to bring suit on an action not yet barred by limitation. Appellant's suit was barred because he filed suit over 10 years after his eighth birthday. The court found that art. 5.82 did not violate the Tex. Const. art.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, two property insurers, asserted that the Texas Catastrophe Property Insurance Association (Cat Pool) was administered unfairly and discriminatorily because the very large member companies that had representation on the Cat Pool board of directors had almost a zero percent participation in Cat Pool insurance writings. The advantage to the larger companies resulted from the statutorily authorized credit for voluntarily insurance. The large insurers' representatives on the board of directors were not obligated to make changes in the Cat Pool's operation simply because they were able to benefit from the credit provision of the statute. Appellants also contended that the trial court erred in holding the substantial evidence rule applied in reviewing an agency decision. This standard of review was correct because under the doctrine of separation of powers, de novo review of legislative or executive determinations of agencies was unconstitutional. Appellants challenged the designation of the catastrophe area and the credit for voluntarily written insurance, issues that was legislative in nature, and the substantial evidence rule was correctly applied by the trial court.</SPAN></P>

Finally, on the merits, the court held that appellee's ordinances were unconstitutional, for they delegated the legislative power to decide which properties were to be regulated to a municipal commission and certain of that commission's officers. The court therefore held that all of the ordinances were unconstitutional, and that the trial judge should have enjoined enforcement of all of them.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The lower court's order enjoining enforcement of some of appellee municipality's ordinances was affirmed, but the order refusing to enjoin the other ordinances was reversed. None of the ordinances could be enforced, as all were unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant employee sought review of an order from the 113th District Court, Harris County (Texas), which transferred the cause to Bexar County (Texas) from Harris County after appellee railroad filed a plea of privilege to have the cause transferred in an action for personal injuries brought under the Federal Employer's Liability Act, 45 U.S.C.S. &sect; 51 et seq..</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant employee sought review of an order which granted appellee railroad's plea of privilege to have the cause, brought under the Federal Employer's Liability Act (F.E.L.A.), 45 U.S.C.S. &sect; 51 et seq., transferred from the county in which appellant did business to the county in which appellant resided. On appeal, the reviewing court rejected appellant's contention that federal, rather than state, law governed venue. The court examined the language of &sect; 56 of the F.E.L.A., 45 U.S.C.S. &sect; 56, and concluded that it established venue only for actions brought in federal court. The court found that venue in state court F.E.L.A. actions was controlled by the venue statutes of the forum and, thus, Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 1995, &sect; 25, controlled venue in this action. The court also found that the provisions of the state venue statute were mandatory, and, therefore, appellant could not bring suit in the county of appellee's domicile. The court rejected appellant's constitutional challenge to the provisions, finding that mandatory application of the state venue statute did not deny him substantial federal rights. The court affirmed the judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the lower court. The court found that venue was governed by the state venue statute, the application of which was mandatory.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant Texas Department of Human Resources sought review of a judgment of the District Court of Dallas County (Texas), which dismissed, with prejudice, appellant's suit to collect child support from appellee birth father after finding that appellant's suit was barred by the general four-year statute of limitations as set out in Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 5529 (1968).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant Texas Department of Human Services sought to compel appellee birth father to support an illegitimate child. The trial court dismissed appellant's suit with prejudice, holding the claim was barred by the four-year statute of limitations, Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 5529 (1978-79). The court reversed the trial court's dismissal and remanded. The court held that appellant is not exempted from application of the statute of limitations in this case, because although Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 5517 provides that limitations do not run against the state generally, the fact that the mother's right to claim child support had not been assigned until the child was over four years old meant that appellee could raise limitations as a defense. But limitations were tolled until the child reached his majority. Limitations in an action governed by art. 5529 (the governing limitation statute) were tolled until the child reached majority pursuant Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 5535 (1978-79). The court did not lack jurisdiction for appellant's failure to file a cost bond, since Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 2276 (1971) exempted the state from having to file a cost bond on appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court's dismissal with prejudice and remanded the case. The court held that while the state may not claim immunity from the statute of limitations for a claim assigned to it by the birth mother, the general four-year statute applied. The provision that tolled the running of limitations until a claimant reached majority also applied.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After appellee policeman was found to have used a handheld phone with alligator clips to place a phone call from the phone junction box of a business while on duty, appellant city civil service commission conducted a hearing. The commission found that appellee's conduct was an unauthorized and fraudulent use of the telephone equipment or system, prohibited by Tex. Penal Code &sect; 31.04. As a result, appellee was indefinitely suspended and permanently dismissed from his police job. Appellee sought and obtained an order from the trial court setting aside appellant's order and reinstating him. The court reversed the trial court's order of reinstatement and ordered appellee terminated. The court held that specific, substantial evidence supported the allegations in the suspension order. Appellee did not deny using the handset and alligator clips to place a phone call from the business' phone line. The court also held that the civil service rule under which appellee was terminated, which called for termination for acts showing lack of good moral character, was not unconstitutionally vague, because a reasonable man would be on notice that what appellee did violated the rule.</SPAN></P>

The trial court heard evidence that appellant and the two children lived with four adult women and approximately twenty-five children in one small three-room home containing one bathroom, and the children were admitted to a hospital in a state of malnutrition before they were finally taken by appellee. Appellant was informed of her visitation rights while the children were in the hands of appellee, but she made no effort to visit the children until advised that she should do so by her attorney, nearly five months later. The trial court entered a decree terminating appellant's parental rights and she appealed. The court held that there was ample evidence that the appellant was indifferent to her children's physical condition and uncooperative with the workers who attempted to assist her in providing proper care. The court also held that Tex. Fam. Code Ann. &sect; 15.02(1)(D) (Supp.1979) was not unconstitutionally vague. Therefore, the court affirmed the decree.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant business sought to overturn the decision of a District Court of Dallas County (Texas), holding that a judgment obtained by appellee State of Washington in that state was entitled to full faith and credit under U.S. Const. art. IV, &sect; I.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee State of Washington obtained a judgment in that state against appellant business assessing civil penalties and issuing an injunction against appellant for violating Washington's consumer protection act. Appellant claimed that the judgment was not enforceable in Texas because the judgment was not entitled to full faith and credit under U.S. Const. art. IV, &sect; I. The trial court entered summary judgment for appellee and the court affirmed, rejecting appellant's arguments that the judgment was penal, that enforcement of the judgment would offend Texas public policy, and that the judgment was otherwise erroneous. The court held that civil penalties in the enforcement of consumer protection statutes were designed to protect consumers not to punish the offender, and therefore held that the judgment was entitled to full faith and credit. The court ruled that both Texas and Washington's consumer statutes were designed to protect the consumer from false advertising; therefore, appellant's public policy argument was rejected. The court also held that appellant could not collaterally attack alleged errors in the judgment because the judgment rendered in Washington was not void.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the decision of the trial court, which had given appellee State of Washington's foreign judgment against appellant business full faith and credit in Texas. The court held that civil penalties issued to enforce consumer protection statutes were not penal and were to be given full faith and credit, and the court also held that the foreign judgment was not subject to collateral attack.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant teacher was a professional employee at a school for the mentally retarded. Plaintiff parent brought a suit against defendant for his son's personal injuries that were sustained while under the supervision of a mentally handicapped playground aide. The son fractured neck vertebra as a result of attempting to high jump a stick at the aide's direction. Plaintiff claimed that defendant was negligent in failing to supervise his son's activities. The court affirmed the grant of summary judgment in favor of defendant, because the legislature intended that Tex. Educ. Code Ann. &sect; 21.912(b) (Supp. 1978-1979) limit the liability of schoolteachers, who were professional school employees, to certain acts resulting from the discipline of students. The court reasoned that because there was no discipline involved in plaintiff's action, defendant was not personally liable. The court held that &sect; 21.912(b) was a permissible exercise of the legislature's police powers under either Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 13 or U.S. Const. amend. XIV because of the desirability of providing teachers limited protection from being placed in the position of an insurer.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the statute limiting professional school employee's liability was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant faculty member was also Dean of Student Affairs, one of the duties of which was to administer a health insurance program for students. An audit of the program allegedly revealed irregularities in its administration. As a result, appellant was informed that if he did not resign he would be fired. Appellant brought suit against the appellees, Board of Regents, alleging that he did not resign as a tenured member of the faculty, but only as Dean of Student Affairs. The limited resignation, however, was treated as a resignation also from his tenured faculty position. The trial court ordered that all of the special exceptions except those alleging vagueness be sustained. Appellant was ordered to re-plead, and when he did not do so, the trial court further ordered that appellant's case be dismissed. The court reversed the order to dismiss and remanded the case to the trial court. The court held that appellant's tenure was a vested property right, the denial of which gave him an inherent right of appeal to the courts despite a lack of both consent by the legislature and of specific statutory provisions allowing judicial review of decisions by the board.</SPAN></P>

Appellant challenged that order, claiming, inter alia, that the juvenile court failed to suppress certain evidence seized as a result of an allegedly invalid arrest and that the petition should have been dismissed because it did not meet the requirements of procedural due process, notice, and specificity. On appeal, the court affirmed the juvenile court's decision, and held that appellant was properly taken into custody pursuant to Tex. Fam.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">This was an appeal from a judgment of the trial court (Texas), which affirmed the decision of appellee Texas Employment Commission and dismissed appellant employee's appeal for want of jurisdiction. Appellee's decision denied appellant certain unemployment benefits because of her misconduct connected with work. At issue was whether notice of determination was timely received, and whether due process and applicable federal law was violated.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant employee was terminated and filed for unemployment benefits. Appellant was disqualified because of misconduct, but had not received notice of claim until approximately two weeks after her benefits were reduced. An appeal was filed and dismissed for want of jurisdiction, which dismissal was affirmed by appellee employment commission. A notice of determination should have been mailed to claimant, who then had 12 days to request a redetermination. Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 5221b-4(b) (1978-1979). Appellant contended appellee's interpretation of the statute was unconstitutional and violated the Federal Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 503(a)(3) (1974). However, appellant was afforded a hearing before the appeals referee in which evidence was introduced. Appellant testified that she arranged for her neighbor to have taken the mail out of her mailbox and given it to her sister, her mother, or herself. As notice was promptly delivered, and taken by neighbor, appellant's contention that she had not received the letter, due to a delay in the chain of custody, could not have been sustained. Neighbor's receipt of the letter, was receipt by appellant, via her agent.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the trial court was affirmed. Proper notice was mailed and timely received by appellant employee's agent. Receipt of the letter by her agent was receipt of the letter by appellant. Nevertheless, she failed to have properly utilized clearly established appeal procedures. Thus, appellant had not been treated unfairly or arbitrarily in violation of due process and applicable federal law.</SPAN></P>

The state withdrew its quo warranto intervention and appellees entered a plea in abatement.

Appellants filed an appeal and contended, among several things, that the state was not an indispensable party. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment. The court held the state was an indispensable party and appellants' lacked standing to challenge the validity of the incorporation of a municipality on their own. The court reasoned that the trial court found the existence of the municipality constituted a defacto corporation existing under color of law and therefore only the state possessed the authority to question its existence.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant adult movie theater owner sought review from the 250th Judicial District Court in and for Travis County (Texas), that taxed costs incident to a receivership established for nonpayment of franchise taxes after a finding by a federal district court that the receivership ordered by the trial court had violated U.S. Const. amend. I and XIV, and Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 8.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee state brought a quo warranto proceeding against appellant adult movie theater owner and alleged that appellant was operating without a valid certificate of authority from the appellee, because it was an out of state corporation and that it had not paid franchise taxes. The trial court ordered a receivership and seizure of all appellant's assets. Appellant then filed a federal lawsuit alleging that appellee's purpose was not to collect taxes, but to shut down its theaters because of the content of the films, in violation of U.S. Const. amend. I and XIV, and Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 8. The federal court agreed and enjoined appellee from any further action and dissolved the receivership. Appellee then brought an action to tax costs adjacent appellant and the trial court granted the requests. Appellant sought review and the court reversed, holding that the determination by the federal court was res judicata on the trial court and that therefore any order enforcing costs of an illegal receivership was an abuse of discretion by the trial court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the taxing of costs to appellant adult movie theater owner and held that in determining that the receivership established by the trial court had violated the appellant's rights to free speech under both the federal and state constitutions, the federal court had determined that appellee state had acted with improper motives and that the trial court had abused its discretion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee sued appellant school district, appellant city, appellant water district, their tax collector and their tax collection lawyers. Appellee, the owner of appellant city's post office building, sought relief from the &quot;Authorized Collection Expense&quot; ordinance which defendants added to the ad valorem taxes on that property. After a nonjury trial, the district court entered judgment declaring the &quot;Authorized Collection Expense&quot; ordinances of appellants to be illegal and void. On appeal, the court held that reversal was warranted because the Attorney General of Texas was not served with a copy of the proceedings and was not given an opportunity to be heard under Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 2524-1, &sect; 11. The court held that the failure to notify the Attorney General of the pendency of this lawsuit, and to give that official an opportunity to be heard, deprived the trial court of jurisdiction to decide the challenge to the constitutional validity of the ordinances.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant taxpayers sought review of a decision of the Third Judicial District Court in and for Anderson County (Texas), which denied their request for a temporary injunction to prevent appellee city and school district from approving their tax rolls or collecting any taxes under an allegedly discriminatory and illegal plan of taxation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant taxpayers sought a temporary injunction to prevent implementation of a property tax by appellee city and school district. The trial court denied the request and on appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that the procedure used by appellee omitted personal property from the tax rolls and that such omission was not accidental, but was the result of a fundamentally erroneous plan or scheme or procedure. The method used by appellees was in violation of Tex. Const. and statutes of Texas and therefore illegal. Appellants met the first half of their burden by showing that they had a probable right to relief on a trial on the merits of their case. The individual appellants presented no evidence to show that they themselves were injured or that they would suffer probable injury. There was no proof that any of the individual appellants were or probably would have been substantially injured by the application of the tax plan to them. The court held that appellants did not meet their burden of showing a probable injury to themselves as the injury required to be shown had to be a pecuniary one and not merely an alleged deprivation of constitutional rights.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment denying appellant taxpayers' request for temporary injunction affirmed on the grounds that, while they demonstrated appellee school district' taxing plan was illegal and unconstitutional, appellants failed to demonstrate that they would have individually been injured by the implementation of the tax.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee garnishor sought to enforce a money judgment against appellant debtor. Appellee filed a writ of garnishment pursuant to Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat.

Writs were filed on two garnishee banks and judgment was entered in appellee's favor. Appellant's motion to vacate the judgment and for a new trial was denied. The court affirmed, holding that as no statements of facts were brought forward to the appeal, the trial court's findings were conclusive and evidence was presumed to be sufficient to support its findings. The court found that article 4076 was constitutional and upon rendition of the final judgment, appellant was required to take notice that post-judgment garnishment proceedings would follow. The court ruled that as the trial court found that appellant had received notice, did nothing to assert his rights in the funds at the garnishee banks, and there was no evidence to the contrary, the trial court's findings and conclusions did not reflect error.</SPAN></P>

The trial court terminated appellant's parental rights and appointed the maternal grandparents as managing conservators of the children. Appellant sought review and asserted 17 points of error by the trial court. The court found that appellant had failed to preserve several of the errors for appellate review because she was raising them for the first time on appeal. Appellant complained that there was no evidence to support the jury's findings of the existence of facts that supported the decree of termination. The court disagreed, citing evidence that appellant's children were neglected, were living in filthy environments, were inadequately clothed and fed, were thin and sickly, had emotional problems, and performed below their abilities in school. The court found that this evidence supported the conclusion that termination of appellant's parental rights was in the best interest of the children. The court affirmed the judgment.</SPAN></P>

Appellee had also requested that the trial court terminate the parent-child relationship between appellant and the minor child. The trial court refused to terminate the parent-child relationship. No appeal was taken on the issue of terminating the relationship. The court concluded that the &quot;best interest&quot; test should be used regarding questions of conservatorship, possession, and support of the minor child. Tex. Fam. Code Ann. &sect; 14.07.

All parties had sought summary judgment. Appellant claimed that appellees, commissioner court and its members, acted outside their jurisdiction when appellee court approved appellee district's annexation of land in the Gulf of Mexico to which appellant held oil lease rights.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In its petition for judicial review, appellant gulf oil leaseholder claimed that appellee commissioners court authorized the annexation of territory to appellee drainage district that included an area eight miles off the Gulf coast upon which appellant owned an oil lease. The court found that Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 8176b-1 granted appellee district the authority to annex additional territory provided the territory to be annexed was contiguous to the district, wholly within the county, outside any other drainage district, and outside any incorporated municipality. The court held that the area appellee district was authorized to annex was described as &quot;territory&quot; and was not limited by statute to land that could be drained. The court ruled that the county boundary extended out into the Gulf and included the area annexed by appellee district. The court determined that appellee court did not exceed its authority when it granted the annexation petition. The court held that there was insufficient summary judgment evidence before the trial court to support either motion for summary judgment based on the substantial evidence rule, and reversed the judgment.</SPAN></P>

The cause was remanded for a trial on appellant gulf oil leaseholder's action for review under the substantial evidence rule.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiff filed suit against defendant car dealer under the Deceptive Trade Practices Act, Tex. Bus. &amp; Com. Code Ann. &sect; 17.41 et seq. (1978) (DTPA). The trial court awarded plaintiff attorney fees and treble damages for mental anguish and replacement parts. On appeal, the court reformed the judgment by denying any recovery for mental anguish, but affirmed the remainder. The court held that damages for mental anguish could not be recovered under DTPA &sect; 17.50 in the absence of physical injury, and that the evidence was factually insufficient to support such an award. Plaintiff failed to prove any damages recoverable under DTPA or at common law. The findings with reference to the odometer were wholly immaterial to any recovery. Plaintiff's trial pleadings did not include any allegation which would have supported the submission of the issues that the defendant's agents actually removed the four-barrel carburetor and substituted a two-barrel device on the car.

In affirming the trial court's decision, the court held the provisions of the city charter were not facially unconstitutional, but were unconstitutional as applied to the factual situation posed in the instant case, i. e., to the manner of preparation and presentation of appellees' petition to appellant. The court explained that, to hold otherwise, would be to impair the right of suffrage by the appellees where there has been no fault or negligence on their part. The court held that the trial court erred in concluding that because the city attorney approved the form of the recall petition prior to its circulation and submission, that appellant was estopped from denying its sufficiency. The court explained that the error in no way affected its obligation to affirm the judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, property owners and deed of trust holder, sought review of the judgment from the 145th Judicial District Court, Nacogdoches County, Texas, which awarded appellee materialman damages under a contractual lien on appellants' property, for labor and materials, pursuant to Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 5452.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee materialman was awarded damages for materials and labor under a contractual lien against appellants, property owners and deed of trust holders, pursuant to Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 5452. The court determined that Tex. Const. art. 16, &sect; 37 provided that mechanics, artisans, and materialmen were entitled to a lien upon the buildings and articles made or repaired by them for the value of their labor thereon or material furnished therefor. However, the court held that appellee had no right to such a lien. Appellee had entered into a contract for materials and labor, but did not complete the work according to the terms of the contract. The court found that appellee's claim to foreclose the lien was improper and appellee had no note to secure the debt. This precluded judgment on the obligation. The court found that appellee's claim of quantum meruit was also improper. Quantum meruit was based on promises implied by law, outside of the contract, and because there was no lien agreed to by the parties, no foreclosure of lien could have occurred. Accordingly, the court reversed the judgment of the trial court and denied recovery to appellee.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>

The court held that appellee's contract with appellants contemplated complete performance, which appellee did not render. Accordingly, there was no contractual lien created that precluded recovery under contract, lien, or quantum meruit.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant city sought review of a judgment of the 86th District Court, Kaufman County, Texas, in favor of appellee landowners in appellee's suit to have certain annexation ordinances declared invalid.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant city, to induce appellee landowners to petition for annexation, agreed to tax appellees' property at a lower rate than property within its limits until such time as the properties were developed and approved. When appellant later began taxing appellees' land at the same rate as property within the city, appellees brought suit to have the annexation ordinance declared invalid. Judgment was for appellees. Appellant sought review, and admitted that those portions of the ordinances providing for a different plan of taxation than other property within its limits were invalid as being in violation of Tex. Const. art. III, &sect; 1, Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 974g, and Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 19, but argued that only the illegal portion need be severed. The court determined that appellant would not have passed the annexation ordinances without the tax limitation provisions. The ordinances, deleted of their unconstitutional provisions, did not represent the purpose and the intent of the city council of appellant at the time of their adoption, and thus they were invalid. Appellant's defense of limitations was not presented to the court below and was thus waived.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment in favor of appellee landowners and against appellant city on appellees' suit to have certain annexation ordinances declared invalid. The ordinances' provision for differing taxation for the annexed property as compared to property within the city limits violated the state constitution, and the ordinances, shorn of their unconstitutional portions, no longer conformed to the intent of appellant's city council.</SPAN></P>

Appellant challenged the standard of proof as being fundamentally erroneous because a federal district court had declared that the code-required standard of proof was unconstitutional and that the proof must be measured by the clear and convincing standard. On appeal, the court rejected appellant's argument. The court held that state courts were not bound by the decisions of the lower federal courts, even though a federal question was involved. The court also held that Texas courts were bound to instruct the jury in a civil case that all factual issues were to be determined by the preponderance of the evidence standard. The court found that the trial court so instructed the jury in this cause and, consequently, there was no error. Accordingly, the court affirmed the judgment of the trial court.</SPAN></P>

Defendant challenged the sufficiency of the evidence supporting the writ, and the constitutionality of the Sequestration Statute,&nbsp;Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 6840.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant justice of the peace heard approximately 400 individual cases involving arrests for picketing violations. The county attorney for appellee El Paso County, Texas failed to appear at any of the scheduled hearings, and appellant dismissed each case in turn. Appellant brought suit for fees of office against appellee for each case under the provisions of Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 1052. The trial court granted summary judgement in favor of appellee and appellant sought review. The court affirmed, holding that appellant's dismissal of the cases did not constitute a &quot;trial&quot; for purposes of the payment of fees to justices of the peace within the meaning of article 1052. The court found that the statute required that the cases had to be tried and disposed of by appellant before he became eligible for the fees. The court also rejected appellant's argument that article 1052 was unconstitutional, on the grounds that appellant did not have standing to question the constitutionality of the statute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, the state credit union commissioner, executed an order that suspended the business operations of appellee credit union after determining that appellee's business affairs were being conducted in an unlawful manner. Appellant took possession of the records, assets, and property of appellee. The trial court issued a temporary injunction to prevent appellant from proceeding with his suspension and removal orders. Appellant petitioned for a stay during the pendency of the appeal of the temporary injunction. The court granted the stay pursuant to Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 1823. Enjoining appellant from proceeding with his orders would permit appellee to resume full business operations. Allowing appellee to resume operations would result in changes in the condition of appellee's accounts because withdrawals would be allowed, liabilities would be incurred, and dividends would be declared. Those business transactions would change or destroy the subject matter of the appeal, which would make it likely that the appeal would be partially moot by the time of its final disposition.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of the judgment of a Dallas County (Texas) District Court, which granted appellees' motion for summary judgment in a cross-action filed by appellant against appellees for wrongful garnishment. Appellant's cross-action had claimed that appellees committed a wrongful garnishment that rendered them liable for damages because they caused his funds to be seized under an unconstitutional statute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellees filed a writ of garnishment before judgment against certain garnishees owing money to appellant. After hearing and before judgment on the merits, the court below granted the writ. Appellant then filed a cross-action for wrongful garnishment. Appellant argued that because appellees caused his funds to be seized under Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 4084 (1966), a statute that had been held unconstitutional, that appellees committed a wrongful garnishment rendering them liable for damages. The trial court granted appellees' motion for summary judgment on the cross action. On appeal, the court held that since art. 4084 was declared unconstitutional prior to the issuance of appellees' writ, that the seizure of the property under the statute was wrongful. The court noted that the court below could not have remedied the constitutional defect by supplying the procedure that the statute failed to provide. After holding that a cause of action arises for actual damages when a garnishment is wrongfully issued, the court reversed and remanded for trial the judgment of the court below.</SPAN></P>

The trial court dismissed the action with prejudice under Tex. Fam. Code Ann. 13.05(a).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner, the natural mother, sued to establish paternity between her minor son and respondent, the alleged father, under Tex. Fam. Code Ann. &sect; 13.02, et seq., (1978). The trial court ordered blood tests for the mother, child and alleged father, and determined from the blood test evidence that respondent was not the father of the child. The case was dismissed with prejudice, Tex. Fam. Code Ann. 13.05(a). Petitioner contended that the court's determination predicated on blood tests was a procedure violative of due process under Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 13. In other words, she contended that Texas had a common law remedy for establishing paternity. The legislature afforded illegitimate children both substantive and procedural due process. Section 13.05(a) was constitutional, and appellant had not been denied either substantive or procedural due process or equal protection. There was no prohibition against the legislature changing the rules by which a common law right may have been established. No one had a vested interest in the rules, themselves, of the common law; and it was within the power of the legislature to change them or entirely repeal them.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed, as art. 5172a afforded no basis for appellant's alleged cause of action because it was unconstitutional and could not be judicially rewritten to render it constitutional. The court found that the unambiguous language of art. 5172a was sexually discriminatory, as it denied to men benefits accorded to women, in violation of Tex. Const. art.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A zoning ordinance regulating off-premise billboards required all existing billboards to either conform to regulations or be removed at the end of a six and a half year amortization period. Plaintiff billboard company challenged the constitutional validity of the ordinance. The court held that the zoning ordinance was valid and enforceable against plaintiff because the provision afforded plaintiff a reasonable opportunity to recoup or recover its investment in structures, where plaintiff could continue to operate the billboards in place and derive revenue therefrom during the amortization period. The court explained that the pertinent factors in determining the reasonableness of the opportunity afforded a billboard company to recoup its investment in the nonconforming use through the amortization period were the amount of its initial investment in the structures, investment realization at the effective date of the ordinance, the life expectancy of the investment, and the existence of lease obligations.

Code Ann. &sect; 15.02(1)(D) (1975) might have been justified if all of the evidence in the case, including appellant's imprisonment, showed a course of conduct which had the effect of endangering the physical or emotional well being of the child. The court held that there was ample evidence for the trial court to have found that a termination of the parent-child relationship would be in the best interests of the child. The court found that Tex. Fam. Code Ann. &sect; 15.02 did not deprive appellant of substantive due process in its failure to specify the degree of harm necessary to invoke the statutory operability.</SPAN></P>

The court held that there was no difficulty establishing paternity and the children in question were the biological children of the decedent. The court also held that Tex. Prob. Code Ann. &sect; 42 was unconstitutional because it violated U.S. Const. amend. XIV in that it treated fathers' illegitimate children differently than legitimate children, but treated mothers' illegitimate children the same as legitimate children, and that appellees did not waive the constitutional issue because courts have adjudicated whether a statute is constitutional when its unconstitutionality was obvious.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Claimant landowner sought review of the decision of a trial court in Bexar County (Texas), which failed to recognize claimant's water right on a particular tract of land. Claimant also raised several issues concerning the constitutionality of the adjudication of the Water Rights Adjudication Act, Tex. Water Code Ann. &sect; 5.301 et seq.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to the Texas' Water Rights Adjudication Act (the Adjudication Act), Tex. Water Code Ann. &sect; 5.301 et seq., claimant landowner obtained water rights to one of his tracts of land after pursuing recognition of same before the Texas Water Rights Commission (Commission) and on appeal to the trial court; but he appealed the trial court's failure to recognize water rights on another tract. Claimant failed to assert water rights to that tract before the Commission. On appeal, the court affirmed the denial of recognition of water rights to claimant on the subject tract. The court noted that, in order to challenge a statute, a litigant must show that it was unconstitutionally detrimental to his situation and to a claimed right he possessed. As claimant had no riparian irrigation right and the court was not authorized to recognize equitable water rights, claimant was not entitled to test the constitutionality of the Adjudication Act. The court also held the state was not estopped to deny irrigation rights due to representations by its agents because estoppel did not run against the state acting in a governmental capacity.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's order failing to recognize a water right on a parcel of land, which recognition claimant landowner had not asserted before the Texas Water Rights Commission nor the trial court, was affirmed because claimant did not demonstrate that he complied with the state law regarding acquisition of an irrigation right and thus he had no vested equitable irrigation right to use water for irrigation purposes.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant city challenged the judgment rendered in the trial court in favor of appellee liquor dealers, that held that appellant's ordinance, City of Wichita Falls, Tex., Ordinance No. 3046 was unconstitutional because the means used to measure appellees' proximity to protected areas varied from Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 666-25a (1976) in violation of Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 1165 (1963). The court affirmed because Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 1165 prohibited any charter amendment or ordinances passed under appellee's charter from containing any provision inconsistent with the Texas Constitution or the general laws of Texas. The court determined that art. 1165 was consistent with Tex. Const. art. 11, &sect; 5 (1955). The court held that appellant's ordinance measured appellees' distance from schools, churches, and public hospitals differently than the method of measurement mandated by the state statute. The court held that the difference in method of measurement rendered the ordinance to have been in variance with the statute and unconstitutional under Tex.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff union sought review of the judgment of the 105th District Court of Kleberg County (Texas), which found that the impasse provisions of The Fire and Police Employee Relations Act (Act), Tex.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant city opted to impose the provisions of The Fire and Police Employee Relations Act (Act), Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 5154c-1, by election and then reached impasse with plaintiff union. Plaintiff brought action under the Act to have the trial court impose a contract, and the trial court declared unconstitutional that required trial court function. Both parties sought review, plaintiff arguing that the Act was constitutional because it set standards for the trial court, and defendant arguing that defendant's election to opt out of the Act was lawful. The court affirmed and ruled that the Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 5153c-1, &sect; 16 guideline for directing the district court's discretion, that compensation and conditions of employment were to be substantially the same as those that prevailed in private sector employment, was too subjective to prevent arbitrary and unequal application of its provisions. The court also affirmed, in the defendant's separate appeal, the trial court's voiding of defendant's election to opt out of the Act because the election was held before a year had elapsed and violated Tex.
