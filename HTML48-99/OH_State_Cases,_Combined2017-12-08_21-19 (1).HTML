</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The driver was arrested for operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol and was offered a chemical sobriety test by the arresting officer. The officer then swore to an affidavit and later testified that the driver refused to submit to the designated test when requested to do so. The officer also testified that the driver was advised of the consequences of refusal. The driver testified that he never remembered being asked to take a test. The driver also argued that because he had pleaded guilty to the charge of operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol, his license could not be suspended under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4511.191. The court disagreed and affirmed the order that suspended the driver's driving privileges. The court held that the burden of proof was the driver to establish that the act that constituted a refusal was not a refusal. The court also held that the fact that the driver pleaded guilty in criminal proceedings to a charge of drunken driving in no way precluded the Registrar of the Bureau of Motor Vehicles from administratively suspending his driver's license pursuant to the implied consent statute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The recipient sought a declaration of his right to receive a special dietary allowance from public assistance funds and an order directed to appellees to provide that special allowance to which the recipient was allegedly entitled pursuant to Ohio Public Assistance Manual &sect; 461.2. The trial court dismissed the recipient's action. On appeal, the court affirmed and held that the recipient was not entitled to declaratory relief because Ohio courts had never held that a money judgment could have been obtained against the State without its consent. The court also ruled the trial court correctly held that it lacked jurisdiction under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 2721.02, 2721.03 to have declared the recipient's constitutional rights regarding the special dietary allowance because the disputed regulation in the Ohio Public Assistance Manual was not a rule under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 119.01, and therefore, the recipient was not entitled to further judicial review. Finally, the court concluded that the recipient's equal protection rights were not violated because the recipient did not purport to represent a class, and there was no invidious discrimination as to disadvantaged minorities.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The taxpayer admitted he failed to file a return or a declaration of tax as required by a city tax ordinance. The commissioner filed criminal charges against the taxpayer. The trial court sustained the taxpayer's demurrer and dismissed the charge based upon the expiration of the 10-year statute of limitations under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 1905.33. The taxpayer filed two actions against the commissioner, and a jury returned a verdict in favor of the taxpayer. The trial court set aside the judgment. In affirming the decision, the court held that the special interrogatory submitted to the jury in response to the claim of malicious prosecution was proper under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2315.16. The commissioner had no duty to offer the taxpayer any help. The conduct of the commissioner was not and could not be malicious. The commissioner did what he was required to do, which was to secure compliance with the law of the city. The trial judge did not commit error in concluding that the answer of the jury, and the evidence adduced, did not create liability against the commissioner. The tax ordinance was a valid enactment and was presumed valid. There could be no claim for false imprisonment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed a judgment from the Common Pleas Court of Huron County (Ohio), which affirmed convictions for violating Monroeville, Ohio, Ordinance 47-12, &sect;&sect; 2 and 29, in that defendant failed to comply with a lawful order of a police officer and failed to produce a driver's license on request of the police officer.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court questioned its own jurisdiction in light of decisional law holding that the amendment of Ohio Const. art. IV, &sect; 4(B), which made no provision for courts of common pleas to review proceedings of municipal courts, deprived the general assembly of power to confer such jurisdiction. Defendant argued that he had a right of appeal to a common pleas court and that he was compelled to stand trial before a mayor who could not be disinterested and impartial. The court held that it had appellate jurisdiction because Ohio Const. art. IV, &sect; 1 vested judicial power in a supreme court, courts of appeal, courts of common pleas, and such other courts as were established by law. Thus, the general assembly could provide for the review of proceedings of inferior courts, which it had the power to create, unless there was a clear prohibition by the constitution. There was no such clear prohibition of the historical review by the common pleas court of proceedings of a mayor's court. Finally, it was so common to vest mayors of villages with inferior judicial functions that the mere union of the executive power and the judicial power in a mayor could not be said to violate due process of law.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants appealed a judgment from the Municipal Court of Franklin County (Ohio), which convicted defendants of disturbance of a lawful assemblage in violation of Ohio Rev. Code &sect; 3761.11.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants engaged in noisy, disruptive conduct at a university commencement, precluding others from listening to the speaker, the U.S. Vice-President. Defendants argued that Ohio Rev. Code &sect; 3761.11 was violative of due process and that &sect; 3761.11, as applied to defendants, constituted an invalid restriction of their right to express anti-war sentiments. The court disagreed. Section 3761.11 was not vague. It prohibited specific activity by specific common language, which could be applied with commonly accepted standards. One could exercise freedom of speech within the limitation of not interfering with the same rights of others. People attending a lawful assemblage should be given the opportunity to listen to ideas without undue interference by others in the exercise of free speech rights. Moreover, the rights of free speech and assembly did not mean that any one with opinions could address a group at any public place and at any time. Conduct by a student, in class or out of it, which for any reason materially disrupted classwork or involved substantial disorder was not immunized by the constitutional guaranty of freedom of speech.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The matter was before the trial court and the bill of exceptions was received by the trial judge, approved, and returned to the clerk the same day. The judgment entry overruling the motion for a new trial was dated and filed with the clerk 14 days before. Therefore, 14 days expired between the entry and the presentation of the bill of exceptions to the trial judge, which was more than the 10 days prescribed for County Courts and less than the 30 days prescribed for Common Pleas Courts. The court held that the legislature had repealed by implication the prior change in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 1901.21 and made the 30 day time limit of Common Pleas Court procedure applicable to Municipal Courts pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2945.65. Thus, the court held that the bill of exceptions was timely filed. As to the merits, the trial court did not err in not determining as a matter of law that the mobile homes in question were structures whose use was incident to the use for agricultural purposes of the land on which they were located. Both mobile homes were used as dwellings. Neither was provided by defendant to entice farm labor or to make available living quarters for farm labor.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed his conviction by the Toledo Municipal Court (Ohio) for an alleged violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2921.05, in that he allegedly cast contempt upon the American flag by wearing one as a cape in which someone else had cut a slit, which was burned in places, and which had a peace button on it.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was arrested in a grocery store wearing the flag as a cape with his head inserted through the slit. Defendant was convicted of casting contempt on the flag, but the court reversed, finding that defendant's form of expression, however distasteful, was constitutionally protected. The court found that the wearing of the flag as a cape did not fall within the wording of the charging affidavit and that portion of &sect; 2921.05 relied upon by the State. Defendant was not charged with exposing a flag upon which was attached or appended a word, figure, mark, or design, which was a distinct and separate offense that was not related to that part of &sect; 2921.05 which referred to &quot;otherwise&quot; casting contempt. Defendant could not be charged for one crime and convicted of an entirely different offense, even where the two offenses were defined and described in one statute.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant claimed that his conviction under &sect; 2904.34 was invalid because part of &sect; 2904.34 was declared unconstitutional. The court held that the conviction was proper. Although part of &sect; 2904.34 was constitutionally invalid, the invalid portion of the statute was severable from the rest of the statute. Therefore, the part of the statute under which defendant was convicted was still valid. The indictment was sufficient because it alleged guilty knowledge (scienter) and guilty purpose (mens rea). Because the statute did not state that specific intent was required, the State did not have to prove specific intent to convict defendant. The State only had to prove defendant's general intent. The search warrant was valid because it was based on information received from a reliable informant corroborated by personal observation of the police officers and by the statement of the victim that defendant performed acts upon her in which he attempted to cause an abortion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The prosecutor raised defendant's other unrelated crimes to show that he used the same gun for the murder. The court held that the convictions were improper. The court reasoned that the prior crimes were too prejudicial and the evidence was cumulative because the gun was already introduced through other testimony. The crimes were not similar acts under Ohio Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2945.59 because none of the objectives in the statute were established by the other crimes. Defendant waived the error regarding the reference to his relationship with black militant groups and the prosecutor's having stated his personal opinions about the case because defendant did not object. The jury was improperly constituted where only people who said that they believed in the death penalty were allowed to be jurors. The court reasoned that all potential jurors should have been asked whether they would have given a death penalty sentence if the law required them to do so as stated in the jury instructions. The prosecutor's statement that the jury had to punish defendant to preserve their way of life was reversible error. The prosecutor's statement that defendant was a hoodlum was justified.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The affidavit in the case charged defendant with a violation of &sect; 132.09(a) in that defendant had in his possession or under his control with the intent to distribute, sell, or exhibit magazines which were obscene, indecent, or lascivious. Defendant owned a small convenience store where he sold magazines. The magazines that were alleged to be obscene contained photographs of nude women with close-ups of their sexual organs. The court reversed the municipal court's judgment. Ordinances which prohibited the possession or sale of obscene materials without reference to guilty knowledge, scienter, or guilty purpose, mens rea, on the part of the accused were unconstitutional. When an ordinance did not clearly make guilty knowledge and guilty purpose elements of the offense, but judicial interpretation made such knowledge and purpose necessary elements, an affidavit that charged the offense solely in the language of the ordinance was insufficient. When the affidavit failed to contain the necessary elements, it was invalid. Even though this issue disposed of the case, the court proceeded to analyze the state of obscenity law in Ohio and determined that the ordinance was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court began its analysis by finding that a license fee could be imposed for regulatory purposes only, not for raising revenue.

The court compared the licensing fee for the location owner of a juke box with the licensing fee for the distributor, and found that the distributor's fees were much greater. However, the amount of police supervision of the owner was substantially greater than the supervision over the distributor. The court found that the ordinance under which defendant was convicted was unconstitutional as a licensing ordinance because it was wholly out of proportion to any burden imposed upon the municipality by the licensed activity, and because it discriminated against one form of activity which bore no greater relation to the evils sought to be prohibited than did other activities which were not licensed.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A city adopted an ordinance requiring the installation of private bathrooms in each multiple housing unit. When the administrator failed to comply with the ordinance, the Commissioner issued a warrant. The administrator was arrested and a hearing was held in the city's police court. The administrator then filed an action for a declaration that the ordinance was unconstitutional. The administrator also sought to enjoin and restrain the Commissioner from proceeding with enforcement of the ordinance or with prosecution. The trial court denied the administrator's petition and dismissed the action. The trial court also denied the administrator's motion for rehearing and a new trial and remanded the case to the municipal court. On appeal, the court deleted the remand. The administrator failed to make the city a party or to serve the attorney general with a copy of the proceeding as required by Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2721.12. Therefore, the trial court properly dismissed the action because it had no authority to render a declaratory judgment on the constitutionality of the ordinance.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The proprietor's employee served alcoholic beverages to a minor in the proprietor's restaurant.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">It was contended that only 676 square feet were needed for one standard self-supporting steel tower but that 8,428 square feet were needed for each &quot;V&quot; shaped aluminum tower with guy wires attached. The landowners argued the utility was condemning far too much of their land unnecessarily. It took 79 acres for a 150-foot wide easement. The jury verdict awarded compensation for land taken and damages to the residue. The landowners valued the whole farm substantially higher and challenged the need for the appropriation. They also appealed certain evidentiary rulings and the jury charge. The court affirmed. The Ohio Constitution provided only that when private property was taken for public use compensation had to be made. The legislature had authority to prescribe the circumstances constituting prima facie evidence of a fact in issue and the rules of evidence and could place the burden of proof where it deemed best. The only manner in which a decision of a grantee of the power of eminent domain to exercise its right of appropriation of private property for public use could be attacked was abuse of discretion by such grantee. There was no prejudicial or constitutional error.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judgment for the utility was affirmed. The landowners had not shown any prejudicial error and they had received a fair trial. There was substantial evidence to support the judgment on the necessity of the appropriation on the amount of land taken.The landowners did not show any lack of necessity or abuse of discretion in making the appropriation. The trial court properly excluded photographs of conditions on other farms in the vicinity.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A policeman attempted to arrest defendant for an assault and battery upon his wife that had ceased by the time the police arrived. Defendant resisted arrest. The court affirmed his convictions for assault and battery and for resisting arrest. The convictions were fully supported by the evidence. The question of credibility as it related to the conflicts of testimony given by defendant and given by his wife and the policeman was a matter for determination by the trial court. The police officers had reasonable cause to believe that defendant was guilty of assault and battery based on the story that the wife told to the police and her appearance. Thus, the arrest for assault and battery was lawful under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2935.03, as amended, and defendant had no right to resist such arrest. The court also held that &sect; 2935.03 was constitutional. However, the court remanded for resentencing because the trial judge failed to comply with Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2947.05, which provided that before sentence was pronounced, defendant had to be informed of the trial court's finding and asked whether he had anything to say as to why judgment should not be pronounced against him.</SPAN></P>

The juvenile court dismissed the mother's motion after determining that it was without jurisdiction to hear the motion. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court ruled that under Ohio Rev.

Under &sect; 2151.38, only the county welfare board could make an application to the juvenile court for termination of custody. The court found that the mother's appeal was not from the order of permanent commitment. The court reasoned that the county welfare board stood in loco parentis to the children and represented their best interests. The court noted that the mother had not petitioned the county welfare board to make an application for change of status in the commitment.

The terms &quot;abuse&quot; and &quot;family&quot; in the ordinance could have been more precise, however they were terms used everyday by people in every walk of life.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The board passed regulations to control how the owners, who lived in an approaching corridor to the airport, used their property. The regulations limited the lighting in the corridor, restricted development to two residences per acre, and limited the height of structures and objects of natural growth. The board claimed that its police powers allowed for the regulations so as to protect the owners from any aircraft accidents and to protect future property owners in the corridor. The court held that the regulations were invalid because they resulted in the taking of property without compensation. The court reasoned that the regulations unconstitutionally restricted property ownership rights, especially in the above airspace, so as to benefit the public in general. The court observed that any threats to the owners' lives resulted from the future development and use of the airport, which was for the public's general use. Thus, the owners' property was being used for the public in general. This use was improper because the owners should not have had to bear the cost of the use for the public.

On appeal he attacked the testimony of the two pharmacists used by the State, the labels on the preparation, and the records kept by the pharmacy, charging that it was all hearsay. The court affirmed the convictions, finding that the testimony of a pharmacist that his knowledge of the contents of the exempt narcotic preparation came from the manufacturer's label was in no sense hearsay. It was a statement of a fact entirely within his own knowledge. It was not excludable as hearsay. As no hearsay problem was presented, no right to confrontation and cross-examination was denied or constitutional right violated. Further, the narcotics register upon which the State relied fell squarely within the category of a business record under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2317.40, as well as meeting the requirements of the narcotics law. The testimony of the pharmacists established it as such.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The church preached that marriage to a divorced person was adultery. The husband argued that because of the advice given by and doctrine taught by the church regarding his prior marriage, his wife left him. The court reversed the judgments. The court found that the only acts committed by the church, its founder, and the school of theology, consisted in publishing their religious beliefs by means of pamphlets and radio broadcasts. The court found that the minister had preached, written a letter to the wife expounding the views of his religion concerning divorce and remarriage, and had talked with her one or more times. The court pointed out, however, that there was no evidence to show that he wrongfully, maliciously, and intentionally enticed, induced, persuaded, and caused the wife to leave her husband. The court stressed that the right to advocate and to disseminate any religious faith, no matter how offensive or ridiculous to others, short of a faith dedicated to the overthrow of the government by force, was guaranteed by the Constitution of the United States and was binding on the states.</SPAN></P>

The city appealed, arguing that that the municipal court erred in holding that the city income tax ordinance did in fact purport to make the tax imposed by it a debt. The court found that the ordinance, and the rules and regulations pursuant thereto, made it clear that the legislative intent was not to provide that the tax imposed should be a debt, but, rather, that the tax imposed should be collectible as a debt.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant workers' compensation claimant challenged the judgment of the Court of Common Pleas of Franklin County (Ohio), which sustained a motion for a directed verdict favorable to defendants, the employer and the industrial commission. The trial court held that the claimant had not, within two years after the date of his injury, made a written notice to the commission as required by Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4123.84.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The claimant, a taxi driver, was injured in an automobile accident. He filed a claim for compensation within two months. The claim remained open. Over two years later, he filed a C-92 for determination of permanent partial disability and modification of award. The claimant argued that the trial court erred in applying &sect; 4123.84, as amended effective December 11, 1967, which added a requirement that notice of specific body parts injured be given. If the claimant was correct, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4123.52, which allowed new evidence to be reviewed for 10 years, would overcome the two-year limitation found in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4123.84. The court found that the claimant's application for modification, filed in 1963, was a pending application at the time the amendment to &sect; 4123.84(A)(1), which became effective on December 11, 1967. The filing of the application for modification was a step in the proceeding that began with the filing of the original claim for benefits. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4123.84(A), as amended December 11, 1967, affected a substantive right; therefore, it only applied to claims for compensation and applications for modification filed after December 11, 1967.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the judgment of the trial court and remanded the cause for determination of the validity of the order appealed thereto.</SPAN></P>

On review, the court held that: (1) under the facts developed in the record, defendant was a delinquent; (2) if defendant committed the same acts as an adult, they would be an felony, therefore, his commitment to the state reformatory was proper; (3) the power of commitment was exclusively within the province of the Ohio legislature, and under state law, defendant had to be committed to the state reformatory because he was over 18 at the time of his trial and commitment; (4) defendant and his guardian had written notice of the specific charge against him, and he was offered the right to counsel and his self-incrimination privileges were observed; and (4) a defect in the arrest or preliminary examination did not preclude the conviction.</SPAN></P>

The zoning authorities recommended denial of the petition and the commissioners, as a board in its legislative capacity, adopted a resolution of denial, thereby retaining the &quot;O&quot; office zone. The property owners filed a declaratory judgment action seeking to have the &quot;O&quot; classification declared unconstitutional as applied to their parcels and asking for a mandatory injunction ordering the commissioners to rezone to &quot;E&quot; retail business. The trial court issued the injunction. On appeal, the court ordered that a judgment for the commissioners be presented. The court concluded that the property owners had completely failed to meet the burden of proof of the commissioners' action's invalidity or to overcome the effect of the commissioners' evidence. The court found it clear that the trial court was without power to enjoin a legislative act and that the commissioners, in acting in a legislative capacity, were not amenable to the Ohio Administrative Appeals Act, Ohio Rev.

The trial court admitted the evidence and convicted defendants of possessing tools with the intent to use them &quot;burglariously.&quot; Defendants appealed, contending that the evidence was acquired as a result of an unreasonable search and that the evidence was insufficient to convict as to the element of intent. On appeal, the court held that the officers acted as any reasonable person would have acted under the same or similar circumstances and that the evidence sustained each essential element of the crime by the requisite degree of proof. The bag to which the crowbars were attached was not the product of search.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was sentenced to the state penitentiary for an indeterminate terms of 10 to 25 years. The trial court overruled his motion for a new trial and, on his notice of appeal, journalized its denial of counsel and refused to provide a transcript and bill of exceptions at public cost. It was the opinion of the trial court that an appeal by defendant would not be in good faith, nor would it be based upon any legitimate claims of error, nor would it be in the interests of justice. On appeal, the court found that while the trial court had lost its right to appoint on the day of sentencing, its lengthy opinion was to be considered. The court held that the trial court's decision was unconstitutional and that defendant was indigent. The court appointed counsel and ordered that defendant be provided, at state expense, with those portions of the trial proceedings as counsel deemed necessary for appeal. The court reasoned that under Douglas, defendant had a constitutional right to counsel on his direct appeal of his judgment of conviction because to deny counsel on appeal to an indigent would seem an invidious discrimination.</SPAN></P>

The homeowners alleged that the waivers they executed were contrary to public policy and void because the waiver denied the homeowners' their right to go to court to contest the illegal sewer tap-in charges. The trial court found that the assessment was illegal, and defendants appealed. The court held that the homeowners' right to sue in court, or to protest the assessment, had already accrued. The waiver was valid because the waiver agreement was supported by consideration and was legally sufficient. The homeowners were not estopped from contesting the sewer assessment because there were virtually no equities, other than the waiver and consent form, favoring defendants. The homeowners did not stand by and enjoy their benefits for a long period without protest, and they did not petition for the improvement. This assessment was made in an illegal manner, completely contrary to the procedure set forth in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 6117.02.</SPAN></P>

After an affidavit was filed alleging defendant violated Ohio Rev.

Code Ann. &sect; 4303.25. The trial court granted the motion and dismissed the charge. On appeal the court reversed, holding that: (1) the prosecutor was permitted to maintain the proceeding to review the judgment because the motion to dismiss the affidavit was the equivalent of a motion to quash, a plea in abatement, or a demurrer; thus it came within an exception to the Euclid rule prohibiting prosecutors from instituting proceedings to review a judgment in a criminal proceeding; and (2) the activity of defendant was violative of the prohibition set forth in the initial sentence of Ohio Rev.

He was unable to make bond, and he was incarcerated in the county jail. Defendant was incarcerated until a verdict was directed discharging him at his trial under a later indictment. Defendant alleged that his 14-month incarceration while awaiting trial amounted to a deprivation of his rights under the Sixth Amendment because the three successive indictments were based on the same facts and incident. On review, the court stated that defendant's rights under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2945.71 were rendered moot by the trial court's decision on the last indictment. The court reasoned that the other two indictments were disposed of within the statutory time limits. In addition, the court found that there was no indication of who caused the delays in trial. The court held that there was no purposeful delay by the prosecution. The court further held that defendant was not deprived of a constitutional right to a speedy trial.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants contended that the trial court should not have stricken their answers to the appropriation petition and proceeded to fix the value of the appropriated property. On review, the court agreed and reversed the judgment below. The court concluded that the action proceeded under two statutes that were unconstitutional:&nbsp;Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 163.08 and 163.09. Those statutes fixed the time for an answer to an appropriation petition and provided that no extension would be granted. The court held, however, that prohibiting an extension to the time to answer a court pleading was an improper invasion by the legislature of the courts' judicial functions. Thus, the trial court's action striking defendants' answers based on the statutory scheme was not sustainable. The court held that the statutes were void as lacking in a requirement of due process of law, an invasion of judicial power by the legislature, and a direct violation of Ohio Const. art.

Eight defendants were convicted of violating &sect; 13.1124, which prohibited unlawful assemblies. On appeal, defendants argued that the ordinance under which they were prosecuted was unconstitutional. The court first noted that freedom of assembly was a constitutionally protected right that could be limited by a local legislative authority through the legitimate use of its police powers. The court also noted that an exercise of police power was valid if it bore a real and substantial relation to the public health, safety, morals or general welfare. The court found the ordinance had constituted an unreasonable exercise of police power by making mere presence in a disorderly assembly sufficient for prosecuting an individual under the ordinance. The court also found the ordinance was unconstitutional because it failed to apprise an individual the conduct proscribed by law. The court concluded that defendants were improperly prosecuted under the ordinance.</SPAN></P>

The quo warranto complaint alleged that the public utility's operation and construction of its power lines was a departure of from the county board's regional land use plan with respect to such power lines.

The public utility further alleged that its ability to organize its power lines was subject only to the regulation by Ohio statutes. The court found the regional land use plan was not formally or legally adopted by the regional planning commission and any action taken by the county board with respect to this plan had no validity.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant sought post-conviction relief from his murder conviction, and the common pleas court denied his request. The court affirmed that ruling and found that many of the alleged grounds for relief were barred by res judicata under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2953.21 et seq. because they had been raised during his unsuccessful direct appeals. In the two remaining grounds, he argued that his right to trial by an impartial jury was denied because all jurors were death-qualified and he contented that the death penalty was unconstitutional because it was cruel and unusual punishment. The court rejected the first point because a juror with a bias in favor of capital punishment was just as unfit to serve on a jury as one who would refuse to vote for the death penalty if properly convinced that the evidence warranted such a vote. In requesting jurors who were opposed to the death penalty, appellant wanted a jury with a prejudice in his favor. The court also rejected his death penalty argument and held that death by electrocution did not violate U.S. Const. amend. VIII or Ohio Const. art. I. &sect; 9.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">When a urine test showed that Butazolidin was in a race winning horse's blood, the Commission suspended appellants' licenses for sixty days for violation of Rule 311 of the Ohio Rules of Racing. Upon review the trial court reversed the Commission's orders, holding that the suspension was not supported by the evidence as required by Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 119.12, and that Rule 311 of the Ohio Rules of Racing was unconstitutional. Upon further review, the court affirmed the trial court's judgment to the extent that the suspension was not appropriate under the facts. The court vacated the trial court's finding that Rule 311 was unconstitutional. The court held that the trial court did not have jurisdiction under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 119.12 to determine the constitutionality of Rule 311 of the Ohio Rules of Racing. The court determined that because there was no evidence that the drug had a direct effect on the horse's racing ability, or that appellants knew the drug had been given to the horse, the application of Rule 311, under the circumstances, was in violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 119.11.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Relator unsuccessful job applicant sought review of a decision of the Common Pleas Court of Franklin County (Ohio), which dismissed a petition of the applicant seeking a writ of mandamus to compel respondent Civil Service Commission of Columbus, to accept his application, and that, incident to such application, the applicant be permitted to compete and engage in a promotional competitive examination for the classified position of fire chief.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The commission issued a public notice of the promotional competitive examination for fire chief, stating that it would be held August 15, 1966, and that applications would be accepted between July 25, 1966, and August 5, 1966. The applicant filed his application on August 2, 1966, and, on the same date, it was rejected by the personnel director because the applicant did not possess the qualification of six months as permanent appointee as fire assistant chief prior to the date of the examination. The commission took no action on relator's application before he filed his mandamus action on August 13, 1966. The trial court dismissed the applicant's petition, and he appealed. The court reversed and held that commission was specially enjoined by law to accept the applicant's application and to permit him to compete in the examination for fire chief. The applicant had no remedy in the ordinary course of law other than mandamus, and as a matter of law the writ of mandamus should have been granted by the trial court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In refusing revivor, the trial court reasoned that Ohio Rev. Code &sect; 2311.31, being a statute of limitations, the notice of the application or proceedings for revivor was not given within the time limitation. The trial court further reasoned that revivor could not have been had against a foreign administrator. On appeal, the court determined that the trial court was in error because both of its reasons were contrary to law. Because the personal injury action, which survived had been commenced in the Ohio trial court, it was in that court that it had to have been revived and the jurisdiction of the action, including proceedings to revive, being in Ohio, the right of revivor had to be determined under the law of Ohio. By consent of defendant to the provisions contained in the statute, which arose from his operation of his automobile in Ohio, jurisdiction had been conferred upon the Ohio courts to proceed against him or his personal representative. There had been no Ohio fiduciary to whom to present a claim. Therefore, the period of limitation for revivor as fixed by Ohio Rev. Code &sect; 2311.31, by reference to Ohio Rev. Code &sect; 2117.06 had never commenced to run under any circumstances.</SPAN></P>

The citizens also had a separate action pending in an effort to enjoin the city from participating in constructing the stadium to be constructed with the proceeds of the bond sale.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The board of county commissions adopted a resolution authorizing the issuance of stadium revenue bonds to pay the cost of building a stadium. The revenues to pay for the principal and interest on the bonds and the stadium property taxes were to be derived from rents under a lease agreement with the city. The city owned the stadium site and was to convey it to the county pursuant to an agreement between the parties. The citizens argued in part that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 133.71 et seq. was unconstitutional because the expense for a taxpayer to participate constituted a violation of due process of law. They also argued that the petition did not comply with the law because one of the specified exhibits was not attached and that the resolution fixing the details of the bonds had some blank spaces. They also claimed that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 133.12 required that the question of issuing bonds had to be voted on in a general election. The court found that the acts and proceedings taken by the city and by the county had not shown any abuse of discretion by the city council or by the board, and that no grounds for sustaining the demurrers were shown.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On appeal, the permit holder contended that the Commission's order was against the manifest weight of the evidence and contrary to law. The court deemed the contentions meritless, as it could not determine from the record whether the Commission excluded any competent evidence from consideration. Further, the Commission properly excluded the evidence proffered by the holder, as it was not newly discovered. The court rejected the holder's argument that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4301.25(A), which permitted the Commission to suspend or revoke any permit for conviction of the holder or his agent or employee for certain violations of the Liquor Control Act or for a felony, denied him the equal protection of the laws. Permits issued under the provisions of the Liquor Control Act were mere licenses that could be revoked or suspended and created no contract or property right. The permit holder assented to the Liquor Control Act's provisions regulating the revocation or suspension of his permits when he applied for them. It was within the sound discretion of the Commission to apply &sect; 4301.25(A) to the holder and suspend his permits upon his agent's conviction for a prohibited sale to a minor.</SPAN></P>

The State appealed in both cases pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 2945.67 to 2945.70. The court dismissed the appeals as of right and overruled the applications for leave to file bills of exceptions. The court concluded that under present constitutional provisions the exercise by appellate courts of their appellate jurisdiction to &quot;review&quot; a judgment or final order of a trial court must always produce, or result in, the affirmance, modification, setting aside, or reversal of that judgment or final order, and thereby must necessarily &quot;affect the judgment of the trial court in said cause.&quot; As Ohio Rev.

The record showed that defendant was not advised by the judge of the municipal court that he had the right to obtain counsel. Defendant argued on appeal that he had a right to counsel and the municipal court had a duty to advise him of that right. The court reversed defendant's conviction after finding that defendant should have been advised that he had the right to obtain counsel. The court stated that in misdemeanor cases indigent defendants were not entitled to be furnished counsel at the expense of the State or municipality. However, pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2937.02 defendant, even though he was charged with a misdemeanor, should have been informed of his right to counsel.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The corporation obtained from fishermen fish taken outside of the State, and distributed in the State perch of lesser size than permitted by Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 1533.63. The corporation contended that &sect; 1533.63 was not applicable to it because it was lawful to take the fish at the place where they were taken and to process them where they were processed. The corporation further contended that the officials' action constituted an unwarranted interference with its property rights, deprived the corporation without due process of law, was an unlawful interference interstate commerce, and that the statute as so applied was unconstitutional. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held &sect; 1533.63 was a conservation measure, and the conservation of natural resources was within the police power of the State as granted by Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 36. The ownership of wild animals, fish and game was in the State, and individual rights therein were limited and subject to police regulation. The State had the power and duty to preserve them for the benefit of all the people. Any relationship to interstate commerce was incidental and inconsequential.</SPAN></P>

Defendant plead not guilty to the charge denying that he knew how the body had gotten there.

Thereafter, it was determined that defendant had committed the crime and he was declared a delinquent child and an order committing defendant to a youth diagnostic center was entered. Defense counsel appealed the judgment and the court affirmed the determination. The court found that the judgment of the juvenile court finding defendant was a delinquent child was not against the manifest weight of the evidence or contrary to law. Contrary to the arguments of defense counsel, the court found that there was no violation of defendant's constitutional rights and no error prejudicial to him. The court found that the procedural statutes governing such procedures were constitutional, protection, not punishment of the delinquent child being the aim, and had not been improperly applied to defendant's case.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed from an order of the trial court (Ohio), which denied her application to take the deposition of a witness in a criminal case. The witness was material, possibly even necessary to defendant's case, and was in military service in South Viet Nam and not amenable to the ordinary subpoena procedures.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In an effort to save a great expenditure of public funds, the trial court directed that the deposition be taken upon interrogatories and denied the application for expenses for taking the actual deposition. Defendant argued that she was deprived of the right of compulsory process to procure the attendance of witnesses in her behalf in violation of Ohio Const. art. I, &sect; 10. The court held that there was no constitutional or statutory authority for taking the testimony of the witness on interrogatory and that defendant was entitled to the issuance of a commission pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2945.50 to have the deposition of the named witness. However, the court held that the statute did not require that counsel be present and it did not preclude the right of the trial court to assign additional or special counsel to defendant for the particular purpose of representing her before the deposition commissioner. Ohio Const. art. I, &sect; 10 simply spelled out the right of the accused to be represented by counsel; it did not require either the accused or the State to be represented at the taking of the deposition by the same counsel assigned to the actual trial of the case.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court modified the trial court's judgment by striking therefrom the requirement that the testimony of the witness be taken on interrogatory. The court reversed the trial court's judgment insofar as it denied the application to take the deposition itself and directed the trial court to issue a commission for the taking of the deposition.</SPAN></P>

It was the admissions made by defendant to the sheriff at that time, while incarcerated in jail, that defendant directed his motion to suppress. The sheriff testified that before he talked to defendant he advised him of his constitutional rights. The trial court overruled the motion. As a general rule, a police officer could not arrest, without a warrant, a person for a misdemeanor, which was not committed in his presence or view. The court held that the legality or illegality of defendant's arrest was not decisive. Assuming, without deciding the question, that defendant's arrest was illegal, the court held that defendant's rights were not prejudiced. The evidence at issue was not physical evidence obtained by a search and seizure under the Fourth Amendment. Rather, the evidence came under the Fifth and Sixth Amendments. The court found that defendant was advised of his constitutional rights and voluntarily gave statements and admissions to the sheriff.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant contended that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4511.251 was unconstitutional. The court disagreed. Even though &sect; 4511.251 provided that a violation of the speed limits was prima facie evidence of drag racing and driving in excess of the speed limit only created a presumption of a violation of the speed limit statute,&nbsp;Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4511.21, the drag racing statute did not create a presumption upon a presumption. Rather, the court held that there was a rational connection between the facts required to be established and the presumption of drag racing upon proof of such facts. However, the evidence did not establish beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant was drag racing rather than overtaking and passing the other vehicle.

Defendant alleged the ordinance was unconstitutional because it was unduly restrictive of personal freedoms of minors, and challenged the provision that prohibited any parent of any child to allow such child to violate said ordinance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was notified by the police that his son was picked up at 3:00 a.m. and charged with breaking and entering into a gas station. Defendant stated he did not know where his son was at the time in question, that his son had left the house to stay overnight at a friend's, and that he did not have permission to be on the streets at 3:00 a.m. The court reversed the conviction. A curfew ordinance that restricted minor children at nighttime could be constitutionally valid if it did not exceed the bounds of reasonableness. Section 583.02 restricted minors during designated nighttime periods, but made exceptions if the minor was accompanied by a parent or had a legitimate excuse, therefore, that part of the ordinance that applied to minors was constitutionally valid. A parent's rights in respect of the care and custody of his minor children were subject to control and regulation by the state. The word &quot;allow&quot; in &sect; 583.02 in reference to whether or not a parent allowed a minor to be out during restricted times required actual or constructive knowledge. Because defendant did not know that his son was violating the curfew ordinance, the judgment was reversed.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed, holding that &sect; 1340.06 was unconstitutional as applied to the brokers. Section 1340.06 was not invalid on the grounds that it discriminated against real estate brokers as a class or prohibited the conduct of the business of dealing in real estate within the City, because it merely attempted to regulate certain advertising incidental to that business. Section 1340.06 was an invalid exercise of the City's police power because the means adopted was not suitable to the end in view; the regulation of the brokers' advertising by means of signs within the City. Section 1340.06 was ineffective because it only punished the placement of signs on property for sale, not the placement of signs on property for rent or lease.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In a criminal trial, defendant sought to take the depositions of certain state witnesses. The trial court announced its intention to allow the depositions. The state sought a writ of prohibition to prevent the taking of the depositions. The court granted the writ. The attendance of the witnesses could be had at the trial. The statute allowing the depositions, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2945.50, exceeded the scope of constitutional right to a deposition. The Ohio Constitution provided for such depositions only where the witness could not be available upon a trial of the merits. The statute, being more lenient than the constitutional mandate, exceeded the scope of the constitution. The court concluded that Ohio Rev.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff appealed an order of the Garfield Heights Municipal Court (Ohio) that granted defendant's motion for costs incurred after defendant offered to confess judgment. Plaintiff's action sought damages for personal injuries arising out of an automobile accident. Pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2311.18, the trial court granted judgment for defendant in the amount paid for the services of a medical witness and a court reporter at trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Prior to trial, defendant offered in open court and in the presence of plaintiff to confess judgment for $ 500, and costs then accrued. Plaintiff, who sought recovery to the extent of $ 7,500 refused the offer. A jury then returned a verdict for defendant. The question on appeal, was whether the allowance of a medical witness and court reporter as costs against plaintiff was authorized by Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2311.18. Plaintiff argued that &quot;costs&quot; within the meaning of the statute was not synonymous with &quot;expenses,&quot; hence the allowance of such expenses of trial incurred after the offer was made was not permissible. The court ruled that the testimony of a medical witness was an essential ingredient to the defense of any personal injury case, and that the employment of a court reporter was equally vital. Taking into account the legislative purpose of imposing the expense of litigation upon the party who persisted in continuing it, the items awarded to defendant here as her costs incurred after the offer was made, being reasonable and necessary in defending plaintiff's claim, were properly allowed by the trial court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the judgment in favor of defendant for the cost of a medical witness and a court reporter.</SPAN></P>

Nevertheless, the city attorney granted the permits to allow the developer to build, within an area zoned as a local business district, a shopping center whose service area was designed to include the population of the entire city as well as people who lived several miles beyond the city. The court, in affirming the trial court's judgment, found that the plan violated the permitted use portion of Barberton, Ohio, Zoning Code &sect; 1163.05(1)(b), which provided that local business district uses were limited to retail stores and services devoted to supplying neighborhood needs. The court rejected the developer's arguments that the ordinance was impermissibly vague because it did not define &quot;neighborhood&quot; and found instead that the ordinary meaning of the term was sufficiently definite and further found that no reasonable construction of the ordinance could be made that included the character of the proposed shopping center and its service area.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On appeal, defendant argued that Ohio Rev.

Defendant also argued that the State failed to prove that he knew that his child was mentally handicapped and that the State failed to show that the child was not adequately provided for, because the child's mother provided the child with necessary food, clothing, and shelter. The court affirmed, concluding that: (1) &sect; 3113.01 in its application to the neglect of a mentally handicapped child, was not invalid for indefiniteness or uncertainty; (2) the trial court's definition of &quot;mentally handicapped&quot;, if anything, required an even greater disability to exist before defendant became criminally liable than was imposed by the statute; and (3) there was no proof that defendant was, because of, lack earnings, inability to secure employment, or physical incapacity, unable to provide the necessary or proper home, care, food, and clothing as prescribed by Ohio Rev.

Respondents filed affirmative defenses.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Relator was appointed to the board for a six-year term at an annual salary of $ 8,400 per year. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 5703.03 provided that members of the board were to be appointed by the Governor with the advice and consent of the Senate. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3.01 provided that a member was entitled to continue to serve until his successor was lawfully appointed and qualified. Relator claimed that he was entitled to continue to serve under &sect; 3.01 because the two appointments made by the Governor since the expiration of his term were not in compliance with Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 5703.03 in that the Senate did not consent. Relator, therefore, sought to continue to serve at the increased salary that had been established by the legislature. The court found that the Senate refused to advise and consent to the Governor's first appointment and failed to advise and consent to the second appointment. Therefore, relator's membership was allowed to rollover. Because he was holding over in the office, the constitutional inhibition against change of salary did not apply where the salary was increased by statute effective during the preceding portion of the appointed term.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellee sought review in the trial court of an ordinance, No. 48-1963, that rezoned certain property. She also appealed a second ordinance, No. 49-1963, which granted a variance to appellant so that the rezoned property could be used as the site of a funeral home. The trial court held that it had jurisdiction to hear the appeal of the first ordinance. It held that the second ordinance was unconstitutional. On appeal by both parties, the court affirmed the judgment as to the first ordinance and reversed as to the second. The trial court should have dismissed the appeal of the first ordinance. The city council's action in adopting the ordinance was a legislative act, and Ohio Rev. Code ch. 2506 did not permit appeals from acts of legislative bodies. However, the granting of a variance was not a legislative act but an administrative function, and it was thus appealable. The ordinance that invested the city council with discretion to grant variances was unconstitutional because it gave the city council power to arbitrarily grant or withhold permits. Because ordinance No. 49-1963 was passed under the authority of the unconstitutional ordinance, it was void.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A city building inspector issued a building permit to the developer for construction of apartment buildings on land that had been annexed by the city. At the time of annexation, the land was subject to a township zoning ordinance that permitted the construction of apartment buildings. After the developer commenced construction, the building inspector revoked the permit on the ground that a city zoning ordinance, &sect; 1131.03 of the Codified Ordinances of the City of Elyria, applied and did not permit the construction of apartment buildings. On appeal of the judgment enjoining defendants from enforcing &sect; 1131.03, the court ruled that &sect; 1131.03 violated Ohio Const. art. XVIII, &sect; 3 insofar as it attempted to zone annexed property in an adjoining township without further legislation subsequent to annexation. The court further ruled that the trial court did not err in finding that the zoning ordinance deprived the developer of his constitutional right to due process and was in conflict with Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 519.18, which provided that zoning regulations of annexed territory remained in effect until the annexing municipality adopted new regulations for such territory.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Urine samples taken from a race horse disclosed a drug, and the trainer was cited to appear before the Commission. At the hearing, the trainer admitted that the horse was administered a penicillin drug prior to the race and was found guilty of violating Rule 259.01, which made the trainer the absolute insurer of the condition of horses entered in a race. The trial court reversed, and the Commission sought review. On appeal, the court reversed and held that the Commission's order was valid even though the Commission did not provide sufficient notice that met the requirements of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 119.07. The trainer was estopped from denying the validity of the order because he agreed to proceed with the hearing. The court also determined that Rule 259.01 was not unreasonable and contrary to law. The court reasoned that the regulation of horse racing was not possible if every rule and regulation was dependent for validity upon the knowledge or motives of the person charged with a violation.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Respondents, the congregation of the Orthodox Jewish religion and the congregation officers, appealed from the judgment of the Mahoning County Common Pleas Court (Ohio) that issued a writ of mandamus ordering disinterment of the bodies of two persons buried in the cemetery owned and operated by the congregation. Relators, next of kin of the persons buried in the cemetery, sought re-interment in a cemetery owned by a Reformed Jewish congregation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The next of kin applied to the congregation for permission to disinter the bodies of the brother and sister. The congregation denied the application and the next of kin obtained writs of mandamus directing disinterment of the bodies. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment, noting that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 517.23 provided for disinterment upon the request of next of kin who paid for the services. The court rejected the congregation's claim that the county court's application of &sect; 517.23 abridged its freedom of religion, in violation of U.S. Const. amend. I, amend. XIV, &sect; 1, and Ohio Const. art. I, &sect; 7. The congregation and the congregation officers failed to satisfy their burden of proving with clear and convincing evidence that the statute was unconstitutional. The religious objections of the owners of the cemetery did not prevent disinterment by next of kin because the objections were not identified as the beliefs and wishes of the decedent who was a member of the Reformed Jewish congregation. The court also found that the congregation did not establish that disinterment violated the religious beliefs of the decedent who was a member of the Orthodox Jewish congregation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">At trial, defendant filed a motion to dismiss, contending that &sect; 2905.30 was void for want of certainty because it did not provide any definition of or standard for determining what might or might not have been an unnatural sex act. The trial court denied defendant's motion to dismiss, and defendant sought review. On appeal, the court reversed and held that the statute was unconstitutional and void because it was totally impossible to define the offense in a manner that accomplished a legitimate legislative purpose. The court noted that neither counsel nor the court was able to find any reported cases or any of the usual sources of legal authority defining the phrase &quot;unnatural sex act.&quot; The court also noted that much authority was available defining such terms as &quot;sexual offenses,&quot; &quot;sexual perverts,&quot; sexually indecent,&quot; &quot;unlawful sexual intercourse,&quot; and &quot;sex perversion,&quot; but none of those phrases fit the statutory offense. Finally, the court examined several types of activity that could have been considered unnatural, including certain types of birth control and artificial insemination, and concluded that the statute certainly did not intend to criminalize these acts.</SPAN></P>

The court, in finding several reversible errors, held that: (1) the trial court erred in determining that double jeopardy precluded bringing charges under two statutes for the same criminal act; (2) the denial of defendant's constitutional and statutory rights to consult an attorney upon arrest was erroneous and prejudicial; (2) the trial court's consideration of plea negotiations to refute defendant's claim of innocence was prejudicial error; (3) the State did not establish venue beyond a reasonable doubt where the application of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2931.19 would have placed venue in another county; and (4) where the victim's blood showed no trace of carbon monoxide, which tended to indicate that the victim was probably dead when defendant started the fire, it could not be said that the State proved death by incineration beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Agents of the Ohio Department of Liquor Control entered the holder's premises and advised her that they were going to confiscate some partial four-fifths bottles of liquor from the back bar of the establishment for the use of the state chemist, who would analyze them for possible refilling. This was done and an analysis was made by the chemist, following which the holder was advised of the charge made against her, which was that she possessed in and upon her premises intoxicating liquor in an original container which had been diluted, refilled, or partially refilled. The Commission found the holder guilty as charged. On appeal, the trial court affirmed the Commission's ruling. The Commission urged that the department was authorized to make the seizure under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4301.10. The court held that the agents of the department did not operate within the authority conferred by the statute, noting that the record was silent as to any reason for the inspection of the holder's premises and the taking of the liquor. Nothing in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4301.10(6) authorized carrying away anything belonging to the holder as a part of the inspection of a place of business.</SPAN></P>

Section 13.0722 attempted to assess a 15 percent penalty, to be added to the cost of making sidewalk repairs by the city, against property owners in cases where they failed to repair their sidewalks after receiving due notice from the city. The trial court ruled that the assessment was invalid and permanently enjoined its levy and assessment against property owners. After that ruling became final, the taxpayers were also awarded attorney fees, which were taxed as court costs to the city. The city appealed the award, but the court affirmed. The taxpayers had brought their action under and by virtue of the authority granted them in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 733.59 because the city's counsel had refused to bring the action. Thus, the trial court, under the authority of &sect; 733.61, had had the discretion to allow reasonable compensation for the taxpayers' attorney to be taxed as costs, given that a judgment had been finally ordered in the taxpayer's favor.</SPAN></P>

Two officers observed patrons purchasing index cards and napkins at the store. There were approximately 22 employees on duty at the time. The complaint against defendant alleged that he suffered and permitted the business to be open on a specified date. The date was a Sunday. The trial court convicted defendant of violating Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3773.24 for conducing business on a Sunday. The court affirmed defendant's conviction. The court found that the complaint against defendant was adequate and valid. The court ruled that the specification of a date that was a Sunday in the complaint was sufficient to charge defendant with the offense. The court also held that the allegation that defendant did &quot;suffer&quot; and &quot;permit&quot; the business to be open was adequate because the terms created no confusion or ambiguity. Moreover, the failure of the complaint to include the words against the peace and dignity of the State was not a fatal defect as the complaint described a crime of the State of Ohio.</SPAN></P>

Appellants claimed that chapter 745 was in conflict with the Revised Code of Ohio and, in addition, was unreasonable, arbitrary, discriminatory and, hence, unconstitutional and void. The court found that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 4503.04(C), 4503.06(A), (J), 3733.07, and 3733.06 purported to vest in the state the sole right to assess a license fee and thereby prohibited the municipality from doing so. Because the state pre-empted the field of taxation as to the licensing of individual house trailers and trailer camps, the city could not impose an occupation or excise tax for the same privilege. Enforcement of chapter 745 of the Ordinances would constitute an interruption with the right of use, prohibited by Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3733.06. The court held that chapter 745 of the Ordinances of the City of Sharonville was an attempt to legislate in a field pre-empted by the state and so in conflict with general law as to render all the provisions thereof unreasonable, arbitrary, and discriminatory, and hence unconstitutional and void.</SPAN></P>

The court also agreed with the decision of the trial court in overruling the motion of defendant to dismiss the charge for the reason that the charge was based upon an unconstitutional statute. Defendant contended that the trial court erred in overruling his motion to dismiss the charge for failure of the State to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant was guilty of permitting the store to be open. The court found that there was no evidence whatever as to what time of day the building was opened, who actually opened it, who ordered it opened, or who the officers and manager were. It was clear that defendant was an assistant manager and did not hold the title of manager, president, or other executive officer. Therefore, the evidence was insufficient.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The City enacted an ordinance No. 235 AC CMS, titled &quot;An Ordinance of the City of Oberlin relating to fair Housing Practices,&quot; which prohibited racial discrimination in selling, leasing, renting, assigning, or otherwise transferring interests in housing.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued that the trial court erred in overruling a motion to suppress the evidence secured on a search warrant issued upon an affidavit, which did not set out the facts upon which the affiant based his belief that illegal things were concealed in the place named in the affidavit. On appeal, the court agreed, holding that Ohio law demanded a recital of facts in the affidavit filed to secure a search warrant sufficient to persuade the judge or magistrate, to whom the request for a search warrant was addressed, that the affiant had sufficient facts at his disposal to establish probable cause, pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2933.23. However, in this situation, the affiant only subscribed to facts based on &quot;information and investigation.&quot; As such, the court held that the affidavit failed to provide sufficient facts to establish probable cause. Thus, defendant made a showing that since the search warrant was based upon a faulty affidavit, the warrant was illegal.

The barber claimed that &sect; 4112.02 deprived him of his constitutional rights, notably under Ohio Const. art. 1, &sect;&sect; 1, 19 and U.S. Const. amend. V, XIV. He argued that to cut the individual's hair would require him to develop new skills and that this would be burdensome and inconvenient and would result in the closing of his shop. The commission placed a cease and desist order against the barber. The trial court later found Ohio Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 4112.02, to be unconstitutional, as applied to the barber, and held that the cease and desist order was a nullity and void. The court reversed the judgment, by holding that the barber could not refuse to serve the individual for any reason which was not applicable alike to all citizens because, when he accepted the privileges afforded by a public license, he had to also accept the obligation to treat all members of the granting authority alike.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A taxpayer alleged that a city ordinance limited and restricted the inherent right to own, sell, lease or otherwise dispose of real property with persons of his choice. When the law director of the city refused to initiate an action to prohibit enforcement of the ordinance, the taxpayer filed suit against the city officials, requesting an injunction prohibiting enforcement of the ordinance. The injunction was denied. On appeal, the court reversed judgment and entered a final order for the taxpayer, stating that Oh. Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 1, 19, gave the right to own and possess property and exercise all privileges bestowed, including the right to sell to one of his own choice or to exercise the right to contract free of any force imposed upon him by governmental authority, except as limited by a proper use of the state's police power exercised for the protection of all of the people. The court held that the ordinance violated due process by eliminating from its provisions the renting or leasing of a housing unit in a single building consisting of not more than four housing units without a justifiable reason for excepting those units from the burden imposed on all other real property.</SPAN></P>

Moreover, in the absence of the court's determination of unconstitutionality, the affidavit would have failed since the facts embodied therein did not constitute a charge under the ordinance. In the affidavit, the only fact alleged was that the corporation refused to erect a fence. It was not alleged that the corporation was owner, operator or tenant of the premises, nor was it alleged that the Safety Director issued a written order to erect the fence. Therefore, sufficient facts were not alleged to constitute an offense under the ordinance.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">An administratrix's decedent was killed when the car in which he was riding was struck at a railroad crossing by a train. She alleged that the railroad was negligent because the train was being operated at 75 miles per hour, which was in excess of the 35 mile per hour limit established under Worthington, Ohio, Ordinance 54-59. The trial judge directed a verdict for the railroad after ruling that the ordinance was unreasonable, unnecessary, discriminating, unconstitutional, and invalid. On appeal the administratrix challenged the ruling that the ordinance was invalid. In reversing the judgment, the court held that the ordinance had to be upheld where its reasonableness was at least debatable. A municipal ordinance regulating the speed of trains through the city was a presumptively valid exercise of the police power, and the burden was on the challenging party to show that it was unreasonable. No substantial interference with interstate commerce was shown where the trains of another railroad travelled at 35 miles an hour while using the same crossing.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Relator, a resident and elector of a city and a candidate for city attorney, filed an action in mandamus against respondent board of elections. Prior to trial, the Secretary of State was made a party. Relator contended that the form of the ballot for the city attorney election did not comply with the election laws, particularly with regard to the location of the write-in space in relation to the title for the contest.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The city attorney's contest was by write-in vote only. The proposed ballot prepared by the board of elections used a voting machine, and the slots for write-in votes and the titles of offices were numbered. However, they were not in direct alignment, and the slots were located approximately 10 inches above the title row. The court found that the ballot was not proper. The city's charter required a blank space below the printed name of each candidate for a write-in vote for each municipal office. However, the charter did not address contests by write-in vote only. The court determined that the state law had to be followed where the city charter was silent. Pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3505.04, if no candidate had been nominated for an office for which an election was to be held, blank spaces had to be provided under the title of the office. Additionally, the court rejected the Secretary of State's contention that he and the board of elections were not legally obligated to conduct a charter municipal election. Under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3501.01, a general election included a regular municipal election, and the statutes regarding elections stated their duties as &quot;shall.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court entered judgment for relator, and the court's mandate was limited to requiring a proper ballot in conformance to the court's opinion in the city attorney's election.</SPAN></P>

At issue was whether mandamus was the proper means to test the validity of the zoning ordinances that restricted the owner's property to residential use.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The owner applied for building permits to construct a retail shopping facility and related parking on his land. Respondents denied the permits and declined to rezone the owner's land to permit such use. The owner sought a writ of mandamus to compel issuance of the permits. Respondents argued that mandamus was not the proper remedy to test the validity of the zoning ordinances. The court agreed, noting that the proper remedy to test the validity of the ordinance was by way of appeal pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. ch. 2506. The court noted that the owner had filed an appeal of the same cause pursuant to the procedures of ch. 2506, thereby demonstrating that mandamus was not his only remedy. The court preferred not to rest its conclusion upon the determination that the owner had another remedy, and examined whether relator would have a right to the relief sought. The court stated that it was the best interest of the entire district, rather than the adaptability of a particular piece of property, that determined the reasonableness of a zoning ordinance. The court concluded that the owner could not prevail on mandamus because there was no evidence that the ordinance was unreasonable.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The district had been zoned for single family residential use for over 40 years without amendment. The village then amended the ordinance to permit the development of a regional shopping center and contended that it benefited the health, welfare, and safety of the district's residents. The landowners contended that the village abused its discretion by passing the amendment to the ordinance and that the amendment constituted invalid spot zoning. The trial court found for the village and the court reversed. The court held that the village abused its discretion in rezoning a tract of land in a residential district for use as a regional shopping center because there was no evidence of any changed condition around the property and the rezoned property would be unavailable for the rezoned use until large public expenditures were made to make the new use practical. The highways and utilities that would serve the shopping center were already overtaxed and required improvements. The zoning amendment constituted invalid spot zoning because zoned classification had not been changed for 40 years and the amendment applied to a single tract of land that was available for residential purposes.</SPAN></P>

Notwithstanding the fact that the Board of Zoning Appeals ordered the commissioner to issue the owner the requested permit, the commissioner refused to issue such. The court determined that the Board of Zoning Appeals lacked the authority to grant the variance because the granting of such constituted an amendment to the use provisions of the ordinance applicable to the owner's property.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant township appealed from Common Pleas Court of Montgomery County (Ohio) judgments for plaintiff landowner in zoning cases seeking a declaratory judgment and an appeal under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2506. The landowner challenged the township's classifying of his premises as single family residential with a lot area of 80,000 square feet. The township argued the judgments were contrary to law and against the manifest weight of evidence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In the declaratory judgment action, the landowner charged that R-1 zoning was unconstitutional because the area requirement was unreasonable as applied to his property. The township contended that the controlling facts had been determined previously and res judicata barred the suit. The court found that the lower court had no authority to proceed under &sect; 2506 and should have dismissed the appeal as the township requested. Without a record before it, it lacked statutory authority to permit introduction of evidence. However, the square foot minimum imposed on the landowner's entire acreage was unreasonable, and that judgment was modified. Giving due weight to flooding, terrain, existing adjacent developments, and factors properly bearing on suitable development, R-1 zoning of a portion of the premises was not unlawful. As modified, that judgment was affirmed. The other judgment was reversed. If, as the landowner claimed, a praecipe was filed and the clerk did not fulfill his obligations, the landowner still had a remedy.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judgment for the landowner was reversed, and the appeal proceedings were dismissed. The declaratory judgment was modified to declare that imposing the 80,000 square foot minimum on the entire acreage was unreasonable but, giving due weight to relevant factors properly bearing on suitable development, R-1 zoning of a portion of the premises was not unlawful. As modified, it was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The owner's property was in a residence zone, and he sought the variance for a commercial use. The owner introduced evidence showing special circumstances that existed in the area where the variance was requested. For example, an area immediately adjacent to the property had been rezoned for commercial use, and the highway upon which the property was located had become one of the most heavily travelled highways in the township. Expert testimony was introduced to show that the special circumstances created a hardship in that the property had substantially less value for a residence use than it would have had in the absence of the special circumstances. The court found that there was no evidence showing that the restriction on the property continued to be a necessary restriction in the public interest. All the evidence tended to show that the literal enforcement of the resolution would have restricted the use of the property without a concomitant benefit to the public. Thus, the restriction was an undue hardship, and the refusal of the variance was an unreasonable exercise of the Board's discretion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The developer filed with the commission a plat of a proposed subdivision, which the commission disapproved, relying on Lorain, Ohio, Ordinance No. 253 (1946) and Lorain, Ohio, Ordinance No. 429 (1955). The developer contended that the ordinances upon which the commission based its refusal to approve the plat of the proposed subdivision were invalid because each of the ordinances was passed without a public hearing and without notice to the public as required by statute. The court found that Ohio Gen. Code &sect; 3586-1 was in effect when the first ordinance was passed and provided that a public hearing was to be held before rules and regulations governing plats and subdivisions were adopted. When the amendment of the first ordinance was adopted, which was known as Lorain, Ohio, Ordinance No. 429, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 711.09 was in effect and also provided that a public hearing was required. Thus, the ordinances were passed by city council contrary to the express terms of the statutes that gave authority to such council to enact legislation on that subject. The legislative action was a nullity because no public hearings had been had.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Municipal Court for the City of Sidney (Ohio), which convicted him of driving while intoxicated under Sidney, Ohio, Ordinance &sect; 731.01.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On appeal, defendant contended that the ordinance under which he was convicted was invalid and unconstitutional, that he was unlawfully deprived of a jury trial, and that the verdict was contrary to law and against the weight of the evidence. Defendant based the unconstitutionality of the ordinance on the ground that it included physical control as a possible statutory offense and Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4511.19 on the same subject no longer included physical control as a possible statutory offense. The court held that the ordinance was not unconstitutional and that it was not in conflict with the state statute. A police ordinance was not in conflict with a general law upon the same subject merely because certain specific acts were declared by the ordinance, which acts were not referred to in the general law. As to the second question, the court held that defendant's contention that he was unlawfully deprived of a jury trial was without merit because he failed to request a jury trial, as required by Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2945.05. As to the third question, the court found that the evidence was of sufficient probative force to sustain the verdict.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Respondent, a city's commissioner of inspections, challenged a judgment of the Common Pleas Court of Butler County (Ohio), which, in relator landowners' mandamus action, ordered the city to issue a building permit for a gas station, finding that the city's zoning ordinances, insofar as they prohibited the erection of a gas station on the landowners' premises, were arbitrary, unreasonable, and beyond the city's zoning power.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The landowners purchased a triangular lot with a house located at a corner of an intersection in the city with the intention of erecting a gas station on it. When they bought it, the land was zoned residential, but the seller was in the process of applying to have it zoned for business. The landowners prosecuted the rezoning application after they acquired the land. The city denied the application to rezone. Appraisers testified that the property was worth more as a business corner and had suffered depreciation as a residence in a commercial area. After the city refused their application for a permit to erect a gas station, the landowners, without applying for a variance, filed for a writ of mandamus. The court held that a city ordinance, which zoned the landowners' property residential because it had a house on it when the land was annexed by the city, was not violative of constitutional rights in general or as applied to the landowners' property. The court further held that even though the land was more suitable for commercial purposes at the time of the landowners' purchase of it, the refusal to rezone it was not a taking without compensation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">One defendant was charged under the City's ordinance with exhibiting for sale and the other with selling an obscene book. The court held first that the City had a right to appeal the order sustaining defendants' demurrers and discharging them. It then held that the ordinance's scienter requirement of &quot;constructive knowledge&quot; of the book's obscene nature did not run afoul of the then current definition of obscenity of the United States Supreme Court. However, the court held that the ordinance violated Ohio Const. art. XVIII, &sect; 3, which authorized municipalities to adopt and enforce within their limits only such local police regulations as were not in conflict with the general laws of the state. The state had a statute that made it a felony to sell or offer for sale an obscene book. The ordinance was worded slightly differently, but defined the same offense. Because the state statute made it a felony, the City had no authority to make it a misdemeanor.</SPAN></P>

The students argued that the enforcement of &sect; 10.22 would enable the Superintendent and Principal to take complete control of a student's activities so far as associations were concerned, thereby denying the parents their responsibility in selecting associations for their children outside school hours and away from school property. The court affirmed the judgment, explaining that rules by a school authority forbidding membership of pupils in so-called Greek-letter fraternities and providing for punishment for violation were valid. The court opined that the Board of Education of the City of Columbus acted within the scope of its statutory and inherent authority in adopting &sect; 10.22; that the provisions of &sect; 10.22 were not unreasonable or arbitrary; and that the enforcement of &sect; 10.22 would not deprive the students of any constitutional rights or natural privileges as citizens or pupils of the public schools.</SPAN></P>

The customers signed an affidavit in the municipal court charging that defendant unlawfully engaged in common labor, or suffered or permitted a building or other place to be open for business on Sunday contrary to Ohio Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was indicted in a single court that described four felonies that he allegedly committed and alleged that he pled guilty to all four, and thus he was brought within the terms of the habitual criminal statutes. The court of common pleas found defendant to be an habitual criminal and sentenced him to life imprisonment. Defendant appealed on questions of law from the judgment, and the court reversed on review. The court held that defendant's motion to quash the indictment should have been granted because the indictment contained defects that were fatal, in that the allegations in the indictment were insufficient. Specifically, it was necessary that the indictment allege that there had been four prior conviction of one or more offenses enumerated in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2961.11, but the court found that no where in the indictment were there allegations of any past or present convictions. The court found that allegations that defendant had plead guilty to certain offenses was not the same as saying he was convicted. Therefore, the court held that the verdict and the judgment were contrary to the weight of the evidence and could not be sustained.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was charged by information with grand larceny. Thereafter, defendant waived his right to counsel and his right to prosecution by indictment and entered a plea of guilty. Defendant subsequently retained counsel, who moved to withdraw defendant's guilty plea and waiver of counsel. The motion was granted and the case proceeded to trial upon the information, whereupon defendant was again convicted. Defendant appealed, arguing that he had an absolute right to withdraw his waiver of his right to be tried by indictment. The court affirmed defendant's conviction. The court found that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2941.021, which permitted the prosecution of an offense where a defendant had affirmatively waived his right to indictment, did not violate the right to an indictment guaranteed by Ohio Const. art. I, &sect; 10. The court found that whether defendant was entitled to withdraw his waiver was a question that was properly addressed to the sound discretion of the trial court. Under the circumstances of the case, the court found that the trial court had not abused its discretion by denying defendant's request to have his case examined by a grand jury.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellee State of Ohio filed an action against appellants, a distributing agency and others, seeking to seek and destroy copies of an obscene book that the agency possessed and intended to distribute for sale. Appellants sought further review after the Court of Common Pleas of Mahoning County (Ohio) granted an injunction against them under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2905.343.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The State sought to seize and destroy copies of an allegedly obscene book that appellants possessed. The lower court issued an injunction barring appellants from distributing the book and granted the State's request to destroy the material. Appellants argued that &sect; 2905.343 was unconstitutional because it deprived them of their right to a trial by jury. They also asserted that the injunction against them was not properly issued. The court rejected their claims. It noted that its review was de novo; it had to consider and decide the action anew, as if the lower court had not previously decided it. Whatever happened in the lower court was irrelevant to the court's determination; it would not decide whether &sect; 2905.343 violated appellants' constitutional rights by not providing a jury trial right in the court below. Appellants did not have a right to a jury trial in the court because that right was not provided in either the Ohio Constitution or any statute. The book had a dominant theme that appealed to the prurient interest. An order allowing seizure and destruction of the obscene material could properly be entered.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court rendered a final judgment of injunction in favor of the State. It ordered appellants to surrender all copies of the book to a county sheriff and directed the sheriff to seize and destroy them.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant operated a junk yard. He was charged with a crime and facts were stipulated by the parties showing that defendant violated Defiance, Ohio, Code of Ordinances &sect; 34.20 by operating the junk yard without first having constructed a fence around it as was required. Defendant was convicted of the offense. He challenged the conviction on the ground that the purpose of the ordinance was to regulate the use of the property solely for esthetic considerations. Reversing, the court held that because the ordinance was based solely on esthetic considerations, it was an unconstitutional exercise of the police power and was, therefore, void. The court stated that when the first two sentences of &sect; 34.20 were read and construed together, it was apparent that the gravamen of the nuisance or the criminal offense was the unsightliness and visibility of the junk or other material stored on the premises, and that if the material was not made visible from the exterior of the premises the operation did not constitute a nuisance and no prohibition against operation then existed.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant taxpayer, a foreign corporation that operated a fleet of trucks carrying freight in interstate commerce, sought review of a decision and final order of the Board of Tax Appeals (Ohio), which affirmed the action of appellee Tax Commissioner with respect to highway use assessments and penalties, as provided in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 5728.01 to 5728.15.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The taxpayer had obtained the necessary highway use permits which were required in cases of tractors, commercial cars, and other vehicles having more than two axles, all of which were subject to the tax. Additionally, the taxpayer also filed quarterly reports showing the number of axles and mileage traveled, which was also required by the Highway Use Tax Law (Ohio). However, the taxpayer failed and refused to pay any part of the tax based upon the use of Ohio highways. In affirming, the court held that there was no merit to the claim that the assessments were void as amounting to a denial of due process and equal protection. The court noted that prior caselaw had established that the Law was, in fact, a valid exercise of the taxing power. Moreover, nowhere in the briefs filed on behalf of the taxpayer was there any argument or authority cited in support of that error in the notice of appeal. The failure to discuss that ground in the briefs amounted to an abandonment of the claim and was in itself a further reason for denying the claimed error. The court concluded by rejecting the challenge to the constitutionality of the bond requirement in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 5728.10.</SPAN></P>

The cases were consolidated before the Board and on review, with other cases decided separately.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In the four cases, there was an assessment and penalty imposed on the taxpayer for each of four different periods in two consecutive calendar years. In each case, the taxpayer filed a petition for reassessment and asserted four grounds why that assessment should be set aside. The taxpayer asserted that the Highway Use Tax Act violated provisions of the United States Constitution, was in conflict with provisions of the Ohio Constitution, that the law was rendered invalid when exemptions to the tax were granted to trucks based in another state that travelled in the state, and that the law was inseparable and rendered inoperative by the issuance of an exemption of any carriers. On rehearing, The commissioner conditionally remitted the penalties if the taxes were paid by a specific date, and otherwise reaffirmed the assessment of the basic tax. On appeal, the court held that: (1) the Board did not have authority to pass upon constitutional questions because the Board was an administrative agency; and (2) no discrimination was shown against the taxpayer as to an exemption for vehicles that carried household goods.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trucking company, which was not domiciled in the State, filed for a refund of highway use taxes paid to the Commissioner. The Board of Tax Appeals affirmed the denial of the trucking company's refund. On appeal, the trucking company claimed that the highway use tax was unconstitutional and violated reciprocity agreements that the State had entered into with a number of other states in which the trucking company operated. The court affirmed the denial of the trucking company's refund request. The court stated that the highway use tax was a legitimate exercise of the State's taxing authority because the tax bore a reasonable relationship for the purpose it was created, it had not impaired interstate commerce, and it was not discriminatory. The court found that the Board properly refused to take judicial notice of the reciprocity agreements that the trucking company claimed exempted it from the highway use tax because the agreements related to states other than the state in which the trucking company was domiciled. The court noted that those agreements that might have applied to the trucking company were not admitted into evidence, and therefore, precluded review by the court.</SPAN></P>

Defendant contended that the judgment was contrary to law and that the ordinance deprived defendant of his rights under the federal and Ohio constitutions and was unconstitutional in its application as it effected defendant's rights. The court held that: (1) the ordinance contained no ascertainable standards of guilt because it depended on varying impressions of juries or factfinders as to what degree or amount of annoyance was required to establish guilt; (2) the ordinance was unconstitutional because the use of the word &quot;annoyance&quot; made the ordinance so vague, indefinite, and uncertain in that there was no standard of guilt and made it impossible for persons of ordinary intelligence to know in advance what their duty was to avoid; and (3) the ordinance was a prohibition and was not a mere regulation where its enforcement would have driven defendant out of his business as a veterinarian and operator of an animal hospital.</SPAN></P>

The trial court found that the Act was unconstitutional and not binding upon the retailer. The court reviewed the history of fair trade legislation and reversed, finding that the clear purpose of the such legislation was to prevent price cutting as inimical to the common good, primarily as to the retail sale of trademarked or trade-named goods at prices below those designated by the owner of the goodwill of the goods. Further, the Act provided conduct that created a contract controlling resale prices. As the obligation on the retailer to maintain fair trade prices was founded on contractual obligations, the Act was within the constitutional powers of the legislature and its provisions violated no constitutional rights of the retailer or others in a like situation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The rule was adopted after a two-hour public hearing attended by the funeral directors and many others. The Board chairman severely limited the time frame for presenting public comment and did not allow some of the funeral directors to finish their comments. At issue in the appeal was the question of whether the Board followed proper procedures in adopting the rule on serving food. The court ruled that it had not and reversed. The new rule was in fact an amendment to an existing rule. The Board failed to follow proper procedure under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 119.03(D) because it did not repeal any former clause. Because the former clause was not repealed, the Board was left with two distinct provisions with the same article and section numbers. Additionally, the Board chairman unreasonably restricted interested persons from exercising their right to make comments on the new rule as require by &sect; 119.03(C). The final order of the Board was also fatally defective because it did not fix any effective date for the rule change. And finally, the Board exceeded its authority under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4717.04 when it adopted the rule.</SPAN></P>

Defendant appealed, arguing, inter alia, that the municipal ordinance was invalid under Ohio Const. art.

Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 4511.19 and 4511.99(B), which imposed a mandatory minimum of three days incarceration for drunk driving. In affirming, the court ruled that judicial precedent provided that a police ordinance was not in conflict with a general law on the same subject merely because different penalties were provided for. Also, a municipality had constitutional authority to legislate in the field of drunk driving. Thus, Toledo, Ohio, Mun. Code &sect; 21-6-9, was valid and constitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner inmate applied for a writ of habeas corpus. The inmate contended that &quot;property of any value&quot; was an essential element of the crime for which he was convicted under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2907.10, and that the mere statement &quot;attempt to steal&quot; in his indictment did not sufficiently allege that element. He also argued that the sixth form of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2941.07 did not authorize the omission of the phrase &quot;or commit a felony.&quot;</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The pertinent portion of the indictment read that: on or about the 19th day of July, 1960, in the night season of said day, in the county and state, the inmate unlawfully attempted to forcibly and maliciously break and enter the offices of a credit union with intent to steal, contrary to the form of the statute in such case made and provided, and against the peace and dignity of the state of Ohio. In denying the application, the court noted that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2907.10 provided that no person could have, in the night season, maliciously and forcibly attempted to break and enter a building with intent to steal property of any value, or with intent to commit a felony. The sixth form of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2941.07 should have been read in the disjunctive, and under the statute either or both phrases, &quot;with intent to steal&quot; or &quot;commit a felony,&quot; might have been used. The phrase, &quot;intent to steal,&quot; in the context of an allegation of malicious and forcible breaking and entering of a building in the night season reasonably imported that the theft would have been of &quot;property of any value.&quot;</SPAN></P>

I, &sect; 9, Ohio Const.&nbsp;art. I, &sect; 14, and Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 28. The court held that Akron, Ohio, Code ch. 25, &sect; 78 was directed to protecting the people under the grant of police power in the field of public safety. The court held that it was unable to say that &sect; 78 had no real or substantial relation to that object, or was, beyond all question, a plain, palpable invasion of rights secured by the Constitution of Ohio. Nor was the court able to conclude that &sect; 78 was arbitrary, discriminatory, capricious, or unreasonable. The court held that it bore a real and substantial relation to the safety of the public, applied to all persons within the proscribed class, and was a reasonable and constitutional enactment. The court further held that because the State of Ohio had not legislated upon the subject of who could possess firearms, &sect; 78 did conflict with general laws such as to make it invalid.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Relator brought an action in mandamus against the commission, praying that a writ of mandamus issue commanding the commission to approve a plat for a tract of approximately 400 acres. Relator desired to plat his property into minimum lots of 20,000 square feet. The approval of the commission was required for the recordation of the plat. Relator contended that the zoning ordinance, which required lots of a minimum size of 80,000 square feet, was an unreasonable and confiscatory exercise of the commission's police power. The township intervened to state that the zoning plan was adopted as part of a comprehensive plan for the entire township, taking into consideration anticipated business development, thoroughfares, water, sewer, school facilities, and topography. The court held that relator had an adequate remedy by way of appeal, as well as declaratory judgment and injunctive relief. Where there was a plain and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law, mandamus would not lie. However, the court also reviewed the record and concluded that relator had no clear right to relief. The control of density of population was a proper zoning objective. The zoning plan was reasonable.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">An owner filed a plat for a tract of land that it sought to develop as an allotment. The zoning authorities approved and recorded the plat, and, shortly thereafter, a contractor was hired to put in roads and install culvert pipes on the tract. While the grading work was in progress, the authorities amended the regulations to require a greater lot width and size in the district where the allotment was located. When a building permit was denied for a lot lacking sufficient width, relators sought mandamus, arguing that the approval of their allotment constituted a nonconforming use. They also contended that retroactive application of the regulations to their lot amounted to an unconstitutional taking. In denying the writ, the court held that the mere approval of an allotment did not constitute a nonconforming use because it did not involve a substantial use of the property. So long as they were not unreasonable or arbitrary, the zoning authorities could validly make changes to the regulations even after an allotment plat was approved and recorded, and the owner was required to conform to those changes.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A county road was located west of the landowner's property. That road intersected with a highway. An adjoining landowner's property became landlocked when the highway became a limited access highway. In appropriation proceedings, the Director proposed to appropriate a strip of land out of a corner of the landowner's property and adjacent to the new highway in order to build a service highway from the adjoining landowner's property. The landowner sought to restrain the Director from raking her land. The trial court dismissed her action. The court affirmed, holding that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 5511.02(3) meant to provide access from areas that were adjacent to, near to, or abutted a limited access highway. If the service highway had to enter the rerouted highway, the whole purpose of the legislature in providing limited access highways would be frustrated. The service road did not have to come from the landlocked premises to the limited access highway. The appropriation was for a public use. A service road was an essential and integral part of the entire limited access highway project.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was accused of selling a child's toy on Sunday in violation of &sect; 3773.24. Upon review, the court observed that the statute, prior to amendment, had been held to be constitutional. The amendments, which became effective July 17, 1959, were merely exceptions to the general prohibition against labor on Sunday. Defendant did attempt to argue that she came within one or more of the exceptions. She claimed that the store that employed her sold sport clothes and accessories, which could have been used in sporting and travel, and thus, all of the store's sales were exempted under the statute. The court concluded that the providing of services and commodities on a Sunday had to be directly incidental to some recreational activity, travel, fair, or entertainment. The court found that because defendant was given the opportunity to establish a defense and did not do so, she was not deprived of her liberty without due process of law.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The controversy concerned the validity of two petitions for annexation that were filed by freeholders to be acted upon by appellees. Appellants claimed that the petitions were invalid under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3505.06 because they included the phrase &quot;for municipal purposes only.&quot; The court disagreed and affirmed the trial court's judgment denying the injunctions sought by appellants, which would have prevented appellees from acting on the petitions. The phrase was not misleading nor inaccurate, because from a practical standpoint, the petitions sought annexation of the territory for municipal purposes only. Section 3505.06 required a ballot to contain a brief title descriptive of the question or issue. That code section did not apply to petitions, however, and the description used on these petitions was not misleading in any event. The only statutory requirements governing petitions were that they be signed by a majority of the adult freeholders residing in the territory; that they contain the name of a person authorized to act as the agent and a full description of the territory and that they be accompanied by an accurate map or plat of the territory sought to be annexed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The property owner applied to the director for a permit to build a gas station on its property. The director refused stating that it would have been contrary to the fire prevention regulations of the City to allow the station to be built. The trial court dismissed the property owner's petition to compel the director to grant it a permit. On appeal, the court reversed. The ordinance of the City provided that as a fire prevention regulation, a gas filling station could not be erected if the land was located within a certain distance from a hospital. The director denied the permit on the ground that it would have been a fire hazard under that ordinance. However, the trial court denied the property owner's request for an injunction on grounds other than that it would be a fire hazard. From the finding of the trial court the property owner struck down the presumption of a fire and explosion hazard under the circumstances of the case, and the applicable ordinance only applied to fire prevention.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The landowner applied to the city for a permit to operate a gas station on his property. The zoning board of appeals then changed the zoning for the area to residential, which included the landowner's property.

The trial court reversed the board's decision and ruled that the change in zoning was unconstitutional. The trial court ordered the commissioner of housing to grant the landowner the permit. On review, the court found that the landowner had a right to challenge the board's decision in the trial court pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code &sect;&sect; 2505.04 to 2505.45. Furthermore, the landowner provided the transcript of proceedings from the board to the trial court as provided by Ohio. Rev. Code &sect; 2506.02. Therefore, the court concluded that the landowner's appeal was perfected. Finally, the court found that pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code &sect; 2506.04 that the trial court had the authority to reverse the board's decision.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued that the municipal court erred in overruling the motion for dismissal because the action was barred after one year from the date of the commission of the offense under the provisions of &sect; 1905.33. The City argued that its ordinance providing for a three-year limitation was not unconstitutional as being in conflict with Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 1905.33 because under the home-rule provision of the Ohio Const. art. XVIII, &sect; 3, it had the power to exercise local self-government and to adopt and enforce rules providing for the collection and enforcement of the city-income tax laws. The court found that the motion to dismiss should have been sustained as the violation of the ordinance occurred more than one year prior to the commencement of the prosecution. Ohio Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The property owners' application for a building permit was denied on the ground that the proposed use was contrary to the village's zoning ordinance, which provided for residential use on the site. The property owners sought a writ of mandamus, and respondents filed a demurrer claiming that the petition did not state a cause of action. The court sustained respondents' demurrer and held that there was an adequate remedy in law available to the property owners, and they were not clearly entitled to the relief that they sought. The court held that appeal from the denial by the zoning board of appeal was possible under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. ch. 2505-2506 and provided an adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law. The court concluded that mandamus was a proper remedy where, under the undisputed facts, it was the clear duty of a government official to have performed the act demanded by a relator. However, the court reasoned that the property owners' land was in an area that was only partially developed with no indication that the legislative judgment as to the property owners' claims was not correct or contrary to the public health, safety, morals, and general welfare of the public.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed a judgment of conviction entered by the Municipal Court of Akron (Ohio), which found defendant guilty of violating Akron, Ohio, Ordinance ch. 24, &sect; 122(a)(41) for parking a vehicle in a no parking zone.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of parking a vehicle in a no parking zone. He contended that (1) &sect; 122(a)(41) violated the Equal Protection Clause of both the state and federal constitutions, because the law discriminated in favor of municipal vehicles; (2) said ordinance amounted to the taking of private property without just compensation; (3) the operation of said ordinance was not impartial, but was unduly oppressive upon individuals and private rights and unreasonable. The court disagreed. The court found that the authority was granted, by Ohio Const. art. XVIII, &sect; 3, to municipalities to adopt and enforce such local police regulations as were not in conflict with general law, if they were not arbitrary, discriminatory, capricious, or unreasonable, and bore a real and substantial relation to the health, safety, morals, or general welfare of the public. The court could not say that the ordinance was unreasonable, so far as it was directed to the expediting of the work of the government. The constitutional prohibition of legislation for the benefit of individuals did not necessarily preclude laws for the benefit of particular classes of individuals, similarly situated.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The gaming device was a pinball machine wired to a metering device which was placed behind the bar in the barkeepers' establishment. In addition to testimony concerning the pinball machine and the electrical meter, there was also evidence offered by investigators of the Department of Liquor Control that they had seen the barmaid pay off a patron who was playing the pinball machine and gave her a score. The barkeepers contended Ohio Board of Liquor Control Regulation 53 was unconstitutionally vague, but the court held that it could not be said that the regulation did not serve as a guide to those persons authorized to sell alcoholic beverages in carrying out statutes against various types of gaming and wagering. The barkeepers also contended the revocation was unwarranted, but the right to modify the penalty imposed by the Board of Liquor Control was not present unless the court found that the order of the Board was not supported by the proper degree of proof. There being evidence of gaming within the barkeepers' premises which was not controverted, the order of the Board was supported by reliable, probative, and substantial evidence and was in accordance with the law.</SPAN></P>

After judgment, the trial court granted the company's request to allow it to introduce proof that it had exhausted its administrative remedies.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The ordinance completely excluded commercial, industrial, and manufacturing use of the company's property. While it seemed to be conceded that the city had refused the company's requests to amend the zoning ordinance regarding the company's property, there was no formal proof that the company had exhausted its administrative remedies. The court said that the trial court's granting of the company's motion to permit such proof was within its discretion and that the city was not prejudiced by proof that its administrative officers had performed their duties. The court stated that the company's declaratory judgment action was not dependent on the absence of any other remedy, that such an action was a more comprehensive remedy, and that declaratory judgment was specifically authorized by statute to have status determined under an ordinance. While the effect of the trial court's judgment was to leave the company's property free of all zoning restrictions, the city had the authority to enact a new and valid zoning ordinance.</SPAN></P>

The Director considered the reasons for refusing consent and, by resolution, set out the urgent necessity for the improvements and his intention to proceed. A certified copy of the resolution was properly served on the city. Within 20 days, the city appealed under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 5521.01. The trial court affirmed the resolution, and the city appealed, contending that the legislation permitting the resolution was unconstitutional and that the resolution was unreasonable and unnecessary. The court disagreed, holding that each step required by law was followed in detail and that the statutes empowering the Director to make the resolution were clearly constitutional. There was an abundance of evidence in the record of sufficient weight to support the trial court's conclusion that the improvements proposed were urgently needed to accommodate the traveling public.</SPAN></P>

The applicant filed an action in injunction and the trial court entered judgment in favor of the applicant. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that the action on review was not started to overthrow or appeal from any order of the board made by the commissioners under &sect; 307.37; it was a direct attack on the power of the board to issue licenses. The court held that &sect; 307.37 gave the board no power, express or implied, to provide for licensing heating contractors. The court held that a permanent injunction might be decreed to prevent the enforcement of an unconstitutional statute. The court held that it found no merit in the contention that the applicant was estopped to question the validity of the licensing measure by applying for his license. The court held that the power of the trial court was sufficient to have enjoined enforcement of &sect; 307.37.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was an employee of a bakery, and made and completed an uninvited call upon a housewife at a residence property, and attempted to persuade her to become a regular customer of the bakery products. The court discharged defendant. The court held that the single act of soliciting orders for bakery products was not a violation of the ordinance. The court explained that &quot;practice&quot; meant an actual performance habitually engaged in, so the practice of doing something could not have been proved by the proof or the admission of one single act. The court noted that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 715.63 and 715.64 conferred a preferential status upon a producer or processor in the sale of his own product whereas the ordinance did not.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The injunctions enjoined appellants from selling at retail any of the products of appellee corporations at prices, which were less than the minimum retail price stipulated by appellees. The court determined that upon the dissolution of the injunction, appellants could have proceeded by way of cross-petition in the injunction action or by the filing of an independent action for damages sustained. The court explained that the court in the case in which the temporary injunction was issued had jurisdiction, upon its dissolution, to determine whether or not the injunction was properly granted. The court noted that when the question whether the injunction should or should not have been granted was raised, the decision could not have been made without the reception of evidence upon request being made therefor. The court concluded that in support of the application to dissolve the injunction, appellants might have shown that they did not violate the provisions of the Ohio Fair Trade Act, Ohio Rev.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The challengers bought their properties with the expectation that the area would remain zoned for residential uses only.

Following public hearings, the zoning commission recommended rejection of the application, but the board of trustees voted to grant the application subject to certain conditions. The common pleas court upheld the board's decision and the challengers appealed. In affirming, the appellate court ruled that the provisions of Ohio Rev.

Code Ann. &sect; 519.12 (1957), because the case was pending before the enactment of the latter provisions. Under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 519.12 (1956), notice of hearings to the challengers by certified mail was not required and they failed to show they were denied due process.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The development company had acquired an interest in a 14-acre tract of land and two adjoining tracts. A zoning ordinance was adopted classifying the land containing the two adjoining tracts as a residential district and prohibited commercial use thereof. The development company erected a shopping center on the 14 acre tract. A driveway was constructed upon the adjoining two tracts of land and used as a means of ingress to and egress from the shopping center. The trial court permanently enjoined the development company from using the driveway for commercial purposes. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that the ordinance was not an unreasonable exercise of police power and did not constitute an unconstitutional taking of private property. The court held that the terms of the city ordinance did impose a residential classification on both tracts of land. The court rejected a contention that the mere use of the tracts for ingress to and egress from the shopping center was not in itself for trade.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant challenged a judgment of the Montgomery County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio), which convicted him of a violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2905.342(B), by his exhibition of a film about nudism. The challenged judgment also ordered him to destroy the film.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was the manager of a drive-in theater, and he gave seven showings of the film, &quot;The Garden of Eden,&quot; which depicted life in a nudist camp. The show was so popular as to create some traffic congestion in the vicinity. There was no evidence that it caused any violence, breach of the peace, violation of law, or the actual threat of any of these things. Defendant was charged with and convicted of violating &sect; 2905.342(B), which prohibited the distribution or exhibition of motion picture films that created a public disorder. Specifically, the showing of a film that advocated the violation of any state or federal criminal laws, so as to create a public disorder, was of a violation of &sect; 2905.342(B). In this regard, defendant was found to have advocated nudism, which was prohibited by Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2905.31. Defendant appealed, and the court reversed. The court held that there was no evidence that defendant created a public disorder by showing the film. The traffic congestion engendered by box office appeal was not a public disorder. Also, the film did not violate &sect; 2905.31, nor without the evil element of obscenity, could it be said to create an urge to violate it.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the judgment of the trial court. Defendant was ordered released, and his film was to be returned.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant contestant challenged an order of the Probate Court of Montgomery County (Ohio) that denied exceptions he filed to the determination of the Ohio inheritance tax on a decedent's estate under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 5731.12. Appellee executor was also a party to the action. The contestant argued that the succession tax statutes, which gave the probate courts executive and judicial duties, were unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court determined that the legislature enacted Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 1.24 as a savings clause, as part of the codification of the Code. The intent of the provision was to construe provisions of the Revised Code that related to sections of the General Code as restatements, and not as new enactments. Thus, the trial court correctly gave Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 5731.12 the same interpretation as the corresponding section of Ohio Gen. Code &sect; 5335 when computing the inheritance tax. Tax statutes were construed in favor of the taxpayer and against the State. However, tax exemption statutes were construed in favor of the State and against the taxpayer. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 5731.21 and Ohio Const. art. IV, &sect; 8 gave the Probate Court jurisdiction to determine inheritance tax maters. The Probate Court properly exercised administrative functions in these ex parte matters and exercised judicial authority in hearing exceptions. The probate judge was not disqualified to make succession tax determinations when his salary as judge was received under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 141.04 and 141.05, and was not for services given in succession tax matters. The court affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Relators, owners and lessees of land, including a realty company, sought a writ of mandamus directing respondents, a city, a board of zoning, building code and fire district appeals of the city, the city commission, a building inspector, a city engineer, and a secretary of the board of zoning appeals, to issue or cause to be issued to the realty company a building permit for the construction of a supermarket.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The front portion of the land was zoned by a city zoning ordinance as retail business, and the rear part was zoned for apartment house use. Respondents argued that the property could have been profitably utilized for the purpose for which it was zoned and that the provisions of the zoning ordinance at issue were reasonable and constitutional. Respondents' claim that relators failed to carry out administrative procedure and that the action was, therefore, prematurely brought was decided against respondents because relators' claims were heard on the merits; therefore, any deviation from administrative procedure or requirements could not have been asserted as a defense in the action. The court held that there was no evidence in the record that would have justified a refusal of relators' request based on traffic problems that may have been created by the proposed supermarket. The court concluded that relators' property, zoned for apartment purposes, was not reasonably available for that purpose and that the restriction as to it was unreasonable and confiscatory.</SPAN></P>

Section 727.01, Revised Code was sufficiently broad to authorize the city council on its own initiative to levy and collect the special assessments.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The State filed a motion for leave to appeal and for permission to file a bill of exceptions from a hearing held in the Municipal Court of Lima (Ohio) relating to criminal charges against defendant. The State claimed that the lower court erred in admitting certain testimony over objection.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The dispositive issue was whether the court could review the lower court's rulings on the admissibility of evidence under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 2945.67 to 2945.70. The court answered that inquiry in the negative. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 2945.67 and 2945.68 authorized the prosecutor to except to a decision, to present a bill of exceptions thereto, and to seek leave to file the bill with the clerk. However, an application by a prosecutor for leave to file a bill of exceptions to a decision in a criminal case before the prosecution was over had to be denied. In the case at bar, defendant had not been indicted or tried when the State's motion was filed. Moreover, the term &quot;decision&quot; as used in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2945.67 had to be construed to apply only to a judgment or final order in order to avoid conflict with Ohio Const. art. IV, &sect; 6, which limited appellate jurisdiction to the review, affirmance, modification, setting aside, or reversal of judgments or final orders. Thus, rulings on the admissibility of evidence were not decisions as so construed and were not reviewable independently of the review of a judgment or final order. As such, the motion was necessarily denied.</SPAN></P>

The applicant contended that the statute violated rights regarding the protection of property and equal protection of the laws and was not uniform in its operation and application. The court on appeal affirmed the trial court's judgment based on its determination that (1) the statutory requirements bore a reasonable and substantial relation to the desired objective of uniform competence of those aspiring to be real estate brokers; (2) the applicant's contention that the statute was arbitrary and discriminatory was without merit because all applicants for the brokers' examination were treated equally without any discriminatory treatment, thereby making the statute uniform in its application and operation; and (3) the coursework requirement was reasonable because the requirements were controlled by the Board that was charged with giving the qualification exam.</SPAN></P>

The landowner claimed that the municipality was barred from levying an income tax on rental income because a state tax was already levied against real estate in the form of a general property tax and the state tax pre-empted the field. Affirming the trial court's judgment in favor of the municipality, the court ruled that the rents received by the landowner were not exempt from the municipal income tax by reason of pre-emption by the State of Ohio because a tax on income was not a tax on property. Noting that municipal corporations had the general power to levy an income tax, the court also determined that there was no reason why the income from property owned by a nonresident located within the municipality could not be taxed exactly the same as it would be if the title were held by a resident.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The city council passed an ordinance appropriating money to cover the expenses of various departments, including the park board. It was stipulated that nothing was appropriated for the operation of the garage by the park board, but that it could use an increase under another code number to pay the expenses of the municipal garage under the control of the city manager. The taxpayer prayed that the members of the city council be ordered to reconstruct its appropriation ordinance so as to make available to the park board a sum sufficient to pay the expense of operating its own garage, either by transferring the amount from the other code number, or by appropriating a like amount from any available source. The court said what the taxpayer sought to do was to control the legislative body of the city and require it to amend legislation enacted by it and to continue in the future to enact similar legislation annually. This could not be done because it was a violation of the separation of powers. But Cincinnati, Ohio, Ordinance &sect; 12-1958, which transferred the park board's automotive equipment to the city manager, was void.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant sought review of a judgment of the Municipal Court of Cleveland (Ohio), which found defendant guilty of carrying concealed weapons in violation of Cleveland, Ohio, Codified Ordinances &sect; 11.2314. Defendant claimed that a pistol locked in a glove compartment of an automobile being owned and operated by defendant, which automobile and revolver were admittedly the property of defendant, did not violate the provisions of the ordinance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was apprehended driving his automobile on a public thoroughfare. Upon stopping defendant, the police officers searched his automobile and found a loaded pistol in a locked glove compartment. The charge of carrying concealed weapons in violation of &sect; 11.2314 was filed against defendant, and, upon trial, the court found defendant guilty and sentence was imposed. The court found that a concealed weapon in a glove compartment of an automobile was within easy reach of defendant and was, therefore, clearly on or about his person. The court held that the words of the ordinance &quot;concealed on or about his person&quot; meant concealed in such proximity to the person as to be convenient of access and within immediate physical reach. The court concluded, however, that the crime of carrying concealed weapons was a felony under Ohio Rev. Code &sect; 2923.01 and could not, therefore, be the subject of a police regulation. The court found that the ordinance attempted to define a criminal act as a misdemeanor in the identical terms as a state statute defining the same act as a felony and was in direct conflict with such state statute and was unconstitutional under Ohio Const. art. XVIII, &sect; 3.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the judgment of the trial court and remanded the case to the municipal court with instructions to institute further proceedings under the proper statute as provided by law.</SPAN></P>

The assessment was based upon the taxpayer's use of Ohio highways and levied under the Ohio Highway Use Tax Law, Ohio Rev. Code &sect;&sect; 5728.01 - 5728.14. The taxpayer contended that the highway use tax was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The taxpayer was an individual who was engaged in the trucking business, wholly within Ohio. The taxpayer's trucks transported bulk freight such as sand, lime and soda ash. The taxpayer filed a highway use tax return but refused to pay the tax due, contending that the Highway Use Tax Law was unconstitutional. The taxpayer argued that the tax was excessive and discriminatory and bore no reasonable relationship to the use of, or cost of construction, maintenance, and operation of the public highways and that it imposed a tax on some vehicles but not others. The court found that the legislative study of the relative effects on highways of the State of the various types of trucks in relation to the number of axles formed a reasonable basis for the tax and that the court's determination of the validity of the tax must confine itself to a determination of whether the tax was discriminatory and bore a reasonable relationship to the purpose for which it was created. The court held that the State had the power to levy a tax upon vehicles as compensation for the use of highways and such power was not barred by the commerce clause nor did it need to be imposed with mathematical exactness.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court reversed and remanded, holding that the attempted inspection of the relator's home was not improper because the inspection was a routine matter, was made during reasonable hours, was primarily for protective and not punitive purposes, and was done in the interest of the general welfare. The inspection contemplated by Dayton, Ohio, Code 18099, &sect; 806.30 was not an unreasonable search within the meaning of the provision prohibiting unreasonable searches and seizures in Ohio Const. art. 1, &sect; 14.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Relators alleged that on the premises was a building, which had been continuously occupied as a residence, and that Lucas County, Ohio, Comprehensive Zoning Plan for Adams Township &sect; 15 A-1 (1956) provided that a certificate of occupancy was required before any occupancy could have taken place on any parcel or in any building. The court determined that the zoning plan did not attempt to regulate an existing nonconforming use except upon discontinuance of a nonconforming use for two years or more, which did not apply to the facts of the case. The court explained that the ground of denial to relators for an occupancy permit therefore stemmed from an erroneous and false premise. The court noted that the lawful nonconforming and continued use of relators could not thereby have been disturbed. The court concluded that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 519.12 and 519.15 did not constitute an adequate remedy at law where a clear right was shown.

The applicant filed a petition for a writ of mandamus directing the city to issue a building permit allowing the applicant to build a filling station on a certain city lot. The applicant's petition for a writ of mandamus was granted. The court held that the ordinance was unreasonable, arbitrary, and void. It held that gasoline was kept and stored in comparative safety in many homes. Further, the city could regulate the presence of inflammable liquids and other combustibles, but could not unqualifiedly prohibit the keeping of boxes, barrels, or other inflammable material upon or in any place within the city. Any prohibition must be of storage in excess of a certain quantity within a certain proximity of specified buildings.</SPAN></P>

On the ground that the verdict was excessive and rendered under the influence of passion and prejudice, the trial court granted a motion for a new trial. Plaintiff appealed, contending that the trial court abused its discretion in granting the motion for a new trial. The court found that the granting of a motion for a new trial was not such a final order as might be reviewed on appeal, unless it clearly appeared that the trial court granting such motion abused its discretion in so doing. Finding that the trial court's action did not fall within the conduct condemned by the law as constituting an abuse of discretion, the court held that the judgment of the trial court was proper. The court held that its judgment could not be governed by its opinion as to whether the verdict was excessive or not or whether it was influenced by passion or prejudice, because its authority extended only to the question of whether the trial court abused its discretion in granting a new trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court held that since the motion for a new trial in the case was filed pursuant to Ohio Rev.

The court held that it was not necessary or proper that it review the record of the proceedings in the trial court during the trial or inquire into the weight and sufficiency of its findings, in determining that a new trial should have been granted. Unless the trial judge, in sustaining the motion for a new trial, was motivated by unreasonable, improper, or arbitrary considerations, he cannot be said to have abused his discretion. The court found that there had been no abuse of discretion, and, therefore, the order of the lower court granting a new trial was not a final order from which the appeal may have been taken to the court.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff State of Ohio appealed a decision by the Court of Common Pleas (Ohio), which affirmed the municipal court's sustaining of defendant drill operator's demurrer and dismissed the State's affidavits. The State filed an action against the operator, charging him with violations of Ohio Rev. Code &sect; 1521.05, for failing to file, within 30 days after a completion of two different water wells, a copy of his log relative to drilling of the wells.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The State argued that the trial court erred in sustaining the demurrer of the defendant to the affidavit charging him with a violation of &sect; 1521.05. The court stated that a fact that this classification might have been disputed or that its effect might have been opposed by argument did not mean that it transgressed constitutional safeguards. The court concluded that, from a consideration of Ohio Rev. Code ch. 1521 in its entirety, it became clear that &sect; 1521.05 was enacted to an end that timely information concerning an underground water supply of the State of Ohio was constantly available and to a further end that a water resources board might have promulgated rules and regulations as were necessary to prevent a pollution and a depletion of subterranean waters. It was likewise clear that &sect; 1521.05 was designed for, and was reasonably related to, a conservation of the State of Ohio's natural resources for a public welfare and that it was violative of neither the Constitution of Ohio nor the Constitution of the United States.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The citizen based her right to the relief sought entirely on her contention that, in denying her a permit and water service at her premises, the city violated the provisions of Ohio Rev.

The court examined the statute and determined that it gave no power to the city that it did not already have under Ohio Const. art. XVIII, &sect; 4. The court also found that the statute imposed a condition or limitation upon the right of the city to contract with others or with noninhabitants of the city in that it limited the price the city was permitted to charge for its services. The court further found that the statute denied the city the chance to contract with property owners abutting the water main involved and forced the city to furnish the service to all who desire it, regardless of the city's facilities or supply.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Motor Vehicle Dealers' and Salesmen's Licensing Board charged a dealer with displaying for sale a truck without having a franchise from the manufacturer, with hiring an unlicensed automobile salesman, and with failing to deliver a certificate of title to a purchaser, all in violations of the Ohio Auto Dealers' and Salesmen's Licensing Act. The court affirmed the trial court's judgments for the dealer and reversed the order of suspension as to the final count. The court ruled that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4517.06, which restricted the dealer's power to advertise, was invalid because it constituted an unlawful prohibition upon the right of a person to follow a lawful industry and created a monopoly by way of special privilege for persons enfranchised by the manufacturers of motor vehicles. The court held that the evidence was insufficient to warrant a conviction and suspension for the dealer's hiring of an unlicensed salesman. The court found that the dealer had delivered a certificate of title to the buyer prior to the filing of the charge, and the dealer could not be convicted of such charge because the findings of the Board were for the violation of another section of the Act.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant landowners challenged decisions of the Court of Common Pleas, Cuyahoga County (Ohio) in cases consolidated for trial, which granted appellant citizen's petition to enjoin the landowners from using the contested property for trailer park purposes in violation of the zoning ordinance of appellant village that went into effect after the landowners purchased the property and denied the landowners' request for injunction against the village.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">At the time the landowners purchased the subject property and began constructing a trailer park, the village had no building or zoning laws prohibiting the use of the land as a trailer park. Thereafter, the village's zoning ordinance went into effect and the landowners' property was zoned as residential. The ordinance provided that no trailer camps could occupy any part of the village. The trial court enjoined the landowners from using the property as a trailer park. On de novo review, the court granted the landowners' request for an injunction against the enforcement of the ordinance and denied the citizen's petition to enjoin the construction of a trailer park. It found that a trailer park was not per se a nuisance and the use of the property for such a purpose was lawful at the time of its purchase and substantial development. Further, considering the rural character of the village, the sparsely settled portion of area where the land was located, and the substantial sums expended for the purchase and development of the land, the retroactive ordinance limiting the use of the land to a single residence did not bear a substantial relationship to public, health, safety, or welfare.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court granted the landowners an injunction against the village, enjoining it from obstructing or interfering with plaintiff in the development and use of their land for a trailer park. It denied the petition of the citizen seeking to enjoin construction of the trailer park.</SPAN></P>

Section 4301.45 provided that upon conviction of the offense the criminal court could order the car sold and the proceeds, after payment of valid liens on the car, would become public money. The owner contended that the criminal proceedings were terminated when he paid the fine and the criminal court had no further jurisdiction over the car. The court disagreed. It held that the criminal court retained jurisdiction to sell the car under the statute, even after its sentence had been carried out. Under the statute, the forfeiture of the car was an incident of the conviction of the owner and the criminal court retained jurisdiction to proceed against it summarily in the criminal proceeding.</SPAN></P>

Because there was nothing in the city charter specifying procedures for enactment of zoning ordinances, the statutory procedure had to be followed.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In a consolidated case, defendants, the City of Columbus, Ohio, and its officials, appealed from judgments of a Court of Common Pleas (Ohio), which found in favor of plaintiffs, the lessors of pinball machines, and permanently enjoined the City from enforcing Columbus, Ohio, Ordinance Nos. 156-53, 157-53, 1615-54. Upon the appeals, the cases were consolidated for retrial by the court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The ordinances prohibited the use and operation of pinball machines. The trial court found that a municipality had no authority to prohibit the use and operation of pinball machines that were designed and utilized only for amusement purposes. Thus, the City was permanently enjoined from interfering with the operation of such games as long as they were not used for gambling. On appeal and retrial, the court held that the lessors failed to show that the ordinances were unreasonable and arbitrary or that they had no real or substantial relation to the morals or general welfare of the people of the City. Accordingly, the ordinances did not violate the Fourteenth Amendment. The testimony of the lessors that the machines did not encourage gambling was insufficient to overcome the City's declaration, which was presumptively true, that such machines did encourage gambling and loitering. The court also found no error in the City's declaration that the lessors' pay machines were readily convertible to free play. Although the first two ordinances were too broad, the invalidity was removed by the third ordinance because it established a standard for licensing and seizure of the machines.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court rendered judgment for the City in each case and remanded the cases to the trial court for execution for costs.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The train engineer claimed that Hamilton, Ohio, Ordinances &sect; 75-7730 violated both the due process and equal protection clauses of the Constitutions of Ohio and the United States. The train engineer also argued that if applied to the railroad, the ordinance would violate the commerce clause of the United States Constitution. The court disagreed. The court held that the ordinance was constitutional. The court found, however, that the trial court erred in denying the engineer's motion for a judgment of acquittal. The court concluded that the activity complained of, although taking place during the prescribed hours, was not unusual and was necessary for the operation of the train. The court held that only such noises as unreasonably disturbed the householders were prohibited. There was no substantial evidence of noises other than those necessarily incident to the normal careful operation of a railroad.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The winery appealed an order affirming the suspension of its liquor permits, in part on the grounds that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4301.13 reached beyond the police power of the state, violated the Due Process clauses of the state and federal constitutions, and contravened the Commerce Clause of the federal constitution. The court affirmed the lower court decision. The highest court in the land had by clear announcements in numerous decisions determined that the states had almost exclusive and unlimited authority in the control and regulation of intoxicating beverages since the adoption of the Twenty-first Amendment, which repealed prohibition. The Twenty-first Amendment subordinated rights under the Commerce Clause to the power of the states to control the traffic of liquor within its borders. Neither the Fifth nor Fourteenth Amendments prohibited governmental regulation for the public welfare, but merely required that the end be accompanied by methods consistent with due process. Further, the legislature, in the exercise of its police power, could delegate authority to the Board of Liquor Control to regulate the traffic and sale of liquor.</SPAN></P>
