<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The charges in each case were similar in nature alleging that the respective individuals, as owners of a rooming house, failed to provide an automatic sprinkler system throughout the subject premises consonant with the requirements of law. The individuals argued that the local city ordinances they are charged under violated N.Y. Exec.

Codes R. &amp; Regs. tit. 9, &sect;&sect; 600 to 1,300, from enacting an ordinance with provisions more restrictive than contained in the Code. The court found that the applicable statutory requirements for automatic sprinklers pertaining to the subject property at the time of the adoption of the Code in 1957, was contained in N.Y. Mult. Resid. Law &sect; 52. That section was not rendered inoperative by adoption of the Code because the latter did not, at the time of its adoption, govern the subject property pursuant to N.Y. Mult. Resid. Law &sect; 329(2). The court also held that the ordinances did not violate N.Y. Const. art. III, &sect; 16 because &sect; 16 was not applicable to local government.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Defendants, as owners of a rooming house, are charged with failing to provide an automatic sprinkler system throughout the subject premises in violation of city ordinances contained in the Municipal Code of the City of Long Beach.  Although a municipality that has adopted the New York State Building Construction Code (Code) ( 9 NYCRR Parts 600-1300) is precluded from enacting an ordinance with provisions more restrictive than those contained in the Code (Executive Law, &sect; 386), the ordinance is nonetheless valid since the subject property is excluded from coverage under the Code (9 NYCRR 701.2 [a]).  The applicable statutory requirements for automatic sprinklers pertaining to the property are&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  instead governed by section 52 of the Multiple Residence Law, which law specifically authorizes more restrictive local ordinances (Multiple Residence Law, &sect; 329, subd. 1).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. In addition, by attempting to incorporate by reference certain compliance standards prepared by a private association, the local ordinances did not violate section 16 of article III of the New York State Constitution since article III only applies to the State Legislature and not to local government. Local government is controlled by article IX of the State Constitution which does not contain restrictions against incorporation by reference in local ordinances.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Accordingly, defendants' motion to dismiss the informations is denied and defendants are found guilty as charged.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Alleging that they had been denied due process because of their loss of good behavior time, relator inmates brought four separate habeas corpus actions against respondent wardens.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The first inmate was charged with inciting to riot, attempted escape, and noncriminal infractions of various prison rules. The second was charged with various infractions, the third was charged with assault, and the fourth was charged with inciting to riot. The court rejected the inmates' argument that they did not know in advance what conduct was prohibited. It stated that all citizens, including inmates, were presumed to know the law; thus, inmates could not escape punishment for the commission of a crime by arguing that they had not been given notice that the commission of a crime violated a prison's rules and regulations. The court held, however, that inmates were entitled to notice of infractions that did not constitute crimes. Applying these principles, the court held that adequate notice was given to the first inmate regarding the noncriminal infractions and that he and the third and fourth inmates were not entitled to advance notice that their criminal infractions were violations of prison rules. As for the second inmate, the court found that his petition was premature in that it was brought too far in advance of his tentative release date.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court dismissed the writs of the four inmates. It granted the second inmate leave to renew his writ within a reasonable time of his tentative release date.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Relators allege that they have been denied due process of law in their loss of &quot;good behavior time&quot;, which was taken away from them by the warden following disciplinary hearings which found them guilty of violating the rules of the institution.  A good time allowance is not granted to an inmate prior to the commencement of his sentence by reason of a procedural practice of the Department of Correctional Services which consists of entering on an inmate's card upon his admission to the institution a &quot;Tentative Expiration Date&quot; which is fixed by subtracting the maximum good time allowance from the maximum sentence. Sections 803 and 804 of the Correction Law and section 70.30 of the Penal Law dictate that good time allowance must be earned after an inmate has demonstrated satisfactory performance or good behavior. Inmates do not have the right to demand or require the allowances authorized by sections 803 and 804.  The Department of Correctional Services has the sole discretion of either granting, denying or withholding good time allowance when said discretion is exercised in accordance with the law.  In the event the department arbitrarily or capriciously denies or withholds&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  earned good time allowance beyond a reasonable time prior to the tentative expiration date inmates may apply to the courts for a review and determination of their claims for earned good time allowance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Although an institution must promulgate rules and regulations so as to give inmates advance notice as to what acts are considered by the institution to be infractions, where the infraction is a crime in violation of the Penal Law, no such advance notice is required since all inmates, even in the absence of all prison rules and regulations, are bound to obey the provisions of the Penal Law, and are presumed to have knowledge and notice that such acts also constitute infractions of prison discipline.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. While inmates are afforded some basic constitutional rights at disciplinary hearings, there is no constitutional right of confrontation and cross-examination, nor is there a right to counsel (see </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Wolff </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">v.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11"> McDonnell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 418 U.S. 539).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. When an inmate is deprived of good time allowance after a hearing conducted long in advance of the tentative release date entered on his record, he has not sustained any loss at that time since no extension to his minimal sentence has occurred. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The execution of the board's decision cannot take effect immediately but must be held in abeyance until the tentative release date. Any writ or article 78 proceeding brought too soon before that date is premature and should be summarily denied with leave to renew at an appropriate date within a reasonable time prior to the tentative release date.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Based upon various grounds discussed above, the writs are denied.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Criminal defendant had prior felony convictions in New York and Connecticut. He was indicted an indictment for criminal sale of a controlled substance in the second degree under N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 220.4(3), criminal possession of a controlled substance in the second degree under N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 220.18(3), and criminal possession of a controlled substance in the sixth degree, N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 220.06(1). Defendant brought an omnibus motion seeking relief from the indictment. Each of the offenses under indictment was committed the same day, and the substance involved in each instance was amphetamines. The court denied defendant's omnibus motion because the legislation represented a proper exercise of the legislature's right to reasonably restrict the right of any class of defendants to plead to reduced criminal charges. The court explained that the mere mention of foreign convictions and imprisonments in the penal law did not contravene N.Y. Const. Art. III &sect; 16 by making the laws of other jurisdictions a part of state law, but merely declared New York's policy to provide enhanced punishment upon proof of such foreign predicates for offenders later convicted in the state.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- second felony drug offenders -- prior felony conviction in another State validly and constitutionally counts as prior felony conviction under New York laws -- mandatory sentences for drug offenders, constitutional -- lesser pleas validly and constitutionally limited.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Connecticut in 1969 defendant was convicted of burglary and sentenced to three to five years; and in New York in 1971 he was again convicted of burglary and was sentenced to four years.  Now in New York in 1974, for an alleged criminal possession and sale on May 14, 1974 of a controlled substance (amphetamine, a stimulant drug), he has been indicted under article 220 of the Penal Law for two class A-II felonies and one class D felony. On the class A-II felony counts, he cannot plead guilty to less than a class A felony the maximum term for which is life imprisonment; and on the class D felony count he cannot plead guilty to anything less than a felony ( CPL 220.10, subd. 6, pars. [a], [b]); and, on any of the three counts, if he is convicted of any felony less than class A, he must be sentenced&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  as a prior felony offender (Penal Law, &sect; 70.06, subd. 1, par.

III, &sect;&sect; 1, 16; also, CPL 400.21, subd. 7, par. [b]).  These statutes do not contravene State and Federal constitutional principles pertaining to equal protection, due process, cruel punishment, ex post facto, or double jeopardy.  Defendant's motion, attacking these statutes as unconstitutional, is denied.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted in a jury trial of first-degree criminal sale of a controlled substance and other charges. Arguing that the sentencing provisions for the sale conviction violated the United States Constitution, he filed a motion to set aside the sale conviction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Under N.Y. Penal Law &sect;&sect; 60.05 and 70.00, first-degree criminal sale of a controlled substance was a class A-I felony that required a mandatory indeterminate sentence with a maximum of life. The court rejected defendant's argument that the punishment violated the Cruel and Unusual Punishment Clause. It stated that because the imposition of the maximum sentence was mandatory, it could not be arbitrarily applied; that the severity of the life maximum was offset by a defendant's eligibility for parole following service of the minimum sentence; that defendant had not shown that a less severe punishment would provide a sufficient deterrent to drug trafficking; and that the present sentencing structure, rather than being rejected by contemporary society, had been prompted by society's demand that strong action be taken against the drug problem. The court then rejected defendant's argument that the statute violated his equal protection rights because it limited plea bargaining. It stated that there was no constitutional right to plea bargaining and that the court could not substitute its judgment for that of the legislature, which had chosen to limit plea negotiations.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A defendant who is charged with criminal sale of a controlled substance in the first degree (a class A-I felony) cannot plea bargain below a class A-III felony, nor may he have the class A felony charge satisfied by a plea to a separate indictment of a lesser charge; and, when he is duly convicted of the class A-I felony, the mandatory sentence is an indeterminate one with a minimum of between 15 and 25 years and a maximum of life; and when thus imprisoned, he may be paroled after serving his minimum sentence but the conditions of the parole are for his lifetime (Penal Law, &sect; 60.05, subd. 1; &sect; 70.00, subd. 2, par, [a]; &sect; 70.00, subd. 3, par.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">One question before the court was whether it had jurisdiction over the claim. The payee contended that the court could not decline jurisdiction over its claim, even in the exercise of discretion, because the causes of action arose in New York in that the checks underlying the dispute were drawn on a New York bank where they were also stopped. However, the checks were executed, delivered, and ultimately indorsed in Colombia, where the stop payment orders were apparently issued to the New York bank. The court found that all of the pertinent transactions relative to liability on the checks took place in Colombia, among residents and citizens of Colombia, including the underlying transaction which led to issuance of the checks. Therefore, the court did not have jurisdiction over claims arising from that transaction.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Three checks, made by a resident of Colombia (South America), and payable to a Colombia resident, and indorsed by said Colombia payee to two Colombia residents, were drawn on a New York bank, and were stopped by the maker.  All these acts occurred in Colombia.  Apparently for purposes of harassment and collection, the Colombia indorsees brought this action on the checks in the New York Supreme Court and there obtained a warrant of attachment&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  upon the maker's funds in the New York bank.  The proper place for this Colombia cause of action by Colombia residents against Colombia residents is Colombia ( CPLR 327).  The New York Supreme Court declines to take jurisdiction.  The court will vacate the attachment, on conditions that the defendant stipulates to accept service of process in an appropriate court in Colombia and waives any applicable Statute of Limitations.  </SPAN></P>

Code &sect; B1-9.0, of an order of respondent New York Commission on Human Rights (commission), which held that all advertisements in the newspaper for employment in the Republic of South Africa had aided and abetted discriminatory acts.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The newspaper was charged with printing advertisements that directly or indirectly expressed limitations, specifications, or discriminations as to race, color, or national origin in violation of &sect; B1-7.0(1)(d). The advertisements cited were for teaching or managerial positions, and they contained no reference to race, color, or creed. The commission held that specification of South Africa as the location of the employment constituted an &quot;expression&quot; of discrimination because the words &quot;South Africa&quot; were understood to be synonymous with white supremacy. The court vacated the order of the commission, which held that the advertisements had aided and abetted discriminatory acts, and which enjoined the newspaper from printing any advertisement seeking employees or employment located in the Republic of South Africa. A perception by New York residents that South Africa discriminated in its hiring practices was not a proper basis for an injunction. By its determination, the commission, in effect, was questioning the employment methods and practices of a foreign government.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff tow truck operators filed a motion for summary judgment in their action to permanently enjoin defendants, town and police department, from enforcing a local law. The tow truck operators argued that the local law was vague and uncertain, arbitrary and capricious, created a monopoly to one class of tow truck operators over another, and that it unlawfully restrained their right to engage in business.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The town passed a law to standardize the operations of tow trucks. The law set up classes of licenses for types of tow truck businesses, an annual fee to obtain the licenses, and established rates and other requirements for tow truck operators to meet to qualify for inclusion on a list that police would call to assist disabled motor vehicles. The tow truck operators filed an action to permanently enjoin the town's enforcement of the law, and the operators then filed a motion for summary judgment. The court granted the motion in part and denied it in part and held that provisions in the law on non-transferability of licenses, non-solicitation of business, license revocation, and requirements that tow trucks be properly equipped were valid. However, provisions establishing rates and prohibiting trucks without licenses from operating in the town were unreasonable, as were requirements that applicants divulge information to the town clerk, that written agreements with auto body shops were necessary for licensees, and that licenses would not be issued to established businesses. The police department was permanently enjoined from maintaining a list of approved tow truck operators.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In the operators' action for a permanent injunction against the implementation of the town's licensing law, the court granted partial summary judgment to the operators and denied it in part. The court permanently enjoined the police department from maintaining a list of approved tow truck operators. The law was invalid as to the establishment of rates. The provisions on -solicitation, non-transferability, and equipment were valid.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Motor vehicles -- regulation of tow-truck operators -- defendant Town of Huntington which enacted local Tow Truck Law requiring licensing of all tow trucks operating within town and also providing for maintenance of approved list of qualified tow truck operators which Suffolk County Police Department must call to remove disabled motor vehicles is permanently enjoined from enforcing those sections of local law declared invalid and void -- since requirements for approved list have been struck down, Suffolk County Police Department is permanently enjoined from maintaining approved list.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Plaintiffs who are engaged in the tow truck business seek to permanently enjoin defendant Town of Huntington from enforcing the town Tow Truck Law (Local Law No. 3-74 of the Town of Huntington) on the ground that such law is unconstitutional and void. Among other things, the law provides for the licensing of all tow vehicles operating in the town, and for inspection, regulation and identification of licensed vehicles.  The law also provides for maintenance of an approved list of tow truck operators which the Suffolk County Police Department must call to remove disabled motor vehicles, and prescribes&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  requirements which must be met before a tow truck operator can qualify for inclusion on the list.  Section 54-4(A) of the law which prohibits the operation of all tow trucks within the town without first obtaining a license from the town clerk is unconstitutional and void since regulation of all licensed tow trucks using the public highways is subject to exclusive control by the State and the town exceeded its authority in enacting this section.  The town is therefore permanently enjoined from enforcing this section.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. In addition, the Town of Huntington is permanently enjoined from enforcing the following sections of Local Law No. 3-74 since they are invalid and void: section 54-4(B)(8) (delegation to Town Clerk of authority to require disclosure of additional information without guidelines or standards); section 54-9(A) (forbidding any person, firm, or corporation to drive on any street or highway within the town for purposes of soliciting tow work); section 54-11 (requiring licensed tow trucker not engaged in automobile body repair work to have a written agreement with an owner of an automobile body shop allowing him to tow vehicles to such establishment for at least one year); &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  sections 54-13 and 54-14 (establishment of maximum rates or charges permitted for a written estimate of the damages to a vehicle and storage charges).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Since the requirements for the approved list have been struck down, the Suffolk County Police Department is permanently enjoined from maintaining an approved list and otherwise implementing the applicable provisions of section 54-15.  </SPAN></P>

The grandmother sought a declaratory judgment that N.Y. Soc. Serv. Law &sect; 371(14) violated the Equal Protection Clause as well as the Social Security Act.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The grandmother, whose seven grandchildren had been placed with her by social services and the family court, was denied assistance from a foster care program under &sect; 371(14) because she was the children's grandmother. The court first stated that other relatives of a child would qualify for aid under the statute, while grandparents were arbitrarily excluded, even though under N.Y. Family Ct. Act &sect; 415 grandparents had no legal obligation to support their grandchildren. Such an distinction, the court stated, violated 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 601 of the Social Security Act and 45 C.F.R. &sect; 233.30, which required that states determine the need for assistance and the amount of assistance on an objective and equitable basis. Holding that N.Y. Soc. Serv. Law &sect; 371(14) was unconstitutional as applied to the grandmother and those similarly situated, the court found that defendants had not shown a compelling governmental for the distinction. Indeed, it stated, without the grandmother providing care for the children, some would likely have to be placed in institutions, costing the state and city more than it would to give the grandmother assistance and contributing to the breakdown of the family.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After a mother abandoned her seven children, they were placed in the care of the maternal grandmother, whose only income was a social security pension.  The grandmother thereupon received &quot;Aid to Dependent Children&quot; (Social Services Law, &sect; 343) amounting to $ 588 a month.  However, she is entitled to be paid, instead, &quot;Aid to Dependent Children-Foster Care&quot; (Social Services Law, &sect; 392) amounting to $ 1,155 a month.  Insofar as the Social Services Law ( &sect; 371, subd. 14) excludes a grandparent from those persons who are entitled to be paid for foster care, said subdivision 14 contravenes the Family Court Act ( &sect; 415), the Social Security Act (U.S. Code, tit. 42, &sect; 601), the Code of Federal Regulations (tit. 45, &sect; 233.20), and the equal protection clause and the due process clause of the State and Federal Constitutions.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant filed a motion to dismiss the indictment against him. He challenged the constitutionality of N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 220.39(1) and asserted that his due process rights, equal protection rights, and safeguards against cruel and unusual punishment were violated by his prosecution under it. The court denied the motion. The court found itself particularly troubled with that aspect of the drug law that mandated the imposition of life sentences for certain drug crimes for all defendants. All mandated sentencing removed the flexibility of making the punishment fit the facts of each individual case and eroded the basic strength from the criminal justice system. However, the court's concerns did not support finding the statute unconstitutional. The standard by which the court determined whether a particular punishment was cruel and unusual was based upon the modern concept of cruelty and unusualness prevailing in society at the time that the question was raised. Considering the seriousness of dealing drugs, the statute's provisions mandating life sentences for sellers was not unconstitutional. Defendant's other claims were meritless. The court denied the motion to dismiss.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court previously imposed a concurrent sentence on defendant under N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 70.25 pursuant to his guilty plea for certain charges. Defendant filed an application contending that the sentence was illegal and must be set aside pursuant to N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 440.20(1), urging that he be resentenced to a conditional or an unconditional discharge in order that the same effect as a concurrent sentence be achieved.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's concurrent sentence was imposed under &sect; 70.25(a). However, since he was sentenced, the department of correctional services had begun to rely on N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 70.30(1), which provided that an indeterminate sentence of imprisonment commenced when the prisoner was received in an institution under the jurisdiction of the state department of correction, to refuse to honor concurrent dispositions of federal prisoners subject to state sentences. Defendant thus argued that the good spirits in which he agreed to plead guilty and in which the court agreed to sentence him would be violated if the relief he requested were not granted. Denying defendant's motion to set aside his sentence under N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 440.20(1), the court held that no constitutional nor statutory barrier prevented the department from refusing to honor concurrent sentences. Thus, when a federal sentence was overturned, a federal prisoner's state sentence would still take full force and effect.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied defendant's motion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- sentence -- State sentence to run concurrently with Federal sentence -- defendant was properly sentenced in State court to indeterminate sentence of seven years to be served concurrently with prior Federal sentences; it is denial of equal protection if prisoners serving sentences in Federal prison may not be sentenced in State court to terms to run concurrently with their sentences -- sentencing provisions (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Penal Law, &sect; 70.20</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">, subd. 1; &sect; 70.30, subd. 1) should not be read to exclude service of concurrent State sentence at Federal institution; Federal prisoners should receive same treatment as State prisoners subject to concurrent sentences.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. While serving three concurrent terms of 15, 10 and 5 years in the Federal penitentiary pursuant to sentences imposed by the Federal court in the Eastern District of New York, defendant was sentenced pursuant to section 70.25 of the Penal Law to an indeterminate term of seven years to be served concurrently with the Federal sentences. Although it was the practice of the County Court of Nassau County to sentence Federal prisoners to State terms&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to be served concurrently with their Federal sentences, the Department of Correctional Services pursuant to a literal interpretation of section 70.30 of the Penal Law adopted the position that State sentences concurrent with Federal sentences could not commence until the prisoner's release from Federal prison and his arrival at an institution under the jurisdiction of the department which has the effect of eliminating the purpose of imposing a concurrent State sentence. Defendant seeks to be resentenced to a conditional or unconditional discharge in order to achieve the same effect as a concurrent sentence. Since prisoners serving indeterminate sentences in State prisons may be sentenced to a concurrent term if later convicted in a State or Federal court and since prisoners serving sentences in Federal prison may be sentenced to a concurrent term if later convicted in Federal court, it is a denial of equal protection if prisoners serving sentences in Federal prison may not be sentenced to terms to run concurrently with their sentences in a State court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. To deny a State court the right to impose concurrent sentences upon Federal prisoners runs contra to the rationale and policy&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of section 70.25 of the Penal Law which is to permit concurrent sentences in every appropriate case.  The insistence upon arrival and custody at State institutions in subdivision 1 of section 70.20 and subdivision 1 of section 70.30 of the Penal Law is grounded upon an intent to allocate responsibilities within the State system and should not be read to exclude service of a concurrent State sentence at a Federal institution.  Federal prisoners should receive the same treatment as State prisoners subject to concurrent sentences. The imposition of defendant's concurrent sentence was proper.  Accordingly, defendant's motion is in all respects denied.  </SPAN></P>

When the statute lowering the minimum age for jury duty became effective on September 1, 1974, the county began to integrate the names of the 18-year-olds to 21-year-olds onto its master list. The court held that the preparation of the jury list by the county followed the procedure and requirements set forth in the Judiciary Law. There was no deliberate exclusion of eligibles in the preparation of the master list.The fact that the jury empaneled to try defendant did not contain jurors of his age group was not proven to be constitutionally prejudicial to him, nor had any evidence been submitted of a probability of unfairness in the prospective actions by the panel.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Pursuant to CPL 270.10, defendant, who is 18 years old, challenged the entire panel of jurors for his pending trial upon misdemeanor charges, on ground that persons between 18 years and 21 years had been excluded from the panel, denying him his right to a trial by his peers and due process of law. The fact that the jury empaneled to try defendant did not contain jurors of his age group was not proven to be constitutionally prejudicial to him, nor has any evidence been submitted by him of a probability of unfairness in the prospective actions by the panel.

Eligible 18-year-olds to 21-year-olds will be incorporated into the over-all roster of jurors and will be on future panels.  Since defendant has not borne the burden of demonstrating that he has been constitutionally deprived of his rights, nor has he shown any substantial prejudice in the drawing and return of the panel of jurors, the challenge to the panel is disallowed.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The publisher produced a bimonthly magazine which it sold to package liquor stores who in turn distributed it without cost to their customers. The Authority issued a bulletin directed to manufacturers and wholesalers of liquor and wine informing them that in the future package stores were permitted to distribute none but &quot;permitted&quot; publications and that a magazine could be so designated when the Authority accepted for filing a &quot;stipulation&quot; signed by the publisher agreeing to the terms of this bulletin. The publisher twice offered its stipulation for filing and was twice rejected. A demand for a hearing was refused. The court held that the proceeding was warranted to compel the Authority to file the stipulation.

Of his omnibus motion requesting relief, only his challenge, under both the federal and New York constitutions, to N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 70.06 and N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 220.10(6)(b) remained for disposition.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged the constitutionality of the sections as they applied to him as a potential second felony offender. He argued that they violated his rights relative to ex post facto laws, double jeopardy, due process, equal protection, and cruel and unusual punishment. Defendant was charged with drug sale and possession offenses which were spelled out under former sections of the criminal statutes which were repealed in 1973. The grand jury which indicted defendant said that he committed the offenses in 1972. The court concluded therefore that neither of the challenged sections had any application to him or to the situation in which he found himself. Clearly then, the court ruled that the laws which defendant challenged had no impact on him. Because the plain truth of the matter was that defendant had no special or personal grievance with these statutes which demanded redress, the court concluded that he lacked the interest which was requisite to standing to question the constitutionality of the statutes. The court added that it was not necessary to wait to for the attorney general to intervene to defend the sections before deciding the challenge.</SPAN></P>

The court found that as the stop was invalid, so was the frisk. The court held that the policeman had no basis for a self-protective frisk for weapons and a frisk for finding evidence was impermissible.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The passenger and driver were in Ohio on a business trip. The passenger decided to extend his stay to complete his business. That evening, the passenger was injured when the driver ran a rental car off the road on the way to dinner. The court dismissed the driver's Ohio Guest Statute defense, but not the Ohio Workmen's Compensation Law defense. Because the passenger and driver were domiciled in New York and the car was registered there, New York law controlled. New York public policy was opposed to the exoneration of liability extended by foreign guest statutes. But questions of fact on whether the employer approved the passenger's decision to extend his stay precluded dismissal of the Workmen's Compensation Law defense. The employer's authorization would connect the trip to the passenger's employment and bring the trip within the course of employment, making workmen's compensation the exclusive remedy.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Plaintiff's employer sent him and a coworker to Ohio, for business reasons, and, although plaintiff's trip was scheduled to be of one day's duration, he elected to extend his stay for an additional day when he found his mission incomplete at the end of the first day.  That evening, he was injured when the car in which his coworker was driving him to dinner ran off the road.

The father was cited to show cause why his consent should not have been dispensed with on the grounds of his abandonment of the children and his loss of civil rights, pursuant to N.Y. Dom. Rel.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The father's civil rights had been suspended during his sentence pursuant to N.Y. Civ. Rights Law &sect; 79(1). N.Y. Dom. Rel. Law &sect; 111 provided in part that, in an adoption proceeding, consent was not required of a parent who had abandoned the child or of a parent who had been deprived of civil rights. The father contended that the language of &sect; 111, which referred to the deprivation of his civil rights, was void for vagueness because it did not specify which civil rights an imprisoned person must be deprived of in order to fall within the operation of &sect; 111. The court ordered that the matter was to be calendared for a hearing on whether the proposed adoption was in the best interest of the children. The court held that &sect; 111 was not in conflict with N.Y. Civ. Rights Law &sect; 79(1) or with the historical development of the New York Civil Rights Law. Further, N.Y. Dom. Rel. Law &sect; 111 was not void for vagueness. There was no violation of due process, equal protection, or the prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment because the United States Constitution did not forbid the selection of an alternative that favored the welfare of the public, and specifically, a child.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was distributing handbills to pedestrians, which contained information that a concert was to be performed. The various prices of admission tickets were displayed on the handbill. No other information appeared on the handbill.

The court found defendant guilty and denied defendant's motion to dismiss the charges. The court held that the United States Constitution imposed no restraint on a government as respecting purely commercial advertising.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- littering -- freedom of speech -- while musical concert represents expression protected by First Amendment, purely commercial advertising leaflets giving time of concert, place, date, names of performers and admission price, are not also protected -- Administrative Code of City of New York (&sect; 755 [2]-7.0, subd. 5), which prohibits distribution in public place of only purely commercial and business advertising matter, does not abridge individual freedoms and is therefore constitutional.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Defendant, while in front of Madison Square Garden, distributed handbills to pedestrians which contained information with respect to a concert and listed its date, time, place, name of performers and admission price.  He was charged with violating subdivision 5 of section 755 (2)-7.0 of the Administrative Code of the City of New York, which&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  prohibits littering and, specifically states &quot;this section is not intended to prevent the lawful distribution of anything other than commercial and business advertising matter.&quot; Upon defendant's motion to have the charge of violating the statute dismissed and to have the statute declared unconstitutional, the motion is denied.  Defendant's leaflets are purely commercial or business advertising, and while a concert represents &quot;speech&quot; protected by the First Amendment, the fact that a concert represents a form of expression does not cause its purely commercial advertising leaflets to be also protected.  By prohibiting such leaflets from being distributed, the city is not preventing the concert from taking place or in any way inhibiting it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The statute is not unconstitutional since a municipality may enact local rules and regulations in the interest of public safety, health, welfare or convenience of its citizenry, so long as the enactments do not abridge the individual liberties to speak, write, print or circulate information or opinions.  The statute, which prohibits only purely commercial and business advertising matter, does not abridge individual freedoms.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant made application to the court for leave to serve a notice of alibi to the state.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was indicted on several counts. The state served an alibi demand on defendant, but he did not respond within the time allowed. Instead, more than six months later, he sought leave to serve a notice of alibi on the state. Defendant offered no excuse for his failure to respond earlier to the demand, but claimed it was crucial to his defense that the alibi witnesses be allowed to testify. Although the state opposed the application, the court granted the state time to serve a new alibi demand and for defendant to respond by service a copy of the notice. It noted that the section under which the demand was served was determined to be unconstitutional because it lacked a reciprocal provision allowing a defendant to discover the identity of the state's alibi rebuttal witness. As such, the alibi demand served by the state was a nullity and defendant was under no obligation to pay it any head.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted the state time to serve a new alibi demand as the prior notice was rendered a nullity when the statute under which it was issued was deemed to be unconstitutional and granted defendant time to respond by serving a notice of alibi on the state.</SPAN></P>

Upon an application by defendant for leave to serve a notice of alibi upon the prosecutor more than six months after defendant was served an alibi demand, even though at the time CPL 250.20 mandated that defendant's notice be served within four days after he was served with demand, the application is granted.  Since section 250.20 was unconstitutional for lack of a reciprocal provision allowing a defendant to discover the identity of the People's alibi rebuttal witnesses, the alibi demand so served was a nullity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.

Defendant also alleged that the prohibition on plea-bargaining violated his due process rights. The trial court denied defendant's motion, holding that life imprisonment in the abstract was neither inherently severe nor excessive and that indeterminate sentences were neither cruel nor unusual. The court also held that potential life sentences for drug crimes were not cruel or unusual, given the attendant violence that often accompanied drug trafficking and the detrimental effect on all areas of life associated with drug abuse. Finally, the court found no due process violation in an anti-plea bargaining clause because the legislature was empowered to restrict the prosecuting attorney in that fashion, and defendants lacked any due process rights to enter plea negotiations.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. A claim that section 65.00 (subd. 1, par. [b]) of the Penal Law, providing for the sentencing of an offender to lifetime probation upon conviction of a drug offense classified as an A-III felony and requiring, as one of the conditions for imposition of such a sentence, that the prosecutor recommend it, transfers an undue amount of the power of punishment to the prosecutor, amounts to a baseless onslaught against prosecutorial discretion and raises no justiciable constitutional issue. Moreover, under the terms of that section, the final decision as to the propriety of lifetime probation rests with the judicial arm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3.  CPL 220.10 (subd. 6, par. [a]), which forecloses a defendant from pleading guilty&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to any lesser offense than a class A felony where the indictment charges him with one of the class A felonies defined in article 220 of the Penal Law, dealing exclusively with drug offenses, does not constitute constitutionally impermissible discrimination in favor of the class of individuals who have been indicted for A-I, A-II, B, C, D and E felonies, drug oriented or not, and against the class of individuals who have been indicted for A-III felonies. The proscription against guilty pleas to lesser offenses where the indictment charges an A-III drug crime rationally promotes the legislative objective of deterring drug abuse and traffic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. No justiciable constitutional issue is raised by a claim of inequality in plea bargaining rights based upon the fact that a criminal action may be commenced either by an indictment or by the filing of a felony complaint in an inferior court.  While CPL 180.50 permits a Judge of an inferior court, with the consent of the prosecutor, to reduce or convert a felony complaint to one charging a nonfelony offense, that section is not a plea bargaining statute but is designed to take care of the case where the charge of any felony is unwarranted.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff the State of New York filed an action complaining that defendant landowners were constructing a driveway through wetlands, in violation of N.Y.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowners argued that since they did not need a permit under N.Y. Envtl. Conserv. Law &sect; 15-0505 this was tantamount to one having been issued prior to the enactment of N.Y. Envtl. Conserv. Law &sect; 25-0202; therefore, they were not barred by &sect; 25-0202 from constructing the driveway. The court noted however that &sect; 25-0202 provided that if one had a permit under &sect; 15-0505, one could alter the marsh. As the landowners did not have a permit, the court ruled that &sect; 25-0202 controlled. The landowners also argued that the town was not subject to the general controls of the State over its wetlands because of early patents. The court maintained, however, that the State's general regulatory powers applied to all lands within the county whether proprietary or not. The court rejected the landowners' argument that the state was not a proper party. The court held that the landowners should follow procedures set forth in &sect; 25-0202 including a hardship hearing before the commissioner, in order to bring a claim alleging that the statute was unconstitutional. The court finally rejected the landowners' argument that the State's complaint failed to state a cause of action.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A criminal defendant, indicted on numerous counts related to sexual assaults on children, moved to dismiss his indictment. The trial court denied his motion, holding that defendant lacked standing to argue that the gender-based protection scheme of N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 260.10 was unconstitutional since he was not affected by that scheme. The court found that the indictment adequately set out violations of N.Y. Penal Law &sect;&sect; 260.10 and 195.00 since it tracked those statutes, and that any complaint defendant had over the lack of specificity was best cured via a bill of particulars. The court further found that the indictments were not subject to dismissal under N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 135.05 since validity of the victims' written consent was in dispute. The court held that double jeopardy did not bar both unlawful imprisonment and child endangerment charges, since the elements of the crimes were different. Finally, the court held that the trial court did not err in joining multiple charges and victims given the commonality in the evidence and the allegations.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- joinder of offenses -- District Attorney is properly charged, in one indictment, with 29 counts of official misconduct, 16 counts of endangering welfare of children, 29 counts of unlawful imprisonment, 8 counts of criminal possession of forged instruments, 2 counts of forgery, and 1 count of assault -- no double jeopardy -- allegations are sufficiently concise and precise -- violation of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Penal Law ( &sect; 195.00</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">) is properly alleged in disjunctive -- allegation of &quot;without consent&quot; includes consents which were obtained by intimidation or deception (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Penal Law, &sect; 135.00</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">, subd. 1) -- </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Penal Law ( </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">&sect; 260.10</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">, subd. 1</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">) is constitutional.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The Penal Law ( &sect; 260.10, subd. 1) validly and constitutionally provides that &quot;A person is guilty of endangering the welfare of a child when: 1. He knowingly acts in a manner likely to be injurious to the physical, mental or moral welfare of a male child less than sixteen years old or a female child less than seventeen years old&quot;.  The equal protection clause of the Federal and State Constitutions applies to the rights of the children, not the offender's. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  2. The indictment properly and concisely ( CPL 200.50, subd. 7) uses the above statute's words, plus the following: &quot;by physically restraining, binding and gagging said child; and, to these words, one of the counts properly adds &quot;and exhibiting to her photographs, written material and moving pictures which were sexually stimulating.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The indictment further charges, properly so in the disjunctive words of the Penal Law ( &sect; 195.00), that the defendant, while he was the District Attorney, did, &quot;with intent to obtain a benefit </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">or</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to injure or deprive another person of a benefit&quot;, commit acts &quot;relating to his office but constituting an unauthorized exercise of his official functions, knowing that such&quot; acts were &quot;unauthorized&quot; (Penal Law, &sect; 195.00, subd. 1), in that, under pretense of official authority, he did restrain one, etc., and in that he used an official letter and subpoena for a specified purpose which was wholly outside the scope of his functions as District Attorney.  These allegations are sufficient ( CPL 200.50, subd. 7, and 210.25, subd. 1).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The indictment further properly charges that the defendant committed the crime of unlawful imprisonment in the second degree&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  (Penal Law, &sect; 135.00, subd. 1; &sect; 135.05; cf.  CPL 200.50, subd. 7, and 210.25, subd. 1) &quot;by confining her limbs and body without her consent and with knowledge that such restriction was unlawful&quot;.  If a child over 16 signed a written consent through &quot;intimidation or deception&quot;, then she was indeed &quot;confined 'without consent'&quot; (Penal Law, &sect; 135.00, subd. 1).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Even if the charges of unlawful imprisonment and endangering the welfare of children are proved at the trial by much the same acts or conduct, the two crimes &quot;have substantially different elements&quot; ( CPL 40.20, subd. 2, pars. [a], [b]) and hence the defendant will not be in double jeopardy for the same crime (cf. Penal Law, &sect; 260.10, subd. 2, and &sect; 120.10).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. The indictment against defendant properly contains 29 counts of official misconduct (Penal Law, &sect; 195.00), 29 counts of unlawful imprisonment in the second degree (Penal Law, &sect; 135.05), 16 counts of endangering the welfare of children (Penal Law, &sect; 260.10), 8 counts of criminal possession of forged instruments in the third degree (Penal Law, &sect; 170.20), 2 counts of forgery in the third degree (Penal Law, &sect; 170.05), and 1 count of assault in the third degree&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  (Penal Law, &sect; 120.00).  These 85 counts are properly joined in one indictment ( CPL 200.20, subd. 2; CPL 40.10).  </SPAN></P>

The court held that: (1) there were no constitutional rights or privileges to prevent a state from compelling a person suspected of driving while intoxicated to submit to a blood test; (2) a person was not entitled to Miranda warnings prior to the extraction of his blood; (3) because the statute equated a refusal with guilt by revoking the driver's license and expressed a strong policy to protect the public from the threat of drunken driving, there was no compelling reason to forbid comment on a person's refusal to take a blood test; and (4) to forbid comment upon such a refusal unduly restricted the legislative intent and unnecessarily prevented the use of competent and probative evidence.</SPAN></P>

At defendant's trial, the prosecution pursuant to subdivision 2 of section 1194 of the Vehicle and Traffic Law sought to introduce evidence of this refusal, but the trial court declaring that part of the statute permitting introduction of such evidence unconstitutional, would not allow such evidence introduced and&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  dismissed the information.  There are no constitutional rights or privileges preventing a State from compelling a person suspected of driving while intoxicated to submit to a blood test, and furthermore a person is not entitled to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Miranda</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> warnings prior to the extraction of blood. Consequently, since there is no constitutional right to refuse to submit to such a test, it necessarly follows that there can be no constitutional prohibition to prevent comment upon the accused's failure to take the test.  The defendant's right of refusal is not a constitutional right but rather is a qualified statutory right whereby the defendant as well as the police is able to avoid the unpleasantness connected with adminstering a blood test on an unwilling subject.  Accordingly, the lower court's ruling is erroneous and the trial order of dismissal is reversed.  </SPAN></P>

The court stated that it would be unconstitutional to subject defendants to criminal liability due to the commissioner's unpublished determination that adjacent lands included any lands within 300 feet of the high tide line. Although the statute created a means whereby actions such as those engaged in by defendants could be proscribed and made a violation of law, the Commissioner of Environmental Conservation failed to file a document with the Secretary of State for publication, which would have made the acts unlawful.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The juvenile was convicted of misdemeanor sexual abuse, and the maximum sentence for this offense was one year in prison. However, because the juvenile was a youth, he was given a reformatory sentence having a maximum of four years. Subsequently, reformatory sentences were abolished by 1974 N.Y.

The juvenile was not a felon and was a misdemeanant who had already served more than the year in prison that he could have received as an adult.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged the constitutionality of N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 70.06 known as the Rockefeller Law, which provided for mandatory minimum State prison sentences for any one convicted of a felony in New York who, within ten years of the present offense, had been convicted of a felony in New York or any other jurisdiction. Defendant entered a plea of guilty to the crime of attempted bribery, a class E felony, and conceded that he had been previously convicted in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York of a felonious conspiracy to violate the Federal narcotics laws. The court held that the application of the Rockefeller Law violated New York Const. art. III, &sect;&sect; 1, 16 in that it improperly delegated legislative power to the legislatures of other jurisdictions and incorporated by reference the laws of those jurisdictions which would not be felonies in New York.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Penal Law ( &sect; 70.06, subd. 1, par. [b], cl.

In 1973 defendant allegedly committed attempted bribery, a class E felony, to which he has now pleaded guilty.  The presentence report reveals that, prior thereto, he was convicted in the United States District Court of a felonious conspiracy to violate the Federal narcotics laws (U. S. Code, tit. 21, former &sect;&sect; 173, 174) for which he was incarcerated for seven years.

The father argued that &sect; 4-1.2 was unconstitutional based on the facts because it deprived him, as an acknowledged father, of equal protection. The court held that the father was entitled to letters, along with the mother, because application specifically of N.Y. Est. Powers &amp; Trusts Law &sect; 4-1.2(a)(2)(b) to the father's case would be a denial of his constitutional rights as the proven father.

The application of EPTL 4-1.2 which allows a father of an illegitimate decedent to receive letters of administration provided an order of filiation declaring paternity is made in a proceeding instituted &quot;within two years of the child's birth&quot;, to the particular facts would constitute a denial of the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  constitutional rights of the father.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The school sought a declaratory judgment that respondents' regulation, N.Y. Comp. Codes R. &amp; Regs. tit. 8, &sect; 65.6, was null and void. The school argued that the legislature intended that it be allowed to independently establish the necessary criteria for programs conducted in and for continuing education in the podiatry profession. The school contended that N.Y. Educ. Law &sect; 7004(9) did not require their program to be approved by respondents. Respondents argued that all the continuing education programs for the podiatry profession were subject to their approval. The court agreed and dismissed the school's petition. The court concluded that &sect; 7004(9) clearly required that respondents approve all continuing education programs. The court determined that if the school's interpretation were accepted the statute would have been an unconstitutional delegation of governmental powers.</SPAN></P>

The truancy provisions and the procedure for enforcing them were attacked through motions to dismiss, but the court found the laws constitutional and held that the legislature could reasonably have believed that New York's compulsory education laws, as applied by the courts, aided the class of individuals they were intended to benefit. They therefore were a constitutional exercise of the state's parens patriae power. The use of the certified attendance transcripts was also allowed as a hearsay exception for evidence with such reliable and probative value.

Defendant filed a motion to dismiss the count that accused him of the criminal sale of a controlled substance and argued that the mandatory minimum penalty was unconstitutional. In the alternative, defendant argued for dismissal of the count in the interest of justice. A psychiatrist, who examined defendant, stated in her affidavit, that he was emotionally disturbed and that the necessary treatment would be unavailable in a penal institution. The court granted defendant's motion to the extent that it ordered a hearing to determine whether or not the interests of justice would be served by dismissal of the count. The court found that the mandatory minimum period of incarceration of one year did not constitute cruel or unusual punishment.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged the orders of the Justice Courts of the Town of Brighton and the Town of Henrietta (New York), which entered judgments on the juries' verdicts that found defendant guilty of the crimes of driving while intoxicated. In the second trial defendant was also convicted of a failure to keep right.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted in each of two trials for driving while intoxicated. In each case, defendant claimed that because his jury trial was held at night, he was denied equal protection of the law as guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment and N.Y. Const. art. I, &sect; 11. In one case, defendant objected to the continuation of his trial at a late hour. The court held that a juror's affidavit was admissible to corroborate that at least one of the jurors was exhausted when he voted to convict. The court ruled that defendant's right to trial by jury was so impaired as to amount to a constitutional violation. In the other case, the court held that: (1) defendant's guilt was fully supported by the evidence; (2) it was not error to permit one of the civilian witnesses to express an opinion as to the condition of defendant; and (3) the prosecutor's comment regarding defendant's &quot;refusal&quot; to take either a breathalyzer or a blood test was not so prejudicial as to deprive the defendant of a fair trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed one of defendant's convictions for driving while intoxicated. The court affirmed one of defendant's convictions for driving while intoxicated.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. A criminal trial in a Town Justice Court, for driving while intoxicated, began at 8:00 p.m., and the case was submitted to the jury at 1:30 a.m., and at 2:50 a.m. the jury brought in a verdict of guilty. The foreman now avers that he was so tired by such long, late hours that he acceded to the verdict of guilty. Defendant's constitutional right of trial by jury was impaired by such a late night trial.  On appeal to the County Court, the verdict is set aside and a new trial is granted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. In another, different, criminal jury trial in a Town Justice Court, on a charge of driving while intoxicated, (a) civilian witnesses properly testified that defendant appeared to be intoxicated, (b) defendant's refusal to take either a breathalyzer test or a blood test was properly made the subject of cross-examination and summation, (c) defendant&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  was properly cross-examined as to a prior incident of intoxication, and (d) the Trial Justice imposed reasonable limitations on the cross-examination of the prosecution's witnesses.

Both parties filed motions for summary judgment. The court granted defendants' motion and denied the bus companies' motion. The court determined that the bus companies had standing because the local law substantially affected their economic interests. The court held that the local law was not unconstitutional because buses and routes were &quot;transit&quot; and &quot;mass transportation&quot; within the meanings of N.Y. Const. art.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were indicted in Wyoming County and then their cases were transferred to Erie County for further proceedings and trial. Defendants filed a motion to strike the jury pool. The court concluded there was discrimination against students and women but not against blacks and young people. Under N.Y. C.P.L.R. 270.10, there was a procedure for challenging the jury panel at the time of trial but there was no statutory procedure for challenging the jury pool. The court concluded that the serious constitutional question raised about the composition of the jury pool justified a hearing on the motion. The court found that the Commissioners of Jurors use of the voters' registry as the source of names for the jury pool was proper under N.Y. Jud. Law &sect; 658, which provided the voters' registry list as one of the sources for prospective jurors. The court found no discrimination in the use of a permanent pool of jurors. The court found that mere mathematical disparities without other evidence did not meet defendants' burden to prove intentional and systematic discrimination of blacks or young people. The court found that the practice of excluding students and women was discriminatory.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted in part the motion to strike the jury pool and ordered that the jury pool be separated back to the start of the year when the discriminatory practices against women and students had stopped.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Jury -- selection -- after hearing on defendants' challenge to entire jury pool (cf.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">CPL 270.10</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">), county's Commissioner of Jurors is directed to use separate pool of jurors who qualified since 1974, when discriminatory practices in favor of students and women were discontinued by said commissioner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. On defendants' challenge to the entire jury pool of Erie County (cf.  CPL 270.10), the court has conducted an evidentiary hearing. In the extensive card files of the Erie County Commissioner of Jurors, were 13 cards marked &quot;negro&quot; or &quot;col&quot;; but these 13 were all in the &quot;qualified&quot; file, not in the &quot;disqualified&quot; file; besides, these 13 cards were all made prior to the year 1952, and the evidence is that any such discriminatory practice has been discontinued since 1952.  The commissioner's present practice of excusing operators of one-man businesses, dairy farmers and the like, when done on a case-by-case basis, seems proper under section 678-a of the Judiciary Law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. However, up to January 1, 1974, there was an improper practice of exempting, on grounds of hardship, persons who stated in their questionnaires that they were students.  Also, up to January 1, 1974, there was an&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  improper practice of selecting far fewer women than men for the pool, because it was found that so many women claimed their statutory exemption as women ( Judiciary Law, &sect; 665, subd. 7).  These discriminatory practices by the commissioner's staff have been discontinued since January 1, 1974.  The commissioner's staff uses a sequential numbering system, and hence it is simple to make up a separate jury pool consisting of those persons who have been marked qualified since January 1, 1974.  The court directs the Commissioner of Jurors to make up such a separate pool. ( Judiciary Law, &sect;&sect; 658, 662; Rules of App. Div., 4th Dept. [22 NYCRR 1025.2, 1025.6].) </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, a youth otherwise eligible for youthful offender treatment, challenged the provisions of N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 720.10(2)(a), a provision that precluded the availability of youthful offender treatment to otherwise eligible youths who had been indicted for class A felonies.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was indicted, as that term was defined in N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect;&sect; 1.20(3), 200.10, for the commission of a class A felony. Prior to conviction, defendant applied for youthful offender treatment. The State contended that defendant was ineligible for youthful offender adjudication because of the charges. The court held that: (1) the statutory restriction was violative of due process requirements because it gave conclusive weight to the untested allegations of an indictment; and (2) the restriction violated the equal protection clauses of both the state and federal constitutions because it irrationally discriminated against those youths who had been charged with class A felonies but were later convicted of lesser felonies. The court reasoned that there was no rational basis for treating differently youths who have been convicted of the same offense merely because one of them had originally been charged with a higher grade of offense and that a restriction or classification based upon a charge made in an indictment rather than a charge proven in court was capricious and irrational.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court directed that upon the guilty plea to the indictment, the conviction was vacated and a youthful offender adjudication was substituted.</SPAN></P>

The charges arose from his sale of $ 11 worth of methadone and he faced a possible sentence of life imprisonment. The court previously denied defendant's omnibus motion. Defendant then filed a motion to dismiss the indictment and argued that the imposition of severe incarceration under the New Drug Law constituted cruel and inhuman treatment in violation of the Fifth, Eight, and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. The court determined that while defendant's constitutional arguments should have been included in his omnibus motion, it would in its discretion consider the merits of his motion. The court found that while neither defendant nor the State specified the section of the law to which the motion was addressed, it was clear that the dealt with N.Y.

He filed a motion against the state to dismiss the charge against him, based on the alleged unconstitutionality of the statute. The court denied defendant's motion, holding that N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 265.05(9) did not preempt New York City, N.Y., Admin. Code &sect; 436-5.0(g), because it did not so extensively treat the subject of imitation pistols as to evidence an intent or desire by the state legislature that it was to be the sole and exclusive legislation in this area. The court further held that by prohibiting possession of an imitation pistol only in the context of N.Y.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.

Article 265 of the Penal Law, which is aimed at the control and regulation of firearms and other dangerous weapons, and which includes imitation pistols only when they are possessed with intent to use the same unlawfully against another (&sect; 265.05, subd. 9), and is silent as to any other use or&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  possession of them, does not pre-empt local legislation in regard to imitation pistols, nor is there any conflict between the provisions of that article and the code, each of which seeks to regulate imitation pistols under its peculiar circumstances.</SPAN></P>

Defendant filed an application for an order staying the execution of a judgment pending the determination of her appeal and releasing her in her own recognizance. The court held that it did not have the authority to grant the relief requested because N.Y. Crim. Proc.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- stay of execution pending appeal -- defendant convicted of A-II felony is not entitled to stay, since bail is prohibited where class A felony sentence has been imposed and Legislature is assumed to have known of prohibition when A-I, A-II and A-III felonies were added -- discrepancy between search warrant and affidavit therefor, clarified by caption on warrant application, presents no reasonable possibility of reversal, and bail may therefore be denied.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Defendant who was convicted of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the second degree, a class A-II felony, is not entitled to a stay of judgment pending appeal. Such stays of judgment are treated primarily as a bail problem, and CPL 530.50 prohibits bail where a class A felony sentence has been imposed.  The no-bail provisions apply to A-I, A-II and A-III felonies, since the Legislature is assumed to have known of the existing statute, when it added these felonies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The affidavit on which the search&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  warrant for the defendant's premises was issued requested a search of a downstairs apartment, while the warrant authorized a search of the upstairs premises.  Since the heading of the application for the warrant specified an upstairs apartment, and the Court of Appeals has looked to warrant captions for clarification of discrepancies, there is no reasonable possibility of reversal on this ground.  Since bail may be denied where appellate reversal is highly improbable, as is the case here, defendant is accordingly denied an order staying execution of judgment pending appeal. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The Secretary of State acted within the authority vested in him by statute when, after he found that homeowners in two areas of Brooklyn and Queens were being unduly harassed&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  by excessive solicitation on the part of licensed real estate brokers and salesmen, and in an attempt to resolve a serious challenge to the stability and tranquility of the community and to end abuses then rampant therein, he issued a blanket order which prohibited such brokers and salesmen from soliciting listings of properties for sale and purchase, in any manner whatsoever, in those areas, and warned that violation of the order would subject them to the penalties prescribed by statute, i.e., revocation or suspension of license for untrustworthiness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The order was not violative of due process.  It was made after public hearings had been held, following the receipt of some 8,000 statements by homeowners, who indicated that they did not wish to be solicited, and telephone and personal complaints from homeowners objecting to the practice, and notice of those hearings was sent to 30,000 homeowners and to every licensed broker in the area.  The notice was sufficient, and a trial type hearing was not required.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The order was not unconstitutionally vague, since it gave fair notice of what conduct was forbidden, nor was it unconstitutionally overbroad, since the geographic boundaries&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  encompassed by it were reasonable and its operative effect did not exceed the evil to be corrected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Licensed real estate brokers and salesmen have no absolute right of solicitation. The order does not prohibit them from engaging in the real estate business, but only prohibits soliciting in the proscribed areas, and, subject to this reasonable limitation, they are free to pursue their business activities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. The order, per se, imposes no discipline, creates no new penalties, and merely defines prohibited conduct. Violation of it could properly be regarded as evidence of untrustworthiness, subjecting offenders to punishment.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant school board adopted a resolution eliminating transportation of students to religious schools outside defendant school district. Plaintiff parents sued for declaratory and injunctive relief to prevent the implementation of the resolution. The court declared the resolution to be lawful.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parents contended that N.Y. Educ. Law &sect; 3635 required the district to bus their children. Section 3635 required a school district to provide transportation for all the children residing within the district to the school they legally attended where such students lived within a certain distance from such schools. A school district was not required to provide such transportation for children residing within a city school district, but if provided, such transportation was to be offered equally to all such children in like circumstances. The court found that students attending school outside the district were not in like circumstances to students going to school in the district and that since the district bused all children within the district and denied busing to children going out of the district, it was complying with the statute. The court also found the statute did not deprive city school districts of equal protection of the laws. There was no showing that the legislature's determination that rural areas did not have transportation facilities equal to those of urban areas was irrational. The court held the statute did not infringe on the parents' free exercise of religion.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant detainee sought a writ of habeas corpus challenging his treatment in the county jail, contending that his rights of equal protection and due process were violated because of his treatment as a prisoner, subject to the same rules and regulations as those who were imprisoned as punishment for convictions rather than simply as detainees awaiting trial. The detainee sought an order relieving him of his alleged unlawful confinement.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A detainee was held in the county jail awaiting trial on charges of second-degree kidnapping, first-degree rape, and first-degree robbery. On another indictment he was charged with other, more serious crimes. He sought a writ of habeas corpus challenging his detention subject to the same conditions as prisoners who had already been convicted. The court denied his petition, finding that the jail's rules and regulations could be applied equally to pretrial detainees and prisoners without violating constitutional limitations because such rules were designed to promote order, health, safety, and security, which were all legitimate government interests. The court found that none of the conditions the detainee complained of appeared to serve a punitive or rehabilitative purpose such as would prevent their equal application to pretrial detainees and prisoners. Overall conditions in the jail did not constitute such an unreasonable encroachment on protected freedoms as to render the detention unconstitutional because the practices in question furthered an important government interest and the limitation of freedoms was no greater than necessary to the furtherance of that interest.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A defendant being held in a county jail pending trial seeks, by way of habeas corpus, to be relieved of &quot;unlawful prison confinement&quot; and detained &quot;in a manner, which is not a prison situation&quot;, the major thrust of his argument being that the rights of a pretrial detainee are violated when he is treated in the same fashion as the convicted prisoner. His application is denied.  A pretrial detainee may be&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  subjected to such restraints as are reasonably related to the purpose of his confinement, i.e., assuring his attendance at trial, which is a legitimate State interest, and, while restraints imposed upon him in excess of those reasonably related to that purpose constitute a deprivation of due process, it does not follow that every restraint imposed equally upon him and the convicted prisoner is a violation of his rights.  Institutional life necessarily entails rules and regulations designed to promote order, health, safety and security, which may be applied equally to pretrial detainees and convicted prisoners without transgressing constitutional limitations.  The conditions under which this defendant is confined and the regulations to which he is subject do not constitute such an unreasonable encroachment on his protected freedoms as to render his detention unconstitutional or otherwise illegal.  </SPAN></P>

Defendant assailed the constitutionality of part of N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 220. He claimed his right to equal protection of the laws under U.S. Const. amend. XIV had been violated by reason of differentiation in weight standards by which guilt for sale and possession of various substances was determined, namely, aggregate weight of substances containing one or more ounces of a narcotic drug, as against pure weight of other drugs. The court denied the motion, holding that convenience or practicality was not the objective of N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 220 and related statutes, and that the intention of the legislature was to alter the provisions of the existing laws for the purpose of airing defects which experience had disclosed, all within the framework of the objective to stem the flow of dangerous drugs to the illicit market.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The police officers filed a suit for declaratory relief against defendants in which they argued that the legislature, in enacting New York City, N.Y., Admin.

New York City, N.Y., Admin. Code &sect; 434a-21.0 provided that no member of the police force who was eligible and obtained 63 years would have continued to serve as a member of the police force, and pursuant to this statute defendants forced police officers to retire at 63. The police officers sought a declaration that defendants' actions in implementing the provisions were unconstitutional. The court found for defendants, holding that neither the intent nor the extent of New York City, N.Y., Admin. Code &sect;&sect; B18-4.0(j) and 434a-21.0 were ambiguous. It was assumed that the legislature in enacting New York City, N.Y., Admin. Code &sect; B18-4.0(j) was aware of the mandatory retirement age of 63. Thus, the legislature did not envision benefits greater than those expressed.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Plaintiffs were or had been members of the police force of the City of New York and were members of the Police Pension Fund, Article 1, which allows, under section B18-4.0 (subd. j) of the Administrative Code of the City of New York, a pension at full pay to retirees completing 35 years of service. Section 434a-21.0 of the code mandates retirement for members of the police force at 63 years of age who are eligible for pension benefits.  Plaintiffs who retired prior to completing 35 years of service have no right to either a prorata share of full pay or reinstatement. As to those plaintiffs who are still members as of the effective date of amended section B18-4.0 (subd. j), which allows completion of 35 years of service, this case is moot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. There is no breach of either the due process and equal protection clauses of the Constitution or the contractual relationship of pension membership established by the New York Constitution, since it is long settled that section 434a-21.0 of the Administrative Code of the City of New York violates no constitutional provision. Accordingly, the defendants are declared to have acted lawfully and reasonably.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff's wrongful death suit was settled, and an order of comprise was submitted, with the determination of compensation owed to plaintiff's counsel to be determined by the court. Noting that an attorney's fee was usually based on the net amount recovered after deducting expenses without regard to claims that others may assert against plaintiff's recovery, the court concluded that to repay the workers' compensation carrier in full required the plaintiff to bear the entire cost of attorneys fees. As such, N.Y. Workers' Comp. Law &sect; 29(1) was unconstitutional and unenforceable, as it violated the due process and equal protection guarantees of the federal and state constitutions. Had plaintiff not sued and the insurance carrier exercised its option to do so, it would have been required to sue for plaintiff's pecuniary loss at its own expense. To require plaintiff to pay the attorneys fees out of the net recovery required her to pay the expense of recovering the carrier's money and lessened her rightful recovery.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Compensation of plaintiff's attorney was to be made in accordance with the percentage formula established by the appellate division's rules, but the court concluded that a state workers' compensation law was unconstitutional and unenforceable in requiring plaintiff to solely bear the burden of attorneys fees without requiring the workers' compensation carrier, reimbursed from the settlement amount, to bear any obligation therefor.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. After receiving a workmen's compensation award, the compromise of a wrongful death action against a third party resulted in a settlement for plaintiff in the amount of $ 150,000.  The insurance carrier liable for payment of the compensation award has a lien against any recovery against a third party &quot;to the extent of the total amount of compensation awarded * * * and to such extent such recovery shall be deemed for the benefit of such fund, person, association, corporation or carrier.&quot; (Workmen's Compensation Law, &sect; 29, subd. 1.) The amount of the lien was&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  fixed at $ 20,870.  To the extent that the provisions of subdivision 1 of section 29 of the Workmen's Compensation Law require the plaintiff to reduce her recovery by the full amount of the attorney's fee, including the part that should equitably be chargeable to the collection of the carrier's lien, they are unconstitutional and unenforceable as violating the due process and equal protection guarantees of the Federal and State Constitutions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. To require plaintiff to pay out of the net recovery the fees paid to her attorney and to give the carrier a &quot;free ride&quot; at her expense is not only unconscionable but, in limiting and lessening plaintiff's right of full recovery in a wrongful death action, it is contrary to section 16 of article I of the State Constitution.  </SPAN></P>

The court noted that it was a due process violation to have denied compensation to a suspended teacher with tenure until after a meaningful hearing, but that it was not a due process violation to suspend a teacher and remove him from the classroom pending such a hearing.</SPAN></P>

In providing these additional regulations to overcome the constitutional defects found to exist in section 3020-a, the Regents and the Commissioner were acting within their lawfully delegated authority and giving effect to the general policy and underlying intent of the Legislature when it enacted that section.  The regulations do not conflict with the specific direction of the section which gives the Commissioner the power to establish necessary&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  rules and procedures &quot;for the conduct of hearings&quot;, without expressly granting him power to supply &quot;due process&quot; procedural safeguards in the post-hearing stages, but, rather, they supplement and carry out the legislative scheme of which that specific direction is a part.</SPAN></P>

Penal Law &sect; 240.35(8). During defendant's arrest, he was searched and methadone, a controlled substance, was found in his coat pocket. Defendant was then also charged with criminal possession of a controlled substance in the seventh degree. Defendant filed a motion to dismiss the loitering charge and a motion to suppress the seized contraband. The court found that the absence of any ascertainable standards governing arrest and conviction rendered fair, even-handed administration of the law a virtual impossibility. The court determined that loitering was a word in common usage whose meaning was well understood, however, it concluded that the word was never designed or intended to render innocent conduct criminal.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mortgagee filed an action to foreclose a mortgage on real property. The referee determined the amount due for principal and computed interest due at the rate of six percent as provided in Rule 5004. The mortgagee contended that it was entitled to a higher rate of interest computed under N.Y. Gen. Oblig. Law &sect; 5-501. The court confirmed the referee's entire report including the six-percent rate of interest. The court noted that the six-percent rate of interest specified in N.Y. C.P.L.R. 5004 applied not only to judgment interest, but also to all accruals of interest pursuant to N.Y. C.P.L.R. 5001, 5002, 5003. The referee properly applied the statutory rate of six percent set by N.Y. C.P.L.R. 5004 in computing the interest due to the mortgagee on the bonds, mortgages, and extension agreement. Regarding the mortgagee's claim that Rule 5004 was unconstitutional, the court held that the award of interest for the period following a breach of contract was merely an element of damages. A change in the availability of interest was not an impairment of the obligation of a contract. The award of interest at the rate provided in Rule 5004 was not in derogation of the mortgagee's rights.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant wanted to present alibi testimony at the trial notwithstanding his failure to provide the prosecution with the names of prospective alibi witnesses. Defendant alleged that N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 250.20 was unconstitutionality because it lacked a reciprocity requirement by the state. The court agreed that there was no significant difference between &sect; 250.20, New York's former law set forth in Code of Criminal Procedure &sect; 295-l, and the notice-of-alibi statute of the State of Oregon. Both the New York former law and the Oregon statute had been held to be unconstitutional. Therefore, the court held that N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 250.20 was unconstitutional. The notice of alibi served upon defendant by the State upon his arraignment was set aside.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The bus company had a franchise from the city to operate three airport-related routes. The authority granted a lower rate to buses engaged in authorized general transportation and specifically excluded airline buses or other special purpose buses using franchised routes from the lower rate. The court granted declaratory and injunctive relief in favor of the bus company. The court noted that the different tolls had to be based upon some real and substantial distinction bearing a reasonable and just relation to the imposed classification. The court concluded that the bus company was engaged in general transportation and that the authority could not reasonably distinguish between buses with regular bus stop routes and buses working airline routes in fixing the toll classifications.</SPAN></P>

It is unreasonable of the Authority to charge a higher toll for two-axle franchised airline buses than for two-axle franchised general transportation buses (cf.  21 NYCRR 251.1).  Judgment is granted to a franchised airline bus corporation enjoining and restraining the Authority from charging it the higher rate.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The criminal defendant had a jury trial pending in the city court on the charge of driving while intoxicated. The defendant argued, inter alia, that the city court lost jurisdiction of the action on the ground that she was denied her constitutional right to a speedy trial. The court denied the defendant's motion, holding that an adjournment of defendant's trial for 70 days was constitutionally permissible. Defendant's case could be adjourned to await the next jury panel provided that it was no longer than the 90 days allowed by statute. The court also found that N.Y. Veh. &amp; Traf. Law &sect; 510(1) conferred upon the city judge the discretion to suspend a driver's license temporarily without notice pending the defendant's prosecution if his decision was based on substantial evidence. The city court acted with sound discretion because it had before it the narrative of the defendant's actions leading to the charge as well as the record of her prior convictions showing her recent and persistent disregard for the traffic laws of the state.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. A petitioner who, 12 hours after the release of a panel of jurors who had tried cases in City Court, was arrested on a charge of driving while intoxicated. and who demanded a speedy jury trial, was not deprived of her constitutional right to a speedy trial when that court adjourned her case for 70 days, until the date when the next jury was to be impanelled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The court, which had before it not only the narrative of&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  petitioner's actions leading to the charge but the record of her prior convictions in the same court, showing recent and persistent disregard for the traffic laws, and which had discretion, under the Vehicle and Traffic Law ( &sect; 510), to temporarily suspend her driver's license pending the trial, acted with sound discretion when it did so.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. In addition to the record of her convictions in City Court, which the Judge admittedly inspected, the file of the case in that court contained a longer record of all her convictions, supplied by the State Motor Vehicle Department, and, on the assumption that the Judge also inspected that record, she claims a violation of the right accorded her by section 504 of the Vehicle and Traffic Law, prohibiting exhibition prior to conviction of the &quot;record of convictions stub&quot; of a license. Since the purpose of that prohibition is to insure a fair hearing on a particular charge unprejudiced by past convictions, it would be sophistry to attempt a distinction between the Judge's seeing the forbidden stub and his seeing the Motor Vehicle Department's copy of the record of convictions. However, there has been no violation of petitioner's right since the Judge&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  has sworn he did not see the departmental copy, and, even if he did see it, there would be no prejudice to her because a jury, not the Judge, will be trying the facts.  </SPAN></P>

The determination of the level of public assistance was ordinarily a legislative matter not subject to review by the courts. However, the legislature could not delegate its legislative powers. To avoid the constitutional prohibition against a pure delegation of legislative power, there must be standards set which the commissioner must follow.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The school, which was affiliated with a religious institution, provided certain educational services pursuant to N.Y. Laws ch. 138 (1970). Subsequently, ch. 996 was found unconstitutional because it violated the Establishment Clause. The school nonetheless filed a claim under N.Y. Laws ch. 996 (1972) for expenses it incurred in providing the services. The school argued that, because the services it provided had been prior to the finding that N.Y. Laws ch. 138 was unconstitutional, it was entitled to reimbursement of expenses. However, the court held that the school was not entitled to recover expenses from the state for the services it rendered. In reaching its conclusion, the court held that ch. 996 was unconstitutional to the extent that it provided for the payment for ch. 138-related educational services performed by a religiously affiliated institution such as the school. The court held that the caselaw upon which the school relied in arguing for payment was distinguishable from the case at issue because, in the case cited by the school, there were certain protections that assured that the services rendered did not further any sectarian purpose.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Legislature authorized payments by the State to nonprofit nonpublic schools, for various school-related services (L. 1970, ch. 138).

The Legislature nevertheless authorized the Court of Claims to hear and determine, as moral obligations, claims for payments for such school-related services already rendered (L. 1972, ch. 996).  But the religious establishment clause of the First Amendment of the United&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  States Constitution prohibits any such claim.

The town enacted of sign and zoning ordinances including Brighton, N.Y. Zoning Ordinance &sect; 42-29. Under the ordinances the company's signs were nonconforming. The court found that the outdoor advertising structures as well as the lease of the lands upon which the structures were erected were an interest in real estate. The signs in question possessed considerable value. Thus, the court concluded that the sign and zoning ordinances in respect to the subject signs in this case were unconstitutional pursuant to the Constitution of the State of New York as well as the Constitution of the United States by reason of the taking property of the company without due process of the law and without just compensation.</SPAN></P>

The plaintiff is entitled to a judgment declaring that the defendant Town of Brighton's sign and zoning ordinances, requiring removal of pre-existing, nonconforming billboards within three years after the statutes' effective date, unconstitutionally take the plaintiff's property without due process of law and just compensation.  The plaintiff's outdoor advertising structures and lease of lands are an interest in land which, if taken by eminent domain, would require compensation, and the effect of the ordinances technically constitutes a taking without just compensation by eliminating a right in real estate through an amortization&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  period shorter than the normal useful life of the property.</SPAN></P>

When he was taken to the police station, $ 1,200 in cash that was on his person found its way into the hands of the Clerk. The individual contended that the money was wrongfully taken from him and retained by the police. The Clerk maintained that these moneys were offered to a police officer as a bribe. The individual later pleaded guilty to the crime of possession of stolen property. The plea was accepted in consideration and dismissal of the nine remaining counts. Thereafter, the individual demanded the return of the $ 1,200, and upon the Clerk's refusal to pay, instituted a replevin action. The individual then filed a motion for summary judgment. The court granted the motion, by holding that the Clerk was required to return the money because such money was not contraband, as it was not shown that it was the &quot;proceeds of a crime,&quot; and the entire indictment against the individual had been disposed of by plea.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Plaintiff was arrested and taken to a police station. While there, $ 1,200 in cash belonging to him and on his person, found its way to defendant.  Subsequently, plaintiff was indicted and charged with 10 crimes, to which he pleaded guilty to criminal possession of stolen property, which plea was accepted in consideration and dismissal of the nine remaining counts.

The court granted defendants' motion to dismiss the indictment and held that the indictment was defective within the meaning of N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect;&sect; 200.50(7). A failure to particularize sufficiently the facts constituting the alleged crime as required by the statute required a dismissal of the indictments underN.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect;&sect; 210.20(1)(a) and 210.25(1). There was insufficient compliance by the State with the statute. The sparse factual allegations contained in this indictment were supplemented merely by the statutory definition of criminally negligent homicide. Each defendant was entitled to know from the face of the indictment what facts were being pleaded against that particular defendant individually. The State was, however, granted leave to resubmit this case.It was apparent from N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 10.00(7) that the term &quot;person&quot; included corporations.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At the end of defendant's trial for violating New York City, N.Y., Health Code &sect; 153.19(a), defendant filed a motion to dismiss the complaint on the grounds that the statute was overly broad and vague, and in violation of the Due Process Clause of the United States Constitution. Defendant also filed a motion to dismiss for failure to establish guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The patrolman testified that he observed great accumulations of debris, litter, and garbage on the sidewalk abutting the property owned by defendant, but conceded that he did not observe defendant actually contribute to the accumulation. The court denied defendant's motion to dismiss the complaint on the grounds that New York City, N.Y., Health Code &sect; 153.19(a) was unconstitutional. The court held that &sect; 153.19(a) was constitutional. The city had the power to adopt the statute under N.Y. Mun. Home Rule Law &sect; 10 and the city's police power. The statute was not overly broad and vague because it was capable of reasonable application to the varying fact patterns presented in the city. A periodic policing by defendant to keep his premises free from litter, garbage, and obstructions was not oppressive but a duty incident to property ownership. Defendant's duty to make a reasonable effort to maintain his premises free from litter was one incident to ownership. Defendant's continuous duty, as a property owner, to maintain the sidewalks abutting his premises free from litter and obstructions was not so unreasonable and onerous that it violated the Due Process Clause.</SPAN></P>

This regulation is a reasonable exercise of the police power. Its wording is sufficiently precise.  There is no proof of invidious discrimination in its enforcement.

The trial court denied the motion, holding where the statute specifically prohibited the mere possession of a cartridge pistol, the statute was clear. Where the statute did not state intent was an element of the crime and where another statute punishing the intent to unlawfully use a cartridge pistol existed, intent was not an element of the crime.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a condemnation proceeding, petitioner town sought to acquire title to claimant tax deed owner's real property for drainage purposes.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The tax deed owner bid at a county tax sale and acquired a tax deed to two parcels consisting of one and seven acres respectively. Subsequently, the town sought to acquire the property for drainage purposes. The tax deed owner failed to prove his title and the court held that he could not be compensated for the property in the condemnation proceedings. The court ordered that upon completion of valuation hearings in the condemnation proceeding, the sum due from the town to the true owner, whoever and wherever he was, would be deposited with the county treasurer. The court denied the tax deed owner's motion for a new trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that the tax deed owner did not have marketable title to the property and, therefore, could not receive compensation in the condemnation proceeding. The tax deed owner's motion for a new trial was denied.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Taxation -- tax liens, tax sales and tax titles -- allegedly &quot;omitted&quot; property cannot be added to tax roll without notice to true owner or to unknown owner -- municipal corporation is not estopped by unauthorized acts of its officials -- presumption of regularity of tax deed refuted -- purported landowner cannot acquire better title by failing to pay his taxes and then buying in at tax sale -- such tax deed grantee does not have marketable title -- hence he is not entitled to any award in condemnation -- award shall be deposited for benefit of unknown true owner of property.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. A tax sale deed by the Suffolk County Treasurer in 1953 conveyed, to a corporation owned by claimant individual, a parcel described as being 1 acre on the westerly side of an unused railroad spur, and a parcel described as being 7 acres on the easterly side of said railroad spur. Expert testimony shows that it is impossible to locate these alleged properties.  In 1965 claimant presented to the town assessor a survey of a 10.24-acre parcel located on the westerly side of&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  a county road which had replaced the abandoned railroad spur. The 7-acre parcel certainly cannot be part of these 10.24 acres, and there is no proof that the 1-acre parcel is.  Moreover, there is no evidence as to who is the true owner or the unknown owner of the 10.24 acres.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Nevertheless, the County Board of Supervisors adopted a resolution canceling the 1965-1966 taxes on the 1-acre and 7-acre parcels, and assessing and levying a &quot;compromise&quot; tax of $ 133.81 for 1965-1966 on the 10.24-acre parcel, and assessing this tax against yet a different corporation owned by claimant individual.  Since all taxes on the 1-acre and 7-acre parcel had already been paid to date, there was nothing to &quot;compromise&quot; and the resolution was unauthorized and invalid (Suffolk County Tax [L. 1920, ch. 311, as amd.], &sect;&sect; 29, 30, 66, 76).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Moreover, the lack of any notice to the true or unknown owner of the 10.24 acres is a constitutional bar to adding the assertedly &quot;omitted&quot; 10.24 acres to the existing tax roll.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Possibly, the &quot;omitted&quot; 10.24 acres could have been added to the next year's tax roll, but only after notice of a hearing to the true owner (Real Property Tax Law, &sect;&sect; 554, 550; Suffolk&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  County Tax Act, &sect; 32).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Claimant and his corporations deliberately failed to pay this so-called &quot;compromise&quot; tax; and thus, after a tax sale and lapse of the statutory three-year period, the County Treasurer in 1970 issued to claimant a tax sale deed of the 10.24 acres. The presumption of regularity is refuted by the facts; and the presumption never became conclusive (Suffolk County Tax Act, &sect;&sect; 3, 53), since, only 10 months after the deed was recorded, the town acquired vested title by condemnation, for drainage purposes, to a tract of land which includes the 10.24 acres.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. A landowner cannot, by means of a self-created tax delinquency, acquire a better title than he had before.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. A municipal corporation is not estopped by the unauthorized acts of its officers, agents, or employees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. The asserted title of claimant or of any of his corporations to the 10.24 acres is invalid, or, at the very least, unmarketable.  Hence they are not entitled to any award for the condemnation by the town.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. After valuation hearings in the town's condemnation proceeding are fully completed, any award for the 10.24 acres shall be deposited with the County Treasurer for the benefit of the unknown&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  true owner (Suffolk County Improvement Act [L. 1927, ch. 190, as amd. by L. 1939, ch. 276], &sect;&sect; 18, 44, 45).  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant filed a motion to suppress evidence used to indict him on weapons charges on the grounds that the evidence was unconstitutionally seized by parole officers.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant drove a parolee to the parole office and was sitting in the car when parole officers requested to search it. Defendant agreed to the search and as he was leaving the car, he reached down for an attache. The officers drew their guns and took the case. The officers, upon patting down defendant, found loaded guns. Defendant was indicted for possession of the guns and moved to suppress them on the grounds that they were unconstitutionally seized. Defendant alleged the stop-and-frisk statute,&nbsp;N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 140.50, did not apply to parole officers. The court denied defendant's motion to suppress. Based on the parolee's suspicious activities, the officers reasonably investigated the parolee and searched the car. The officers were justified in their limited frisk of defendant because they were fearful that he was armed. The statute did not explicitly preclude parole officers from conducting limited searches in the course of their duties.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied defendant's motion to suppress because the weapons taken from defendant's belt were constitutionally seized.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. During questioning of a parolee who had a large amount of cash, had told of an assassination attempt and was generally evasive, the parole officers noticed a conspicuous looking vehicle parked in front of the Department of Correctional Services with the defendant seated in it, and after investigation from other sources, determined that the vehicle was customarily used by the parolee and registered to his wife.  Asked to identify the occupant, the parolee said that &quot;if that fellow has any guns on him, I don't know anything about it.&quot; Upon approaching the vehicle and getting no response to questions from the defendant, the parole officers announced their intention to search the vehicle and after asking the defendant some questions, they searched the defendant and seized weapons and ammunition which the defendant was carrying&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  both in his waist and in an attache case which was by his feet and which he had picked up when getting out of the car.  Under the circumstances, there were reasonable grounds for an investigation as to whether parole was being violated, and a search of the vehicle was incidental to that investigation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The belief of the parole officers that the defendant was armed, that their own safety was in danger, and their limited frisk of the defendant were all reasonable.  Evidence obtained as a result of reasonable conduct is admissible and accordingly, the guns taken from the defendant's belt were constitutionally seized. The guns in the attache case are admissible as the result of a search incident to a lawful arrest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3.  CPL 140.50, the &quot;stop and frisk&quot; law, was not intended to preclude all law enforcement officers other than those denominated as police officers from conducting a limited search for weapons when, in the course of performing their lawful duties, they reasonably fear for their own safety. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. A month-old infant was voluntarily committed to the care of the local Commissioner of Social Services by her biological mother, who could not care for her because of severe physical and emotional problems.  Under the supervision of a child care agency, the infant, who is now eight years old, has been with the same foster parents and apparently is well adjusted.  Pursuant to section 392 of the Social Services Law, the local Commissioner of Social Services at the behest of the child care agency has filed a petition in the Family Court for a periodic review of the foster care status and placement. Notice has been given to the natural mother, and she opposes any extension of the foster care placement and asks that her child be&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  returned to her.</SPAN></P>

Social Services Law, &sect; 372, subd. 4, and Family Ct. Act, &sect; 166).  The case record shall be delivered to the Clerk of this court under seal, to be kept in his exclusive custody. Counsel for both parties may arrange for inspection thereof either jointly or, upon their written stipulation, individually.  The Clerk shall make same available under court auspices only.  No extracts or copies may be made from the record, nor may the contents thereof be disclosed to the respective litigants.  The court intends that counsel examine same in order to enable them to represent their clients adequately at the trial.  The court does not intend that potentially psychologically damaging information be shared with the litigants.  The attorneys shall conform to these direction as officers of the court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The natural mother avers that she has a phobia of travel and that therefore this proceeding&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  should be transferred from New York County to Bronx County, where she resides.  However, the Family Court conducts all Bronx County proceedings under section 392 of the Social Services Law in its New York County courthouse.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, the New York State Environmental Conservation Department, brought this motion for summary judgment in plaintiff property owner's action against the Department.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner operated a large dairy on its land, through which ran a stream classified by the Department as Class &quot;C&quot; with &quot;C (T)&quot; standards for quality and purity. The owner hired a contractor to clear bushes near the stream for the purpose of growing more hay and feed for its cattle. In the process, bulldozers were caused to cross the stream. Although the owner was advised that, pursuant to the statute and regulations, a permit was required for any work that modified the bed or banks of the stream, no permit was ever applied for. The Department therefore instituted action to enforce the statute. The court dismissed the owner's first cause of action on the ground that salutary actions taken by the State to assure that a classified stream was kept pure was proper as long as it was reasonable. Because the owner failed to apply for a permit under the statute, the court was not able to judge the reasonableness of the application of the statute to the owner's circumstances. As to the second cause of action, the court declared that the statute was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

The statute is reasonably designed to guard the public and the adjoining or riparian owners against pollution. The statute does not confiscate the waters or the banks of the waters of a dairy farm through whose 500 acres a classified stream flows.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The applicant fraudulently obtained public assistance when she failed to inform the Department of Social Services that she was employed.

The applicant was subsequently injured in a car accident and was unable to work. The Department denied her assistance under &sect; 348.4(a). The applicant contended, inter alia, that &sect; 348.4(a) was unconstitutional. The court agreed. The court found that the enactment of &sect; 348.4 established substantive standards and usurped the legislative function. Because the legislature had specifically addressed itself to welfare fraud and the penalties to be imposed, it pre-empted this area and left no alternatives for discretionary rule-making power under N.Y. Soc. Serv. Law, &sect;145. Therefore, the administrative agency could not enact legislation that denied assistance as a penalty for fraud.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff filed felony complaints charging various defendants with larceny for collecting welfare benefits without fully disclosing their assets to the Department of Social Services. The complaints expressly alleged the elements of the crime of larceny by false pretenses. Plaintiff alleged that the payments to defendants were occasioned by an alleged willful concealment of facts which if known to the Department of Social Services (Department) would have resulted in the curtailment of funds in excess of the sum to which defendants were entitled. Defendants claimed that the Department did not rely upon misrepresentations or omissions of defendants since it was undisputed that defendants were entitled to some assistance anyway. The court stated that no New York court has decided whether entitlement to some benefits insulated the recipient from criminal prosecution for receiving excess payments without disclosing such facts to the proper authorities. The court could not determine whether the endorsements on the welfare checks were made pursuant to an original plan to conceal salient facts regarding their eligibility. The court held the cases for action by the grand jury.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  1. After a hearing upon felony complaints, the court holds for the action of the Grand Jury the cases of three defendants charged with a misdemeanor violation of the Social Services Law and with grand larceny in the second degree, a felony, in that each received semi-monthly public assistance checks over a period of time during which she willfully concealed a fact which, if known to the Department of Social Services, would have resulted in her receiving lesser sums.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. As to whether each case reveals a &quot;common plan or scheme&quot; such that the individual checks may be aggregated to reach grand larceny levels, no evidence has been presented to indicate whether the defendant read the statement on the back of each check cashed, to the effect that the payee was still in need of public assistance, had reported all resources to the department, and would notify it of any change in circumstances or resources.  While it is evident that she could not have received any benefits without indorsing the checks, the court cannot determine whether her indorsements thereof were made pursuant to an original plan to conceal salient facts regarding her eligibility, but, if it can be established at an evidentiary&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  hearing or trial that she concealed such operative facts with the expectancy of receiving undeserved benefits on a continuing basis, such would constitute the crime of larceny by false pretenses as a felony.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. As to a contention by defendants that the department did not rely upon the misrepresentations, since they would have been entitled to some assistance, albeit lesser sums, without them, the payment of benefits is directly dependent upon the need of the recipient, and the court cannot say, as a matter of law, that the department would have dispensed the funds in total disregard of its established guidelines had the true facts been disclosed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. In each of these cases, the prosecutions were not initiated within the two-year Statute of Limitations for a misdemeanor. As to whether they may be reduced and tried as misdemeanors, the defense of the Statute of Limitations is an issue to be raised upon the trial and not on a motion addressed to the sufficiency of the felony complaints, but such a defense would serve as a bar to prosecution if it is raised.  It would be waived upon a plea of guilty to a reduced charge.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The indictment against defendants alleged that they, on behalf of a Republican committee, in order to promote the election of the Republican candidates, distributed thousands of letters to Liberal Party voters, urging them to vote for the Liberal Party. The effect would be to diffuse Democratic Party support. The statute prohibited such printing and distribution of letters if the writer and/or sender did not list his or its name and address. The court found that the statute was unconstitutional. The politicians had standing, not because their own rights of free expression were violated, but because of a judicial assumption that the statute's very existence could cause others to refrain from constitutionally protected speech or expression. The statute was not limited to deterring defamation, nor was it limited to campaign literature. Even granting the compelling nature of the concern for the integrity of political campaigns, the statute was not limited to deterring campaign defamation and financing violations. The statute was overbroad in that it unfairly and unnecessarily swept within its criminal sanctions activity that was the protected right of every citizen.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.  Section 457 of the Election Law makes it a misdemeanor to publish of distribute any handbill, circular, or letter containing any allegation about any political party or candidate or person or proposition, in connection with any election or nomination, without also printing thereon the true name and post office address of the person or committee at whose instance it is published or distributed. Section 446 of the Election Law makes it a misdemeanor for two or more persons to conspire to promote or prevent the election of any person to a public office by the use of any means which are prohibited by law.  But anonymity in political expression has long and historically&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  been a necessary and constitutional right which is zealously protected by the Federal First Amendment's &quot;freedom of speech&quot; and by the State Constitution's &quot;liberty of speech&quot; and &quot;rights * * * peaceably * * * to petition the government, or any department thereof&quot; (N.

Section 457 of the Election Law, in absolutely requiring the identification of any one who exercises his constitutional right to speak freely, is overly and unnecessarily broad and hence is unconstitutional and void.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Since section 457 of the Election Law unconstitutionally prohibits free speech as distinguished from conduct, defendants who are charged with violating this section have standing to challenge its constitutionality on the ground that it is unnecessarily broad and absolute.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Accordingly, defendants' motion to dismiss the indictment against them is granted.  </SPAN></P>

On or about March 28, 1973, in accordance with section 3013 of the Education Law, petitioner was recommended for tenure by the Superintendent of Schools and other supervisory personnel as a probationary teacher who has been found &quot;competent, efficient and satisfactory.&quot; The respondent Board of Education reviewed the recommendation and decided not to grant tenure. In an article 78 proceeding to compel the respondent to restore her job, her petition is dismissed for failure to state a cause of action. Subdivision 2 of section 3013 of the Education Law provides that each probationary teacher who is not to be recommended for appointment&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  on tenure shall be so notified in writing by the Superintendent not less than 60 days immediately preceding the expiration of his probationary period.

Petitioner fails to state a cause of action when she alleges, upon information and belief, that since the Superintendent recommended her for tenure, the board's denial must be based upon reasons other than her academic qualifications and teaching effectiveness. The allegations lack the factual basis to support a conclusion that petitioner's constitutional rights were violated and therefore she was not denied tenure without due process of law.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On reargument, plaintiff, an individual injured in an automobile accident with defendant insurance company's insured, filed a motion for summary judgment in an action to enforce a judgment against defendant's insured in Louisiana. Defendant contended that the direct action statute of Louisiana, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 13:3474, under which plaintiff initiated the action, was unconstitutional and did not subject defendant to Louisiana's jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After plaintiff obtained a judgment against defendant's insured in a Louisiana state court arising from an automobile accident that occurred in Louisiana, plaintiff brought suit to enforce the judgment against defendant pursuant to La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 13:3474, and sought summary judgment. The court granted plaintiff's motion for summary judgment, rejecting defendant's contention that Louisiana lacked jurisdiction to render judgment against it because it was not licensed to do business in Louisiana and did not transact any business in Louisiana and, consequently, the judgment against it violated due process. The court ruled that because defendant issued its insurance policy, which insured against accidents wherever its insured drove, with the knowledge that insured could be involved in an accident anywhere in the United States, defendant had sufficient minimum contacts with Louisiana to satisfy due process. Further, the court ruled that &sect; 13:3474 was a valid exercise of Louisiana's legitimate interest in safeguarding the rights of persons injured there, and thus, plaintiff's suit did not offend traditional notions of fair play and justice.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Although one need not be present in the State to subject itself to the jurisdiction of its courts and although the acts of the insured in Louisiana are not attributable to the New York insurer, the issuance of a motor vehicle liability policy to a New York resident insuring against accidents wherever they arise, and realizing that its insureds will invariably be involved in accidents all over the country, are sufficient &quot;contacts&quot; to satisfy the test set forth in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">International Shoe Co. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">v.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11"> State of Washington</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (326 U.S. 310) so as to render the New York insurer subject to the jurisdiction of the Louisiana courts.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners joint venturers instituted a N.Y. C.P.L.R. art. 78 proceeding, in the nature of mandamus, which sought to review and vacate the orders of respondent Public Service Commission of the State of New York (PSC). The PSC had banned the use of decorative torches using gas as fuel and directed that the natural gas service to the restaurant owned by the joint venturers was to have been discontinued.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The use of decorative torches fueled by natural gas was a large part of the ambience of the restaurant. The PSC had ordered discontinuance of the restaurant's natural gas services unless the gas lamps and torches used by the restaurant were extinguished or converted to be used with mantles. The court granted a stay of the enforcement of the PSC's orders pending the court's decision. The court dismissed the petition of the joint venturers holding that the ban on the use of such torches and the directive to discontinue supplying gas to the restaurant unless it discontinued the use of such torches had to stand because the joint venturers failed to show that the PSC acted arbitrarily in determining that the torches constituted a wasteful device or practice or acted arbitrarily in including within the definition of &quot;decorative torches&quot; the gas lamps that existed in the restaurant. The court further found there was no showing to overcome the PSC's determination that the decorative torches were a wasteful device or practice.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court dismissed the joint venturers' petition.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The individual was arrested for driving a van that was painted as the American flag. The paint job was, in a police officer's opinion, a violation of N.Y. Gen. Bus. Law &sect; 136. The court reasoned that whether or not the individual was expressing an idea by driving a van painted as a flag need not concern the court because such use of a flag was not illegal. The court found as a matter of law that the arrest was for something not constituting a crime and therefore there was a cause of action for false arrest and false imprisonment. The court reasoned that the information filed by the police officer did not state facts sufficient to constitute the crime charged.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Claimant's vehicle, painted with the colors and design of the American flag, was stopped and claimant was arrested for unlawful display of the American flag (General Business Law, &sect; 136).  Claimant was promptly arraigned before a Town Justice who allowed the entry of a plea of not guilty.  Unable to post the bail, claimant was incarcerated until bail was posted. Subsequently the charges were dismissed.  Whether or not the claimant was expressing an idea by driving a vehicle painted as a flag, such use of the flag is not illegal and therefore there was no probable cause for the arrest. As a matter of law the arrest was for something not constituting a crime and therefore there is a cause of action for false arrest and false imprisonment. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner union brought a proceeding, pursuant to N.Y. C.P.L.R. art. 78 seeking to enjoin respondent state from refusing to negotiate concerning retirement benefits under a reopener clause in the collective bargaining agreement which existed between the parties.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The union sought a declaration that statutes imposing a retirement program upon the union's bargaining unit and which removed retirement benefits from the scope of legally negotiable terms and conditions of employment were unconstitutional. Under the parties' agreement, retirement benefits for employees was a subject that could have been reopened for negotiations between the union and the state. The court found that N.Y. Civ. Serv. Law &sect; 201(4) eliminated the employer's obligation under the agreement to negotiate retirement benefits, provided for limitations on retirement and death benefits applicable to new entrants, and provided for the temporary suspension of retirement negotiations and a plan for coalition negotiations. The court held that 1973 N.Y. Laws ch. 382 did not violate the union's constitutional rights. The court found that the state had the police power to impair the existing obligation on the part of the state to negotiate retirement benefits with the union and that such power was paramount to any rights under the contract between the parties.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court dismissed the union's petition, which had sought to enjoin the state from refusing to negotiate concerning retirement benefits under a reopener clause in the collective bargaining agreement between the parties.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Civil service -- collective bargaining agreement -- retirement benefits -- chapter 382 of Laws of 1973, removing retirement benefits from scope of negotiable terms and conditions of public employment, is constitutional -- petition by union which, at time of its enactment, was conducting reopened negotiations with State concerning retirement benefits, under clause in collective bargaining agreement providing for such reopening, to have it declared </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">unconstitutional,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> is dismissed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. A collective bargaining agreement between the State and the union representing State employees in the security services bargaining unit provided for the reopening of negotiations concerning retirement benefits at the request of the union.  After the union requested the reopening of such negotiations and while the reopened negotiations were continuing, chapter 382 of the Laws of 1973 was enacted, removing retirement benefits from the scope of negotiable terms and conditions of public employment. A petition by the union to have this statute declared unconstitutional is dismissed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The statute, which does not attempt to vitiate any employee benefits&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  which have become vested, does not violate the constitutional prohibition against impairment of a contractual obligation (U. S. Const., art. I, &sect; 10).  It has for its purpose the maintenance of a stable economic environment, is addressed to a legitimate end, and the measures taken are reasonable and appropriate to that end.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The statute does not violate the constitutional provision that &quot;membership in any pension or retirement system of the state * * * shall be a contractual relationship, the benefits of which shall not be diminished or impaired&quot; (N. Y. Const., art. V, &sect; 7).  The contractual right to negotiate retirement benefits is not a &quot;benefit&quot; of membership in the retirement system within the meaning of this provision, which prohibits a reduction of benefits but does not guarantee that members shall always have the means to seek improvements in benefits by collective bargaining.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The statute does not violate the constitutional provision that employees shall have the right to organize and bargain collectively through representatives of their own choosing (N. Y. Const., art. I, &sect; 17).  Since the obligation to engage in collective bargaining was imposed on the public employee&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  by statute, it may be limited by statute.  And, since the provisions of the statute for limitations on retirement and death benefits apply only to new entrants, it does not deny to the union's members the right to bargain through representatives of their own choosing. However, even assuming those members were affected by the statute and its terms were, as the union asserts, negotiated with another union, it would still not violate this constitutional provision.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. The statute does not violate the equal protection clause (U. S. Const., 14th Amdt.).  It is applicable to all public employees, not merely the members of this union, and, assuming this union was the only one actually negotiating under the reopener clause at the time it was signed into law, this was merely fortuitous.  </SPAN></P>

There was a complained filed against defendant and the law enforcement agencies were mandated to investigate the circumstances and prosecute the same within &sect; 9.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants filed a motion to set aside the verdict of the jury, which found them guilty of resisting arrest under N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 205.30 and obstructing governmental administration under N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 195.05. The court, at the end of the State's case, dismissed the disorderly conduct charge under N.Y.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The police saw one defendant passing out fliers and stopped to see what the fliers contained. Defendant identified himself and offered his driver's license for verification. When the officers insisted on seeing the fliers defendant refused to hand them one. The second defendant and cohort seeing what was happening entered into the dispute. A scuffle ensued and defendants were arrested. The court held that there was not probable cause for the arrest, such that the charges had to be dismissed. The police had absolutely no probable cause that any one of the nation's laws was being violated. Defendants were seen doing nothing more than exercising their presumptively constitutional First Amendment rights. Where a police officer had no power or right to demand something, then he had no authorized duty to perform in that regard, and any order given was unauthorized where no power or right existed. Thus, the arrest for refusing to obey the officer would be unauthorized, an essential element of N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 205.30, and the &quot;official function,&quot; the essential element under N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 195.05, could not be obstructed, impaired, or perverted, if there was no power or right to act.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defendant was apparently exercising his First Amendment right to distribute literature on the street, even though the literature bore a red star and the emblem of a hammer and sickle.  To two policemen who approached him, he identified himself and showed his driver's license, but he refused to show them the literature.  At this point the codefendant crossed over from the other side of the street.

However, on motion of the defendants ( CPL 330.30, subd. 1) the court set aside the verdict and discharged the defendants, on the grounds that the police had no probable cause for the arrest (cf.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The critical question posed in the case was whether the city's amendment to the zoning regulations, under the guise of creating a special park district, was a reasonable exercise of governmental police power. The court found that the city's action in rezoning the areas of the private parks, which were owned by the owners and were the security for the mortgagee's mortgage, into public recreational areas totally destroyed the economic value of such plots and had significantly deprived the mortgagee of its security for the mortgage. Additionally, the court found that the owners had been deprived of the use of the property for an improvement to which it was reasonably adapted and that the zoning regulation barred the owners from any economic use of their property. The court concluded that the amendment was illegal. The finding by the court that the enactment of the zoning amendment was unconstitutional and void automatically restored the property to the zoning classification it had prior to the adoption of the zoning amendment. The court refused to award damages because the mortgagee and the owners had not demonstrated any immediate financial loss.</SPAN></P>

The court directs that the prior zoning classification (R-10) be restored to these two small private parks.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A mixed, commercial and residential, use building was damaged by fire. The owners of the building obtained a building permit from the municipality. Subsequently, the building commissioner revoked the building permit asserting that the permit was issued by mistake. A municipal ordinance only allowed renovation of a damaged building if less that 50 percent of a building was damaged. The building in question was more that 50 percent damaged. The owners filed suit seeking an injunction and/or damages for their reliance on the issued building permit. The court granted the owners damages for costs directly relating to any reliance on the originally issued permit. The permit was validly revoked because the ordinance was valid and constitutional, however, the issuance of building permits was a form of warranty and a municipality could be held liable for breach of that warranty.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. After a building in the City of Long Beach, which was a mixed residential and commercial structure, and nonconforming since an ordinance enacted after its construction prohibited such mixed usage, was damaged by fire, its owner applied for a building permit to restore the damaged portions, and the city's Building Commissioner issued the permit.  However, after reconstruction was started, the city revoked the permit, claiming it had been mistakenly granted in view of an ordinance which allowed rebuilding of a nonconforming structure only where not more than one half of its value or cubical contents was damaged. The owner of the building then sued the city and its Building Commissioner for an injunction directing reissuance of the permit, or, failing that, damages for expenditures made in reliance on the issued permit.  The action is dismissed against the Building Commissioner and the revocation of the permit is declared valid, but the owner is awarded damages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Over 50% of the building's&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  value and cubical contents had, in fact, been destroyed, and the 50% cut-off point provided for in the ordinance, which was intended to strike an equitable balance in allowing rebuilding of a nonconforming structure with only relatively minor damage, is not unreasonable or confiscatory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The prohibition in the ordinance against mixed residential and commercial uses in a single structure serves to keep apart living and working population and to unify uses existent in any one building, and it cannot be said to ignore the common good or be unconstitutional, nor is it confiscatory as applied to this building owner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The act of the Building Commissioner in granting the unauthorized permit does not estop the city from revoking it.  Indeed, the revocation was required as a necessary act to enforce the ordinance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. The failure of the building owner to serve a notice of claim against the city does not preclude it from obtaining damages.  Section 50-e of the General Municipal Law requires a notice only where a tort claim is asserted, and this claim is found to be in quasi-contract and warranty, and incidental to the equitable relief sought.  Nor does the statute, which is designed to&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  forewarn a municipality, apply in principle, the occurrences here involved being recent administrative transactions continuously within the city's knowledge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. In awarding damages, the court eliminates the costs of debris removal, cleanup and safeguarding, since they would have been expended anyway; lost profits during the delay in construction, since they are speculative, and corporate expenses claimed by the building owner. </SPAN></P>

The selection committee chose the person who ranked number one on the list. The court denied the division's petition to enjoin respondents from appointing anyone other than complainant.

Such order seems to be contrary to the Civil Service Law and the Public Employees' Fair Employment Act and the State Constitution (art.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The county social services brought a paternity action against the putative father. The putative father sought dismissal of the petition on the ground that the statute authorizing the proceeding, N.Y. Fam. Ct. Act &sect; 517 (Act), was unconstitutional on equal protection grounds. The Act permitted a proceeding by a public welfare official to be brought within 10 years, but limited individuals who brought such proceedings to a two-year statute of limitations. The attorney general intervened pursuant to the request of the court. On review of the matter, the court noted that a prior decision declared the two-year statute of limitations in the Act unconstitutional, the statute itself was constitutional. The court also rejected the putative father's contention that where the proceeding was not brought for more than eight years after the act of conception, the burden on the putative father to find witnesses on his behalf was practically insurmountable.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A proceeding by a Deputy Commissioner of Social Services to declare respondent to be the father of a child born in 1966 was properly brought under section 517 of the Family Court Act, which permits a proceeding by a public welfare official to be brought within 10 years but establishes a 2-year Statute of Limitations where the proceeding is brought by an individual.  A public welfare official is allowed a greater length of time to bring a paternity action because of the city's role as provider of funds for public support. The city should be given the widest latitude in trying to retrieve from an available source moneys expended on public assistance. The 10-year statute does not unconstitutionally deprive a putative father of due process by virtue of the fact that a longer time is allowed a social services official to bring paternity proceedings than&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  is permitted an individual.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants claimed the statute that prohibited the sale and possession of cocaine violated the due process, equal protection, and cruel and unusual punishment clauses of the United States Constitution. Defendants argued that the legislature misclassified cocaine as a &quot;narcotic drug.&quot; The court held that the term &quot;narcotic drug&quot; as used by the Legislature was for those drugs which were the most dangerous and included all the drugs the Legislature considered dangerous. The legislature was fully aware that cocaine was not truly narcotic, and still determined to classify cocaine in the same manner as true narcotic drugs. The court found that it was irrelevant whether cocaine was a narcotic in the strict medical sense. The court concluded that there was enough medical and law enforcement evidence to find a reasonable basis for the legislature to classify cocaine as a &quot;narcotic drug&quot; and to regulate its sale, possession and use. The legislative action had a real and substantial relation to public health, safety, morals and the general welfare and was a valid exercise of the police power of the state.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied the motion to dismiss. The court held that the legislature had not misclassified cocaine as a &quot;narcotic drug.&quot;</SPAN></P>

The court also held that the determination of the Attorney-General was not final and binding in any sense. The court was unable to determine, solely on the papers before it, whether or not the withholding of approval for filing by the Attorney-General was arbitrary and capricious.

The consumers alleged that the PSC refused to hold a &quot;formal hearing&quot;, as required by their regulations. The PSC and utilities filed motions to dismiss the consumers' complaint for failure to state a cause of action. The court transferred the action and held that PSC administrative procedures provided a regularized, orderly process of dispute settlement prior to termination and complied with the requirements of due process, and that the proper vehicle for challenging the PSC's failure to hold a hearing was under N.Y.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants filed a motion to suppress business records seized by the New York Health Department inspectors, alleging that the records had been seized after an illegal, warrantless search, that N.Y.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">New York City Health Department inspectors performed a routine audit at defendant's pharmacy pursuant to N.Y. Pub.

The audit disclosed that sales of non-prescription over-the-counter drugs were excessive. Some weeks after an informal hearing at the health department, the inspectors returned and seized the pharmacy's non-prescription records. Defendant filed this motion to suppress, asserting that N.Y. Pub. Health Law &sect; 3390 was unconstitutional and violated his privacy rights. Defendant also asserted that records were seized after an illegal warrantless search and that Miranda warnings should have been given. The motion was denied, with the court holding that the officers had a statutory right to inspect the records under N.Y. Pub. Health Law &sect; 3333; N.Y. Pub. Health Law &sect; 3390 was not an unconstitutional invasion of the pharmacist's privacy rights, and no Miranda warnings were required prior to an administrative search.</SPAN></P>

The court concluded that there was no question that defendants would not be permitted to inspect the personnel folders as a matter of right in a discovery proceeding. Further the court held that defendants' counsel failed to demonstrate any theory of relevancy or materiality of the information which was contained in the police records. In the absence of a prima facie showing that such information did exist, the court was of the opinion that the records were not discoverable by compulsory process.

Law &sect; 15(2), a different age standard for marriages between males and females was established. A female might have married at age 18 without parental consent, while a male might not have married without consent until he reached age 21. The male, a 20-year-old wishing to marry, filed an action seeking an order to direct the city clerk to issue him a marriage license. On review, the court found that while there might have been valid ends served by restricting the marriage of young males, a desirable end could not have been promoted by prohibited means. The court determined that under &sect; 15(2), there was no guarantee of alike treatment to all those in the classification because the State of New York assigned discretion to the parents. The court held that parents might have used their authority to act on behalf of the State interest or they might have done whatever they pleased. The court ruled that &sect; 15(2) violated the Equal Protection Clause and directed the city clerk to issue a marriage license to the male.</SPAN></P>

Domestic Relations Law ( &sect; 15, subd 2) which establishes a different age standard for marriage in that a female can marry at age 18 without parental consent while a male may not marry without such consent until he reaches age 21 is arbitrary and unconstitutional because it does not provide that all persons similarly circumstanced shall be treated alike. Although there may be a valid State objective by restricting the marriage of young males, this burden of fulfilling the State need is assigned to the parents and there are no guidelines or limitations to assure that the parents will perform their responsibility within the framework of the allegedly valid State objective.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The newspaper ran advertisements for public and private employment in the Republic of South Africa. The commission charged that each advertisement constituted an advertisement by an employer which expressed, directly or indirectly, any limitation, specification, or discrimination as to race or color. The newspaper filed an art. 78 proceeding seeking to prohibit the commission from proceeding with a hearing on the matter. On review, the court found that the advertisement appeared in a state newspaper, addressed to residents of the state, and no doubt such residents, with general knowledge of South Africa, would believe that it made a substantial difference whether an applicant for employment was white or black. The court determined that the commission could proceed with the hearing in order to make a factual record leading to a reasonably expeditious decision and dismissed the newspaper's petition.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court dismissed the newspaper's petition seeking to prohibit the commission from holding a hearing.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a 15-count indictment defendant was charged with the illegal practice of medicine, unlawfully holding himself out as being able to practice medicine, and illegally using the title &quot;physician&quot; in violation of N.Y.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In his motion to dismiss, defendant argued in part that the statute defining the practice of medicine, &sect; 6521, was unconstitutionally overbroad and vague. Defendant also argued that the practice of medicine did not include acupuncture. The court rejected these arguments and denied in part and granted in part defendant's motion to dismiss. The court denied the motion to suppress. First, the court held that in order to declare a law unconstitutional, its invalidity must be demonstrated beyond a reasonable doubt. The court concluded that defendant failed to meet this burden. Second, the court held that whether actions constituted the practice of medicine was dependent upon the facts and not upon the name of the procedure, its origins, or legislative lack of clairvoyance. The court held that the practice of acupuncture was the practice of medicine. The court concluded that the statutes under consideration were designed to prevent such conduct as the indiscriminate application of cauterization and the sticking of needles into human beings by unskilled and unlicensed practitioners.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State Board of Pharmacy, a licensing board under the jurisdiction of the Commissioner of Education, notified the pharmacist to appear before a committee of said board pursuant to N.Y. Educ. Law &sect; 6809 to answer charges that the prescription center, where the pharmacist was the supervisor, was advertising through local newspapers discounts on all drug needs. In response, the pharmacist initiated the action and obtained a preliminary injunction restraining the Board from enforcing the regulation. A few days later, new regulations went into effect amending the existing regulation. Under the new regulation, unprofessional conduct included the advertising of prices and the use of words such as &quot;discount.&quot; Under the new regulation, the posting of prices was not considered advertising. In effect, both regulations prohibited the same conduct. The court held that an assumed state of facts existed which justified the regulation and it was, therefore, held to be constitutional. The State had a legitimate interest to prohibit advertising in the area of prescription drugs.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Regulation which prohibits a pharmacist from advertising discounts in connection with the offering of professional services (8 NYCRR 63.3) is constitutional.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, inmates charged with various offenses in the aftermath of a prison disturbance, filed motions to dismiss the indictments, alleging improper grand jury proceedings, defective indictments, denial of speedy trial, double jeopardy, insufficiency of evidence for indictments, and interests of justice.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following a disturbance at Attica prison, defendants, some of the inmates, were charges with various offenses. Defendants filed motions to dismiss on numerous grounds. The court held that since the grand jury was selected in conformity with law, it did not need to mirror the demographic make-up of the community. Since defendants' crimes were of the kind not generally disregarded, kidnapping, coercion, etc., their claim of selective enforcement was not valid. The record of the grand jury proceedings indicated that the evidence was sufficient for all indictments. Since N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law art. 40 and art. 200 allowed separate counts for each victim and if the same crime was committed in different ways, and since double jeopardy did not attach to administrative proceedings, there was no double jeopardy bar. Because the prosecutor could file indictments any time within the statute of limitations, and the time period for a speedy trial did not begin until such filing, defendants did not lose their right to a speedy trial. Thus, the court denied the motions in all respects.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied all motions in every respect, since the record showed that all statutory requirements protecting defendants' rights had been followed, the penalties defendants received in prison were not a criminal proceedings to which double jeopardy would attach, the time period for calculating defendants' right to a speedy trial began when the indictments were filed, and justice did not mandate dismissal of the indictments.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Grand jury -- selection of jurors -- selection of grand jurors not reviewable on motion -- selective enforcement prevails only if such crimes are not prosecuted elsewhere in New York -- presumption of regularity in Grand Jury proceedings -- duplicitous counts permissible if individual situation so requires -- speedy trial requirement not violated where trial period has been tolled -- administrative punishment does not sustain claim of double jeopardy -- motion to dismiss must allege that Grand Jury evidence was not legally sufficient -- dismissal of indictments in furtherance of justice not demonstrated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Statutes with respect to the qualifications of grand jurors are not unconstitutional in that they result in a Grand Jury whose members are not mathematically proportionate in sex, race and age to the population of Wyoming County.  The court and the prosecutor made a sincere effort to empanel a Grand Jury that was not infected with bias or prejudice toward anyone subject to its scrutiny.  In addition, the court lacks jurisdiction to review the acts of another Justice of the Supreme Court&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  in drawing the Grand Jury.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. While criminal acts may have been committed by agents or officers of the State during and after retaking of the facilities at Attica and no indictments have been returned against persons other than Attica inmates, defendants are not being subjected to selective enforcement of the law.  The principle of selective enforcement applies only when it is designed to discriminate against persons prosecuted, without any intention to follow it up by general enforcement against others.  The crimes charged in the indictments, kidnapping, coercion and assault, are not generally disregarded anywhere in the State of New York.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. There is a strong presumption of regularity that attaches to Grand Jury proceedings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Counts of the indictment having identical wording have not violated the prohibition against duplicitous counts.  Those counts are plain and specific and presumptively charge the defendants therein with separate offenses.  Articles 40 and 200 of the CPL allow: (1) charging of lesser included offenses, (2) separate counts for separate victims and (3) separate counts if the same crime may be committed in different ways.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. A right to a speedy trial occurs&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  only &quot;after a criminal action is commenced&quot; ( CPL 30.20, subd. 1).  The records indicate as to each defendant that the six-month ready for trial period has not elapsed but has been tolled pursuant to the provisions of subdivision 4 of CPL 30.30.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. Subdivision 1 of CPL 40.30 declares that a person is prosecuted within the meaning of CPL 40.20 &quot;when he is charged therewith by an accusatory instrument filed in a court of this state or of any jurisdiction within the United States.&quot; Therefore, administrative punishment does not sustain a claim of double jeopardy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. Subdivision 2 of CPL 210.30 requires that a motion to dismiss on the ground of insufficiency of evidence must allege that there is reasonable cause to believe that the Grand Jury evidence was not legally sufficient and defendants have not sustained their burden of demonstrating that there is such reasonable cause. Nevertheless the court has inspected the Grand Jury minutes and finds sufficient legal evidence, which if uncontroverted or unexplained, would support convictions by the triers of the facts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. No sufficient basis for dismissal of the indictments in the furtherance of justice has been demonstrated.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner aid recipient sought review of a determination made by respondent Commissioner of Social Services, which after a hearing affirmed the determination of respondent City Social Service Agency to reduce the recipient's grant of aid to a disabled person by recouping payments made to him to which he was not entitled, pursuant to 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 404.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The recipient received aid to disabled. But unknown to the agency, he also received disability payments from the Veteran's Administration. The agency sent the recipient notice of intent to reduce public assistance and to recoup the amount paid in excess. The recipient requested a hearing, and the commissioner agreed with the determination of the agency. The recipient sought to annul the decision, but the court agreed with the findings. The court denied the recipient's claim that he did not receive adequate notice of the charges or an opportunity to defend against them. The court held that he was sufficiently conversant with the hearing procedure and that the right to counsel was indicated in the notice he received. The court held that a prior three-judge court had determined that 18 N.Y. C.R.R. 348.4 and its regulations were valid against the claim that they violated the Due Process, Equal Protection, and Supremacy clauses of the Constitution. The court held that &sect; 404 specifically provided that when a recipient of assistance received more than the amount to which he was entitled, any future payment due would be decreased.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the findings of the agency.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Social services -- notice of fair hearing -- petitioner was advised of his right to counsel and fair hearing -- State not required to support needy irrespective of their conduct -- recoupment by Social Services agency does not violate Social Security Act.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. In a proceeding to annul a determination which reduced petitioner's grant of aid to a disabled person and recouped payments made to him to which he was not entitled, the petition is dismissed.  Petitioner was given adequate notice of the charges against him and an opportunity to defend against the proposed action of respondent.  The notice stated that &quot;If you believe that your assistance should not be reduced, you may request a state fair hearing * * *.  If you request a fair hearing, a notice will be sent to you informing you of the time and place of your hearing&quot; and that petitioner was entitled to be represented by an attorney.  Clearly, petitioner received due notice of the charges against him and that he was entitled to be represented.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The provisions of 18 NYCRR 348.4 do not violate the New York Constitution and the Social Services Law requiring aid, care and support&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  for the needy. The Constitution (art. XVII, &sect; 1) and the Social Services Law ( &sect; 131, subd. 1; &sect; 131-a, subds. 1, 3) set forth the general policies of the State to provide for the needy insofar as funds are available for that purpose but they do not require that every inhabitant of this State, normally qualified for such aid, is entitled to be supported regardless of his actions and conduct.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The New York statute and regulations requiring repayment of assistance benefits do not violate due process or equal protection.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. In view of section 404 of title 42 of the United States Code which provides that when a recipient of assistance has received more than the amount to which he is entitled, the Secretary shall decrease any future payment due him, recoupment by the social services agency does not violate the Social Security Act. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Police on routine patrol observed the arrestees' vehicle unattended in a restricted parking area. Upon looking through the windows of the illegally parked vehicle the officers saw what they believed to be an American flag with a peace symbol in the upper left-hand corner. Drugs were discovered in the vehicle. The arrestees were arrested for desecration of a flag in violation of N.Y. Gen. Bus. Law &sect; 136(A) and for possession of dangerous drugs in violation of N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 220.05. The court ruled in favor of the arrestees with regard to their claims for false arrest. The arrestees' claims for malicious prosecution were dismissed. The arrestees were awarded compensatory damages. The court held that even if the police believed the &quot;flag&quot; to be desecrated, there still was no justification for the arrest, since the flag certainly was not exposed to public view. The court found that what attracted the police to the scene was the illegal parking of the vehicle, and the police were justified in checking the vehicle and to issue parking violations, which was not done.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. On a summer night about midnight, several college students drove in a panel truck to a quiet public beach, and parked the truck there in a no-parking zone, and went on foot about 100 yards further down the beach behind some sand dunes.  Two State Troopers on patrol saw the empty parked truck and approached it and saw, on its interior wall behind the driver's seat, a piece of paper or cardboard on which there were drawn, in crayon, red and white stripes and a peace symbol in its upper left corner.  The student who owned the truck consented that the truck be searched; and thus, in its glove compartment, the troopers found&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  a vial containing some amphetamine pills. The students, but not the one who owned the truck, were arrested and charged with possessing dangerous drugs (Penal Law, &sect; 220.05) and with exhibiting a picture or design on a flag of the United States (General Business Law, &sect; 136, subd. a).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. However, this warrantless arrest was illegal, since there was no reasonable cause to believe that the alleged offenses or crimes had been committed ( CPL 140.10; Code Crim. Pro., &sect; 177, subd. 1).  The students were not arrested for unlawful parking. The crayon picture or design was not a flag of the United States and it was not &quot;exposed to public view&quot; (General Business Law, &sect; 136, subd. a); moreover the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit has adjudged said subdivision unconstitutional as applied to an American-like flag with a peace symbol. As for the amphetamine pills, the students were not &quot;in the automobile at the time such drug was found&quot; nor were they in &quot;physical possession&quot; of the pills (Penal Law, &sect; 220.25; &sect; 10.00, subd. 8).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. For the next 13 hours the students were under arrest and were booked, photographed, fingerprinted, and finally arraigned and bailed.  About&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  a month thereafter, a Town Justice held a suppression hearing and suppressed the seized evidence and dismissed the informations.  The People did not appeal.  The students' legal expenses were $ 100.  For the false arrest and imprisonment and the arrest record, the three students are respectively awarded $ 3,000, $ 2,500, and $ 2,500 damages against the State of New York.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. However, there was no proof that the State Troopers had actual malice, and hence the cause of action for malicious prosecution is dismissed.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was indicted by the Special Narcotics Courts of the Supreme Court of the State of New York sitting in the City of New York, New York County. The crimes were committed in a drugstore that was located in the County of Bronx, City of New York. Defendant claimed that the grand jury which indicted him and the petit jury that would try him were illegally constituted. The court held that N.Y. Jud.

The court recognized that it had the power to declare that the provisions of &sect; 177 were unconstitutional, it declined to so, and reluctantly stated that the legislature's actions were constitutional. The court found that the trial of defendant in a county other than that in which the crimes were committed raised constitutional issues under the Sixth Amendment.

The property owners sought to invalidate a City Local Law No. 24, which repealed the maximum base rent provisions and the return hardship provisions in the City Rent and Rehab. Laws. The property owners and the City filed motions for summary judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The City passed Local Law No. 24, which repealed the maximum base rent entitled to be received by property owners and also repealed the basis for calculating hardship rent increases. The property owners challenged the repeals. The court held that Local Law No. 24, &sect; 2 was invalid because it contradicted 1971 N.Y. Laws 372, which prohibited the City from passing local laws or ordinances that subjected the property owners to more stringent or restrictive provisions of regulation and control than those that were already in effect at the time 1971 N.Y. Laws 372 became effective. The court found that the City's adoption of Local Law No. 24 repealed a provision which in fact subjected the property owners to more stringent regulation and control. The court declared that Local Law No. 24, &sect; 2 was void. The court went on to find that Local Law No. 24, &sect; 3 repealed a section of Local Law No. 30, &sect; 12, which was not in effect at the time 1971 N.Y. Laws 372 became effective and, therefore, was a valid local law. The court conceded that its ruling had countering effects, but stated that the resolution of the rent control issue was for the state legislature and city council.</SPAN></P>

The court concluded that the statute could be read as if it contained the condition that any trial before a hearing officer had to be on consent of the parties in order to sustain the constitutionality of the section. Moreover, &sect;110(e) did provide for the assignment of actions and proceedings to hearing officers. Thus, &sect; 110(e) could reasonably be given a construction that did not do violence to the state constitution.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant brought before the court a motion for an order declaring N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 250.20&nbsp;unconstitutional, or in the alternative providing for reciprocal disclosure of witnesses, i.e., alibi. The district attorney had served upon defendant a demand for a bill of particulars with respect to an affirmative defense that defendant was elsewhere than at the scene of the crime.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant indicated in his moving papers his intention to assert an alibi defense upon the trial.

The district attorney suggested to the court that the overall practice of discovery now extant in the State of New York by virtue of statute and case law might be sufficient to satisfy the requirements of the due process provisions of the United States Constitution. The court held that although &sect; 240 did not afford a liberal and broad discovery of various items and categories of evidence as the people contended, it did adopt a middle-of-the-road approach, halfway between the extreme liberal position and the extreme prosecution approach. The court held that N.Y. Crim. Proc.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought a declaration that &sect; 250.20 was unconstitutional because it did not provide for reciprocity of disclosure and that he did not have to comply with the alibi statute in order to present alibi witnesses and testimony at the trial.

The court held that the alibi statute was constitutional, but that there was an implied provision of reciprocity in the statute from case law and other statutory provisions. The court found, inter alia, that (1) the norm to be applied in determining whether a notice of alibi statute was constitutional was whether defendant enjoyed reciprocal discovery against the state; (2) a statute was not be declared unconstitutional unless required to do so by most cogent reasons or compelled by unanswerable grounds and unless such conclusion was unavoidable; and (3) N.Y.

The court denied defendant's motion to dismiss. The court held that defendant was not deprived of the right to plead guilty in local criminal court to driving while intoxicated and failure to keep right. Defendant's contentions on pleading in criminal court were unsupported by conclusive factual affirmations that he truly sought to do as he had asserted. The court decided to hold the motion to suppress in abeyance pending outcome of a hearing. The court denied the motion to inspect the grand jury minutes.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant brought before the court a motion for an order declaring the New York &quot;notice of alibi&quot; statute,&nbsp;N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 250.20, unconstitutional and permitting him to offer an alibi defense at the trial despite his failure to serve the notice required by that statute. In the alternative, defendant requested that, should the court find the statute constitutional, the people be required to afford him reciprocal discovery.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was indicted and the people, in keeping with the usual practice, attached a demand for a notice of alibi to the copy of the indictment that was served upon defendant. The court held that there was a strong presumption of constitutionality that attached to any statute duly enacted by the legislature. Courts at nisi prius should be most reluctant to hold a statute unconstitutional and could properly do so only where that result was inescapable. The court's analysis of N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 250.20 in light of other case law revealed that the conclusion of unconstitutionality was not inescapable. But the court held that &sect; 250.20 was amenable to a construction requiring reciprocal disclosure. While the court could not hold that &sect; 250.20 was unconstitutional, the court was required to enforce it judiciously so as to avoid the risk of committing reversible error. By affording reciprocal discovery pretrial, the court could satisfy the requirements of due process enunciated by the supreme court.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment forbids enforcement of a notice of alibi rule unless reciprocal discovery rights are given to criminal defendants.  Under subdivision 2 of CPL 250.20 the court has discretion in deciding whether or not preclusion should be ordered upon a failure to serve a notice of alibi. Courts might now hold that preclusion may be invoked under the statute only where reciprocal disclosure has been available to the defendant.  Such a rule made binding on all New York courts would render the &quot;notice of alibi&quot; statute constitutional.  Accordingly, a motion to declare the statute unconstitutional is denied and a motion to require the People to disclose their alibi rebuttal witnesses is granted.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner decedent's mother filed the claim asserting that she was the sole beneficiary of the estate in the proceedings to approve settlement of a wrongful death action, to settle the account of the administratrix, and for other relief with reference to administrative expenses and debts. Petitioner decedent's children also claimed entitlement to the decedent's estate.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decedent died after an automobile accident, leaving eight illegitimate children. The decedent's mother and the children both petitioned to receive the damages awarded in subsequent wrongful death litigation. The court noted that N.Y. Est. Powers &amp; Trusts Law &sect; 4-1.2(a) para. 2 specifically denied to illegitimate children the right to be distributees of a father, unless a court of competent jurisdiction during the lifetime of the father entered an order establishing paternity within two years after the child's birth. No such order had been entered establishing the paternity of the eight children. The court further observed that illegitimate children were permitted to inherit from their mother and to be distributees of their mother's estate equally with legitimate children. The court concluded that, to the extent the statutes denied the children the right to participate in the distribution of the proceeds of an action for the wrongful death of their putative father, they were denied the equal protection of the law guaranteed by U.S. Const. amend. XIV and N.Y. Const. art. I, &sect; 11. The court granted the children's claim to inherit the wrongful death award.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted the claim filed by the decedent's children to the proceeds of the decedent's estate, including the wrongful death settlement.

Without an order of filiation, the children must establish that the decedent was in fact their father and that as a result of their father's death they sustained a pecuniary loss. Having proven this, the balance of the settlement of the action after expenses should be distributed to the children of decedent. </SPAN></P>

C.P.L.R. 78 for relief after respondent school board confirmed the suspension of the teacher without pay until all the charges against him were disposed of. The teacher requested the rescission of the suspension, the striking of every reference to it from his personnel file, and to have been reinstated with all back pay and benefits.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The teacher contended that no statute authorized his suspension without pay and that if any statute did, it was unconstitutional for depriving him of due process. The court denied the teacher's petition. The court determined that the school board had a valid governmental interest in protecting the health and safety of the school children entrusted to its care. The school board must also have protected the governmental interest that there should have been no gifts of the public's money. The court determined that as long as the teacher was able to have been reimbursed when found innocent, the government's interest should have prevailed. Therefore, the court concluded that a prior hearing was not constitutionally required before a school board could have suspended a teacher without pay on charges that, if proven, would have warranted his dismissal. Finally, the court determined that article 78 was not available for interlocutory relief and that if the teacher was aggrieved by the hearing then he had the right to appeal when there had been a final determination.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner police officer sought an injunction prohibiting respondent Commissioner of the Suffolk County Police Department (commissioner) from requiring the officer to submit to a polygraph examination about the misconduct of a fellow officer.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The officer and his partner were on the scene of an apparent suicide. The partner was seen taking money from the deceased's pocket. During the investigation regarding the money, the officer was told to take a polygraph. Although he appeared for a polygraph test he was too agitated to proceed. The commissioner ordered that the officer take the test or be dismissed. The officer sought an injunction against the commissioner. The court recognized that police officers were protected by the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination. Therefore, the court found that the officer could not be required to waive his immunity. Although protected from self-incrimination by the Fifth Amendment, the court found that this did not extend to a protection of the officer's employment. The commissioner's investigation into the partner's misconduct was specifically, directly, and narrowly related to the officer's performance of his duties and was therefore within his discretion in managing the police department. The court acknowledged the controversy over the accuracy of the polygraph test, but found that did not preclude it from being useful within limits. The court dismissed the petition.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court dismissed the officer's petition to enjoin the commissioner from requiring him to take a polygraph test.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Civil service -- police -- submission to polygraph examination -- police officer during course of departmental investigation of alleged misconduct of fellow officer may be compelled to submit to polygraph examination or risk dismissal -- privilege against self incrimination is not bar to dismissal of police officer who refuses to answer questions relating to performance of official duties -- refusal to submit to polygraph examination constitutes justiciable controversy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. In an article 78 proceeding instituted to enjoin the Commissioner of the Suffolk County Police Department from requiring the petitioner, a police officer, to either submit to a polygraph examination during the course of a departmental investigation of alleged misconduct of a fellow officer or risk being suspended or dismissed, the petition is dismissed.  The Commissioner having a justifiable interest in ascertaining whether the petitioner is telling the truth and the polygraph being a useful investigative tool whose results are frequently reliable within recognized limits, there is no constitutional prohibition which petitioner may raise against testifying and there is no statutory&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  bar to the use of polygraph examinations by either public or private employees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The privilege against self incrimination is not a bar to dismissal of a police officer who refuses to answer questions specifically, directly and narrowly relating to the performance of his official duties when he is not required to waive his immunity with respect to the use of his answers in a subsequent criminal proceeding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Although the Commissioner has not ordered the petitioner to submit to a polygraph examination, an order will follow if his &quot;request&quot; is refused.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs brought an action seeking a permanent injunction restraining defendants from engaging in a concerted work stoppage. The court stated that the language of N.Y. Civ. Serv. Law &sect; 210 forbidding concerted work stoppages by teachers was clear. This law, which denied the right to strike to certain public employees, was an expression of the legislature's conclusion that in an orderly society, the benefits to be gained from the use of a strike in aid of collective bargaining were outweighed by the damage to the community as a whole when certain necessary public functions were brought to a halt by the strike. Nowhere was such damage more apparent than when the orderly operation of a city's school's was disrupted. The court stated that &sect; 210 could not be intentionally violated, legally or morally, on the theory that it was being &quot;tested.&quot; The court held that its duty to issue the injunction was clear, and that defendants' duty to obey the injunction was also clear.</SPAN></P>

The court held that, where a public officer such as a policeman was called as a witness in the performance of his public duty, the prosecution had a duty to make available to the court any information in its possession or in the police department's possession which might go to the issue of defendant's guilt, including evidence affecting the credibility of the police officer. The court could not, by quashing the subpoena, preclude the possibility of defense discovery of such evidence if it existed.

The court held that each of these words, especially because of the word &quot;or&quot; separating them, stood by itself and that the others that followed &quot;obscene&quot; did not and were not meant to define, describe, enlarge or circumscribe the word &quot;obscene.&quot; The court held that the word &quot;obscene&quot; could be interpreted without the help or hindrance of the words that followed in the statute.

The court declared that both statutes were unconstitutional and granted defense summary judgments dismissing the complaints. It held that the definition of &quot;obscene&quot; found in N.Y.

C.P.L.R. 6330 incorporated the definition of &quot;obscene&quot; used in the penal statute, it, too, was unconstitutionally overbroad.

In its answer, respondent School District sought a declaration that it is not bound by the agreement between the city and the corporation because it was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city and the corporation entered into an agreement wherein the city partially exempted the corporation from local and municipal taxes and from such taxes that were levied by or on behalf of any taxing jurisdiction described in N.Y. Priv. Hous. Fin. Law &sect; 577(1)(b). The School District claimed the agreement did not limit the amount of taxes it could levy. The corporation contended that the School District was limited by the agreement. The court agreed with the corporation. Section 577(1)(b) provided that the maximum tax liability on the corporation, as a public housing development corporation, was 40 percent of the value of the property included in the project, or $ 45,500, whichever was lower. Under &sect; 577(1)(b), because the city acted on behalf of the School District in levying the district's taxes, the tax exemption that bound the city also bound the School District. Thus, the tax was capped at $ 45,500. A constitutional issue based on a lack of adequate notice that was raised by the School District failed because the School District stipulated that it had actual knowledge of the resolution and agreement.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The City Council of a city enacted a resolution, and the city entered into an agreement with petitioner, for the purpose of providing low income housing and granting petitioner exemption from local and municipal taxes to the extent of 40% of &quot;the value of the property&quot; included in the project but the tax liability in no event should be less than $ 45,500 per year.  &quot;Value of the property&quot; upon which local and municipal taxes are based means the assessed valuation of the property as it appears on the city's assessment rolls, and not, as claimed by the city, the cost of construction of the completed project.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Section 577 (subd. 1, par. [b]) of the Private Housing Finance Law provides that where a municipality acts on behalf&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of another taxing jurisdiction in assessing real property for the purpose of taxation or in levying taxes therefor, the action of the local legislative body of such municipality in granting tax exemption shall have the effect of exempting the property from local and municipal taxes including school taxes levied by or on behalf of both such taxing jurisdictions.  Under this section, the tax exemption granted by the city applies to the tax levied by the School District.  The School District is bound by the agreement between the city and petitioner.  The School District had actual knowledge of the resolution and agreement since the fall of 1972 and thus had ample opportunity to adjust its budget and finances.  If any constitutional defect as to notice existed originally, it was rectified by the resolution adopted by the council on May 16, 1972 which ratified and confirmed the resolution of June 4, 1970 authorizing the tax abatement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Since the School District must base the taxes levied by it on the city's assessment rolls, it may not question the assessment fixed by the city, nor the method of arriving at the assessed valuation, nor may it raise any valid objection to the granting&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of any exemption or abatement of taxes by the city.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The School District is entitled, against the city retroactively, to its fair proportionate share of the minimum tax. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court adjudicated defendant, a juvenile, to be a juvenile delinquent. The court found that defendant had committed acts which, if committed by an adult, would constitute the crimes of murder, first-degree robbery and grand larceny. The court denied defendant's preliminary motion for a jury trial. Defendant's law guardian filed a motion asking the court to refrain from ordering any disposition under N.Y. Fam. Ct.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a bench trial the court found that the defendant had, in concert with two other persons, robbed and fatally bludgeoned a victim. Defendant's law guardian filed a motion requesting the court to refrain from sentencing defendant to an indefinite reformatory term as allowed by &sect; 758(b); the guardian asserted that because defendant had been denied a jury at his disposition hearing, sentencing him to an indefinite reformatory term would violate defendant's constitutional rights under U.S. Const. amends. V, VIII, and XIV. The guardian also argued that the distinction that N.Y. Fam. Ct. Act &sect; 758(b) made, for dispositional purposes, between older and younger juveniles was unconstitutionally discriminatory. The court sentenced defendant pursuant to &sect; 758(b). There was no jury trial right in juvenile adjudication hearings. Defendant's incarceration in a reception center instead of a state training school was not cruel or unusual punishment and did not violate his equal protection rights; the State had a legitimate interest in protecting younger, detained juveniles from more dangerous, older ones. The seriousness of defendant's crimes dictated the imposition of a serious disposition.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, the owners of adult bookstores, were charged by the New York City ,New York Department of Consumer Affairs with maintaining places or premises of public amusement without a license, pursuant to New York City, N.Y., Admin. Code &sect;&sect; B32-1.0 and B32-4.0. The owners challenged those provisions as violating their First Amendment constitutional rights, and alleged that the ordinances constituted an impermissible prior restraint.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The department proceeded against the owners for maintaining places of public amusement without a license. The question for consideration was whether the licensing scheme constituted a valid exercise of the police power in an area, which clearly impinged on First Amendment freedoms. New York City, N.Y., Admin. Code &sect; B32-1.0(a) provided for a license to operate a place of public amusement upon such terms and conditions as the commissioner deemed necessary for proper regulation and good order, and New York City, N.Y., Admin. Code &sect; B32-4.0 stated that such licenses, in the discretion of the commissioner, could have been subject to conditions which, in his judgment, might have been essential for the welfare and benefit of the city. The court held that the sections were unconstitutional on their face in that they subjected the exercise of freedoms protected by the First Amendment to the prior restraint of a license without narrow, objective and definite standards to guide the licensing authority.</SPAN></P>

The sections give unlimited discretion to the Commissioner of Consumer Affairs to establish conditions for the granting of a license, and since the showing of motion pictures involves the exercise of First Amendment freedoms, the statutes constitute an unconstitutional prior restraint of the right to free expression.  </SPAN></P>

The court held that a person accused of a crime had a constitutionally protected right to the court appointment of counsel to represent him where he could not otherwise afford to pay for private counsel. The court then concluded that an indigent parent, faced with the loss of a child's society, as well as the possibility of criminal charges, N.Y. Fam. Ct. Act &sect;&sect; 1014, 1055; N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 260.10, was entitled to the assistance of counsel with assigned counsel if the parent lacked the means to retain a lawyer.

It does not matter that the proceeding is a civil proceeding. Section 433 provides that the court must inform respondent of the contents of the petition and advise him of his right to counsel. While the Family Court did tell respondent that he had a right to counsel, when respondent stated that he could not afford one, the Family Court should have advised him of his right to court-appointed counsel.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Because of a critical backlog of drug cases pending in the courts of New York, the legislature passed a law to permit the creation of Special Narcotics Parts to handle only narcotics cases. Defendant filed a motion to dismiss his indictment, and argued that the legislative scheme adopted was unconstitutional. Defendant withdrew his motion to suppress a statement when the prosecution declared it would not use the statement. The court ruled that the motion to dismiss must be denied. The court held that the legislative authority for the adoption of the narcotics court system was a general law, not a local law, even though by virtue of population it only applied to New York City. The law uniformly applied to every citizen within the jurisdictions affected. The court rejected the argument that the scheme denied a right to trial by a jury of a defendant's peers, noting that any number of cases are routinely tried on motions to change venue, without damage to the defendant's constitutional rights.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Special Narcotics Parts -- article 5-B of Judiciary Law establishing Special Narcotics Parts of Supreme Court in cities with population of one million or more is not </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">unconstitutional</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> as local law -- Grand Jury of Special Narcotics Parts, which in practice is New York County Grand Jury has power to indict for narcotics violations in any county without violating Constitution -- trial by petit jury in county other than that in which act was done does not deny defendant right to trial by jury of peers -- </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">section 177-a of Judiciary Law</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> does not preclude hearing cases commenced prior to September, 1972.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. In April, 1972, the Legislature enacted article 5-B of the Judiciary Law establishing Special Narcotics Parts of the Supreme Court, in cities with a population of one million or more.  Article 5-B does not violate section 17 of article III of the State Constitution which prohibits the Legislature from passing a private or local bill providing for changes of venue in civil or criminal cases.  It is not a private bill changing&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  venue. It applies uniformly to all narcotics defendants, rather than to a particular defendant or case.  The reference to population in article 5-B does not designate and identify the place affected.  It defines the problem in terms of population.  Article 5-B is not a local law. The class, based on population, is reasonable because of the problems peculiar to the City of New York.  The consolidation of narcotics prosecutions in the City of New York requires the utilization of manpower across county lines and it is the only such city.  The Legislature's action to solve the problem does not constitute a local law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The Grand Jury of the Special Narcotics Parts, which in practice is a New York County Grand Jury, is properly empowered to indict for narcotics offenses in any county.  The procedure for Grand Jury presentment set forth in subdivision (iii) of section 177-d of the Judiciary Law is proper exercise of legislative power. Nothing in section 6 of article I of the State Constitution or the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution mandates that a crime must be presented to a Grand Jury in the county where the crime was committed, or prohibits the Legislature from&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  passing a law which directs that the offender be tried in a county other than that in which the act was done.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Trial by a petit jury of a county other than that in which the act was done does not deny defendant the right to a trial by a jury of his peers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4.  Section 177-a of the Judiciary Law does not preclude the court from hearing and determining cases commenced prior to September, 1972, when the Special Narcotics Courts were to be established.  </SPAN></P>

Moreover, even though the City could establish reasonable classifications regarding the licensing of those individuals involved in occupations affecting the public interest, the court found that the City failed to justify the classification of applicants for taxicab driver's licenses into citizens and non-citizens.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant county legislature submitted for court approval a redistricting plan. Three individual plaintiffs asked the court to adopt a weighted voting scheme. Plaintiff-intervenor village submitted its own plan for approval.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A county submitted for court approval a redistricting plan that contained 24 legislative districts. Three individuals argued that the plan exceeded the permissible population deviation and was unconstitutional; they proposed a weighted voting scheme as a temporary measure for the upcoming elections. A village submitted a similar plan, with the exception that the boundaries of two legislative districts were altered to include the entire village within one district rather than, as in the county plan, within two districts. The court rejected the weighted voting plan and the village plan, and adopted the county plan in its entirety. The court rejected the argument that the 9.02 percent variation between the largest and smallest districts was constitutionally impermissible. Larger deviations had been previously approved in decisions dealing with local legislative bodies. Courts allowed a broader scope of permissible deviations in state apportionment cases than in federal apportionment cases and had a more tolerant attitude toward the practical justification for such deviations. This tolerance was even greater when courts dealt with local, intrastate legislative bodies.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court adopted, approved, and imposed by judicial decree the county plan as the districting plan for the upcoming elections of county legislators and as the interim districting plan for the county beginning the following year, to be effective until it was superseded or adopted as the permanent plan.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional law -- apportionment of County Legislature -- plan of reapportionment of County Legislature providing for 24 districts and population deviation between largest and smallest districts of 9.02% is constitutionally valid -- village located in two towns seeks placement of village in one district which County Legislature rejected by adhering to town lines; no valid reason offered for changing Legislature's policy by judicial flat -- no support exists for weighted voting plan and it is rejected -- County Legislature's plan is adopted for 1973 elections and as final plan on stated conditions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. A plan of reapportionment for the Onondaga County Legislature proposed by such Legislature provides for 24 legislative districts.  The largest district has a population 3.96% over the mean district population and the smallest district is 5.06% under the mean.  The total deviation between the largest and smallest districts is 9.02%.  Such deviation and the average deviation of 2.67% is within constitutionally permissible limits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The Village of North Syracuse lies in two towns.  Under the County Legislature's plan, town boundary lines are adhered to so that the portion of&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the village lying in one town is placed in one district and the portion lying in the other town is in a second district.  The Village of North Syracuse objects to such division claiming that the whole of the village be in one district.  The County Legislature considered the village's proposal and rejected it.  No valid reason for not accepting the decision of the County Legislature has been offered.  To override the policy of the Legislature would be an unwarranted act of judicial interference in a legislative function.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Individual plaintiffs ask for a weighted voting plan.  The computer analysis that would be required has not been done.  No reason for discarding the County Legislature's plan for a weighted voting scheme has been suggested.  Weighted voting is rejected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The County Legislature's plan is adopted as the interim districting plan for the 1973 elections and under stated conditions as the final districting plan.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff teacher brought an action against defendant state teachers retirement system seeking an injunction restoring him to his former position with back pay, and the system moved to dismiss the complaint arguing that involuntary retirement was proper due to the teacher's blindness.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A tenured elementary school teacher took extended sick leave due to vision problems and eventually became blind. After completing a rehabilitation program he sought to return to work; a medical examination determined that he was capable of working with limitations. The board of education, however, placed him on disability retirement. The teacher argued that involuntary retirement violated his constitutional rights because he had not been afforded a hearing. The retirement system claimed that a hearing was merely a formality because the teacher's blindness was not disputed. The court held that N.Y. Educ. Law &sect; 511(1) violated due process to the extent that it permitted enforced retirement of a tenured teacher without a hearing. The teacher's blindness did not render the hearing a formality because the issue was physical capacity to teach, not blindness. Under N.Y. Educ. Law &sect; 3004 blindness was not per se disabling. The teacher was entitled to reinstatement to his former position together with all back pay and benefits.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court ordered the teacher reinstated to his former position and denied his motion for an injunction as moot. The retirement system's motion to dismiss was denied.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So much of subdivision 1 of section 511 of the Education Law as purports to authorize the involuntary retirement of a blind, tenured teacher, without an adversary hearing, is unconstitutional and void (cf. Education Law, &sect; 3004).  The court directs that the blind teacher be reinstated with back pay.  </SPAN></P>

After the enactment of certain regulations, they were, inter alia, told to obtain licenses pursuant to the regulations.

Defendants sought to have the action dismissed and to have the law declared constitutional. The court denied plaintiffs' request, noting that, inter alia, there was no showing of any direct restraint on interstate commerce, nor any showing that the legislation would in any way discriminate against those engaged in interstate commerce.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The executor of the estate and beneficiaries sought construction of the decedent's will.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decedent made bequests, with conditional reversionary interests to several charitable organizations, which were found to be unincorporated parts of other entities. The decedent also made substitute gifts in two codicils, which did not mention the restrictions. The court held that the bequests were gifts upon restriction consistent with the nature of the gifts as allowed by N.Y. Est. Powers &amp; Trusts Law &sect;&sect; 6-4.5, 6-4.6, and 6-3.2(a)(1)(B), (C), and not charitable trusts. The court held that the remaindermen would be entitled to assert their interests under N.Y. Est. Powers &amp; Trusts Law &sect; 6-5.1, if the conditions that would have given rise to those interests were met. Because the organizations to which the bequests were made were parts of other entities, the court held that the testator intended the gifts to go to the actual legal entities. Since the codicils, which made substitute gifts, did not speak to the restrictions contained in the will, the court determined that the testator intended for the restrictions to apply to the substitute gifts.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Testator bequeathed shares of stock of Argo Oil Corporation and of various other oil corporations to several different religious and charitable institutions.

The will was made in 1956, and codicils in 1961 and 1965, and testator died in 1969.  These bequests are outright gifts, with a restriction which is enforceable by the State Attorney-General (EPTL [eff. Setp. 1, 1967] 1-2.15; 6-3.2, subd. [a], par. [1], cls.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. &quot;Christ the King Seminary&quot; is not a legal entity, but is the school of Theology of St. Bonaventure University.  The bequest shall be paid to said university and shall be applied by said university to the benefit of its said school of theology.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Similarly, a bequest to &quot;St. Elizabeth's Convent&quot; shall be paid to the Franciscan Sisters of Allegany, New York, Inc., and shall be applied by said religious corporation to the benefit of its present St. Elizabeth's Residence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Similarly, a bequest of $ 500 to &quot;Missionary Poor Chares of St. Bonaventure, New York&quot; shall be paid to a New Jersey religious corporation whose name is the Province of Immaculate Conception, and shall be expended by said corporation for the benefit of the Missionary Poor Clares, so called, at Christ&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the King Seminary at St. Bonaventure, New York.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. In a codicil, testator stated that he had sold all of his Argo Oil stock and therefore he substituted, to the legatees of that stock, shares of Gulf Oil stock, Texaco Oil stock, Standard Oil of California stock, and Ohio Oil stock.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff State sought a temporary injunction, pursuant to 1973 N.Y. Laws ch. 585, to prevent defendants, members of the cemetery workers union, from continuing a strike or lockout. The Governor had issued an executive order invoking the law. His order stated that a labor dispute existed that resulted in an actual threat to the health and welfare of state residents. The union contended that the statute was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The union contended that the law was, on its face and as applied, unconstitutional. It also contended that an emergency health condition did not factually exist. The court noted that the factual determination of an emergency was solely within the governor's power and that the court ought not to usurp his power. The grant of power to the governor was a valid emergency measure. In any event the evidence established that the governor had not abused the power granted to him, and that he had not acted arbitrarily or capriciously. The statute, as an emergency use of the state's police power did not facially offend the federal or state constitutions. The legislature could validly proclaim it to be the public policy of the state that, upon the occurrence of an emergency health hazard, cemetery workers could not continue a strike because their services were essential to the public health, welfare, and human dignity of the state's residents. The court noted that the union's conduct was an affront to the state's declared public policy that the body of a deceased person should be decently buried as soon as possible after death.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff customers filed a motion for a preliminary injunction to enjoin defendant public utility from discontinuing gas and electric services to their premises during the pendency of their action, which sought a declaratory judgment and a permanent injunction on the grounds that N.Y.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The customers contended that the statute was unconstitutional because it did not provide an opportunity for a hearing before an impartial hearing officer prior to the discontinuance of utility service. The court refused to grant the preliminary injunction because it found that the customers were not likely to ultimately succeed in their action as they failed to demonstrate that they were denied due process. The court did not determine whether public utility's discontinuance of service was state action, and found that the threat of termination of utility services for nonpayment involved none of the special irreversible economic hardships requiring prior judicial proceedings, as would wage garnishment or termination of public assistance payments. Even assuming a property right, the customer did not show that they or anyone else had been denied due process because there was no indication that the company's procedures were not fundamentally fair. The court found the public utility's shutoff notice went beyond the notice required by N.Y. Comp.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Plaintiffs, customers of a gas and electric utility, who, because they did not pay their bills after notice was given them, had their gas and electric service discontinued, do not have a property right, within the meaning of the Due Process Clause of the Federal Constitution, in the continuation of utility services, and thus requiring prior judicial proceedings before termination. The threat of termination of utility services for nonpayment involves no special irreversible economic hardships.  Plaintiffs can avoid any grievous loss by paying the amount, if disputed.</SPAN></P>

Assuming that the continuation of utility services rises to the status of a property right within the Due Process Clause of the Constitution, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the only process due is not a hearing before an impartial hearing officer, but notice before termination and an opportunity to present to the utility any evidence the customer may have, if he claims that his bill has been paid.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The district attorney charged defendants with criminal violations and then filed an action seeking to enjoin them from the sale, distribution, further distribution or acquisition, or possession with the state of a certain motion picture entitled &quot;The Devil in Miss Jones.&quot; The action specifically sought to enjoin them from exhibiting the picture within the county. Defendants filed a motion to dismiss the action, arguing that there were violations of the First, Fifth, and Fourteenth Amendment against them. Defendants also asked for a stay until the criminal matters were determined because a conviction could cause the picture to be outlawed as contraband. The court denied the motion, holding that there were no constitutional violations and that a preliminary injunction could be granted where defendants were doing or threatening to do an act which would violate a law. The court also denied a stay, holding that it would be futile. A trial conviction would only result in penal sanctions against the individual defendants.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee worked for the city and took a competitive examination for promotion. He claimed veteran's preference credit based on his active military service. The eligibility list for examination at first ranked him upon recognition of his veteran's preference credit. On a revised list, he was denied the veteran's credit. He sought to overturn the decision on the basis of his service in the navy on active duty during time of war, pursuant to N.Y. Const. art. V, &sect; 6 and N.Y. Civ. Serv. Law &sect; 85. On appeal, the Commission claimed that N.Y. Gen. Const. Law &sect; 13-a barred the granting of the preferential status. The court reversed the denial of the preference and held that status as a veteran was established by honorable active federal service in some branch of the armed services during time of war and that the Commission acted in an arbitrary, capricious, and illegal manner in denying the preference. There was no difference in the nomenclature used by the armed services classifying the employee's six months' continuous duty, in time of war, as active duty or active duty for training. In either use, his normal civilian life and employment were disrupted for this extended period.</SPAN></P>

The masseurs sought an injunction to prevent enforcement of the local law and to have it declared unconstitutional. The court granted the masseurs' request for injunctive relief, finding the law unreasonably restrictive of the privileges and immunities of the citizenry. The court held it void on its face because no standards were set out for enforcement of the law, which left the law open to discriminatory enforcement.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Relator inmates filed separate applications for writs of habeas corpus that were heard together regarding their confinement in a reformatory, the denial of the benefits of rehabilitative programs, and the deprivation of the benefit of good behavior time as a consequence of being confined under a reformatory sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmates contended that (1) no part of the complex they were confined to met the requirements of a reformatory; thus, their confinement was not in accordance with the sentences imposed upon them; (2) the reformatory sentence imposed entitled them to the benefit of certain rehabilitative programs, which they were denied; (3) confinement under a reformatory sentence deprived them of the benefit of good behavior time which those serving indeterminate or definite sentences could earn under the provisions of N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 70.30(4). The court held that (1) the issue of whether the complex met the requirements of a reformatory was not in a position to permit disposition on the merits because the inmates failed to comply with the primary requirements of due process, i.e., to name some state official as a party and to give notice to the office of the Attorney-General; (2) the programs available to the inmates that were transferred to the correctional institution were substantially the same programs as those available in the reformatory; and (3) to the extent that the inmates had earned the benefit of good behavior time, they were entitled to credit therefor.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that the inmates were entitled to credit for good behavior time to the extent that they had earned such benefit and that the inmates' argument that the complex they were confined to did not meet the requirements of a reformatory was not in a position to permit disposition on the merits.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Prisons and prisoners -- good time -- imposition of extended reformatory sentence on relators carrying finding that reform is possible does not violate due process -- since State Commission of Correction provisionally certified reformatory, and neither it nor any individual State officer is party, certification cannot be reviewed -- evidence of rehabilitation programs at reformatory meets constitutional standards -- transfer of relators after they attained age 21 to correctional institution can be justified only on basis of waiver signed by four and waivers may be revoked requiring transfer back to reformatory -- denial of good behavior time to defendants sentenced to reformatory is </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">unconstitutional;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> Commissioner of Corrections must compute such time if earned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Relators were sentenced to a reformatory and after attaining age 21 and being found to have violated their parole, chose to stay in a correctional institution rather than in a reformatory. A reformatory sentence is extended because there is no opportunity to reduce the time by credit for good time. Two relators were convicted of misdemeanors but nevertheless given the extended reformatory sentence. The imposition&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of an extended sentence carries with it a finding that reformation is possible and therefore violated no concept of due process or equal protection of said two relators.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The Rikers Island reformatory was provisionally certified by the State Commission of Correction.  Since relators attack such certification, their failure to name a State officer as a party and to give notice to the office of the Attorney-General deprived the Commission of Correction of the opportunity to submit evidence to justify its grant of conditional certification. The ruling of the State commission cannot be reviewed in this proceeding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Relators were sentenced to the city reformatory for the purpose of rehabilitation. The evidence shows numerous programs at the city reformatory including educational, vocational, work release, and VISTA programs and others.  Even though the level is not equal to that of the State, it meets the constitutional standards.  Relators who are housed in the correctional institution also have these programs available.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The State law empowers the State Commissioner of Correctional Services to transfer inmates from one institution to another but similar power to the City Commissioner&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  does not exist.  The sole authority for the transfers to the correctional institution are waivers signed by four relators.  While this is sufficient to sustain the transfers, the waiver is revocable and should any of these four indicate a desire to revoke, the City Commissioner is directed to transfer him to the reformatory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Good behavior time is granted against the maximum term of an indeterminate sentence (not exceeding one third of the maximum sentence ) and up to one sixth of a definite sentence. A reformatory sentence does not fit into either of these categories and those so sentenced are the only persons under the statute who are not entitled to good behavior time.  There is no rational basis for this distinction and the denial of good time is unconstitutional.  Relators are entitled to good behavior time if they have earned it but if their records show that they have not, it will be denied.  Accordingly, the New York City Commissioner of Correction is directed to forthwith examine into the institutional records of relators for the purpose of determining whether those records disclose warrant for administrative proceedings looking to a forfeiture of good behavior time.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The sale of methaqualone had been increased to a felony offense by the action of the State Commissioner of Health pursuant to N.Y. Pub. Health Law &sect; 3372. The court held that this was not an unconstitutional delegation of the legislative function to the commissioner, because in listing methaqualone as a dangerous drug the commissioner was performing a ministerial function based on the results of tests proving that methaqualone was a dangerous drug. The court next held that it was no defense that the pharmacist was unaware that the degree of the offense had been increased. The court agreed, however, that a search warrant authorizing the seizure of everything except aspirin and toothpaste, as the court put it, was tantamount to a general warrant that was proscribed by the Fourth Amendment. The court also held that while a bill of particulars could not be sought simply to fish for evidence, it was proper to disclose the names of all purchasers of the drug because as a pharmacist defendant had a lawful right to dispense the drug to persons with prescriptions.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. An indictment of a pharmacist properly alleged that, on or about March 1, 1973, in 10 instances he sold drugs without the requisite prescriptions and thus committed 10 violations of the Education Law as misdemeanors, and that, in the 11th instance, he sold methaqualone without the requisite prescription and thus committed one Class D felony (Penal Law, &sect; 220.30; &sect; 220.00, subd. 4; Public Health Law, former &sect; 3371, subd. 1; former &sect; 3372).  The State Commissioner of Health properly filed a designation&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  or order with the Secretary of State on February 9, 1973 listing methaqualone as a controlled dangerous depressant drug (10 NYCRR former 81.47 [c] [1]).  This filing lawfully increased the offense of selling methaqualone from a misdemeanor to a felony (Penal Law, &sect; 10.00, subd. 1; &sect; 15.20, subd. 2; &sect; 220.30).  It is immaterial that the pharmacist did not know that his criminal offense had been increased to a felony.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Defendant has not presented any evidence that he has been prejudiced by the delay which occurred between the dates when he committed the crimes and the date when he was indicted and arrested therefor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. A telephone conversation which was overheard or recorded with the consent of the sender is not &quot;intercepted&quot; and hence no eavesdropping warrant is needed ( CPL 700.05, subd. 3).  The admissibility in evidence of the conversation will be for the Trial Judge to determine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. A warrant to search and seize, from a pharmacist's drugstore, &quot;narcotic, depressant and stimulant drugs, dangerous drugs, controlled drugs, invoices * * * records * * * books * * * correspondence * * * cancelled checks, journals, ledgers and other business records * * * relating to the purchase, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  sale and distribution of [such] drug&quot;, is much too broad (U. S. Const., 4th Amdt.; CPL 690.10), and therefore all items and papers thus seized shall be suppressed from evidence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Since the indicted pharmacist may assert as a defense that he lawfully sold the drugs pursuant to prescriptions (Public Health Law, former &sect; 3381, subd. 1, par. [a]), he is entitled to a bill of particulars of the names of the persons to whom he allegedly sold the drugs without any prescription. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. An administratorship of this multiple dwelling (Real Property Actions and Proceedings Law, art. 7-a), and a mortgage foreclosure receivership have both been terminated, and the landlord is now in possession again.  A tenant&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  whose low income makes him practically judgment proof still owes uncollected rent for several months in 1970 and for 10 months in 1972 and for January through April of 1973.  In this nonpayment summary dispossess proceeding, the landlord is granted judgment for the arrears and for a warrant of dispossess.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. However, execution of the warrant is stayed so as to permit the tenant to pay the arrears at the rate of $ 13.50 a month, concurrently with his regular monthly rent, until the arrears have been paid in full.  The warrant of eviction shall issue and shall be executed if a default by the tenant remains uncured after 10 days' notice and if an affidavit by the landlord or her attorney so attests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The landlord has waived the benefit of the statute (Real Property Actions and Proceedings Law, &sect; 732, subd. 2) which limits a stay of a warrant of dispossess to five days.</SPAN></P>

Although this building still needs many repairs and essential services, a recent report by the city's Department of Rent and Housing Maintenance states: &quot;Good effort being made for 100% completion.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5.

The court granted plaintiff an injunction pursuant to N.Y. Gen. Bus. Law &sect; 349(b). The court held that defendant did not qualify as a &quot;college&quot; because it had no formal entrance requirements, no faculty members who were trained and competent to teach accredited and recognized academic courses, and no educational facilities. The court held that defendant transacted business as defined by N.Y.

The purpose of the statute was to assure adequate and satisfactory water supply and sewage facilities to residential lots. The state commissioner of health served a notice of hearing and complaint on the landowner, claiming violations of N.Y. Pub. Health Law &sect; 1116. The court held that the sales here did not require consideration of water or sewage. The sales were for recreational purposes only and there was no evidence of urbanization. The court would not blindly apply the words of a statute to arrive at an unreasonable or absurd result. The statute was too broadly drawn to include the instant case. The court further held that N.Y.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In four companion cases, the housing company sought retroactive rent and refused to credit rent security held on deposit. The court held that the legislative plan contained in the statutory provisions, authorizing a rent surcharge of up to a maximum of 50 percent of rent, appeared to be an appropriate equitable means of preventing the acute hardship of sudden eviction, especially under existing economic conditions in which tenants' incomes could vary greatly from year to year. The court also held that authority had to be delegated to a governmental agency to create rules for effectuating and implementing this public policy, and the rules were required to provide some means of procuring essential information as a reasonable guideline for imposition of any surcharge. The existing rules providing for income confirmation and surcharge procedure were a valid delegation and exercise of legislative authority. The legislative rationale and the expressed statutory purpose of the surcharge required tenant occupancy, since the surcharge was a statutory device to permit continued occupancy by a tenant after the tenant's income exceeded that statutory limit.</SPAN></P>

Although this lease prohibits any setoff of the tenant's security deposit against the landlord's claims, this provision cannot apply when all claims have matured, as in this case.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners, a group of civil service employees and a group of home relief recipients, each brought an N.Y. C.P.L.R. 78 proceeding, which attacked N.Y. Soc. Serv. Law &sect; 164, the &quot;work relief&quot; statute, and the actions of respondents, state and city officers and agencies, pursuant to &sect; 164. The proceedings were dismissed as against the state, and the court addressed the claims of both groups against the city agencies and officials.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners contended that home relief recipients were being employed to perform work ordinarily performed by regular employees, and that they did so at a lower salary and without benefits enjoyed by regular employees. The court held that the work relief statute did not violate the constitutional requirement that appointments and promotions in the civil service be made according to merit and fitness because the assignment of the home relief recipients to work did not constitute such an appointment or promotion. The court determined that the statute did not prevent relief recipients from being used to do the same kind of civil service work as regular employees. The court found that the home relief recipients were not being unconstitutionally held in a state of peonage where the only sanction for their refusing to work was that they would not receive relief payments. The court noted that an issue of fact was presented as to whether the relief recipients were being paid at the requisite state minimum wage, but found that it would be impossible to conduct a hearing as to all 21,000 recipients. The court ordered a hearing as to the three recipients named in the petition.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court dismissed the petition of the civil service employees.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners, as executors and trustees, brought an action for a determination relating to the proper payment of a renounced payment of $ 1,000 of the residuary a decedent's estate. Notice was given to respondents, the legatees, the grandchildren, and other interested parties.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decedent left certain shares of his residuary estate outright to his daughters, in trust for his grandchildren. One daughter renounced $ 1,000 of her residuary bequest in accordance with the provisions of N.Y. Est. Powers &amp; Trusts Law &sect; 3-3.10. N.Y. Est. Powers &amp; Trusts Law &sect; 3-3.10, which became effective prior to his death, was applicable because no property right vested until the decedent died. Section 3-3.10 provided that because the decedent had not otherwise provided, the filing of the renunciation had the same effect with respect to the renounced interest as though the daughter had predeceased the testator. Because N.Y. Est. Powers &amp; Trusts Law &sect; 3-3.3 subd. (a), par. (1) provided that the renouncing daughter was treated as predeceasing the decedent, the renounced bequest passed to the grandchildren. Therefore, the grandchildren were each entitled to one-half of the renounced amount. The amount was paid outright to the grandchildren and not in trust to the trustees, because the fact that the legacy passed in accordance with &sect; 3-3.3 took the bequest out of the provisions of the will.</SPAN></P>

EPTL 3-3.10, which became law after the will was executed but before decedent's death and treats a renounced interest as though the renouncing person had predeceased the testator, applies to decedent's will, an ambulatory instrument vesting property rights at the date of death, not the date of execution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Since the daughter's bequest was to pass outright, the children receive in the same fashion and not through the shares in trust created for them from part of the residuary estate. </SPAN></P>

However, respondents denied approval to the amendment, precipitating petitioners' art. 78 application seeking a declaration that 1971 N.Y.

While agreeing that respondents' action was properly vacated, the court upheld the constitutionality of 1971 N.Y. Laws ch. 1012. It found that respondents' denial of approval was based on &quot;suppositious effects of unknown numerical magnitude&quot; resulting from respondents' analysis of the impact of the amendment.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner mother commenced a paternity proceeding to procure an order declaring that respondent putative father was the natural father of her three children.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The father objected to joining the Commissioner as a co-petitioner on the basis that the 10-year statute of limitations provided in N.Y. Fam. Ct. Act &sect; 517(b) was unconstitutional under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Under &sect; 517, a mother was limited to two years to bring a filiation action, while the Commissioner was limited to ten. Therefore, whether a putative father was subjected to either a two- or ten-year period of liability based solely upon the mother's income level at the time the action was brought. The court concluded that the dual statute of limitations provided in &sect; 517 was reasonable when viewed in terms of the presumed legislative objective in enacting it, and that it was not arbitrary or invidious. As the 10-year limitation period incorporated some apparent degree of &quot;reason&quot; when viewed in terms of the presumed legislative purpose in enacting it, the statute also met minimal due process standards. The court noted, however, that the court was justified in dismissing a paternity petition on due process grounds in an exceptional case where a putative father was able to show &quot;actual prejudice in preparing a defense.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court rejected the father's contention that the Act's dual statute of limitations was unconstitutional and granted the mother's motion to join the Commissioner as a co-petitioner.</SPAN></P>

Section 44-12 of the Code forbids possession of the same kind of gambling equipment prohibited by section 225.30 of the Penal Law but the local law includes a location where the casual player as well as the professional gambler is playing.

However, the court determined that the use of the newly drawn districts would be proper for that particular election because there was insufficient time to adequately prepare a new plan of reapportionment for that year's municipal election. The court held that the other politicians challenge to the newly drawn districts, namely that the new districts invidiously gerrymandered the Republican Party and deleted Republican voting strength, was not a proper challenge to the newly drawn districts.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. A local law of the City of New York which established a plan for 33 new councilmanic districts in said city to be voted at the primary election of June 4, 1973 and the general election in November is invalid in that the Second and Eighth Councilmanic Districts fail to conform to the statutory requirements of contiguity, convenience and compactness. Because of time limitations which would disrupt the electoral process and disenfranchise the voters, the plan is adopted as a temporary measure for the primary and general election of 1973 and is to remain in effect until the next councilmanic election by which time a new reapportionment plan shall be adopted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. By chapter 1206 of the Laws of 1971 the New York City Council was directed to establish a plan for 33 new councilmanic districts by a local law which was to describe the boundaries so as to contain as nearly equal a number of inhabitants as practicable and be &quot;of convenient and contiguous territory and in as compact a form as practicable&quot;.  The apportionment resulting, insofar as population and&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  equal representation was involved, was perfect for the maximum variance between any of the districts is less than 1/10th of 1%.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The Second Councilmanic District consists of portions of Manhattan and Richmond.  The southern tip of Manhattan, an island, which is closest to Richmond, another island, is not located in the Second District.  It is impossible to travel from the Manhattan portion of the district to the Richmond portion without crossing either the first and third districts or New Jersey and the first district.  The Second Councilmanic District does not comply with the requirement of &quot;convenient and contiguous territory in as compact form as practicable&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The Eighth Councilmanic District is located in three boroughs, Manhattan, Queens and the Bronx.  Those portions located in Manhattan and the Bronx are contiguous. That portion which is in Queens does not adjoin, touch or connect with the other portions.  A reading of the word descriptions of the district shows that the Eighth Councilmanic District is bisected by the Seventh Councilmanic District and is not contiguous.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. The Thirty-third Councilmanic District is composed of sections of the eastern portion of Richmond&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and a part of southwest Brooklyn.  Since the eastern boundary of the Borough of Richmond is defined as the Borough of Brooklyn, these two areas are contiguous and as compact as possible and the district does not violate the statute.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. While some challenged districts are irregular in form, lack of neatness does not render them noncompact, inconvenient or noncontiguous.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. The challenge to the districts as to lack of racial and ethnic representation is without proof or merit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. Even though the local law contains a saving clause that if one section is held unconstitutional, it shall not affect the others, since each of the districts is dependent upon the other, if one is invalid, the whole is invalid. The local law is unconstitutional.  </SPAN></P>

However, defendants contended the term &quot;unnecessarily&quot; as used in the statute was susceptible of so many meanings that the statute was unconstitutionally vague. The court held that the doctrine of &quot;vagueness&quot; did not mean that the fact that the Penal Law had not specifically defined a key word in the statute, it became constitutionally defective. A lack of precision in statutory language did not automatically mean that the requirements of due process had been offended. The court noted that citizens who desired to obey this statute would not have difficulty in understanding it.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner, the Commissioner of Welfare of the City of New York (commissioner), sought to declare respondent, the putative father, to be the father of a male child who, along with his mother, was receiving public assistance. The mother's previous paternity suit against the putative father had been dismissed as untimely under the two-year statute of limitations of Fam. Ct. Act &sect; 517(a), which applied to private litigants.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The putative father contended that he was denied equal protection under the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States because, under Fam. Ct. Act &sect; 517(b), the commissioner could bring a paternity suit until 10 years after the birth of the child if the child was receiving public assistance, although the natural mother was limited to two years under Fam. Ct. Act &sect; 517(a). The court disagreed and found that the commission's claim was not time-barred. The legislature could have excluded the commission from any limitations period, but instead it imposed the 10-year period to balance the protection of public funds with the protection of defendants from stale claims. A welfare mother was not compelled to name the father of her child, and she often was an adverse party because of her desire to protect the father and receive public assistance. In relieving the public from the support of those liable to become public charges, the legislature could give the commission a greater period of time to bring suit. The commissioner's status as a public official in charge of public money placed him in a different position from a private litigant suing in an individual capacity.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners, about 17,000 city police officers, filed a special proceeding under N.Y. C.P.L.R. art. 78 for a determination that N.Y. Civ. Serv. Law &sect; 210 was unconstitutional on its face or as applied to them. They sought to annul the determination of respondent, a city director of personnel, that they had violated &sect; 210 and that fines and forfeited tenure be imposed. Intervenor, a state attorney general appeared in opposition to the petition.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The officers were fined and placed on probation for having engaged in an illegal strike, described as a &quot;work stoppage,&quot; during a five-day period. The officers filed their petition against the director of personnel, and other respondents, a city and its mayor, comptroller, and police commissioner. A state attorney general appeared in opposition to the petition. In response to the director's determinations, over 18,000 affidavits of objection were filed. The director designated independent attorneys who examined them, reviewed the original determinations and proofs submitted in opposition, and made recommendations as to a necessity for a hearing. The court held that: (1) the mayor's delegation of administrative functions, powers and duties to the director was proper because &sect; 210 determinations were administrative determinations; (2) there was implicit power in the director to do whatever was administratively necessary because the presumption was that the director properly discharged his duties; and (3) the officers were afforded a right to a meaningful opportunity to be heard within the limits of practicality and approved procedures for objection and review by special proceedings.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court entered a declaration that the statute was constitutional on its face and as applied to the officers, and that the statute was validly enforced.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The Civil Service Law ( &sect; 210, subd. 1) validly and constitutionally prohibits strikes by public employees; and it provides that &quot;an employee who is absent from work without permission, or who abstains wholly or in part from the full performance of his duties in his normal manner without permission, on the date or dates when a strike occurs, shall be presumed to have engaged in such strike on such date or dates&quot; (&sect; 210, subd. 2, par.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The presumption (Civil Service Law, &sect; 210, subd. 2, par. [b]) is easily rebuttable by showing a death in the family, or that the employee was donating blood, or some other acceptable excuse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The Mayor of the City of New York (its &quot;chief executive officer&quot;) properly delegated his duties under section 210 of the Civil Service Law to the Personnel Director of the City of New York, whom he designated as his Special Assistant (Mayor's Executive Order No. 32 dated January 21, 1971; New York City Charter, &sect; 3).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. Said Special Assistant acted reasonably promptly on some 25,000 reports of duties performed by policemen during the period January 14 to 19, 1971.  He gave probation and&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  fine notices on or about June 18, 1971, and payroll deductions began 30 days thereafter, and he commenced issuing determinations within two months after objections were filed (Civil Service Law, &sect; 210, subd. 2, pars.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">During the arrest of the accused wrongdoer, county police department officers seized certain funds from his person. The criminal proceedings against the accused wrongdoer were later dismissed, and he petitioned respondents for the return of those funds. Respondents refused to return the funds, so the accused wrongdoer petitioned the court to obtain the return of the funds. A justice of the court denied the petition, and the accused wrongdoer moved to renew his application before the whole court. The court determined that petition should not have been dismissed as untimely, because the applicable limitations period for a mandamus action had not expired. The court thus granted the motion to renew. Further, it determined that the affirmative defenses asserted by respondents lacked merit, and that justice and fundamental fairness required the return of the funds to the accused wrongdoer. The accused wrongdoer's petition to secure the return of the funds therefore was granted, and respondents were ordered to return the funds without interest.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. On July 6, 1971 the police arrested petitioner on a numbers running&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  charge and seized $ 660 from him.  The criminal proceeding was dismissed on November 23, 1971, his attorney demanded return of the money on January 10, 1972, and, on April 18, 1972, after the demand was refused, he commenced an article 78 proceeding.  By court order dated August 7, 1972 his petition was dismissed as untimely.  On a motion to renew, that order is vacated and his petition is granted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The four-month period of limitation applicable to the proceeding did not begin to run on the date the criminal proceeding was dismissed but on the date of the municipal act which is challenged as invalid, i.e., the refusal to return the money on demand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Petitioner is not barred by laches. He was not served with the prior order of dismissal and notice of entry thereof, and no prejudice to any party has been shown.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The fact that he may have alternate remedies of conversion and replevin does not preclude him from bringing an article 78 proceeding as a citizen aggrieved by the determination of a county agency. The article 78 remedy is particularly apt where, as here, there are no substantial factual issues which might render summary disposition inappropriate. And service of a&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  notice of claim under the General Municipal Law is not required before bringing an article 78 proceeding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. The money belongs to petitioner, and there is no claim that the county has a continuing right to hold it.  Moreover, it should be returned as a matter of fundamental fairness and justice.  Cash taken incidental to a numbers running charge does not appear to be contraband, as opposed to the numbers stubs themselves.  In any event, any arguable public right to it dissipated when the criminal charge was dismissed.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The claimant was arrested on possession of gambling records, policy slips, in violation of N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 225.15. He pled guilty and paid a fine. He filed a complaint against the clerk to recover the funds seized in connection with his arrest. The clerk filed a motion for summary judgment. The court denied the motion. Under the provisions of N.Y. City Admin. Code &sect; 435-4.0, it was a plaintiff's burden to prove that the property in question was not contraband subject to forfeiture. Although &sect; 435-4.0 was declared unconstitutional precisely because it placed this untoward burden of proof upon the claimant from whom moneys had been seized, nothing precluded the city from seizing or confiscating contraband. The claimant could therefore be able to make out a prima facie case by merely showing the seizure of the money alleged to be his, the final disposition of the criminal charge, and the demand and refusal of the clerk to the return of the money. However, the city on its part could be in a position to prove the money in question was indeed contraband, did not belong to the claimant, and was subject to forfeiture. That issue could not be determined without a trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant filed a motion to dismiss an indictment brought by the People of the State of New York and voted by the Grand Jury of Kings County, which charged him with two counts each of sale of a dangerous drug in the third degree, possession of a dangerous drug in the fourth degree, and possession of a dangerous drug in the sixth degree. Defendant's arrest warrant had not been executed until nearly 32 months after the indictment had been voted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The People had not presented any evidence to explain the long delay in arresting defendant. All the People stated was that the delay had been through inadvertence or negligence due to overburdened and understaffed warrant squads. The People denied any attempt to delay the trial to hinder defendant's case. The court noted that defendant had a right to a speedy trial, which was guaranteed not only by N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 30.20, but also by the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution. However, the court noted that it was unclear whether the Sixth Amendment speedy trial right extended to a case, such as this, where defendant not only was not arrested promptly, but had not even been informed that there had been an indictment voted against him until almost 32 months later. The court found that such a long period of delay could have prejudiced defendant's case due to loss of physical evidence and the fading of witnesses' memories of the incident. Therefore, the court ruled that a hearing was needed in order to determine in what way, if any, defendant's case had been prejudiced and to give the People the chance to show that the delay had been reasonable under the circumstances.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court ruled that a determination on defendant's motion to dismiss the indictment brought against him by the People would be held in abeyance until a hearing could be held at which defendant could present evidence of any prejudice to him from the delay in arresting him and the People could present evidence that it had acted diligently to execute the arrest warrant.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On December 23, 1969 in Kings County, defendant was indicted and an arrest warrant was issued for sale of a dangerous drug and possession of a dangerous drug; but somehow defendant was not arrested until almost 31 months later, on July 18, 1972, although defendant asserts that he lived and worked in Kings County at all times.  The court will conduct a hearing to determine whether the People's delay is excusable and whether the defendant's ability to prepare his defense has been unconstitutionally impaired by the delay.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Commissioner of Education argued that the motion to order the State to contribute to the education of a handicapped child under &sect; 4403 was premature and that the family court could not impose liability for the cost of an order upon the State. The court disagreed. In making their orders for the education of a handicapped child, most family courts had been charging the State with reimbursement as a matter of course. The city had not been required to institute an independent proceeding under N.Y. C.P.L.R. art. 78 to receive 50 percent of its payment from the State. Under N.Y. Educ. Law &sect; 4403, subd. 1, when the family court issued an order for the education of any handicapped child, the Commissioner should issue a certificate to that effect. The counsel to the Commissioner stated that the only reason for not approving the child was that she was a public charge. The court held that failing to provide payment for the child for this reason was invidious discrimination. Many family courts did not require a parent to contribute to the cost of educating a handicapped child.</SPAN></P>

The court found that a grand jury could not direct the filing of a prosecutor's information unless the evidence was both legally sufficient to establish the commission of a crime and gave rise to reasonable cause to believe that the defendant committed the crime.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner, state administrator, filed an action, under N.Y. C.P.L.R. art. 78, with the court seeking a judgment directing respondents, the mayor and related parties, to take whatever action was necessary to implement additional appropriations for the Housing Part of the Civil Court of the City of New York. The mayor moved to dismiss the action for failure to state a cause of action, but the court denied the motion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The administrator sought to compel the mayor and related parties to provide additional appropriations for the operation of the Housing Part of the Civil Court of the City of New York. Essentially, the communications between the executive and the judicial branches of the city government deteriorated to such an extent that the lawsuit became necessary in order to determine how and when the Housing Part was to be funded. Upon review, the court held that the administrator had standing to bring the proceeding. The court then ruled that the duty to fund could not be avoided or subverted because budgetary modifications or future appropriations entailed some degree of discretion. The court stated that discretion could not be abused or converted into a subterfuge to exercise a de fact veto over legislative enactment. The court found that, despite the existence of certain established budgetary procedures, budget appropriations for the court for all practical purposes were lump sum allocations. Thus, the court ordered that the mayor and the related parties were required to provide the funding, as the right of the public to a swift adjudication of housing complaints prevailed over obstinacy.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court ordered the mayor and related parties to proceed to take necessary action to make available the funds that were required to properly staff and operate the Housing Part of the Civil Court of the City of New York.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.

The city has no power to cut off all funds for the courts.  Its discretion may not be abused, and the limits of its discretion are constitutionally proscribed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The Civil Court has power, within the limits of the law creating the Housing Part, to designate hearing officers and fix their number, function and salary.

If petitioners did not follow the ordinary procedures to obtain a modification of the city's 1972-1973 budget to procure the funds for the period from April 1, 1973 through June 30, 1973, respondents nevertheless do not deny that they were on written notice beginning in November, 1972, that city funds were needed for the new Housing Part of the Civil Court.

He did not receive any examination for drug addiction before he was sentenced and claimed that his sentence was illegal because he had no presentence narcotics examination, allegedly required by N.Y. Mental Hyg. Law &sect; 207. The court denied the petition. The sentence of concern in &sect; 207 was 134 words long, half the length of the Gettysburg Address. The only thing that saved the ersatz literary product from judicial recycling due to unconstitutional vagueness was the rule of construction. The court assumed the statute to be constitutional and salvaged any pertinent part of the sentence that could be excised. The legislature did not mean for every criminal to be examined for drugs. If the statute was to make sense, there had to be some sign of narcotics use in addition to the offense before an examination was required. Thus, committing one of the offenses by itself did not require a presentence narcotics examination. Other matters needed to be present to alert the court to a possible narcotics problem.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner 18-year-old male brought a special proceeding for an order directing respondent Clerk of the City of New York to issue him a marriage license without the male first obtaining his parents' written consent. He alleged that N.Y. Dom. Rel. Law &sect; 15(2)&nbsp;unconstitutionally discriminated against him as a male because there was no comparable provision requiring an 18-year-old female to obtain parental consent to marry.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The issue was whether there was an appropriate governmental interest in requiring the male to obtain parental consent to marry while not fixing the same requirement for an 18-year-old female. The court found that the discrimination was an ancient rule, time-honored, and the public policy of the State of New York and much of the nation. The primary obligation of a husband or father was to support his wife and children. Interwoven in that obligation was the recognition that natural order, taught both by history and reason, designated the male as the provider in the usual marriage relation. That duty was sufficient reason to require males to be older and generally more suited to their duty before they could independently decide to marry. The court held that in the presence of a legitimate state interest in the marriage relation and the reasonably conceivable fact that the male would be the provider in the marriage relation, there was a rational basis for the State to provide safeguards affecting the marriage of male minors. The male did not meet the heavy burden of overcoming the strong presumption of constitutionality of N.Y. Dom. Rel. Law &sect; 15(2).</SPAN></P>

This age discrimination against males is not unreasonable, since the males are the legally obligated supporters of the females they marry. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee worked for a city transit authority for 20 years and retired in May of 1972. Under a local code, the employee was entitled to receive an amount equal to on-half of his salary or compensation earnable by him for transit service in the year prior to his retirement. However, the employee's pension benefits were adversely affected by a new law, under N.Y. Retire. &amp; Soc. Sec. Law &sect; 431(4), which provided a change in the computation of the pension amount and became effective in April of 1972. The employee filed an action seeking a declaratory judgment with respect to the application of &sect; 431(4), and the retirement system argued that the limitation was not a limitation on retirement benefits but a limitation on salary. The court granted summary judgment to the employee to the extent that, as to the employee and those similarly situated, &sect; 431(4) was unconstitutional. The court ruled that &sect; 431(4) would be unconstitutional if it were to apply the same to any civil service employee who became a member of the retirement system prior to the effective date of the enactment, despite the fact that its prospective application was within the bounds of legislative enactment.</SPAN></P>

IX because it was clearly related to a matter of state concern and the run-off procedure delineated therein was a part of the election process. It was not arbitrary merely because it affected only New York City and had a rational basis, the implementation of effective local self-government. N.Y. Elec.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner, who had been incarcerated after being convicted of attempted sexual abuse, sought to annul respondent parole board's determination which revoked his conditional release and which held him to his maximum expiration date in a proceeding brought under N.Y. C.P.L.R. art. 78.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After interviewing petitioner upon his release, a parole officer prepared a report of violation of parole which charged petitioner with (1) using an alcoholic beverage to excess and being admittedly intoxicated; (2) stating that he would refuse to abide by some of his parole conditions; and (3) being a menace to himself and to other persons. After a hearing, the parole board revoked petitioner's parole. The court held that, under N.Y. Correct. Law &sect; 212(10), once it was satisfied that there had been a meaningful factual presentation before the parole board, its review was limited. Further, a question of substantial evidence under N.Y. C.P.L.R. 7803(4) may be raised to challenge a parole board's determination revoking parole and in a proper case the matter must be referred to an appellate court, N.Y. C.P.L.R. 7804(g). The parole board's determination was not arbitrary or capricious with regard to the first two charges of the violation report because the petitioner failed to meet his burden of supporting his allegations and arguments with facts. Moreover, petitioner's expression of intent not to abide by the conditions of his parole was properly considered by the parole board.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court dismissed defendant's petition.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Parole -- revocation -- on his very first appearance before parole officer, convict was intoxicated and abusive and stated that he would not abide by any rules except to report to parole officer; after hearing at which convict was represented by counsel, his conditional release was properly revoked by Parole Board; judicial review proceeding dismissed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Convicted of attempted sexual abuse and sentenced to an indeterminate term not exceeding four years, and conditionally released or paroled from Ossining Correctional Facility after a year and three months and told to report at once to his parole officer in New York City, the convict became drunk and intoxicated and went to his parole officer while still carrying a half full bottle of whiskey and told the parole officer in abusive and belligerent terms that he would not abide by any rules governing parole except that he would make his scheduled office reports.  The Parole Board then held a revocation hearing (Correction Law, &sect; 212, subds. 1, 7).  The convict was represented there by counsel ( </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">People ex rel. Menechino </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">v.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11"> Warden</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 27 N Y 2d 376, followed), who cross-examined the parole officers. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The convict's prior record of assault and violence and mental illness was properly read into the record.  This was a meaningful factual presentation. The Parole Board properly revoked the parole or conditional release and directed that the convict serve the rest of his maximum term. This determination was not arbitrary or capricious but, rather, met the requirements of due process of law and was supported by substantial evidence (cf.  CPLR 7803, subd. 4, and Correction Law, &sect; 212, subd. 10) and hence the Supreme Court dismissed this judicial review proceeding.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Claimant landlords filed a motion for an order directing respondent State to pay interest on the landlord's claim. A decision by the court awarded the landlords a sum with interest. That decision held that the State could not use statutory suspensions of interest as a lever to force a claimant to either do what he was not legally obligated to do, or to accept less that the amount provided by statute because that was patently unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At trial of the landlords' claims against the city, the court entered a judgment in the landlord's favor. The attorney-general issued a certificate of no appeal from the judgment. The State refused to pay the interest required by the judgment. An assistant attorney-general answered the landlord's motion by stating that because the court's jurisdiction was limited, the court did not have equity jurisdiction nor did it have the power to direct the state's comptroller to act except as provided by N.Y. Ct. Claims Act &sect; 22. The court held that it did have equity jurisdiction and that the challenge rested on a threefold error: it counseled disobedience to the court's final unappealed judgment; it usurped the function of the appellate division by reversing or modifying a valid judgment of the court; and it advised the landlord to seek the compliance of a state official by a N.Y. C.P.L.R. art. 78 proceeding. Pursuant to N.Y. Ct. Claims Act &sect;&sect; 8, 9, and 12, the court had comprehensive jurisdiction to try and decide all claims against the State including the right to afford equitable relief where it was incidental to a claim for a money judgment.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Court of Claims granted an order directing the State to pay interest on the entire advance payment and on the balance of an appropriation award, each from the dates on which the State stopped paying interest to the dates of payment.  In the decision making the award, the court had pointed out that statutory suspensions of interest to force claimants to obtain releases from lessees or accept an advance payment offer less than the statutory percentage of value were unconstitutional.  The court, though having no equity jurisdiction, has the right to afford equitable relief when incidental to a claim for a money judgment and require compliance with its final, unappealed judgment.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner property owner sought review of an order from a trial court (New York), which dismissed the property owner's petition that sought to annul a determination by respondent Urban Renewal Agency not to purchase the improved realty owned by the property owner that had previously be designated as property &quot;to be acquired&quot; by the urban renewal plan presented to the city council.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owner challenged the dismissal of her petition that objected to the agency's decision not to purchase her property after it had designated the property as &quot;to be acquired&quot; in the urban renewal plan. The property owner argued that the adoption of the urban renewal plan by the city constituted a rezoning of the property from business to residential, and thereby placed a legal restraint on its use that amounted to a constructive condemnation in violation of the property owner's right to due process. The court determined that under N.Y. Gen. Mun. Law &sect; 503-a(4)(e), the city was allowed to plan and rezone municipal areas that were in furtherance of the plans and goals of the agency. The city's approval of the local urban renewal plan did not infringe on the property owner's rights because the State was allowed to pass laws for the general good of all people that narrowed the rights of the individual property owner. The agency, as an arm of the State, was allowed to impinge on the individual constitutional rights of the property owner as the urban renewal plan was intended for the general good of all persons.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court dismissed the property owner's petition.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Municipal corporations -- urban renewal -- adoption of Urban Renewal Agency's plan did not result in unauthorized rezoning tantamount to unconstitutional taking -- when City Council adopted plan, it also changed zone of petitioner's property to residential -- no unlawful taking resulted from change of zone -- if petitioner is forced to rehabilitate her property and it is not taken by agency, there will be no liability on part of agency for damages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Adoption of the Urban Renewal Agency's plan did not amount to an unauthorized rezoning of petitioner's property tantamount to an unconstitutional &quot;taking&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. When the Troy City Council approved the local urban renewal plan on May 27, 1971, it also, in furtherance of that plan, approved the designation of the zone or area in which petitioner's property is located as residential.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. There is no merit to petitioner's claim that restriction of use or of sale by a change in zoning ordinance amounts to an unlawful taking.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">This matter was before the court on defendants' motion to suppress a certain film.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A police officer seized a film depicting two males and a female engaging in various sexual activity that was being shown in the rear of a book store-peep show establishment after the officer personally viewed it. Defendants contended that the seizure was unconstitutional because the court should have gone to the store to view the film and then issue a search warrant and because the officer lacked probable cause to believe the film was hard-core pornography. The court held that defendants failed to carry their burden of demonstrating a violation of their constitutional rights. The court, which had viewed the film, concluded that the officer had probable cause to believe he was viewing hard-core pornography and that he could seize it as incident to a lawful arrest. The film was in the nature of sample evidence of a suspected crime being committed and prior restraint in violation of the free speech clause was not an issue given the film was not for sale and that the seizure was reasonable and proper for evidentiary purposes.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found that the film was admissible against defendants at trial and that the seizure did not violate defendants' constitutional rights.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Defendants, employees of a book store and peep show establishment who are charged with promoting and possession with intent to promote a certain obscene film in violation of section 235.05 of the Penal Law, have standing to move to suppress, even though they do not allege a proprietary interest in the store or film, because there was a search and seizure in premises in which they were present and the evidence seized is to be used against them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The police seized a silent film, without printing&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of any kind contained in a peep show machine depicting two males and a female in various sexual activity. There is no way for a court to identify the film so as to make it the object of a subpoena duces tecum or an ex parte restraining order or a demand that it be made available to the People for trial preparation.  If this film were not seized by the officer, there would be no way to produce it at trial.  If the officer, after viewing the film, sought to get a search warrant, the unidentifiable nature of the film is such that any warrant issued would of necessity be void for vagueness as a general warrant in that the thing to be seized could not be specified.  The officer could not purchase the film; it was not for sale.  Thus, it could not be presented to a court for judicial scrutiny or an adversary hearing. To require a Judge to leave the bench and go to a peep show establishment to view a film before it may be used as evidence is unreasonable.  In view of all the circumstances the seizure was legal and the film is admissible against defendants on the trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The seizing officer had the right to determine that the film was hard core pornography since it showed deviate sexual&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  intercourse without dialogue.  Such acts are not constitutionally protected. The court has viewed the film and agrees that the officer had probable cause to believe he was viewing hard core pornography and that he could seize it as an incident to a lawful arrest. </SPAN></P>

The landowner never sought judicial review of the town's rejection of his applications, but instead brought this action.

The court found that proceeding one was moot because the board had made a decision that was subject to the review of the court. The court further found that in proceeding two, the contract between the employees and the State was a public contract because one of the parties was a governmental body and that N.Y. Civ. Serv. Law art. 14 required the State to allow a labor union to represent public employees in negations whether or not the labor union had been certified or not. The court further held that there were no constitutional violations at issue. The only infringement was procedural, that is, the manner of enforcement of the contractual rights of the parties; there was no impairment of the rights of the parties.

The city filed an article 78 proceeding to challenge the Commissioner's decision to withhold approval of the rule.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Commissioner enacted a blanket rule decreasing maximum rents in rent-controlled apartments for failure of the owner to comply with the mandated improvement required by the Air Pollution Control Code, New York City, N.Y., Admin. &sect; 1403.2-1.01 et seq. The basis of the real estate company's action was that the rental agency had failed to obtain approval of the Commissioner for this change in policy. The real estate company further argued that the program constituted a more stringent restrictive rule, which required State approval. The State contended that the city had no standing to challenge the constitutionality of the statute, that the statute was constitutional, and that the withholding of approval by the Commissioner was a reasonable exercise of the discretion delegated to him by law. The court determined that the State lacked standing to challenge the constitutionality of the statute. The court further determined that the Commissioner did not act unreasonably in withholding approval of the regulation and that his approval was required before the regulation was valid.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After defendant's acquittal on a charge of public lewdness under N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 245.00, the court reserved decision upon the question of whether exposure of a female under N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 245.01 was a lesser-included offense of the charge of public lewdness and whether defendant was guilty of that charge.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was acquitted of a charge of public lewdness in violation of N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 245.00. The court found defendant was guilty of the lesser-included offense of exposure of a female under N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 245.01. The court noted that the proper test for deciding whether an offense was a lesser-included offense was to determine if the lesser offense required proof of an element that was not required to establish the greater offense. The answer in this case was no. Defendant intentionally exposed her entire body, including her breasts, in a public place. Defendant challenged the constitutionality of the statute, but failed to establish it was unconstitutional beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found defendant guilty of the lesser-included offense of exposure of a female and sentenced her to a fine of $ 50 or in default of payment thereof, to serve 5 days and to a conditional discharge.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Defendant was acquitted of public lewdness (Penal Law, &sect; 245.00) upon proof that she took her bathing suit off on a public beach but did not engage in any lewd conduct. Section 245.01 of the Penal Law provides that a female is guilty of exposure when in a public place she appears clothed or costumed in such a manner that the portion of her breast below the top of the areola is not covered.  Such crime is a lesser included offense.  The words &quot;clothed or costumed&quot; in the statute are designed to cover transparent clothing and do not limit prosecution to persons who are clothed. The statute covers all situations where a female intentionally exposes her breasts in public irrespective of whether she is wearing anything else.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant charged with illegal possession of a loaded handgun moved to suppress the weapon found on his person, and testimony pertaining thereto, on the grounds that, while the arresting officer had a warrant to search the premises and another individual who occupied those premises, he had no probable cause to conduct a warrantless search of defendant's person in the course of the execution of that warrant.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Police obtained a warrant to search an apartment for drugs. The warrant also directed the search of the named occupant. Defendant was present in the apartment when the warrant was executed and one of the officers patted down his clothing. During the frisk, a loaded handgun was found on defendant's person and he was charged with illegal possession of a loaded handgun. Defendant moved to suppress, claiming the frisk was an illegal and unreasonable search, in violation of U.S. Const. amend. IV, because the officer lacked probable cause. In denying the motion, the court ruled that the warrantless frisk was valid and reasonable. Courts have long recognized that an officer may take reasonable precautions without a warrant, such as frisking, to assure his own safety and that of others and such action is authorized by N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 690.15. The officer here, in light of his experience and the circumstances, had a reasonable suspicion to warrant the belief that his safety was in danger, so as to justify a frisk for weapons.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The suppression motion was denied because the search of defendant was a limited and reasonable frisk, taken by the officer to assure his own safety and that of others, based on a reasonable suspicion and belief that it was necessary for his protection.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. An officer, on the authority of a no-knock search warrant, who entered the apartment designated in the warrant occupied by a woman to search for narcotics, saw the woman and defendant, who was not named in the warrant, and acted reasonably in patting defendant's clothing, discovering a gun, removing it from defendant and arresting him.  Suppression of the weapon is denied.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Although the warrant and the supporting affidavit were not offered in evidence, the court takes judicial notice of them and has examined them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The stop and frisk statute ( CPL 140.50), which permits a warrantless search to disarm a possible assailant, applies to activity &quot;in a public place&quot; and authorizes&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  a similar frisk in a nonpublic place, such as an apartment, upon a legal entry.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner property owners filed a motion requesting an order to direct the taking of testimony bearing on the alleged illegality of assessment procedures used by respondent Board of Assessors of the Town of Fallsburgh in making up the yearly general assessment roll of the town. The property owners also sought a declaration that the assessment procedures and resultant tax rolls were unconstitutional, illegal, and void.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Board argued that that proceedings to review assessments of real property must be brought under the N.Y. Real Prop. Tax Law art. 7 and could not be collaterally attacked. In cases when the purpose of the proceeding was to review actual evaluations, the test was the fairness and reasonableness of the Board's conclusion. In these cases, N.Y. Real Prop. Tax Law art. 7 was the exclusive remedy. However, when the taxing authority acted entirely without jurisdiction in making assessments and compiling a tax roll, then its acts were void and subject to collateral attack. In this case, the property owners did not carry their heavy burden of proving that the Board's acts resulted in a loss of its jurisdiction to tax. The alleged acts were mere errors that did not void the tax roll. The charge that the assessor only assessed vacant land in his program was unsupported by proof that the assessments did not represent fair market value. The charges that the assessor used an outdated tax map and did not personally view each parcel were without merit as personal viewing was not required by law. The court dismissed the petition.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied the motion and dismissed the petition.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Taxation -- assessments -- collateral attack on assessment roll of town cannot be maintained by petitioners; their exclusive remedy is by proceeding under article 7 of Real Property Tax Law -- late filing does not vitiate assessment roll -- assessment not illegal because assessor is not qualified -- stated alleged illegal acts do not support collateral attack -- charge that assessors are motivated by personal gain is not supported -- charge that assessors assessed land only is not supported -- use of outdated tax map is immaterial -- that assessors fixed value of land at $ 800 per acre does not justify collateral attack on roll.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. An article 78 CPLR review proceeding with relation to the general assessment roll of respondent town cannot be maintained by petitioners since they fail to allege any basis for a collateral attack. Their exclusive remedy is a proceeding under article 7 of the Real Property Tax Law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. While the assessment roll was certified and filed as required by law, late filing does not vitiate the roll or the tax levied thereunder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The qualification, or lack thereof of the Town Assessors does not render the assessment illegal. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Moreover, the recitation of the assessor's background in real property matters more than satisfies the requirements set forth in section 1522 of the Real Property Tax Law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The alleged illegal acts that (1) inadequate provisions for hearing individual grievances were provided, (2) changes were made in the tax rolls after July 15, 1972, and (3) some veterans' exemptions were changed are inadequate to justify relief in the absence of evidence proving misconduct. Such charges affect individual taxpayers for whom the law provides an adequate remedy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. The charge that individual board members were motivated by personal profit or gain is not supported and is baseless as a reason for maintaining an article 78 certiorari proceeding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. The charge that the assessor adopted a multiphased program of assessment and only assessed vacant land in compiling the 1972 tax roll in alleged violation of section 306 of the Real Property Tax Law which states that all real property shall be assessed at full value is not supported.  Petitioners have failed to overcome the presumption that the assessments are correct.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. That the assessor used an outdated tax map and did not personally view each parcel&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  is immaterial.  The map used is not identified and petitioners have not shown the availability or lack thereof of any other map. Personal viewing of each parcel is not required by the Real Property Tax Law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. The contention that the assessor arbitrarily set a figure of $ 800 per acre as the market value of all land in the township and failed to take into consideration such factors as easements, road frontage, availability of water and location is meritless as justification for collaterally attacking the entire assessment roll in the absence of any supportable allegation that the $ 800 per acre assessment does not represent a uniform percentage of full value. </SPAN></P>

The father contended that because of religious beliefs the children were not immunized and that to have required him to do so would have constituted an unconstitutional infringement upon his free exercise of religion rights. The father commenced an action in federal court challenging the exemption provisions of that statute. The lower court held that the father had to first exhaust his state remedies. The children were allowed to attend school pursuant to the terms of a temporary restraining order which prohibited their exclusion from school, pending a determination of this motion for a permanent injunction. The court held that if father could prove at the trial that he had a genuine and sincere religious belief that he would qualify for the exemption.

The court found that even when his military service was taken into account, his age still exceeded the required 32 years. The court found that the commission was authorized under N.Y. Civ. Serv.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, a town building inspector and others, filed a motion pursuant to N.Y. C.P.L.R. 4404 for an order setting aside the court's decision in favor of plaintiff landowner or in the alternative, granting other related relief. The court previously rendered a declaratory judgment declaring that a city's zoning ordinance, to the extent that it would have prohibited the landowner from maintaining a mobile home on his property, was unenforceable.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court previously found that defendants' express policy of not enforcing prohibitions against mobile homes placed in the town prior to 1966 was premised on an arbitrary classification. Therefore, to allow defendants to enforce the prohibitions against the landowner, who had placed his mobile home on the town after 1966, would have resulted in a violation of his equal protection rights. Defendants stated that the decision was contrary to the evidence. The court found that defendants' argument was that the prohibition against mobile homes in their zoning ordinance prior to an amendment in 1966 was unconstitutional. As a result, defendants could not take action against mobile homes placed in the town prior to 1966. The court denied defendants' motion. The court held that defendants were in no position to question the constitutionality of their own enactment. The court further held that a governmental body, which enacted an ordinance, was estopped from challenging the provisions of their own ordinance. Finally, the court held that defendants' failure to raise the constitutional question before, without offering any excuse therefore, constituted a waiver on their part.</SPAN></P>

Defendants cannot suggest that they did not enforce the ordinance in force prior to 1966 on the ground that it was unconstitutional.  They cannot question the constitutionality of their own enactment.  Moreover, by failing to raise the question of constitutionality hitherto, they have waived it.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court was required to determine the constitutionality of 1968 N.Y. Laws 345, as amended by 1969 N.Y. Laws 1006 and 1971 N.Y. Laws 623 (Act) enacted by the State Legislature to enable the formation of the United Nations Development Corporation (UNDC) for the implementation of its development program. The owner of the land objected to the condemnation of the land for the program.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The application for an order of condemnation was objected to by the owner of the land sought by the city in its role as condemnor for the purpose of initially fulfilling its obligations as a participant in UNDC's development project. The owner opposed the application to condemn, alleging that the Act was an unconstitutional, unlawful intrusion by the State into the foreign and international affairs of the United States and that the use for which the property was sought for condemnation was not a &quot;public&quot; use. The claim that the creation of UNDC was the State's gambit into foreign affairs was rejected. Further, on a consideration of the whole concept of the development plan, it was apparent that the adventitious private use did not defeat the paramount public purpose of the project to supply the expanding and urgent needs of the UN. The court concluded that the enabling Act creating UNDC and empowering it to exercise the functions necessary to expand the facilities of the UN World Headquarters was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, two licensee harness racing track operators, brought actions against defendants, the New York State Quarter Horse Racing Commission and two corporations who had been granted temporary licenses to conduct quarter horse racing in Albany County and Suffolk County. The track operators sought a declaratory judgment that N.Y. Pari-Mutuel Revenue Law &sect; 67(4) was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An injunction was also sought restraining the commission from granting permanent licenses to conduct quarter horse racing within 50 miles of the track operators' harness racing tracks. The parties all sought summary judgment pursuant to N.Y. C.P.L.R. 3212. The track operators contended that that portion of the statute authorizing the granting of quarter horse racing licenses, which afforded 50-mile protection to all other harness tracks except the track operators' Saratoga and Roosevelt, was unconstitutional in that it denied equal protection to them as guaranteed by N.Y. Const. art. I, &sect; 11 and the 14th Amendment of the United States Constitution. The court held that the track operators were authorized to operate harness tracks only as might be prescribed by the legislature. Continuance of this kind of business depended on legislative permission, and this permission could be conditioned and the imposed conditions altered from time to time according to the legislative view of fairness. The court held that it could not be said that the establishment of a 35-mile radius for the relevant counties was based on arbitrary or unreasonable assumptions of fact.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Section 67 (subd. 4) of the Pari-Mutuel Revenue Law (as added by L. 1970, ch. 1023) which prohibits the grant of licenses to quarter horse racetrack located within 50 miles of any existing harness, thoroughbred or quarter horse track except that in Suffolk and Albany Counties, licenses may be granted to quarter horse tracks located within 35 miles of any such existing track, is constitutional.  It cannot be said that the establishment of a 35-mile radius for Suffolk and Albany Counties was based on fictions or on arbitrary or unreasonable assumptions nor does it indicate hostile or oppressive discrimination against plaintiffs.  Nor can it be said that no state of facts reasonably justifying the differentiation in distance is conceivable. There is a rebuttable presumption of the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  existence of the necessary factual support for the provisions of a statute which was known to the Legislature.  The Legislature had before it the necessary factual support for the enactment of section 67 (subd. 4).  The presumption has not been overcome.  The passage of such law was a valid exercise of the police power and of the power and authority of taxation given to the Legislature by section 9 of article I of the State Constitution.  </SPAN></P>
