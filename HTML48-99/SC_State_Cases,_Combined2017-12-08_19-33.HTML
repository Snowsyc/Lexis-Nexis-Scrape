</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, convenience store owner, commenced this action against respondent, South Carolina Department of Revenue, to recover for business losses allegedly incurred when cash payouts for video poker were banned pursuant to a local option referendum. The complaint alleged a regulatory taking of appellant's contracts regarding the poker machines and an unconstitutional impairment of contract in violation of the Contract Clause, U.S. Const. art. 1 &sect;10. The trial judge found no taking or impairment of contract and ruled in favor of respondent. The judgment was affirmed. The court found no merit in appellant's contention that a taking occurred when the statute providing for the local option referendum was enacted, in light of the fact no property right could have existed at that time since the contracts had not yet been signed. Furthermore, the court found no substantial impairment of a contract where further regulation regarding cash payouts was foreseeable.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment in favor of department of revenue affirmed; where appellant had entered into contract after enactment of law that allowed for local option referendum, there was no regulatory taking or unconstitutional impairment of contract.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants brought a declaratory judgment action against appellees, alleging that individual appellant was not qualified to run for the Citadel's Board of Visitors (Board) due to his age. Appellants requested a writ of mandamus ordering the Association of Citadel Men to proceed with the election and an injunction to require the election to conduct the election without appellant individual's name on the ballot. Individual appellant counterclaimed, arguing that the statutory age restriction violated the equal protection provision of the United States Constitution. On appeal, the court reversed the trial court's ruling, holding the election invalid since S. C. Code Ann. &sect; 59-121-30 (Supp. 1998) violated equal protection. There was no rational basis in imposing an age restriction on the elected members of the Board, but not on the governor's appointee. Thus, individual appellant was a qualified nominee entitled to have his name on the ballot.</SPAN></P>

Acts 125 (Act), legislation relating to video gaming machines. Plaintiff asserted that Part II of the Act was an unconstitutional delegation of power by the legislature to the voters of South Carolina. The court determined that plaintiff had standing to challenge the Act's constitutionality, because the Act required plaintiff to pay a license surcharge to fund the referendum and would directly affect plaintiff's business. The court also determined that Part II of the Act was an unconstitutional delegation of the legislature's authority to make a law based on S.C. Const. art. III, &sect; 1 and that Part II of the Act was severable from the rest of the Act, because Part I of the Act was capable of being executed independently of Part II without destroying the legislature's intent in passing the Act.</SPAN></P>

Appellant could not show that he was prejudiced by the refusal to admit documents related to appellant's earlier bond, because appellant was permitted to make the mitigation argument he sought. Refusing to admit testimony of appellant's accomplice was not an abuse of discretion because the testimony was irrelevant to the circumstances of the murder and appellant's statements negated any contention that he was a minor participant in the crime. Refusal to admit the testimony of a second witness on the grounds of remoteness was not error because there was no evidence that appellant was a minor participant in the crime and the testimony was not probative.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of summary judgment in the Lexington County Circuit Court (South Carolina), in favor of respondents, the state department of transportation, in an action for deprivation of substantive due process, unconstitutional taking, and arbitrary and capricious action arising out of the closing of a railroad crossing, where appellant argued he should have been given notice pursuant to S.C.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed summary judgment dismissal in favor of respondent state department of transportation. Appellant filed suit when respondent state department of transportation closed a railroad crossing, arguing that appellant should have been given notice, the closing constituted a taking, and resulted in the depreciation of appellant's property value, and the trial court granted summary judgment in favor of respondent. On review the court found that respondent had the authority to close and abolish grade crossings without notice under S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 58-15-1625 (Supp. 1998) upon a finding that the enhancement of public safety outweighed any inconvenience of increased circuitry of highway routes, and that statute was exclusive of other provisions of law, including S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 57-9-10, under which appellant relied, and which did require notice. The court rejected appellant's claim that he had a constitutionally protected right to access the highway because the affected road did not abut appellant's property.</SPAN></P>

The circuit court's master-in-equity granted respondent's motion for summary judgment. The Supreme Court of South Carolina affirmed, holding that the required payment was a charge, not a tax, and respondent had uniformly imposed the charge upon those who were required to pay it.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, the owner/operator of a convenience store, appealed from a decision of the Circuit Court of York County (South Carolina), which upheld the zoning board of appeal's denial of grandfather status under York County, S.C., Ordinance No. 497, for three video poker machines installed in appellant's store.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant convenience store owner operated five video poker games in his store. When the citizens of the county voted in a referendum to ban video poker machines, the company that owned the machines in appellant's store decided to remove the machines in anticipation of a ban on video poker in the county. The next month appellant learned that the ban would be postponed, so he installed two video poker machines in his store and obtained the required licenses. The county's ban on video poker was subsequently ruled unconstitutional. The county passed York County, S.C., Ordinance No. 497 that included a grandfather clause allowing the continued operation of video poker machines that met certain criteria. Appellant applied for grandfather status for his store for five machines, but the zoning board only grandfathered two machines because appellant only had two licenses at the ordinance's cutoff date. Appellant challenged the decision, and the lower court affirmed. Appellant sought further review, and the court reversed, finding that appellant was entitled to the other three machines to reach the maximum number allowed under the ordinance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the order of the lower court that upheld the denial of grandfather status on three video poker machines in appellant's store. The court found that since the county had already determined that appellant met all the requirements for two machines at the location, the county could not deny that appellant was entitled to the other three machines to reach the maximum number permitted under the ordinance.</SPAN></P>

Appellant challenged the ruling in favor of respondent and contended that because appellant was living out of state, S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 15-3-30 applied to toll the statute of limitations. Respondent argued that appellant could not use the tolling statute because respondent was amenable to service and his whereabouts were not concealed from appellant.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following a declaratory action brought by appellant sheriff against various respondent county officials, appellant sought review of the decision by the Horry County Circuit Court (South Carolina) denying appellant the custody and control of the county jail.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sheriff sought review of a decision by the lower court denying appellant the custody and control of the county jail. The court held that appellant had standing to bring the action for declaratory relief. Appellant, having a personal stake and financial interest in the question of control over the county jail, was a real party in interest who had a real, material, and substantial interest in the action. The court held that S.C. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 53-553, 554 (1959), granting exclusive jurisdiction over the county jail to the county police commission, were unconstitutional. By statute, as expressed in S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 24-5-10 (1976), the general law of the state had been that the sheriff had custody and control of the jail in his county. Since 1905, S.C. Const. art. III, &sect; 34(9) contained a provision restricting the legislature from enacting special laws that affected one county as opposed to the general laws for the entire state. Therefore, S.C. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 53-553, 554, taking away custody of the county jail, were unconstitutional when passed because the statutory provisions were in direct conflict with the general law.</SPAN></P>

The court also stated that the law did not violate the S.C. Const. art. III, &sect; 17, against one subject title legislation, because the title was changed prior to passage.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed an order striking down an ordinance that required any person conducting business in the city to obtain a business license.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant city sought review of the judgment from the Horry County Court (South Carolina) affirming the ruling of the special referee that appellant's Ordinance 5-11, which regulated the use of jet skis on public beaches, was invalid because it exceeded appellant's police power and was inconsistent with S.C. Const. art. XIV, &sect; 4, and with state statutes.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant city enacted an ordinance limiting the time during which jet skis could be used on its beaches. Respondent, the operator of a jet ski rental business, brought a declaratory judgment action to determine the ordinance's validity. The referee found the ordinance invalid, and the trial court affirmed his ruling. The court affirmed the trial court's decision in part and reversed it in part. It was within appellant's police power to restrict the time when jet skis could be launched and beached. State statutes regulating watercraft on navigable waters did not preempt the ordinance because the state statutes did not regulate beach activity, as the ordinance was designed to do. The ordinance did not infringe S.C. Const. art. XIV, &sect; 4 because the ordinance was a reasonable restriction on public access to navigable water. The ordinance did not violate federal constitutional protections regarding access to navigable water because the ordinance did not infringe on interstate commerce. Respondent did not have a vested right to use the public beach for jet ski rental. The ordinance did not constitute an equal protection violation because the ordinance was not enforced discriminatorily.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's decision in part and reversed it in part because the ordinance was within appellant's police power, state statutes did not preempt the ordinance, the ordinance was a reasonable restriction on public access to navigable water, the ordinance did not infringe on interstate commerce, respondent lacked a vested right to a particular use of government property, and the ordinance was not enforced discriminatorily.</SPAN></P>

That judgment was reversed after the court accepted petitioner state's petition for a writ of certiorari. The court below was first found to have erred in finding respondent's trial attorney ineffective for failing to obtain certain documents before trial because, even if respondent's attorney had been deficient, respondent failed to show that but for his counsel's error, the result of the proceeding would have been different. The court below was also found to have erred in finding the attorney ineffective for having failed to challenge a search of defendant's vehicle because such a challenge would have been futile in light of the fact that petitioner's theory for the search had been consent. Finally, respondent's attorney's failure to request a jury charge discussing the dismissal of a charge was not found to have been in error because there was no evidence that the jury had been misled.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged the order of the Circuit Court of Richland County (South Carolina), which ruled that the doctrine of res judicata barred appellant's argument about appellees' board composition and which held that the statute establishing appellees' board composition violated S.C. Const. art. III, &sect; 1. Appellees sought review of the reversal of appellees' administrative decision to revoke appellant's status as designated insurance agent.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant agent was an insurance agent of appellee facility. Appellee facility investigated allegations of underwriting irregularities at appellant's agency. Appellee facility sought to revoke appellant's designated agent status because appellant allegedly had improperly classified private risks as commercial risks, insured phantom vehicles, wrote duplicate coverages, endorsed policies to insure additional vehicles after policies were canceled, and violated trust accounting procedures. At a hearing, appellee board revoked appellant's designated agent status. Appellant petitioned the trial court for review. The trial court reversed the decision holding that the procedure followed by appellees was unconstitutional based on S.C. Const. art. I, &sect; 22. The trial court also held the doctrine of res judicata barred appellant's arguments about appellee board's composition and the statute establishing the composition was unconstitutional. Both parties appealed. The appellate court reversed the finding that res judicata barred appellant's argument and the case was remanded because the administrative hearing process was so inherently flawed that it was not subject to harmless error analysis.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court reversed the finding that res judicata barred appellant's argument regarding appellees' board composition. However, the appellate court affirmed the trial court's order that appellees' administrative procedure violated the state constitution because the same persons served as prosecutor and adjudicator regarding the revocation hearing, thus the action was remanded to ensure appellant received fair procedural due process.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court held (1) a particular witness was competent because she met the minimum standard for competency of S.C. R.

R. Evid. 801(d)(2), (5) it was harmless error for the trial judge to give the jury a circumstantial evidence charge because it instructed the jury to seek reasonable explanation other than the guilt of the accused. However, the error was harmless because the trial judge instructed jurors 26 other times that the state had the burden of proving appellant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, and (6) the appellant was not entitled to a new trial based on newly discovered evidence because the evidence appellant would have presented at a new trial would not change the outcome of the trial.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiffs alleged that defendants violated S.C. Const. art. XVII, &sect; 7, which prohibited lotteries. The cause was removed to the federal court, which made factual findings and issued an order of certification. On review the court found that the constitution did not prohibit games of chance or gambling per se with the exception of public officials. The court held that there was a clear distinction between lotteries and gambling or betting on games of chance. The court held that lottery was a term of art and video gaming devices did not come within the plain and ordinary meaning of lottery because they did not involve a drawing and tickets or other indicium of entitlement to a prize. The court held that the type II and type III video games did not constitute lotteries in violation of the state constitution, noting that any change was one for legislative action, not one for the courts.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was indicted on various charges, including murder, and the state sought the death penalty. While he was imprisoned awaiting trial, a privileged conversation between defendant and his lawyer was surreptitiously recorded. Upon learning of the videotape and its dissemination to the media, defendant moved for a temporary restraining order, which the trial court granted. The court held that the trial court did have subject matter jurisdiction to issue the injunction in order to protect its proceedings, and its assertion of personal jurisdiction over the newspaper challenging the injunction was not erroneous. There was sufficient evidence to conclude that pretrial publicity had the potential to impair defendant's constitutional right to a fair trial, and the remedial measures employed by the trial court were necessary to guarantee this right. The limited prior restraint imposed was narrowly tailored in scope and duration, and was justified by the egregious circumstances of the case.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the instant court affirmed defendant's conviction, but remanded the matter for an inquiry on defendant's allegation that the indictment in the case was issued by a grand jury, from which African Americans were excluded. The Horry County Circuit Court (South Carolina) entered an order that there was no discriminatory exclusion of African Americans. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In his statistical argument, defendant's expert witness based his calculations on a 13 percent figure for African Americans that constituted just the voter registration pool, not the potential jury pool. The figure did not take into account the statutory requirement of both the voter registration list and the driver's license/identification card list. Because the base figure was incomplete, all of defendant's figures rested on a suspect foundation. Moreover, defendant did not present any evidence as to whom was excused, whether they were excused for valid reasons, and whether there was a discrepancy between excusals for African Americans and whites. Defendant argued that the selection process was not racially neutral, because, although it may have produced random results in the long-run, it did not produce representative juries in the short-term. The appellate court rejected this argument, as the selection process only needed to be race neutral. There was not a strict legal requirement that every single jury be uniformly representative of the population. Finally, the appellate court held the State established that the county used race neutral selection criteria and procedures.</SPAN></P>

The jury returned a verdict in the deceased's favor. The trial court required her to elect between recovery under negligence law and the UTPA. The parties appealed, and, on remand, the trial court was directed to consider the deceased's application for attorney's fees and costs from the date on which she filed her second amended complaint alleging a violation of the UTPA. The trial court made the award, and the laboratory sought further review. The court affirmed the trial court's remand judgment and held that the attorney's fee provision of S.C.

The court found sufficient evidence supporting each of the six factors that the trial court properly considered in setting the attorney's fee award.

The court noted that the governor could exercise the veto power only when clearly authorized by the South Carolina Constitution and that the language conferring the veto power was to be strictly construed.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent pleaded guilty to criminal child neglect pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 20-7-50 (1985), for causing her baby to be born with cocaine metabolites in its system by reason of her ingestion of crack cocaine during the third trimester of her pregnancy. She filed a petition for post conviction relief, pleading the circuit court's lack of subject matter jurisdiction to accept her plea as well as ineffective assistance of counsel. Her claim of ineffective assistance of counsel was based upon her lawyer's failure to advise her the statute might not apply to prenatal drug use. The petition was granted on both grounds. The state appealed and argued the court erred in finding the sentencing court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to accept the plea. The supreme court held that both statutory language and case law compelled the conclusion that a viable fetus was a person for the purposes of the code. The court ruled that respondent's counsel's belief that the child neglect statute applied to her actions was justified and she did not receive ineffective assistance. The court found that &sect; 20-750 did not burden respondent's right to carry her pregnancy to term or any other privacy right.</SPAN></P>

Acts 171 effected a taking of property in which they had a vested interest and also violated due process.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">1988 S.C. Acts 658 was enacted, providing for a retroactive decrease in the capital gains tax rate for capital gains realized between January 1, 1987 and January 31, 1988 and providing for refund for overpayment of capital gains realized during 1987 through January of 1988. In 1989, Act 658 was amended to change the dates of the eligibility and to provide that the refunds would be made in two equal installments. 1991 S.C. Acts 171 altered the 1989 amendment by reducing by half the size of the refund. The taxpayers qualified for the refund and filed a complaint. The trial court found that the taxpayers possessed a vested property right interest in the capital gains tax refund and that Act 171 would effect a taking or , in the alternative, that the elimination of the refund constituted a retroactive tax that violated due process. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment in part. Act 171 did not effect a taking of a vested property interest because the taxpayers had no vested interest in the tax laws remaining unchanged. However, it violated substantive due process because of its excessive retroactivity. The rate of interest under S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 12-54-25 (Supp. 1996) governed.</SPAN></P>

When the bonds were repaid, the association would dissolve and its assets would be distributed to SCDOT. The property owner argued that SCDOT failed to comply with S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 57-3-615. The court held that &sect; 57-3-615 was unconstitutional on its face, under S.C. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 14, because state roads required statewide uniformity and S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 57-3-615 placed too much discretion in the counties. There was no lending of the state's credit or &quot;joint ownership,&quot; under S.C. Const. art. X, &sect; 11, because the bonds were payable solely by toll revenues and SCDOT was not a stockholder in the association. Even if the toll was a &quot;tax&quot; under S.C. Const. art. X, &sect; 5, there was no improper delegation because an independent expert would estimate the appropriate tolls. SCDOT had legislative authority to enter into noncompetition agreements under its broad power to contract.</SPAN></P>

At the sentencing hearing, the prosecution introduced evidence that defendant raped, killed, and attacked several other people, all while defendant was between 14 and 17 years old. Defendant was sentenced to death. The court affirmed the sentence. The court held that South Carolina's death penalty was not unconstitutional as applied to individuals under age 17. First, defendant failed to raise the argument below and thereby preserve it. Also, the United States Supreme Court had held that the death penalty was constitutional when applied to someone 16 years old or older at the time of the offense. The court was not persuaded by the decision of another state's court that found a death sentence for a 16-year old to be unconstitutional because that court failed to construe the statute in a way that could find it to be constitutional.</SPAN></P>

The homeowners also argued that there were no compelling reasons justifying the creation of the district by special law. The court found that the Act did meet the definition of special legislation and did not contravene the constitutional prohibition against special legislation. The legislature had a right under previously decided cases to create special districts without violating S.C. Const. art. III, &sect; 34(IX). The homeowners argued that monthly charges and front-foot assessments to cover a district project constituted taxation without representation in violation of S. C. Const. art. X, &sect; 5. The court found that assessments were routinely imposed only upon property benefited by a service. Regarding the question of the proportionality of the assessment, though the homeowners might not receive as great a benefit from the community water and sewer system as other property owners who did not have private water and sanitation facilities, there was no requirement that benefits to assessed land be direct or immediate or that there be absolute equality of benefits.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 16-15-365 (Supp. 1995), which generally prohibited certain &quot;lewd and lascivious&quot; behavior. Defendants' convictions were based on the conduct of dancers at a topless dancing establishment owned by one of the defendants and managed by the other.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Between November 1994, and July 1995, undercover police officers visited the topless dancing establishment posing as patrons. The officers observed the dancers repeatedly having physical contact with the customers. The physical contact included the dancers, among other things, rubbing their bottoms over men's crotches while performing private dances off-stage. Following these observations, defendants were charged with and subsequently convicted of violating &sect; 16-15-365. Defendants argued the statute under which they were convicted violated Due Process because it prohibited constitutionally protected speech and was thus overbroad. They argued the statute was facially overbroad because it could be applied to other conduct not extant in this case that was constitutionally protected. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that: (1) S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 16-15-365 (Supp. 1995) prohibited conduct, not speech; (2) while the statute did not directly limit its reach to public conduct, the court found that by the language used the legislature clearly intended such a limitation; and (3) defendants failed to meet their burden of proving &sect; 16-15-365&nbsp;unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendants' convictions of violating the statute prohibiting certain &quot;lewd and lascivious&quot; behavior.</SPAN></P>

The court held that although &sect; 6-1-70 did not prohibit the imposition of real estate transfer fees, it prohibited local governments from retaining the revenue generated by them. The court stated that the limitation on revenue-raising did not violate S.C. Const. art.

The court found that there was also no violation of article VIII because S.C. Code &sect; 6-1-70 (Supp. 1995) was a general law that applied to all real estate transfer fees.

Acts, Part II, &sect; 27 (&quot;Act 658&quot;).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Act 658 was enacted in response to the retroactive elimination of the capital gains tax deduction. Act 658 provided for a reinstatement of the tax deduction for capital gains realized between January 1, 1987 and January 31, 1988. Act 658 provided for refunds for the capital gains taxes that had been paid for gains realized during 1987 through January 1988. In 1989, Act 658 was amended to change the dates for which a deduction would be available. A 1991 amendment reduced by half the size of the refund each affected taxpayer would receive and also made ineligible for the tax deduction any person convicted of a felony in connection with the enactment or amendment of Act 658. The court held that the taxpayer's arguments were moot. The taxpayer's constitutional arguments concerned Act 658 as originally enacted and did not take into account the effect of the 1989 and 1991 Amendments, which cured most of the ills that the taxpayer complained of. The amended Act 658 had to be construed as if the original statute had been repealed, and a new and independent Act in the amended form adopted. The taxpayer posed no challenge to Act 658 as amended, and therefore his action was moot.</SPAN></P>

The court agreed with the trial court's analysis that because the state's criminal laws, which addressed the subject of public nudity, did not prohibit nude dancing alone, Ordinance 2727 conflicted with S.C.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 12-21-2806 (Supp. 1995) of the Video Games Machine Act, S.C. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 12-21-2770 to -2809 (Supp. 1995), provided for referenda on a county-by-county basis to determine the legality in each county of non-machine cash payouts from video game machines. Certain citizens brought an action against state and county officials seeking a declaratory judgment that S.C. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 12-21-2806, -2808 (Supp. 1995) were unconstitutional. The circuit court held that they were constitutional. The citizens appealed and the court reversed. The circuit court erred in holding that the challenged statutes were not special laws in violation of S.C. Const. art. III, &sect; 34. These local option laws permitted counties, through the referendum process, to opt out of S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 16-19-60 (Supp. 1985) which exempted non-machine cash payouts from the state's criminal prohibitions against gaming and betting. Thus, the effect of the laws was to criminalize conduct in some counties that remained legal elsewhere under state law. S.C. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 14(5), required statewide uniformity of criminal laws. The local option laws were therefore unconstitutional special legislation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Commission argued that it had a right to the filing fees for unopposed primary candidates. The court agreed. The language &sect; 7-13-40 required the filing fees for unopposed primary candidates, as well as those for opposed candidates, to be transmitted to the election Commission. The only way the party had any right to the filing fees for candidates who were unopposed in the primaries was if &sect; 7-13-40 effected an unconstitutional taking of its property. Prior statutory schemes for running party primaries created a party's property interest in candidates' filing fees. However, because the statutory scheme had been altered to relieve the political parties of the responsibility of conducting primaries, the property interest in filing fees no longer existed. The Commission conducted the primaries and the General Assembly set the filing fees for candidates. Because the political parties no longer financed and conducted their own primaries, and no longer set filing fees, the purpose of the filing fee was limited to that designated by the General Assembly. The court concluded that the party lacked any property interest in the filing fees at issue.</SPAN></P>

The residents' due process rights were not violated simply because the ordinance was passed after they purchased their home. Moreover, the court held that the ordinance was not preempted by the Federal Endangered Species Act, 16 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1531 et seq., or the South Carolina Nongame and Endangered Species Conservation Act, S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 50-15-10 et seq. (1992). Mount Pleasant, S.C., Ordinance No. 93050 did not create any obstacle to the fulfillment of state or federal objectives.

The state fund was created by the South Carolina State Underground Petroleum Environmental Response Bank Act, S.C. Code &sect;&sect; 44-2-10 et seq.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The insurer, an oil company, purchased pollution liability policies from the insurer in 1988 and 1989 concerning underground storage tanks. The policies contained coordination of benefits clauses, which provided that coverage would be in excess to any funds receivable from the state fund. Claims were made under the policies. The insurer sought a declaration that it was entitled to recover reimbursement under the fund. The circuit court denied reimbursement on the basis that the 1990 and 1992 amendments to the Act provided that the funds were payable only in excess to the coverage provided by insurance. On appeal, the court affirmed the circuit court's judgment, which had denied reimbursement. The court held: (1) that the amendments to the Act did not violate the contract clause of either the federal or state constitution because the insurer's expectation that the state would continue distributing funds without regard to insurance policies was unreasonable and there was no substantial impairment in the insurer's ability to contract; and (2) that retroactive application of the amendments was constitutional because the insurer had no contract with the State as to the funds.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant raised numerous challenges to the jury selection process, as well as the composition of the grand jury. Three women with young children were excused from jury service pursuant to the &quot;childcare&quot; exemption as provided in S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 14-7-860. Defendant argued that the statutory exclusion of these women violated his right to a venire pool that reflected a fair cross-section of the community. The court disagreed and held that the statutory exemption protected the important interest in assuring that the family members responsible for childcare were available to do so and was appropriately tailored. Further, the court found that the trial court had not abused its discretion in permitting another juror to be excused due to school concerns. The court did find that the trial court improperly denied defendant's challenges to the grand jury composition based upon his claim that blacks had been impermissibly excluded. The court held that defendant was entitled to provide statistical evidence to support his claim and because none was present, that portion of the judgment had to be remanded for the appropriate hearing. The remaining portions of the judgment were affirmed.</SPAN></P>

Accordingly, that portion of the trial court's judgment was remanded for a proper evidentiary hearing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The county adopted an ordinance which established a user fee for the disposal of solid waste. The ordinance also required multi-tenant property owners to be responsible for the fees of their tenants if a lease for the tenant was not on file with the county records office.

The court also held that the ordinance did not violate the owner's equal protection rights because requiring multi-tenant property owners to pay the solid waste disposal fees of their tenants was reasonably related to the purpose of charging the persons who generated solid waste for its collection and disposal and there was a rational basis for billing property owners when their tenants did not have leases on file in the county records office.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff employees brought an action against defendant city shortly after plaintiffs received a copy of the new employee handbook, which was published after defendant repealed the ordinances that set the level of fringe benefits for plaintiffs. The previous handbook did not contain any disclaimer that it was not intended to create a contractual relationship. The circuit court found that plaintiffs had no contractual rights that were impaired by the prospective reduction in benefits. The court noted that the existence of a contract generally was a question of state law, and the parties sharply disputed whether defendant owed plaintiffs any contractual obligation. The court found that an examination of the ordinances at issue demonstrated no intent by defendant to bind itself contractually to plaintiffs. Plaintiffs failed to meet their burden of overcoming the presumption that the ordinances did not give rise to contractual rights. Absent any information when the original employee handbook was issued, no conclusion could be reached from the issuance of the handbook about defendant's intent in enacting the personnel ordinances. The court affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The county council commenced an action challenging the constitutionality of 1949 S.C. Act 443, &sect; 5. The trial court held the proviso requiring the delegation's involvement in the budgeting and taxing functions of the District violated the separation of powers doctrine. Rather than strike the proviso as unconstitutional, however, the trial court found the approval function of the delegation should be transferred to the county council, which had the statutory power under S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 4-9-30(5) (1986) to make appropriations for special tax districts. The District argued that the trial court erred in transferring the approval function to the county council rather than striking the approval requirement altogether. The court concluded the legislature would have passed the Act independent of the provision requiring budgetary oversight by the legislative delegation and found no reason to nullify the entire Act creating the District rather than sever the delegation's role of direct budgetary oversight. Further, the trial court's attempt to preserve budgetary oversight by vesting the function in the county council under S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 4-9-30(5) violated S.C.

Acts 588, which created a special sales tax for school funding.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer argued that the tax violated the rule against taxation without representation because certain county residents could not vote for school board members although they were taxed, that the tax was a type of special legislation, and that Act 588 was an unconstitutional delegation of taxing power. The state supreme court affirmed. The taxpayer was not taxed without representation because Act 588 did not give defendants the unlimited power of taxation. The sales tax was imposed only after the entire county voted for it. While special legislation was generally unconstitutional when a general law was applicable, Act 588 was not a type of special legislation. Local governments had the authority to pass taxing legislation for education aimed at persons and property within a certain district without violating the rule against special laws. The tax in question was raised through everyone in the county and was for the benefit of the entire county. Act 588 did not delegate taxing power to defendants. With the approval of the voters, a tax was imposed county-wide. The constitutional prohibition against the delegation of taxing authority was not implicated.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In an action brought by plaintiff county magistrates challenging defendant county's authority to eliminate their magistrate positions, the United States District Court for the District of South Carolina certified two questions concerning a county's authority under S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 22-1-10(A) (Supp. 1994) to determine the number of magistrate positions, subject to S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 22-8-40(B) (1989) and S.C. Const. art. V, and art. VIII, &sect; 14.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The county contended that S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 22-8-40(B) (1989), which established a county's maximum number of magistrates, delegated to the counties the discretion to determine the number of magistrate's positions it wished to fund. The court held that the county's construction rendered the statute unconstitutional because it was clear that under S.C. Const. art. VIII counties had no authority to alter the structure of the magisterial branch of the judicial system. S.C. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 14 limited the powers that local governments may be granted by state law by providing that local governments may not set aside the structure for and the administration of the state's judicial system. Under S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 22-8-40(B) (1989), there were two alternative formulas which were to be used in ascertaining the appropriate number of magistrates, requiring the county to have either one magistrate per 28,000 persons or the average of one per 28,000 persons and one per 150 square miles, whichever was higher. Thus, &sect; 22-8-40(B) required counties to fund the higher number of magistrates mandated by application of the section's formula.</SPAN></P>

The court held that neither the First nor the Fourteenth Amendment mandated a right of access to government information. The information could have been available, only not so conveniently as the attorney wished. Further, the attorney's speech was not limited in any way. Neither did the statute violate the attorney's due process or equal protection rights. The statute was reasonably related to the purpose of protecting accident victims' privacy.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, manufacturer and owner of real and personal property, sought review of a decision of a trial court, Charleston County (South Carolina) that upheld the constitutionality of the Local Option Sales Tax legislation (LOST), S.C. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 4-10-10 to - 100. (Supplement 1994).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The manufacturer filed LOST and property tax returns and paid those taxes under protest. Thereafter, it filed its action challenging the allocation of the property tax credit. It alleged that the LOST legislation violated S.C. Const. art. X, &sect;&sect; 1, 6 by effectively altering the uniformity requirements in those sections and that the LOST legislation violated S.C. Const. art. III, &sect; 17. The manufacturer conceded the sales tax itself was constitutional but that the tax credit was severable from the sales tax portion of LOST. The court held that the plain language of article X, &sect;&sect; 1 and 6 did not impose uniformity on the distribution of taxes. The LOST scheme had not altered the levying of property taxes nor the assessment of property. Rather, the scheme merely levied a sales tax and distributed the sales tax in the form of a property tax credit. Because property taxes were assessed and levied regardless of the LOST credit, the trial court was correct in holding that the LOST plan did not violate article X, &sect;&sect; 1 and 6 of the Constitution. The title of LOST met the requirements of article III, &sect; 17 because it stated the general subject, local option sales tax.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The attorney was appointed to represent an indigent non-capital defendant after the Public Defender's Office was relieved from representation because of a conflict of interest. After the case was resolved, the attorney submitted a Defense of Indigents voucher to the circuit court on which he deleted the statutory rates included on the voucher form and inserted a higher rate. The circuit judge denied the voucher because the fee exceeded the statutory rate under S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 17-3-50 (1985). The attorney commenced a declaratory judgment action seeking a ruling the statutory fees were unconstitutional. The court found no taking because the burden on the attorney was not excessive. There was no fundamental unfairness in the application of the statutory fees in a non-capital case. The court reasoned that the attorney, when he was admitted to the Bar, voluntarily submitted to appointment for indigent representation by the act of taking the oath of admission.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant voters sought review of an order from the Circuit Court of Beaufort County (South Carolina), which found their proposed spending limitation ordinance unlawful. The voters had brought suit to compel respondent County Council to place the proposed ordinance on the ballot. The circuit court specifically finding that the proposed ordinance violates S.C. Const. art X, &sect; 7(b).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The voters argued that the proposed ordinance did not violate S.C. Const. art. X, &sect; 7(b). The court agreed. The ordinance limited the amount of total expenses that the Council could incur. Thus, it merely limited the amount of estimated expenses. Therefore, the ordinance did not affect the Council's ability to prepare and maintain annual budgets which provided sufficient income to meet its estimated expenses. The voters next contended that the ordinance did not violate S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 4-9-1210 (1986) because it did not specifically appropriate money or authorize the levy of a tax. The court disagreed. The voters argued that &sect; 4-9-1210 did not prohibit the electorate from introducing an ordinance which limited all county appropriations. However, the voters' interpretation of &sect; 4-9-1210 would have led to the absurd result of prohibiting the electorate from introducing an ordinance that limited a specific county appropriation but allowed the electorate to introduce an ordinance that limited all county appropriations. In limiting all county appropriations, the ordinance restricted the Council's authority over the treasury and thus defeated the plain legislative intent of &sect; 4-9-1210.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court modified the order of the circuit court to hold that the proposed ordinance did not violate the South Carolina Constitution and, as modified, affirmed the order.</SPAN></P>

Accordingly, the circuit court ordered the tax commission to refund all taxes paid under protest. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that: (1) the circuit court's finding, that the transactions between the taxpayers and carrier companies constituted a sale of services, was supported by evidence of record; (2) reasonable evidence supported the circuit court's finding that the taxpayers' sales of services to the carrier companies were wholesale and, therefore, exempt from sales tax; and (3) the taxpayers were entitled to interest on their judgments as set forth in S.C.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The personal representative of a deceased former patient of the hospital brought a negligence action against the hospital to recover for the patient's injuries, which were allegedly caused by the hospital. The hospital moved for summary judgment on the basis the action was barred by S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 15-78-110 (Supp. 1993) of the South Carolina Tort Claims Act, which provided a two-year statute of limitations. The trial judge granted the hospital's motion for summary judgment. The personal representative appealed, contending that the trial judge erred in applying &sect; 15-78-110 because the action was for medical malpractice and, therefore, the medical malpractice statute of limitations, S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 15-3-545 (Supp. 1993) was the proper statute of limitations. On appeal, the court held that the trial court properly held the Act to control because the hospital was a governmental entity and that there was no equal protection violation because a shorter statute of limitations period was rationally designed to minimize the undue burden on the public entity brought by late filed claims, which increased the cost of litigation and reduce the likelihood of settlement.</SPAN></P>

The insurer had brought the declaratory judgment action to determine coverage.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The policy issued to the contractor provided that the insurer could cancel the policy without cause upon ten days notice.

On July 14, 1986, the rider was injured while riding his motorcycle through a construction site worked by the contractor for the Department. The rider sued the contractor and the Department, and the insurer then filed its action. Appellants argued that the trial judge erred in finding that S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 38-75-730 (1986) violated the Contract Clause because there was no substantial impairment. On appeal, the court agreed that there was no Contract Clause violation but concluded, however, that &sect; 38-75-730 did not apply to the policy in question and affirmed the cancellation of the policy. Section 38-75-730 did not become effective until after issuance of the policy to the contractor. A statute that became effective after the date of issuance of an insurance policy did not apply to the policy absent legislative intent that the statute be applied retroactively. There was no evidence that the legislature intended &sect; 38-75-730 to apply retroactively.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A party chairman collected filing fees from 15 candidates running for political office in an election and forwarded them to the SEC. Because eight candidates were unopposed, with their names not being listed on the ballot, the chairman demanded that the SEC return the fees of the eight candidates. When the SEC refused, the chairman initiated an action to recover the fees. A trial court ruled that S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 7-13-40 (Supp. 1993) did not require transmittal of filing fees of candidates whose names appeared on the ballot and, thus, ordered the SEC to return the fees paid by the chairman. On appeal, the court affirmed, noting that under &sect; 7-13-40 filing fees were to be transmitted to the SEC only for candidates whose name appeared on the ballot. Because the statute was clear and unambiguous, the court said that it must abide by its terms and not attempt to limit or expand its scope. Despite the SEC's contention that a number of local parties did send fees for unopposed candidates, the court rejected the SEC's attempt to have it search for another meaning. Moreover, only fees required to be transmitted were subject to the statute's mandate of using the fees to conduct primaries.</SPAN></P>

The trial court found that aggravating circumstances were present so defendant was sentenced to death. Defendant appealed and the court affirmed. At trial, both parties made Batson challenges so the trial judge selected a new venire including some of the jurors who had been stricken. The court found that this was not an error because once a new venire was selected, it was within the trial judge's discretion to fashion the appropriate remedy under the particular facts of each case. As long as neither party's constitutional rights were infringed, that remedy could include the seating of an improperly challenged juror. The trial court properly admitted autopsy photographs because they depicted precisely the aggravating circumstance that they were intended to show. The relevance of the photographs and their probative value on the issue of physical torture was great enough to negate the risk of the jury basing its decision on an improper passion. The court found that the probative value of the slides in this case clearly outweighed any prejudicial effect they may have had on the jury.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged his conviction for possession of crack cocaine with intent to distribute claiming that the provision in S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 44-53-375 (Supp. 1991) for higher penalties for possession with intent to distribute crack cocaine than were provided for cocaine in other forms violated the Equal Protection and Due Process Clauses of the United States Constitution. The court held that the terms of the statute clearly and unambiguously proscribed the possession of crack cocaine with the intent to distribute. The court found no due process violation because the statute gave sufficient notice to enable a reasonable person to comprehend what was prohibited. The court also found that the legislature's classification in sentencing between crack cocaine and cocaine had the following rational motives: the potency of the drug, the ease with which drug dealers can carry and conceal it, the highly addictive nature of the drug, and the violence which often accompanies trade in it. The court held that the statute did not violate the Equal Protection Clause.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 20-7-1670(e) (1992) in adoption proceedings brought against respondent biological parents. The Department of Social Services intervened as respondent.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">One day after the infant's birth, the adoptive parents (from the State of New York) filed a petition for adoption pursuant to S.C.

The family court found that unusual or exceptional circumstances did not exist. The adoptive parents and the child filed motions for reconsideration. The family court issued a second order requiring that the child be surrendered and the adoptive parents and the child appealed and filed a petition for supersedeas. An order was issued by the court superseding the family court order which required the adoptive parents to surrender the child. The court concluded that: (1) to allow a court to focus exclusively on the non-residence of the prospective parents would violate the provisions of S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 20-7-2040; (2) unusual or exceptional should turn on a best interests of the child standard; and (3) because of the limited record, the court was unable to review the family court's decision.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayers challenged the county's budgetary process of providing certain services to unincorporated areas only. The taxpayers contended that the county was required to apportion the taxes according to the services provided. They alleged that the county's practice violated S.C. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 7, S.C. Const. art. X, &sect; 6, and S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 4-9-30 (1986 and Supp. 1993). After the trial court entered judgment in favor of the county, the taxpayers sought review. In affirming, the court determined that the county was not required to establish a special service district under either &sect; 4-9-30 or S.C. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 7. In addition, the county did not violate the &quot;uniformity&quot; requirement of S.C. Const. art. X, &sect; 6 by imposing the county-wide tax. The taxes levied in the county were uniform because they were levied equally within the county. Finally, the court held that the county did not violate the Equal Protection Clause by distinguishing between county residents in cities and those in unincorporated areas. The services rendered benefitted all residents because they were provided for county maintenance. The Equal Protection Clause did not require mathematical symmetry.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellees successfully enjoined the enforcement of Ordinance No. 91-17, which made it unlawful to own or operate a &quot;sexually-oriented&quot; business, which was defined to include a nightclub or bar where nude or semi-nude dancing was performed and alcoholic beverages were served. The ordinance also prohibited participation in nude or semi-nude dancing. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment of the trial court. Ordinance No. 91-17 was an unconstitutional restriction of appellees' First Amendment rights because it was a content-based regulation of a constitutionally protected activity. The ordinance totally banned nude dancing, and provided no alternatives for the banned expressive conduct, such as minimal clothing that dancers could wear. The ordinance was not related to a ban on public nudity, but targeted the dancing itself. Ordinance No. 91-17 sought to proscribe conduct not unlawful per se under S.C.

The fact that a legislative delegation could recommend a project to a county transportation committee infringed no executive power. The recommendations were not binding on the transportation committee, and the executive branch retained ultimate discretion over the expenditure of &quot;C&quot; funds.

The inmate did not file the application for post-conviction relief. On appeal from the trial court's order dismissing the petition for writ of habeas corpus, the court affirmed. Section 17-27-20 provided that the Uniform Post-Conviction Relief Act was the exclusive remedy for challenging the validity of a conviction or sentence. The writ of habeas corpus was provided for by S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 17-17-10 (1976) and was constitutionally guaranteed by S.C. Const. art.

The circuit court held that the definition of &quot;player&quot; in S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 12-21-3320(16) (Supp. 1989) excluded representatives of the operator.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the court held that the plain meaning of S.C.

The court further held that the definition of player was not unconstitutionally vague on its face. The court found that an internal Commission memorandum on the practice was an unofficial and nonbinding policy statement as opposed to a binding norm or rule that had to be published as a regulation in accordance with the Administrative Procedures Act (APA) provisions codified at S.C. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 1-23-130, 1-23-140 (1986). The court also noted that the Bingo Act was a tax statute but that S.C. Tax Commission Manual of Regulations, Opinions and Policy Documents, Revenue Procedures 87-1and 87-3 (1989) did not apply because the memorandum was a guideline, not a regulation, and the issuance of guidelines was discretionary. The court ruled that surveillance of the game did not violate the Taxpayer's Bill of Rights, S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 12-54-810 (Supp. 1989), because the surveillance was tax-related.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants argued, inter alia, that they were immune from indictment by virtue of their earlier plea bargain agreement or that they were immune from indictment by virtue of immunities granted in order to compel their testimony before the state grand jury. The court held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in dismissing the indictment against those defendants with plea bargain agreements because there was sufficient evidence in the record that the terms of the agreements barred further prosecution of those defendants. The court then enunciated a new rule that future plea bargain agreements had to be on the record and had to recite the scope, offenses, and individuals involved in the agreement. The court would then limit its review of a plea agreement only to those terms that were fully set forth in the record. The court also held that the dismissal of the indictments against defendants who gave immunized testimony at the state grand jury was proper because the limitation of immunity to use immunity under the State Grand Jury Act, specifically S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 14-1760 (Supp. 1992) violated S.C. Const. art. I, &sect; 12, which permitted only transactional immunity.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs alleged that the companies conspired to fix soft drink prices.

He invoked his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination and refused to answer essentially all of the relevant questions asked by plaintiffs and the company. The company filed a motion to compel the former employee's testimony pursuant to the Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(a). The magistrate certified and the court agreed to answer the following question: Whether S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 39-3-40 (1985) precluded prosecution by the State of South Carolina of a witness compelled to testify in a civil action brought in the district court under S.C. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 39-3-10 and 39-3-30. The court determined that S.C.

Code Ann. &sect; 39-3-30 (1985), which provided for civil remedies for those damaged by violations of S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 39-3-10 (1985).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">1973 S.C. Acts 757 created a county water and sewer authority to consolidate those services in one authority.

Acts 757 was unconstitutional and that 1971 S.C. Acts 240 was revived. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that the legislation creating a water and sewer authority in a specific county violated the constitutional home rule mandate. It did not qualify under the transitional legislation exception to the prohibition against legislation affecting a specific county because it did not implement a new form of county government. The court did not agree with the county's argument that 1971 S.C. Acts 240 should have been declared invalid because of disuse. Instead, it was revived by the invalidation of 1973 S.C.

Trial counsel was ineffective for failing to object to the trial court's jury instruction regarding the burden of proof under S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 44-53-370(d)(3). The instruction improperly shifted the burden of proof to the inmate in that it stated that a rebuttable presumption of guilt arose where a person possessed more than one gram of cocaine or 28 grams of marijuana.

However, the court held that S.C.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant creditor challenged an order from a trial court in Beaufort County (South Carolina), which entered judgment in favor of respondent debtor in the creditor's action to attach the proceeds from the debtor's settlement of a personal injury action in satisfaction of the creditor's judgment. The trial court gave the debtor the benefit of the Homestead Exemption Act, S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 15-41-30(11)(B).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At the time the creditor obtained a judgment against the debtor, the debtor was a South Carolina resident. She later became a Virginia resident and settled an unrelated personal injury action. The creditor tried to attach the proceeds of the settlement, but the trial court concluded that to allow the creditor to seize the proceeds would be a denial of the debtor's equal protection rights. On appeal, the court reversed, holding that the Homestead Exemption statute, in limiting the exemption to South Carolina residents only, did not deprive the debtor, a non-resident, of equal protection of the laws. The classification of residents versus non-residents satisfied the three-prong test: it was reasonably related to the purpose of protecting residents from indigency; the members of the class were all treated alike; and the State had a legitimate interest in preventing its citizens from becoming dependent upon the State for support. The classification was not plainly arbitrary and there was a reasonable hypothesis to support it.</SPAN></P>

In the taxpayers' action to enjoin defendants' appropriations, the court held that S.C. Const. art. X, &sect; 5 did not and could not prohibit the appropriations made by Act 501 because S.C. Const. art. X, &sect; 5, unlike the former S.C. Const. art. X, &sect; 3, did not prohibit the legislature from amending the public purpose to which tax proceeds could be applied. Specifically, the appropriation of SHIMS revenues to the general fund did not violate S.C. Const. art. X, &sect; 5 because Act 501 created no new tax; it did not fix the tax rate or levy a tax. As such, &sect;&sect; 129.65, 124.27 of Act 501, 1992 S.C. Acts 3249, did not violate S.C. Const. art. X, &sect; 5.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were street preachers who preached loudly on Saturdays in downtown Beaufort directly in front of business establishments by either standing on the sidewalk or in the bed of a pickup truck. The City of Beaufort amended its local noise ordinance making it unlawful to disturb a business by making loud and unseemly noises. On several Saturdays, defendants commenced their loud preaching and the businesses called police. After determining that the merchants' complaints were based solely on the noise, police warned defendants that they were in violation of the City of Beaufort Ordinance &sect; 9-1008. Defendants were arrested when they continued to preach at the same noise level. Defendants alleged that the ordinance was unconstitutionally vague and infringed upon their freedom of speech in violation of the U. S. Const. amend. I and S. C. Const. art. I &sect; 2. Because the court found that the ordinance was content-neutral, the court held that the ordinance did not violate defendants' constitutional rights to free speech and that the ordinance was not constitutionally vague. The ordinance regulated speech solely upon the noise generated rather than the message conveyed.</SPAN></P>

The trial court held that the company's power plant was properly included within the District and that the County Treasurer was entitled to recover all taxes that had been paid under protest.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The company alleged that it had a contract for fire services with a local city, which thereby exempted the company's power plant from inclusion in the new District under S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 4-19-10 (1976) and S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 5-7-60 (1976). The court affirmed the judgment against the power company. The trial judge concluded that the agreement between the company and the local city was a mutual aid agreement, which was not a contract as contemplated by the statutes. The record established that there was no agreement between the company and the local city concerning the timing or the amount of the annual payment made by the company. A volunteer fire department produced receipts from the company, but it had been terminated from the plant's fire plan in 1984. Company representatives told the company's expert witness that payments to the city fire department were voluntary. There was sufficient evidence to support the judge's conclusion that a contract did not exist between the company and the local city. Lastly, the company's claim that the tax was an unconstitutional taking failed because, contrary to its assertions, the company was benefitted by the presence of the new fire district.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant requested that the court reconsider its affirmance of his conviction in light of a determination by the United States Supreme Court finding that cross burning constituted expressive speech entitled to protection under the First Amendment. On rehearing, the court vacated its prior opinion and reversed defendant's conviction. The court determined that S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 16-7-120 (Law. Co-op. 1985) was facially unconstitutional because its intent was to prohibit symbolic conduct, cross burning, which expressed ideas that society found to be offensive. Although S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 16-11-550 (Law. Co-op. 1985) was unconstitutionally overbroad, it did not reflect an attempt by government to limit speech. The court cured the impact of &sect; 16-11-550 on the First Amendment by holding that the term &quot;incendiary&quot; when used in conjunction with &quot;explosive&quot; was defined as a bomb used to start a fire. The trial judge committed reversible error in informing the jury that &sect; 16-11-550 spoke to devices &quot;used to ignite fire or tending to excite.&quot; The error was compounded by the fact that when the trial judge charged the jury, he refused to include the word &quot;explosive&quot; in his reading of &sect; 16-11-550.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The creditors obtained a judgment against the debtor, plus attorney's fees.

The masters held that the annuity from the malpractice suit was exempt from attachment pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 15-41-30(11)(B)(Supp. 1992). On review, the creditors contended that &sect; 15-41-30(11) denied them equal protection on the ground that it served no compelling government interest. The court disagreed, finding that the statute invoked an accepted protection of certain portions of a debtor's property from creditors and was not invalid merely because it did not contain a monetary cap. The court also rejected the argument that the statute violated due process and impaired the obligation of contracts in that it was enacted subsequent to the obligation for the debt. While the current version of the statute was enacted in 1988, the court noted that the identical exemption had existed since 1981, codified as S.C.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The purchasers had contended that the ordinance was void because it levied a tax on the transfer of realty without statutory authority.

The master had held that, when read together, art. VIII, &sect; 7, and S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 5-7-30 (Supp. 1991), conferred authority to enact the ordinance. On appeal, the purchasers asserted that under Dillon's Rule the ordinance was invalid in the absence of express or implied enabling statutory authority. The court found that by amending S.C.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The client's criminal conviction was reversed based upon ineffective assistance of counsel. The client conceded that the applicable statute of limitations was six years as prescribed by S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 15-3-530 (1977 &amp; Supp. 1992). She argued that the trial court erred because the limitations period applicable to her cause of action had not expired, or, alternatively, that the limitations period was tolled by S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 15-3-40 (Supp. 1992). The client argued that she did not discover the attorney's alleged malpractice until the court reversed her conviction based on ineffective assistance of counsel. The court found that the limitations period expired before the client filed her action. The court held that the client could not claim the benefit of &sect; 15-3-40 because she was imprisoned on a life sentence when her cause of action accrued. The client claimed that excluding prisoners serving life sentences from the tolling provisions of &sect; 15-3-40 violated the Equal Protection clauses of the United States and South Carolina constitutions. The court disagreed and held that a reasonable hypothesis existed for the legislature's exclusion of life prisoners from &sect; 15-3-40.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After defendant pled guilty to assault and battery with intent to kill, armed robbery, first degree burglary, grand larceny, kidnapping, and murder he was sentenced on each charge and given a death sentence on the murder charge. On review, defendant's major assertion was that his sentence to death on the murder charge should be reversed because the trial judge erred in proceeding directly from the plea to sentencing without waiting at least 24 hours as required by S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 16-3-20(B) (Supp. 1991). The court found that there was nothing in the record that indicated that defendant waived the waiting period under &sect; 16-3-20(B). The court did not deem defense counsel's assent to immediately proceed with sentencing sufficient to constitute a waiver of the statutory waiting period under &sect; 16-3-20(B). Therefore, the court vacated the sentence of death on the grounds that the statutory waiting period under &sect; 16-3-20(B) was not observed, and defendant did not affirmatively waive the waiting period.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant State sought review of a determination by the Aiken County Master-In-Equity (South Carolina) in an action brought by appellees, attorneys and an investigator, that S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 16-3-26 (Supp. 1991) and S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 17-3-50 (1985) were unconstitutional because they set the amount of attorney's fees allowed to counsel appointed in capital cases, as well as amounts allowed for investigators.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The attorneys were appointed to represent an indigent client in a capital case and the investigator was employed to assist in the defense. Following the defendant's acquittal, the attorneys and the investigator brought an action against the State because they had acquired fees and costs greatly in excess of those allowed under S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 16-3-26 (Supp. 1991) and S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 17-3-50 (1985). The circuit court referred the matter to the master-in-equity, who declared the statutes unconstitutional, awarded the attorneys fees at the market rate, and awarded the investigator an amount. On appeal, the court held that the statutes were not unconstitutional because they did not provide absolute allowances for capital cases, but merely provided limitations. The court found that the attorneys were entitled to recover their fees at a reasonable rate to be determined by the court, rather than the market rate. The court ruled that the amount awarded to the investigator was reasonable.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the determination that the statutes were unconstitutional and remanded the matter for a determination of reasonable attorney's fees and costs for the attorneys.

The court affirmed the trial court's judgment that convicted defendant of murder and sentenced him to death. The circuit court properly decided to not instruct the jury that it must have found beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant understood his Miranda rights before it could consider defendant's incriminating statements as evidence. The question of whether law enforcement complied with the requirements of Miranda was for the court, not for the jury. The court limited the application of State v. Adams, 277 S.C. 115, 283 S.E.2d 582 (1981) to the extent that it mandated that the jury make a separate finding that defendant received and understood his Miranda rights. Facts which demonstrated that defendant was given and understood his Miranda rights comprised but two elements that a jury must have examined under the totality of the circumstances when it sought to determine whether a confession was made voluntarily. The statutory definition of &quot;kidnapping&quot; that was contained in S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 16-3-910 (Law. Co-op. 1976) was not overbroad because &sect; 16-3-910 was not so broad as to encompass all cases of murder.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiffs contended that the Board improperly adopted the plan, in that it exceeded the authority granted to it by the legislature.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found that the allegations of individualized injuries by the plaintiffs were sufficient to show standing. Because the clear statutory language, evidence of legislative intent, longstanding administrative interpretation, and required constitutional construction of the Act left no doubt that the Board had exceeded its statutory authority in proposing cuts based on agencies' growth, the court granted the injunction. The Board's new interpretation was in conflict with the legislative and administrative history of the Act because the legislature had expressed its approval of proportionate across the board cuts by reenacting the provision granting the Board the authority to make reductions each year. Further, construing the Act to allow the Board to choose any method for reducing the rate of expenditures, the only limitation being that the reductions be as uniform as practicable, would have violated the separation of powers provision in S.C. Const. art. I, &sect; 8. In the absence of the authority to reduce the rate of expenditure based on growth, either the Board had to make proportionate cuts across the board, or the legislature had to be recalled to deal with the reductions.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">While the victim was hitchhiking a ride with defendants and two other passengers, she was taken down a dirt road to a garbage dump and brutally murdered.

One of the passengers received immunity for her testimony at trial and the other passenger was 11 years old at the time of the murder. After the convictions and sentences were affirmed on appeal, defendants sought post-conviction relief. When the court refused to grant certiorari, the United States Supreme Court remanded for further consideration of the post-conviction relief that was sought. The court held that the malice charge made to the jury was an unconstitutional shifting of the burden of proof. However, the court further held that the error was harmless because of the overwhelming evidence showing malice on the part of defendants. Additionally, the court held that the circuit court did not err in holding that defendants' motions to amend the post-conviction relief petitions were untimely under the Uniform Post-Relief Conviction Procedure Act, S.

Code Ann. &sect; 11-35-50 (1976), and that a county ordinance was invalid and inapplicable to an amended contract between respondents, a waste disposal contractor and a county.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The contractor and the county entered into a contract for construction and operation of solid waste disposal facilities. The contractor would take over a current disposal site and build a new facility that could accept up to 3,500 tons of waste per day. The citizens' group expressed concern over the effects of locating a landfill in the county and an amended contract was executed to limit the amount of waste to be received from out-of-state sources. The county then adopted an ordinance, which would require the contractor to obtain a permit and limited the amount of waste to be received to 150 tons. The trial court found that no private right of action was provided and that the ordinance impaired the contract and was invalid. The court affirmed. There was no underlying intent to benefit citizens' groups or private parties in the competitive procurement law; therefore, the citizens' group had no implied right of private action. The ordinance was invalid as it affected the contract because it impaired the contract, such impairment substantially disrupted the reasonable expectations of the parties to the contract, and it was unconstitutionally unreasonable and unnecessary.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff lessees brought an action against defendants, an automobile dealer (dealer) and a manufacturer, on the theories of breach of warranty, strict liability in tort, and a violation of the Regulation of Manufacturers, Distributors, and Dealers Act (Act). A trial court in Richland County (South Carolina) awarded the lessees double actual damages and treble punitive damages as provided in the Act. The dealer and the manufacturer appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The dealer and manufacturer asserted that the Act was unconstitutionally vague and that the actual damages were not caused by the dealer's conduct in violation of the Act. They also contended that a finding of malice was not supported, the lessees were erroneously allowed to recover attorney fees, the notes written by a lessee were hearsay, and evidence of the subsequent recall of an automobile was admitted in error. The court held that the Act adequately provided notice of what conduct was prohibited and was not unconstitutionally vague. Any actual damages suffered by the lessees resulted from the dealer's actions. The jury could have properly found malice evidenced by any number of the facts recited. When an action in which attorney fees were recoverable by statute was joined with alternative theories of recovery based on the same transaction, no allocation of attorney's services had to be made. The notes itemizing the malfunctions of the car were prepared by one lessee immediately before she took the car in for service. Thus, the notes qualified as a witness' past recollection. The subsequent recall was admissible to show the defective condition existed at the time alleged.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the award of actual and punitive damages to the lessees.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The husband claimed that the wife was not entitled to alimony under S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 20-3-130 (1990) because she had committed adultery. The wife claimed that she suffered from a mental illness. The trial court found that the wife lacked the capacity to commit adultery. The appellate court found that the wife failed to prove that her mental condition deprived her of the ability to control her acts. The court affirmed in part and reversed in part the appellate court's judgment. The court held that S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 14-3-320 (1983) provided that the court's review of a family court's findings of fact was limited to substantial evidence review, that &sect; 14-3-320 conflicted with S.C.

Code Ann. &sect; 14-3-320 was unconstitutional, and that the wife had the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that she was unable to appreciate the wrongfulness of her adultery.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The federal retirees had appealed the court's decision that they were not entitled to a refund to the United States Supreme Court, which had granted the retirees' petition for certiorari, vacated the court's judgment, and remanded the action to the court for further consideration. In affirming, the court held that the equal protection clause did not require a statute authorizing a refund for one type of tax to provide the identical procedural mechanisms which were provided in a separate statute for a different type of tax. The court further held that its previous decision was based primarily on the adequate and independent state ground that the retirees were procedurally barred from recovery because they failed to proceed under the applicable state statute. However, the court further found that it was free to utilize the Chevron Oil analysis to determine whether Davis could have been applied prospectively. After having done such an analysis previously, the court concluded that Davis should have been applied prospectively. However, even if Davis should have been applied retroactively, the court still denied the retirees' refund as they were procedurally barred from recovery.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Upon certified questions from the federal district court, the South Carolina Supreme Court determined that South Carolina law applied to the policy at issue.

As the rule of conflicts statute applied, the court refused to consider application of the Second Restatement of Conflicts of Law, for such analysis would be an advisory opinion that the court would not make. Applying the rule of conflicts statute, the court found that South Carolina insurance law applied, and the application of South Carolina law was neither arbitrary nor fundamentally unfair. While the parties were not residents of the state, the contract was not written in the state, and the policies covered property in other states, the insured property at issue in this case was within South Carolina.

The taxpayer contended that she was not liable for the use tax that respondent South Carolina Tax Commission assessed against her under S.C.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent injured filed an action against appellant highway department under the South Carolina Tort Claims Act (SCTA). The jury returned a verdict in favor of respondent, but the trial court reduced the verdict pursuant to a liability cap provided in the SCTCA. Appellant sought review, claiming that the trial court erred in the admission of certain evidence, that respondent was contributorily negligent, and that appellant had immunity under the SCTA. Respondent sought review, claiming that the liability cap was unconstitutional. On appeal, the court found that appellant waived its right to object to the inadequacy of the limiting instructions to certain evidence. The court held that the issue of contributory negligence was properly submitted to the jury. The court held that appellant provided no testimony reflecting a conscious decision, that it weighed the appropriate factors, that it was made in reference to the repair and maintenance of the road travelled by respondent, and therefore appellant was not entitled to immunity. The court sustained the constitutionality of the liability cap because it was neither arbitrary nor without a reasonable basis.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the verdict in favor of respondent injured because appellant highway department failed to establish that it had immunity. The court also affirmed the reduction in respondent's award because the South Carolina Tort Claims Act provided a liability cap that was constitutionally proper.</SPAN></P>

The trial court held that the acts were valid, and the county appealed. The court determined that the acts were special legislation as they applied to only one county and one institution of higher learning. The court found that legislation regarding education was not exempt from the requirements of S.C. Const. art. III, &sect; 34(IX). The court held that the acts violated the general prohibition against special legislation contained in S.C. Const. art. III, &sect; 34(IX) because a general law could be fashioned to provide ad valorem property tax funding for all state funded colleges and universities and the record was devoid of any peculiar local conditions requiring special treatment.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The tax commission commenced a declaratory action, seeking a determination of the constitutionality of S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 12-27-430 (Supp. 1990). The circuit court held that the statute was unconstitutional in its entirety and further found that the tax commission was entitled to collect an additional tax on fuel ethanol blends previously sold by the oil marketers. The oil marketers appealed. In vacating in part, the court concluded that, because the tax commission's complaint only asked the circuit court to determine whether &sect; 12-27-430 was constitutional, it was error for the circuit court to hold that the tax commission was entitled to assess and collect taxes on ethanol blends previously sold. That portion of the circuit court's order was, thus, vacated. In affirming the remainder of the circuit court's ruling, however, the court concluded that &sect; 12-27-430 was unconstitutional, in that, it imposed an unconstitutional burden upon interstate commerce where it was designed to benefit only intrastate concerns. Because there was no savings clause in the statute, the unconstitutional provision rendered the statute unconstitutional in its entirety.</SPAN></P>

On further appeal, defendants argued that the statute was unconstitutionally overbroad under U.S. Const. amend. I as applied to them. The court agreed and reversed the conviction. The freedom of individuals verbally to oppose or challenge police action without risk of arrest was one of the principal characteristics of a free nation from a police state.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the city argued that &sect; 13-3 and S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 44-53-370(c) and (d) (1976) prohibited the same conduct, with the city code merely imposing the maximum punishment, not usurping the state law. The city also contended that state law established only the outer parameters of municipal court sentencing jurisdiction and that the municipal judge's discretion was properly limited by the ordinance establishing the substantive offense and mandatory punishment. In affirming, the court ruled that S.C. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 14 precluded local governments from setting aside state criminal laws and penalties and that S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 44-53-370(d) had preempted the field for penalties for the possession of marijuana. The court held that the ordinance violated the strictures of S.C. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 14 by setting aside the penalty under state law. The court ruled further that City of North Charleston, S.C., City Code &sect; 13-3 attempted to circumvent the sentencing discretion of the municipal judge conferred under S.C.

The court also held that the forfeiture proceeding did not violate the state constitutional due process clause, S.C. Const. art. I, &sect; 3.

After a breathalyzer test revealed that the driver was not intoxicated, the arresting officer requested that the driver submit to a urine test because he believed the driver was under the influence of drugs. When the driver refused to provide a urine sample, his license was suspended for 90 days pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 56-5-2950(d). The driver challenged the suspension of his license, contending that the last sentence of &sect; 56-5-2950(d), which allowed a person arrested for a first DUI offense to have the 90-day suspension cancelled if he pled guilty but mandated the 90-day suspension if the accused exercised his right to a jury trial, was unconstitutional. The suspension was sustained, but the circuit court reversed on appeal, finding that the statutory provision was unconstitutional. The State Department of Highways and Public Transportation appealed.

Code Ann. &sect; 17-29-20 (Law. Co-op. Supp. 1991) or the state or federal constitutions.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant argued that Caller ID, an optional service by which the telephone company's customers could purchase a device that would reveal the telephone numbers of incoming calls, violated S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 17-29-20, which prohibited trap and trace devices. The court found that S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 17-29-20(B) exempted the use of trap and trace devices where the consent of the user of the service had been obtained. The court determined that the user of Caller ID would be the subscriber to the service, and the user's subscription would constitute the required consent under S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 17-29-20(B). The court found that the constitutional right to privacy did not attach to the Caller ID service because the State's approval process for new telephone services did not rise to the level of &quot;state action&quot; to convert the telephone company's actions into those of the State for purposes of the Fourteenth Amendment. The court affirmed the judgment in favor of the telephone company, finding that any expectation of privacy that a caller had in his telephone number did not outweigh the interest of a called party in deterring harassing, fraudulent, unlawful, or abusive calls.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The indictment charged that defendant unlawfully committed a sexual battery upon his niece during a two-year period. The trial court denied his motion to quash the indictment as unconstitutionally vague or overbroad and convicted him of criminal sexual conduct with a minor in the first degree. On appeal, the court affirmed. Defendant alleged that because of the two-year length of time specified in the indictment, he was unable to defend the charge by establishing an alibi defense. The court refused to adopt a per se rule that a two-year indictment period was unconstitutionally overbroad. Defendant was able to proceed with his defense of denial and he presented evidence of factual impossibility, but the jury simply rejected those defenses. The court noted that the indictment span was narrowed as much as possible under the circumstances. The victim, who was eight-years-old at the time of trial, was unable to pinpoint the exact date on which the offense took place. Defendant testified that he was only in the victim's vicinity a few times during the two-year period. In determining whether defendant was prejudiced, the court looked at the surrounding circumstances that existed pretrial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee was injured while working for the employer and was awarded disability benefits, which were paid by the insurance company. Subsequently, the employee became incarcerated and missed a required visit with his physician as a result. The insurance company discontinued the payment of benefits and alleged that the employee was no longer entitled to benefits since his incarceration and refusal to meet with the physician. The commissioner ordered the continued payment of benefits, but the commission reversed the decision. The circuit court reversed the commission's determination and ordered the payment of the employee's benefits. On appeal, the court held that the employee's incarceration was not wholly dispositive of his right to receive benefits because the benefits were a property interest of the employee's. The court found that because the employee's earning capacity was affected by his injury and he had continued to see a physician once an approved one had been appointed, the discontinuance of his benefits was unsupported. Thus, because the employee had not reached maximum medical healing, he was entitled to benefits despite his incarceration.</SPAN></P>

The Circuit Court, Horry County (South Carolina) granted summary judgment in favor of defendants. The artist appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The president of the artist's guild requested that the artist remove a piece of art because it was offensive. The artist refused. The director and the city manager ordered that the lobby closed until the matter was resolved. The action of the city manager and/or the director did not represent official municipal policy. Under the council/manager form of government adopted by the city the manager and the director did not have the authority to set city policy, nor could their acts be said to represent official policy. The acts of the manager and the director were individual discretionary acts, involving a decision on how to handle a situation that had arisen in the convention center. The municipal council never met, nor did they vote, on the decision made by the manager and the director. Therefore, their acts were not translated as the acts of the city council or the city. The city council did not have the authority to delegate matters of policy of customs, and it did not delegate that authority therefore the individual decisions of the manager and the director did not give rise to liability for the city. The manager and the city enjoyed qualified immunity.</SPAN></P>

Acts 6447, was prohibited special legislation and violative of S.C. Const. art. VIII, &sect;&sect; 1 and 7.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to Act No. 190, 1969 S.C. Acts 202, one of the Acts that created the Authority, the governing body of the Authority was to be composed of seven resident electors of Newberry County, to be appointed by the Governor upon a recommendation of a majority of the members of the Newberry County Legislative Delegation. However, Act No. 784, 1988 S.C. Acts 6447, required that each of the seven resident electors be representative of a county council district and be appointed by the Governor upon recommendation of the majority of members of the Newberry County Council, and it provided that the terms of the present governing members appointed under Act No. 190 would expire on the effective date of Act No. 784. The court held that the prohibition against special legislation in S.C. Const. art. VIII meant that no law could be passed concerning a specific county that related to those powers, duties, functions, and responsibilities that, under the mandated systems of government, were set aside for counties. Act No. 784 was exactly the type of special legislation that was prohibited by art. VIII, &sect;&sect; 1 and 7 and could not be considered transitional legislation or remedial legislation.</SPAN></P>

The court found no abuse of discretion in the trial court's decision not to submit special verdict forms to the jury. The court found that the issue of agency was properly submitted to the jury because the subcontractor could not have been found, as a matter of law, to be an independent contractor. The court held that the trial court properly charged the jury that, in removing the stop sign, the telephone company violated S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 56-5-1030. The court held that the injury victim could recover for property damage, although the car was assigned to him by his father following the accident, because the telephone company lacked standing to contest the validity of the assignment.

Instructions to the jury concerning resolving conflicting evidence did not constitute an improper comment on defendant's failure to testify. Instructions were judged by what a reasonable juror would have understood them to mean. The court also held that it was not error to define reasonable doubt as substantial doubt.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Upon auditing the taxpayers' tax records, the Commission discovered that a number of its coin operated machines had not been declared as merchant's equipment even though they appeared as fully depreciated assets on the taxpayers' tax returns. The taxpayers disputed the Commission's characterization of the property, claiming that the machine's were not merchant's equipment because they were in storage or discarded. The circuit court found that if property was merchant's equipment, it was subject to 27 S.C. Code Ann.

Code Ann. &sect; 48-39-10 et seq. (1989). The Charleston County Court of Common Pleas (South Carolina) awarded damages to the landowner and appellant council sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowner contended that the Beachfront Management Act's restrictions on the use of his lots worked a taking of his property without just compensation because it deprived him of all economically viable use of his property. The council claimed that no compensation was due because the landowner's private use threatened serious public harm. The court held that governmental regulation of the use of property in order to prevent serious public harm did not amount to a regulatory taking of property for which compensation had to be paid. The landowner did not challenge the validity of the legislative scheme or its purposes. The court followed its previous position and rejected the landowner's argument that he was entitled to damages regardless of how the proposed use of his property harmed the public.</SPAN></P>

The children contended that the marriage to the husband was invalid, that the husband waived his right to the estate, that the testator's intent was disregarded, and that S.C.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The children argued that the husband was not entitled to the elective share because he was not the legal spouse of the testator. The children alleged that the husband's divorce decree from his second marriage was not finalized until after his marriage ceremony with the testator. The children also contended that the husband waived his elective share by conveying his interest in the marital residence to the testator and by a reconciliation letter. In addition, the children claimed that the testator had the right to dispose of her property as she wished and that S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 62-2-201 did not provide equal protection. The court affirmed the judgment. The court held that the divorce decree was final when signed by the judge and filed with the family court. The court found that there was nothing the indicate that the husband knew he was waiving his elective share. In addition, the testator could not ignore S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 62-2-201. Finally, the court concluded that men and women were treated equally under &sect; 62-2-201 and that the classification of married persons was reasonably related to the legislative purpose of providing for the surviving spouses.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Commission assessed taxes against the taxpayer that included royalty and interest income the taxpayer received from its foreign subsidiaries. The taxpayer appealed and the trial court ruled that no refund was due the taxpayer. The taxpayer sought review of the trial court's decision. In reversing the trial court's order in part, the court found that the Commission's apportionment formula did not adequately address the income the taxpayer derived from its foreign subsidiaries. The court determined that the trial court did not adequately consider the disproportionality caused by not separating out the income derived from the taxpayer's foreign subsidiaries and its subsidiaries in the United States. The court stated that the apportionment formula needed to be re-factored to consider in its denominator the proportionate measure of the payroll, property, and sales from the foreign subsidiaries that generated income for the taxpayer. The court remanded the case for the court to determine if there was a gross disparity between the amounts that affected the taxpayer's constitutional rights and that would warrant a refund.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The doctor performed gynecomastia on three boys for enlarged breasts by performing mastectomies. Experts testified that the procedure was improper when the doctor failed to investigate whether the boys' conditions were such to be improved by surgery. The doctor performed a tubal ligation and scar revision on a female patient who came to him for a tummy tuck because her abdomen had stretch marks from pregnancy. The patient was to receive a tummy tuck rather than the scar revision, and the doctor was not qualified to perform the scar revision. In the procedure he removed the patient's navel. Without conducting an examination, the doctor ordered the discharge of an emergency room patient who required observation. The court held that S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 40-47-200(8) and (12) properly apprised the doctor of unacceptable conduct. Subsection (8) forbade unprofessional conduct that was likely to harm the public, and subsection (12) provided that a lack of professional competence constitutes misconduct for which a doctor could be disciplined.

VIII, &sect; 7, in that fees collected under the ordinance from businesses in portions of the county inured to the benefit of all, and in that the tax was not levied equally within the affected areas, denying the taxpayers equal protection of the law and depriving them of their property without due process under S.C. Const. art. I, &sect; 3 and U.S. Const. amend. XIV, &sect; 1. The county denied the unconstitutionality of the ordinance. Adopting and incorporating the trial court's law, findings, and conclusions, the court ruled that the tax imposed was an excise tax, and not a property tax, and the cited portions of the state constitution were inapplicable to it. Further, countywide distribution of the revenue from the excise tax that was only collected in certain county areas was not prohibited by S.C. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 7.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the U.S. Supreme Court rendered its decision in Davis v. Michigan Dept. of Treasury, 489 U.S. 803, 109 S. Ct. 1500, 103 L.Ed.2d 891 (1989), ruling that state taxation of income of persons retired from employment with the federal government at a greater rate than the taxation of income of persons retired from state service violated the doctrine of intergovernmental tax immunity and was constitutionally prohibited, federal retirees residing in South Carolina filed suit against the state and the state tax commission seeking a tax refund. The trial court agreed that the retirees were entitled to a refund and rendered judgment in their favor. The state and the state tax commission appealed. In reversing, the court concluded that, although the federal retirees could no longer be assessed a greater tax than state retirees, the Davis decision was to be applied prospectively and not retrospectively. To apply Davis retroactively would require the state to refund approximately $ 200,000,000 to the federal retirees.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The patient commenced a medical malpractice suit against the doctor and hospital, alleging that a gauze pad was negligently left in her abdomen following surgery. The trial court held that the suit was barred by the statute of limitations in S. C. Code Ann. &sect; 15-3-545 as it existed prior to amendment in 1988 and granted summary judgment to the doctor and hospital. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that: (1) the patient's medical malpractice action was governed by the pre-amendment version of &sect; 15-3-545; and (2) the two-year &quot;foreign object&quot; limitations period of the statute satisfied the requirements of equal protection. The court rejected the patient's contentions that the legislature intended for the amendment to have retrospective operation and that it was unconstitutional to allow &quot;foreign object&quot; malpractice claimants only two years to file suit while allowing other malpractice claimants three years. The direct causal connection between a foreign object and its attendant negligent conduct justified exempting such negligence from any &quot;repose&quot; limitation while, on the other hand, reducing the period in which to bring suit once the object was discovered.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with murder after killing a dairy worker with an ax. Following a bench trial, defendant was found not guilty by reason of insanity. After finding defendant not guilty, the trial judge committed defendant to a state hospital for a 120-day evaluation pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 17-24-40 (1976). Defendant challenged the order of commitment. In affirming, the court rejected defendant's argument that the retrospective application of &sect; 17-24-40 violated the prohibition against ex post facto laws. The statute merely changed the procedure for commitment proceedings and did not affect any substantial right of defendant. Further, the application of &sect; 17-24-40 did not constitute an ex post facto law because it did not make criminal a previously innocent act, aggravate a crime previously committed, provide greater punishment, or change the proof necessary to convict. Further, &sect; 17-24-40 required that any terms and conditions imposed by the judge were to be therapeutic in nature and not punitive.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The statute, part of the Industrial Revenue Bond Act, S.C. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 4-29-10 to 4-29-150 (1986), allowed a negotiated &quot;fee in lieu of taxes&quot; for projects involving an initial investment of at least $ 85 million. Under the statute, the county and the corporation used the negotiated fee in connection with a proposed $ 700 million expansion of the corporation's existing manufacturing facilities. The taxpayer, a county resident, alleged that the statute violated the uniformity provisions of S.C. Const. art. X as well as equal protection. The court first held that the statute did not violate the uniformity provisions because the property that was the subject of the negotiated fee was exempt from ad valorem taxation under S.C. Const. art. X, &sect; 3(a), which applied to property used exclusively for public purposes. The court stated that industrial development was a public purpose and the transaction here served such a public purpose. Next, the court held that the statute did not violate equal protection because its classification scheme was rationally related to its legislative purpose of attracting large capital-intensive industries to South Carolina.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The child was defendant's five-year-old stepson.

Defendant's attorney was allowed to fully cross-examine the child. The videotaped testimony was shown to the jury. The court first held that the procedures established for handling &quot;special&quot; witnesses under &sect; 16-3-1510(G), in conjunction with cases construing the statute, sufficiently protected defendant's right to confrontation while simultaneously protecting the rights of the victim. The court then found that the State had presented ample evidence, including expert testimony, that would enable the trial court to conclude that testimony in defendant's presence would be traumatic to the child.

The trial court ruled against the chiropractor. The court affirmed the judgment and held that the restriction on commercial speech under Reg. 61-90 &sect; 101(A) was a narrowly tailored one and it did not violate the First Amendment. The term &quot;chiropractic hospital&quot; would have been deceptive in that such a facility could not have provided surgical or medical care supervised by licensed medical doctors or osteopaths contrary to the specific qualifications of a &quot;hospital.&quot; The chiropractor still could have advertised his facility as a chiropractic inpatient facility.

The trial court held that the ordinance was invalid because the new district overlapped the old district and that the legislature's act repealing the legislation establishing the old district was unconstitutional special legislation.

The corporation, which operated two adult bookstores, contested the constitutionality of the ordinance. On appeal, the court affirmed the circuit court's decision upholding the ordinance. The court held that: (1) the county had the power to regulate sexually oriented businesses because the regulations pertained to public use of buildings and public health and general welfare, which were embraced by the enabling statutes; (2) the ordinance's locational provisions were valid &quot;time, place and manner&quot; regulations because they provided reasonable alternative relocation sites for businesses affected by the ordinances and the corporation presented no evidence that it was effectively denied a reasonable opportunity to continue the operation of its bookstores at other locations; and (3) the ordinance's licensing provisions were narrowly tailored to serve the county's interests because it provided the Zoning Administrator with a standard susceptible of objective measurement, thus circumscribing his discretion, and the provisions were not substantial broader than necessary to achieve the county's interest.</SPAN></P>

The board invalidated her teaching certificate after ETS notified it that the teacher's scores were cancelled. Although the teacher requested and was granted a hearing, a committee affirmed the board's decision. Thereafter, she sought judicial review. The lower court affirmed the board's judgment. On appeal, the court reversed the lower court's order, concluding that S.C. Code Reg. &sect; 43-59 (Supp. 1989) was unconstitutional because it let the State deprive the teacher of her employment, which was a protected property interest, without affording her procedural due process. Due process required that the teacher be afforded notice and an opportunity to confront and cross-examine witness against her. The fact that she was given a hearing as a favor did not save the regulation. Besides, the hearing granted failed to afford due process to the teacher because the board disclosed no evidence substantiating the cancellation of her test scores. Thus, the teacher had no meaningful opportunity to contest the allegations against her.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent South Carolina Public Service Authority adopted a resolution to change its fiscal year to the calendar year, under &sect; 31 of Act 658, Gen.

The trial court entered judgment for the authority, and appellants, national banks and bondholder class representatives, sought review. On appeal, the court affirmed, adopting the trial court's order. The court held that &sect; 31 was not special legislation that violated appellants' rights under S.C. Const. art. III, &sect; 34, because no general law applied to the authority as a quasi-municipal corporation. The resolution did not violate appellants' equal protection rights under U.S. Const. amend. XIV and S.C. Const. art. I, &sect; 3, because the authority was a unique state agency with a justifiable reason for acting differently from other agencies. The court held that the resolution only technically impaired contracts with bondholders and so did not violate the contract clauses under U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 10 and S.C. Const. art.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate filed his action three years after the alleged libel occurred and while he was incarcerated on a life sentence for murder. He alleged the investigator gave false information to the station during the inmate's trial, which the station broadcasted. The trial court dismissed the action as barred by the two year statute of limitations under S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 15-3-550(1) (1976). The trial court held that the disability under S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 15-3-40(3) (Supp. 1987) providing for tolling of the limitations period if a person was imprisoned at the time the action accrued did not apply to the inmate because he was serving a life sentence. On appeal, the inmate claimed that &sect; 15-3-40(3) violated his equal protection rights because he would be eligible for parole after 20 years and, therefore, he stood in the same position as one convicted for a term less than life. In affirming, the court held that the inmate was not eligible for parole until the service of 20 years. An award of parole, however, was discretionary with the parole board even after the inmate became eligible. Thus, the inmate's status was not the same as that of a person serving a definite term of 20 years.</SPAN></P>

The rules were changed to allow members of the joint delegation to vote for Edgefield County residents who were not nominated by the Edgefield County delegation. The highway commissioner was elected after the Edgefield County delegation walked out in protest.

Prior to the trial, the trial judge had posted a notice that he would issue sanctions against attorneys who requested insufficient court time for their cases. The trial judge found the attorney in contempt. On appeal, the court reversed and vacated the ruling. The court held that the trial judge abused his discretion in finding the attorney in contempt of court because she neither willfully disobeyed a court order nor acted disrespectfully towards the court. She merely underestimated the amount of time she would need to try her case by thirty minutes. The trial judge's notice was a local administrative rule affecting the operation of the courts that had not been submitted to or approved by the Chief Justice as was required. The trial judge in family court was not authorized to adopt its own rules of administration or practice and procedure.</SPAN></P>

The federal court presented to the court the certified question of whether S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 44-43-10 was unconstitutional as being violative of the Equal Protection Clause of S.C. Const. art. I, &sect; 3.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The hospital and blood center sought summary judgment on the patient's claim of breach of the implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose. The court considered the question of whether South Carolina's blood shield statute,&nbsp;S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 44-43-10, which exempted providers of blood and blood products from implied warranty-based liability, violated the South Carolina Constitution. The court held that the encouragement of a readily available supply of blood and blood products motivated the enactment of &sect; 44-43-10 in South Carolina, that the classification created by the statute bore a reasonable relation to that legislative goal, and there was nothing irrational in the legislature's decision to distinguish between individuals injured as a result of blood transfusions and individuals injured by improperly designed or manufactured man-made goods. There was no unequal treatment of potential defendants and the classification created by the statute rested upon a reasonable basis. Therefore, the statute comported with the Equal Protection clause of the Constitution of South Carolina.</SPAN></P>

Appellees failed to timely file the actions pursuant to &sect; 30-4-100(a), and the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction. Unless the action was timely commenced under &sect; 30-4-100(a), the trial judge lacked subject matter jurisdiction and any order issued in the action was void. An examination of the complaints in the actions supported the conclusion that November 21, 1986, was the date of the alleged violation. Once a public vote was taken in accordance with &sect; 30-4-20(c), the information in question was no longer a public record for purposes of the FOIA.

Thereafter, a hearing was held on the merits. The parties reached a compromise, and the child was returned to the mother. No appeal was taken from that order. The mother filed an action seeking declaratory and injunctive relief and damages. She claimed that S.C.

The court found that the commission was exempt from the criteria notice requirements necessary under the competitive sealed bidding of S.C. Code Ann. 11-35-1520 (1976). Thus, the panel placed a procedural requirement upon the commission that was simply not provided for in &sect; 11-35-1590 or 23 S.C. Code Ann. Regs. 19-445.2120 (1976).

Code Ann. &sect; 6-15-60 (Supp. 1986) was amended to allow counties to impose charges on properties served by sewer facilities. Pursuant to this statute, the county council enacted the Master Special Sewer District Ordinance which set up a framework for the county to designate areas in need of sewer facilities and to impose charges upon persons or property receiving sewer service in those areas. Subsequently, the county council enacted another ordinance that provided for imposing charges and issuing bonds to finance sewer lines in a particular area. The taxpayers argued Act 499 was unconstitutional because it violated S.C. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 7 and S.C. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 14. The court affirmed, holding that: (1) the provisions for creating special tax districts contained in S.C.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer operated movie theaters throughout South Carolina. Pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 12-21-2710 (Law. Co-op. 1977), the taxpayer paid a 20 percent tax on admissions when showing motion pictures rated &quot;X&quot; or not rated. The court declared the tax imposed by &sect; 12-21-2710&nbsp;unconstitutional. The taxpayer applied for a refund of the taxes paid under &sect; 12-21-2710. Upon petition to the circuit court, the trial judge ordered the Commission to issue the refund. The Commission asserted that the taxpayer had no standing to seek a refund because the tax was paid by the patron, not by the movie theater. The court found that the South Carolina General Assembly provided that taxes imposed by S.C. Code Ann. ch. 21 were to be paid by the business establishment unless otherwise provided. The court noted that S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 12-21-2420 (Law. Co-op. 1977), which was a tax upon movie patrons, provided otherwise, but that S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 12-21-2710 (Law. Co-op. 1977), the statute that imposed the additional tax on nonrated or X-rated movies, did not provide otherwise, thus the movie theater (taxpayer) was liable for the tax imposed by &sect; 12-21-2710.</SPAN></P>

After experiencing weight loss during the later stages of pregnancy, the mother delivered a stillborn child on September 12, 1979. Questioning whether the doctor had rendered proper medical care, plaintiffs first consulted an attorney one day after the mother was released from the hospital. After receiving a legal malpractice settlement against an attorney for failure to timely file suit against the doctor, plaintiffs filed suit against the doctor in March 1985. The trial court entered summary judgment for the doctor, finding plaintiffs' claims barred by the medical malpractice statute of limitation, S.C. Code Ann. (1984 Supp.). Plaintiffs appealed. Noting that &sect; 15-3-545 encompassed both negligence and contract actions arising out of medical malpractice, the court held that the statute did not violate equal protection and that plaintiffs discovered or reasonably ought to have discovered the potential medical malpractice action beyond the limitations period.</SPAN></P>

Under this authority, state research authority sought to fund its construction and development of research parks by issuing bonds to finance its activities. The trial court held that several provisions of the Act were unconstitutional and that funding actions contemplated by state research authority to finance its activities were ultra vires. State research authority appealed, arguing that although it was prescribed from pledging the state's credit, that a mortgage of their land would not constitute a pledge of state credit. The court agreed, holding that state research authority, a state agency, could expend public funds for industrial development, because industrial development was a valid public purpose.</SPAN></P>

Defendant argued that the trial judge committed error when he excluded persons from the jury who were opposed to the death penalty. The court disagreed and held that although a prospective juror could be excluded for cause if his views on capital punishment would prevent the performance of his duties as a juror, defendant's right to a jury selected from a representative cross-section of the community did not encompass the inclusion of persons opposed to the death penalty. Defendant next argued that the trial judge erred in refusing to charge the jury on the lesser-included offense of voluntary manslaughter. The court disagreed and held that a charge on a lesser-included offense was proper only when the evidence was susceptible of the inference that defendant committed the lesser offense. The court held that defendant went to the scene in the middle of the night armed with a gun and a bayonet. He waited for the victims, then killed all three of them. Although there was a history of domestic strain between defendant and his ex-wife, there was absolutely no evidence these murders were provoked.</SPAN></P>

The trial court sentenced him to the mandatory minimum sentence of 25 years with a $ 25,000 fine.

The court also found that the decision to single out drug traffickers for especially harsh penalties had the rational basis of protecting the public health by attacking the most pressing danger with the stiffest penalties. The court also found that the sentence was neither cruel nor unusual because it was not out of proportion with the severity of the crime when the gravity of the offense, the similarity of sentences in the same jurisdiction, and the similarity of sentences in other jurisdictions were taken into consideration.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After concluding that the wife had not been properly married to the decedent, the circuit court ruled that under S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 21-7-480 (1976), she was only allowed to take one-fourth of the estate of the decedent. On appeal, the wife challenged the law as unconstitutional. The court agreed, holding that &sect; 21-7-480 was unconstitutional in its entirety because it violated the Equal Protection Clause of the United States Constitution and had no rational basis in any legitimate governmental interest. Mindful of the rights of persons affected by the statute on the one hand, and the need for the orderly probate of estates in South Carolina on the other, the court held that &sect; 21-7-480 was inapplicable to the estates of those persons dying on or after August 19, 1982. The wife, therefore, could inherit the estate as directed in the decedent's will. The state's interest in the sanctity of marriage was not substantially related to limiting the inheritance rights of a certain class of illegitimate children. No child is responsible for his birth and penalizing the illegitimate child was an ineffective way of dealing with the issues.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After an amendment to &sect; 58-27-1360 was enacted, the cities invoked the original jurisdiction of the court seeking a declaration of the constitutionality of the amendment. Section 58-27-1360 empowered cities to condemn and purchase facilities of the cooperatives whose territories, previously assigned to the South Carolina Public Service Commission, became annexed. This power involved the right to oust the cooperatives through the exercise of eminent domain. The amendment to &sect; 58-27-1360 restricted the cities' power and provided that condemnation could only occur after the Commission had found that the cooperative's service was inadequate, undependable, or unreasonably discriminatory. Specifically, the cities alleged that the amendment contravened S.C. Const. art. VIII, &sect;&sect; 15 and 16. The court concluded that the amendment to &sect; 58-27-1360 was constitutional. The court explained that the requirement in S.C. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 15 that cities consent to the construction or operation of an electric plant did not apply retrospectively to grant the cities the right of ouster. Further, the cities' right to operate electrical utilities under S.C. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 16 could be regulated.</SPAN></P>

The tax commission denied the requested relief. The manufacturers appealed, and the circuit court affirmed. The manufacturers sought further review. In affirming, the court concluded that the state constitution required that taxes upon property were to be laid upon the actual value of the property, and there was no showing of an intentional failure on the part of the counties to reassess the properties under their jurisdiction. In each county, the properties were being assessed as equally and uniformly as possible; despite any discrepancies, the manufacturers were not entitled to a valuation of their properties at less than their fair market value.</SPAN></P>

Both received the death sentence. In a consolidated appeal pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 16-3-25 (1976), the issues included whether, in the guilt phase, one defendant's prior convictions should have been introduced and whether the trial judge's instruction on the conspiracy charge was incorrect.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the court held that the combination of numerous errors compelled the court to reverse and remand for a new trial. In that context, the court made observations regarding the issues. Even though one defendant had not sought an instruction that the jury could not use evidence of his prior convictions as evidence of his guilt, reviewing the record for error in favorem vitae in the capital case, the court indicated that such an instruction should have been given. Although a conspiracy instruction was a correct statement of the general law, the trial court should also have instructed that the jury had to find that the homicide was a natural or probable consequence of the acts actually agreed on by defendant before the law would hold him responsible for a homicide that occurred during a larceny of a motor vehicle. Given that instructions that constituted either a burden shifting presumption or a conclusive presumption were unconstitutional, a malice charge given was clearly erroneous. In the sentencing phase, the trial judge should have instructed on defendants' individual culpability and that the jury should not consider the possibility of defendants' eligibility for parole.</SPAN></P>

The contractor filed a declaratory judgment action arguing that the statute was unconstitutional as a violation of the Commerce Clause. On appeal, the court noted that the state could not pass any regulation that unduly burdened the free flow of commerce between the states. However, the court also noted that if the state was a market participant it could favor its own state citizens over out of state citizens. The court held that the state was a market participant by purchasing reinforced concrete pipe and, therefore, had not violated the Commerce Clause by choosing its trading partners so as to favor its own residents. The court determined that the classification between residents and non-residents as established by &sect; 11-35-1520(9)(d) did not violate the Equal Protection Clause.

It was funded entirely from the revenue it generated. Section 70 of the Act provided that voters residing in the District may, by referendum, decide between two methods of electing district board members, who could be allowed fiscal autonomy. The referendum voters decided that the board's budget must be approved by county council. The District argued that the subject matter of &sect; 70 of the Act was not related to the raising and expenditure of State monies and was therefore improperly included in the Act, violating S.C.

The subject of an appropriations bill was solely to make appropriations to meet the ordinary expenses of State government and to direct the manner in which the funds were to be expended. The test to be applied to provisions of such Act was whether the challenged legislation reasonably and inherently related to the raising and spending of tax monies.

Code &sect; 41-43-10 et seq. (1983), and the Act, which provided capital and management assistance to in-state rather than out-of-state and foreign enterprises, was not unconstitutional as violating the Commerce Clause.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state passed the Act, which created the Jobs-Economic Development Authority and authorized programs that provided affordable capital and management assistance to eligible South Carolina businesses. A challenge was made to the Act, and the trial court upheld it in its entirety. Appellant argued that the Act was unconstitutional. The court held that the Act did not violate S.C. Const. art. III, &sect; 7 because it did not relate to several subjects in its title. The court also found that the Act served a public purpose by creating jobs and economic development. Further, the court determined that the Act did not pledge the state's acts or credit in violation of S.C. Const. art. X, &sect; 11 because the Act contained a disclaimer, which was sufficient to protect the state from pecuniary obligations. In addition, the court ruled that the Act did not deny equal protection or violate the Commerce Clause because the state had the right to set guidelines for its market participation regardless of effects in either interstate or foreign commerce. The court concluded that the Act did not violate the state constitutional prohibition against delegation of legislative power.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted certiorari to consider (1) whether defendant met his burden of showing that a timely request was made of counsel to perfect a direct appeal; and (2) whether Rule 9 of the Post-Conviction Procedure Rules violated S.C.

The court affirmed the lower court's denial of defendant's request for post-conviction relief, holding that Rule 9 of the Post-Conviction Procedure Rules complied with the discretionary review prescribed in the Uniform Post-Conviction Relief Act, S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 17-27-110, and therefore did not violate S.C. Const. art. V, &sect; 5.Next, because the record contained uncontradicted testimony that defendant timely requested his trial attorney to appeal the case, the court reviewed the trial errors alleged by defendant. However, the court held that a report of a suspicious car parked in the driveway of a vacant house provided reasonable suspicion for a police officer to stop the automobile in which defendant was a passenger.

At issue was whether the attorney's fee provisions of the mechanics' lien statutes,&nbsp;S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 29-5-10 (1983 Cum. Supp.) and &sect; 29-5-20 (1976), denied defendants equal protection of the law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court noted that S. C. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 29-5-10 and -20 allowed the award of attorney's fees to prevailing claimants in mechanics' lien actions but provided for no fee award to prevailing defendants. Appellant argued that the goal of giving priority to claims regarding work performed and materials furnished justified the classification. The court disagreed. Allowing attorney's fees only to successful lien claimants bore no reasonable relationship to that goal. Contrary to appellant's contention, the court held that authorizing fee awards to prevailing defendants, as well as plaintiffs, would not chill the laborer's right to seek relief in court. Appellant also argued that the purpose of the statutes was to ease the burden on the pocketbooks of laborers and materialmen. While such a goal was admirable, it did not justify placing an unfair burden on landowners and other defendants. The court held that the provisions of S.C. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 29-5-10 and -20 dealing with attorney's fees were unconstitutional denials of equal protection to defendants..</SPAN></P>

The lower court affirmed the respondent's denial of a rate increase based upon Act 1293.

The Commission had alleged that its minimum price regulation was being circumvented as a result of refunds, rebates, and/or hauling charges being received by the milk producers or producer associations. The milk producers appealed. The court found that the Commission could not regulate the price of raw milk produced in South Carolina or purchased outside of South Carolina for processing within the state.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A sewer district filed an action seeking a permanent injunction to enjoin the municipality from constructing sewer lines outside its city limits. The municipality counterclaimed seeking an accounting and a holding that an act was unconstitutional. The court affirmed the circuit court's decision granting summary judgment for the sewer district on its action since there were no material issues of fact involved. The court concluded that the sewer district was a designated service area under S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 5-7-60 (Law. Co-op. 1976), and thus the municipality was prohibited from extending its collection lines outside its corporate limits absent permission from the sewer district. The court failed to find a need for an accounting since the municipality failed to cite any wrongdoing or impropriety, and the testimony and exhibits revealed that the sewer district maintained records adequate to insure each user paid only for the services received. The court ruled that the circuit court erred in holding 1973 S.C. Acts 772 constitutional, and the court found that S.C.

He challenged the constitutionality of &sect; 16-11-110(B), claiming that it was an unconstitutional restraint on the right of a property owner to dispose of his property.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State contended that defendant maliciously and wilfully burned the &quot;property of another.&quot; Although defendant set fire to his own property, it was subject to a mortgage lien. Thus, the question was whether defendant intentionally committed a wrongful act toward another without legal justification or excuse. The court held that the mortgagee's interest was sufficient to deem the property &quot;property of another&quot; for purposes of the arson statute,&nbsp;S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 16-11-110(B)(1983). S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 29-3-10 recognized that a mortgagee had an interest in mortgaged property because it gave a mortgagee the right to sell the property in a mortgage foreclosure action. The arson statute in effect protected that interest by deterring the mortgagor from wilfully and maliciously damaging or destroying the property. Because the arson statute,&nbsp;S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 16-11-110(B), required a finding of both willfulness and malice before one could be convicted of arson in the second degree, it did not unconstitutionally restrain one from disposing of his own property.</SPAN></P>

Nevertheless, the hospital asserted that the doctrine of necessaries remained a viable common law doctrine.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant widow sought review of an order of the Chesterfield County Court (South Carolina), which held that she could not claim her dower rights to the lands of her husband because of the equal protection clauses set forth in S.C. Const. art. I, &sect; 3 and U.S. Const. amend. XIV and which awarded the lands to respondent sister, who took in fee simple under the will of the testator.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The widow brought an action to determine whether she was entitled to a dower interest in 67 acres of land. Her husband died testate in August 1976. He willed the subject property to his sister, who contended that she took a fee simple interest in the property under the will. The trial court held that, inasmuch as widowers were not permitted to inherit a dower interest or its equivalent, the widow could not claim because of the equal protection clauses set forth in S.C. Const. art. I, &sect; 3 and the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution. The court held that under a recent decision of the U.S. Supreme Court, the common law right of dower was now unconstitutional. However, the court reversed because the rights of the widow had vested for some three years before the decision of the Supreme Court. In applying it retroactively, titles to property, which vested over the years by reason of the dower law, would have been upset. Therefore, widows whose husbands died after the filing of this opinion were barred from dower claims.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the second event of unemployment, the worker received benefits but sought extended benefits; those extended benefits were denied because he had been disqualified from seven weeks of regular unemployment compensation after the first unemployment event on account of misconduct at employment. The court ruled that the worker was disqualified from receipt of extended benefits after the second unemployment event because under S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 41-35-420(6) only employment after applying for extended benefits would terminate disqualification. Unemployment compensation was a dually funded entitlement dependent on federal law, and &sect; 202(a)(4) of the State Extended Unemployment Compensation Act of 1970, 26 U.S.C.S. &sect; 3304, provided that people could terminate disqualification from extended benefits only by employment after they had applied for extended benefits. The court ruled that the requirement of S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 41-35-420(6) that the worker be employed after he applied for extended benefits to end disqualification was related to the purpose of the statute rationally and that &sect; 41-35-420(6) did not violate either the state or federal constitutions.</SPAN></P>

The trial court held that the ordinance implementing the bond was constitutional. On appeal, the court reversed the judgment of the trial court. The court found that the challenged ordinance was not constitutional because it did not have a valid public purpose. The court determined that the building of the industrial park would likely be of great benefit to businesses, which would not have to incur the costs of building but that any benefit it would have for the public would be negligible. The court noted that the county did not have purchasers or tenants lined up and that the county was only speculating on the likelihood of such purchasers and tenants. The court also pointed out that the industrial park was not clearly defined. The court concluded that there would be total taxpayer liability in such situation. The court reviewed case law and noted that bonds were generally held constitutional where the benefit was directly to the public, not where it was negligible or speculative.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed the order finding the ordinance unconstitutional.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The bingo operator challenged the constitutionality of &sect; 12-21-2590. The trial court held that the limitation on the value of prizes awarded at bingo games was constitutional, but that the residency requirement for bingo operators was unconstitutional. The court affirmed in part and reversed in part. The court found that bingo was a form of gambling under S.C. Code 52-17-50 (1983). The court found no state or federal constitutional right to conduct bingo. Organizations could only conduct bingo games by license; however, the license conferred no property right. The court also noted that the bingo licensing scheme was part of the state's tax law. The court pointed out that the operator bore a substantial burden of establishing that the statute was unconstitutional. The court held that the state's interests overrode the interest of the bingo operator. The court held that the state had a legitimate interest in limiting the monetary value of prizes in order to limit crowd control, and in reducing the likelihood of extensive gambling by its citizens.

The court noted that &sect; 16-13-120 related to the matter of proof and that it was entirely possible to obtain a conviction for shoplifting in violation of &sect; 16-13-110 without regard to &sect; 16-13-120. The court, after a review of the trial court's instruction as a whole, determined that the instruction containing the statutory presumption did not prejudice defendant. Although the presumption in &sect; 16-13-120 was unconstitutional, the trial court did not charge that the presumption was conclusive, and it did not shift the burden of proof onto defendant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The City entered into a license agreement with the bingo vendor to permit the bingo vendor to conduct bingo games in a convention center. After the City refused to honor the agreement, the bingo vendor sought specific performance. The trial court entered judgment in favor of the bingo vendor. In reversing, the court agreed with the City's contention that the license agreement was entered into pursuant to unconstitutional special legislation. The court explained that S.C. Const. art. XVII, &sect; 7, prohibited lotteries in the State of South Carolina. The court noted, however, that the constitution allowed charitable organizations and state and county fairs to conduct bingo games. The court held that the portion of S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 52-17-20(2) (1976 &amp; Supp. 1982), which designated certain portions of Horry County and the Isle of Palms as county fairs, was unconstitutional as special legislation, in violation of S.C.

Accordingly, the court concluded that the license agreement between the bingo vendor and the City, entered into pursuant to &sect; 52-17-20(2), was repugnant to public policy and void.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court, finding that the order of the trial court properly set forth and disposed of all the issues. The trial court concluded that the purchase of the trailers and their subsequent use and storage in South Carolina made the company subject to the use tax imposed by S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 12-35-810. The trial court determined that the evidence showed that not only was there a use, but also that there was a storage of the trailers in South Carolina sufficient to make the company liable for the use tax. Also, because the company was the ultimate user and consumer of the trailers, the sale of the trailers to the company was not at wholesale and, therefore, was at retail. Finally, the trial court determined that the company was not exempt from the tax because the facts showed that the tax was a tax on use and storage in South Carolina and not a tax on interstate commerce.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court held that as a general rule, a statute may be partly constitutional and partly unconstitutional, and that where a portion remained complete in itself, capable of being fully executed, wholly independent of that which was unconstitutional, the courts should enforce the constitutional portion.

Code Ann. &sect; 12-21-2050 (Law. Co-Op. 1976) and a portion of S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 12-21-2120, were unconstitutional as violative of the Commerce Clause, U.S. Const. art.

The Commission denied refunds and future exemptions that were applicable for those bottlers marketing their goods in the normally accepted store-door delivery method. The bottlers contended that, in order to use the exempt method, they were no longer conducting business solely in interstate commerce. The trial court found the two provisions unconstitutional, and the court agreed because they constituted a clear violation of the Commerce Clause. The alternate tax reporting method of S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 12-21-2120 was only available to those bottlers with plants within the State, and, thus, that provision also violated the Commerce Clause. The court found that the bottlers had an absolute constitutional right to conduct business entirely in interstate commerce and that they could not be subjected to discriminatory taxation because of that choice. The trial court properly found that the bottlers were entitled to refunds of taxes paid under protest. Because S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 21-21-2050 was unconstitutional, the bottlers were entitled to the exemption and discount provided by S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 21-21-2030.</SPAN></P>

After a guilty verdict, jurors were drawn to try a second case in which the attorney was also a defense counsel. The jurors were excused for the day. On the courthouse premises, the attorney engaged in conversations with two jurors that served on the first case and with a third juror that served on both cases. The court found that the attorney's own admissions constituted a clear violation of S.C. Code Prof. Resp. DR 7-108(B)(1), which prohibited an attorney from communicating with a member of a jury during the trial of a case. In another incident, the attorney represented a client in a post-conviction relief trial. The correction officials had a policy governing press interviews with inmates on death row, requiring the approval of the prosecutor. The prosecutor refused to permit an interview of the client with the press. The attorney took his friend, a reporter, to the prison for an interview. The attorney misrepresented the purpose of his visit and that of the reporter; thus, the attorney violated S.C. Code Prof. Resp. DR 1-102(A)(4).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The cooperative sought a declaratory judgment to determine the constitutionality of &sect; 58-27-1360. The City owned and operated a combined utility system. The cooperative served only one customer in an area annexed by the City, but served many customers to the north and south of the annexed area. Upon receipt of the resolution of the City and its utility system, which stated that they would provide electricity to the annexed area, the cooperative sought to compel the City to purchase its facilities and property in the annexed area, pursuant to &sect; 58-27-1360. The parties were unable to negotiate the sale, and the cooperative brought its action. The trial court found that the provisions of &sect; 58-27-1360 were mandatory, and the court affirmed. The court rejected the City's argument that it was forced to purchase more of the cooperative's equipment than needed. The court found that the statute protected the economic rights and futures of cooperatives. The court held that the statutory formula used to compute the cooperative's just compensation was constitutional as long as it was construed as a minimum and not a limitation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant former husband sought review of a judgment of the Richland County Circuit Court (South Carolina), which granted a divorce between him and respondent former wife and made an equitable distribution of property.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The husband and wife were married and divorced twice. After the trial court granted the parties' second divorce, the husband sought review. The court held that because the husband and wife jointly owned the marital residence as tenants in common, the trial court could properly consider it in the equitable distribution. Furthermore, the court found that it was not an abuse of discretion to award the wife title to all of the stocks, bonds, and funds jointly held by the parties as tenants in common where the wife applied $ 60,000 of her inheritance towards the purchase of the stocks. However, the court concluded that the trial court erred in treating the husband's military retirement fund as marital property, subject to equitable distribution. The court found that the military funds could be considered in determining any alimony obligations, however. As such, the court reversed that portion of the judgment dealing with the husband's military funds and remanded for a determination on alimony in light of the funds. Finally, the court reversed that part of the order requiring the husband to name the wife as a beneficiary of his military Survivor Benefit Plan.</SPAN></P>

The State appealed the magistrate's ruling on the ground that &sect; 56-1-370 violated the separation of powers doctrine set forth in S.C. Const. art. I, &sect; 8. The court held that: (1) magistrates were part of a unified judicial system and could exercise only the duties and powers of the judicial branch; (2) the overall statutory scheme indicated that the issuance, suspension, and control of driver's licenses were administrative functions that rested with the Department; (3) the Department was a component of the executive branch; (4) the portion of &sect; 56-1-370 that allowed magistrates to conduct implied consent hearings violated the doctrine of separation of powers; and (5) the unconstitutional portion of &sect; 56-1-370 was severable from the remainder of the statute.</SPAN></P>

During the death penalty phase, evidence of defendant's attempt to commit a similar crime was properly admitted to establish aggravating circumstances. The court found that evidence of defendant's future conformity to prison life was properly excluded as irrelevant because it did not pertain to the existence or nonexistence of mitigating or aggravating circumstances arising out of the murder. The court affirmed defendant's conviction, and it reversed the death penalty and remanded for resentencing.

The manufacturers filed motions for judgment on the pleadings under the South Carolina &quot;Door Closing Statute,&quot; S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 15-5-150 (1976).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff was a resident of New York and had never been exposed in South Carolina to asbestos containing products. His only exposure occurred in New York. The trial court held that &sect; 15-5-150 barred his claims. Plaintiff challenged the constitutionality of &sect; 15-5-150 on the grounds of unlawful discrimination and denial of equal protection. The court affirmed and held that &sect; 15-5-150 was constitutional. The &quot;Door Closing Statute&quot; accomplished several legislative objectives rationally related to the state's interest. It favored resident plaintiffs over nonresident plaintiffs. The statute provided a forum for wrongs connected with the State while avoiding the resolution of wrongs in which the State had little interest. It encouraged activity and investment within the State by foreign corporations without subjecting it to actions unrelated to its activity within the State. The distinction between corporations authorized to do business in South Carolina and those who did not was valid. As applied, the &quot;Door Closing Statute&quot; would therefore bar plaintiff's claims. Additionally, plaintiff had no standing to assert the equal protection argument against foreign non-corporate defendants.</SPAN></P>

The court also held that the trial court did not err in failing to instruct the jury that a police officer's testimony concerning a witness's statement prior to trial that was inconsistent with that witness's statement made at trial was to be considered solely for impeachment purposes. Instead, the court held that the testimony of the prior inconsistent statement was properly admissible as substantive evidence when the declarant testified at trial and was subject to cross-examination.

The court was required to determine how a prior opinion, which prohibited an appointed body from levying taxes, affected &sect; 4-9-70 when an exception contained in that statute applied to an appointed authority. The taxpayer urged a literal reading of the statute; petitioners alleged that the statute was properly construed according to legislative intent. The court ruled that the prior opinion rendered the exemption of &sect; 4-9-70 invalid as it applied to appointed bodies. However, the legislative intent was preserved by allowing the county council to prescribe the method of establishing the school tax millage.

After their appeals languished before the higher court, appellants moved for a speedy remedy. In denying the motions, the court recognized that the right to a speedy remedy under S.C. Const. art. I, &sect; 9, included the right to a speedy appeal. However, the length of the appellate process was attributable to a large backlog of case that had accrued before the court, a backlog that the court could not easily remedy. The court utilized its time and manpower to its fullest extent, but its abilities were hindered by the fact that the court of appeals was not operational with only one judge. The filling of the appellate court vacancies was a matter for resolution by the legislature and was not within the reach of the court.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 17-23-160 (Supp. 1981), pertaining to preliminary hearings, was to deprive the trial court of jurisdiction to try him. Even though he did not request a preliminary hearing, his right to a preliminary hearing was not waived because he never received notice. Although the court agreed with defendant that the purported effect of &sect; 17-23-160 was to require notice of the right to a preliminary hearing before it could be knowingly waived, the court ruled that the jurisdictional language of S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 22-5-320 offended the state constitution and therefore the trial court had jurisdiction to try the matter. Accordingly, the court affirmed defendant's conviction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of armed robbery and the murder of a convenience store clerk. After the jury was impaneled, defendant pleaded guilty to murder and armed robbery conditioned on his being sentenced by the jury. The State protested that under S.C. Code &sect; 16-3-20(B) (1976, Cum. Supp. 1981) defendant had no statutory right to the jury's imposition of sentence because defendant had pleaded guilty. The circuit court held that defendant had a statutory right to a jury determination of sentence and the court reversed and remanded. The court found &sect; 16-3-20(B) clearly stated that upon a conviction or adjudication of guilt for murder a separate sentencing proceeding would be conducted to determine whether to impose a sentence of death or life imprisonment. The statute also stated that if a jury trial had been waived or a guilty plea entered the sentencing proceeding would be conducted by the circuit court. Because defendant entered his guilty plea, the court held that the circuit court erred when it permitted the jury to determine sentence. The court also held that a new trial was necessary because of inducement of jury determination of sentence on elicitation of defendant's plea.</SPAN></P>

Code &sect; 15-53-10 et seq. (Laws. Co-op 1976), as amended, to test the constitutionality of a state appropriations bill. The bill provided for the creation of a Joint Appropriation Review Committee (JARC), which was composed of defendants, members of the Senate and members of the House of Representatives.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The South Carolina General Assembly adopted an appropriations bill that attempted to confer upon a quasi-legislative committee the power to control expenditures. The Attorney General contended that that the General Assembly improperly attempted to confer upon the JARC authority which was, under the constitution, allocated to the executive department. The court held that the Attorney General had the right to bring the action against the twelve defendants in their capacity as committee, board, or commission members, and held that relief by way of a declaratory judgment was proper. The court determined that portions of the state appropriations bill were unconstitutional because they violated S.C. Const. art. I, &sect; 8 by infringing on the government's separation-of-powers. The court held that because the JARC was not a legislative body, it had not power or authority to appropriate money as necessary for the operation of the agencies of government.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that portions of the appropriations bill were unconstitutional. The court order the unconstitutional portions severed from the bill.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parties entered into a contract under the terms of which the agency received and accepted proposals for insurance to be written by the insurance company. The agency sought to enjoin the termination of the contract and to recover damages from the insurance company for the termination of the contract, claiming that the cancellation of the contract was in violation of the South Carolina Automobile Reparation Reformation Act of 1974, S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 38-37-10, et seq. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded. The court found that the contract between the parties was an important property right; the parties had the right to enter or not to enter into the agreement and to spell out the provisions. The court then found that the challenged section of the Act, S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 38-37-940(2), severely impaired the contractual right. The court reasoned that &sect; 38-37-940(2) was not necessary to the accomplishment of the overall purpose of The Act. The court therefore overruled its prior opinion that found &sect; 38-37-940(2) constitutional, and reversed the granted summary judgment.</SPAN></P>
