</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff husband filed a marital dissolution action against defendant wife that sought custody and financial relief. The husband asserted jurisdiction under the Connecticut long-arm statute,&nbsp;Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 46b-46(b). The wife, a resident of New York, filed a motion to dismiss and alleged that the court did not have jurisdiction under the Due Process Clause of U.S. Const. amend. XIV.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The husband became a resident of Connecticut more that one year prior to the commencement of the dissolution action. Prior to moving to Connecticut, the husband lived with the wife and the parties' two minor children in New York. Neither the wife nor the children ever resided in Connecticut. The husband filed the marital dissolution action in Connecticut and sought custody of the parties' minor children and financial relief. The husband asserted jurisdiction pursuant to the Connecticut long-arm statute,&nbsp;Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 46b-46(b). The wife lived in New York and filed a motion to dismiss and alleged a violation of the Due Process Clause of U.S. Const. amend. XIV. The court granted the wife's motion to dismiss and held that the wife did not have minimal contacts with Connecticut, and that the maintenance of the suit and its request for financial relief offended traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice. The court also held that the marital res was with both the husband and the wife, and that the husband was free to file an amendment to the complaint that only sought a dissolution of the marriage.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff organization brought an action seeking a temporary injunction to restrain defendant, the Commissioner of the Department of Environmental Protection (department), from causing, permitting, participating in, or sanctioning actions, which were likely to result in the killing of fawn deer. The department filed a motion to dismiss the action for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The department claimed that the organization had no standing to bring the action because no hunts were taking place and none were scheduled or planned to take place at any specific time in the future. The court determined that the hunts that the organization sought to enjoin were not only capable of repetition, but the department's regulations established future hunts as a policy. The court explained that the organization had standing under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 22a-16, which provided that any person could have brought an action against the state for declarative and injunctive relief to protect the public trust in the natural resources of the state. The court noted that the organization could have sought declaratory relief, which was an exception to the general rule of sovereign immunity, because such relief did not seek to control the activities of the state. The court concluded that even under the most strict construction of &sect; 22-16a, the organization had standing to bring the action because the conduct of the department was in combination with others and was reasonably likely to unreasonably destroy the public trust in the natural resource of deer.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff wife sought a marital dissolution from defendant husband, asserting she was entitled to an equal division of assets after a long-term marriage in which she was initially a low-paid wage earner, then a stay-at-home mother after the birth of their children, and later a corporate wife assisting in her husband's executive duties. Defendant asserted plaintiff was entitled to only what would maintain her standard of living.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found plaintiff wife's nonmonetary contributions as a corporate housewife and mother entitled her to approximately half of the marital estate plus alimony. The court rejected any valuation of nonmonetary contributions and also rejected defendant husband's claim that Conn. Gen.

The court reached a property distribution and alimony award sufficient to maintain plaintiff's pre-separation standard of living as well as equitably distribute the assets among the parties. The court found that &sect;&sect; 46b-81(c) and 46b-82 were constitutional and that the marriage was not a partnership. Further the court held that tax vesting rules were not applicable to defendant's unvested stock options and bonuses and determined certain stocks and retirement benefits were part of the marital estate. To divide the unvested portions of the estate, the court applied coverture factors using the date of separation for valuation purposes. The court refused to close the proceedings, following the guidelines of Conn. Gen. Prac. Book &sect;&sect; 211B and 895. and retained jurisdiction over valuation of assets.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff business owners sought review of a judgment by defendant Westbrook Zoning Board of Appeals (Connecticut), which affirmed a decision by a zoning enforcement officer ordering the owners to cease and desist their retail lobster business.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the Board affirmed the decision of the zoning officer issuing a cease and desist order, the owners appealed. The owners claimed that their property was in use for the purpose of lobster retailing prior to the enactment of the zoning provisions in question, giving it status as permissible nonconforming use. The owners also asserted that Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 8-7 requiring four votes of the Board members to reverse the officer's order deprived them of their property rights without due process of law. The court denied the owners' appeal. The court held that based on the conflicting evidence, the Board was free to conclude that the owners failed to prove the existence of a valid nonconforming use prior to the enactment of the zoning provisions. The court found that in failing to prove the existence of such a use, the owners also failed to prove that they had a constitutionally protected property right. The court stated that because the owners had no such right, they could not prevail on their due process claim. The court noted that even if the owners had such a right, they failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the statute deprived them of that right without due process.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">DCF filed a petition to terminate the parental rights of a minor female child. The child's likely paternal grandfather was granted intervenor status and sought a transfer of guardianship of the child to him. The child's acknowledged father resisted termination of his parental rights and supported his father's bid for guardianship of the child. The court terminated the parental rights and appointed the Commissioner of the DCF as the statutory parent for the child. The court found, by clear and convincing evidence, that the parents failed to achieve such degree of personal rehabilitation as would encourage the belief that within a reasonable time considering the age and needs of the child, the parents could assume a responsible position in the life of the child. The court noted that the parents had no ongoing parent child relationship and the child was doing well in foster care.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee was injured while working for the employer, which paid workmen's compensation benefits. The employee brought a negligence action against the tortfeasor, and pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 31-293 gave notice to the employer, which filed an intervening complaint, but failed to do so within 30-days, as provided for by the statute. The trial, appellate, and supreme courts sustained the employee's objection to the intervening complaint because the employer had lost its right to intervene by not complying with the statutory requirement. While the underlying action continued to pend, the Connecticut Supreme Court decided that &sect; 31-293 was constitutionally defective in that it did not provide for notice to an employer of the commencement of an action and that rights would be permanently lost if an employer did not intervene within the 30-day statutory period. The employer renewed its motion to intervene. The court granted the motion, concluding that the Supreme Court's decision was to be applied retroactively to implement the public policy of preventing double recovery by an injured employee where no hardship would be brought upon the tortfeasor or the employee.</SPAN></P>

The electrician filed a motion for summary judgment, and argued that the claim was barred by the statute of repose, Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 52-584. The homeowners argued that , because of the additional work in 1993, the tort was a continuing one, or, in the alternative, that &sect; 52-584 was unconstitutional. The court granted the motion for summary judgment. The court held that because there was no special relationship and no continuing duty to warn of a dangerous condition, there was no continuing tort. The court held that reasonable conditions on a cause of action, such as statutes of repose, were not unconstitutional on their face.

The Commission filed a motion to dismiss the corporation's action as moot in light of 1996 Conn. Acts 241. The court denied the corporation's motion for judgment after applying 1996 Conn. Acts 241, because the Connecticut Supreme Court's decision arose from a reservation request brought under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 52-235. The court found that the time limitations in which the corporation claimed a vested right were part of a statutory scheme to provide a procedure for processing discrimination complaints to resolution through arbitration and administrative adjudication. The court concluded that in enacting 1996 Conn. Acts 241, the legislature excused the Commission's failure to comply with procedural requirements that did not directly affect the substantive rights of the corporation. The court stated that because the case had not reached final judgment and because it found no vested right in the statutory time limitations, there was no unjust abrogation of a vested right held by the corporation.</SPAN></P>

The court agreed and granted summary judgment in favor of the general contractor and the subcontractor on the product liability claim. The court said that a contractor was not a product seller because a construction contract was basically one for the rendition of services, and the materials used were only incidental to the main purpose of the contract.Next, the general contractor and the subcontractor contended that the homeowner's claims for negligence and breach of implied warranty were time barred by Conn.

The alleged polluter plead as a special defense that the statute was unconstitutional as applied to him. The alleged polluter also plead other special defenses, but failed to brief objections to the Commissioner's motion to strike them. The court granted the Commissioner's motion to strike in part and denied it in part. The court held that the purpose of the motion to strike was to test the legal sufficiency of the allegations in the special defenses to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. The court found that facts provable under the allegations would have supported the alleged polluter's constitutional special defense and that he was entitled to have the trier of fact determine whether application of the facts supported a finding that the statute was unconstitutional as applied to him.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff owner challenged a judgment of defendant Zoning Board of Appeals of the Town of North Stonington (Connecticut) that denied the owner's request for a variance from North Stonington, Ct., Zoning Regulations &sect; 407 and held that it had no jurisdiction to consider the owner's appeal from the failure of a zoning enforcement officer (ZEO) to act on the owner's application for certification to use his property as a year round residence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner's property was located in a seasonal use overlay area that restricted use to seasonal occupation. ZEOs in the past had granted certifications of year round use to owners within such areas, but before the owner filed his application, the town's planning and zoning commission instructed the ZEO not to issue any more such certifications because it was considering establishing a policy and regulatory amendments on the subject. The ZEO therefore returned the owner's application without taking action on it. The court affirmed the board's decision. The ZEO never had any authority to issue certifications for year round use of property in seasonal areas, and his failure to act was not an order, requirement, or decision over which the board had jurisdiction. Although Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 8-6a required appeals to be decided before variance applications when both were filed together, the board acted properly by denying the variance request without acting on the appeal. With no jurisdiction, the board could not take further action on the appeal and was able to proceed to consideration of the variance. The board did not abuse its discretion in denying the variance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the board's judgment that had denied the owner's request for a variance and had held that it lacked jurisdiction to consider the owner's appeal from the ZEO's failure to act on the owner's application for certification to use his property as a year round residence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Several years after defendant husband left plaintiff wife and his son and moved to another state, he won 18 million dollars in the lottery. Plaintiff filed an action for dissolution of marriage and sought child support, alimony and an equitable distribution of the marital estate. Defendant filed a motion to dismiss arguing that the court lacked in personam jurisdiction over him. The court held that the exercise of jurisdiction was appropriate because defendant purposefully availed himself of the benefits of the state by obtaining a marriage license, enrolling his child in public school, and most significantly, relying on the state to support his wife and his child after he left the forum. The court found that plaintiff's delay in filing for divorce did not constitute laches because she had been unaware of defendant's whereabouts for a long time and was not financially able to pursue defendant. The court found that there was no comparison between plaintiff and defendant's standards of living, noting that plaintiff lived in poverty, while defendant was affluent. The court ruled that plaintiff was entitled to alimony of $ 6,000 a month for a period of ten years.</SPAN></P>

The court ruled that the Board reasonably concluded that the parcel had always been and still was one parcel of land and not two separate and distinct lots. The court held that the owner cited no authority for drawing the conclusion that a town line automatically severed property into two separate distinct lots.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The student was arrested, off school grounds, after a police officer discovered two ounces of marijuana in his car. The board held a hearing at which the student appeared and was represented by counsel. The board voted to expel the student for the rest of the marking period and to exclude him from extracurricular activities. The court granted the student's request for a temporary injunction to prohibit the implementation of his expulsion.  Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 10-233d provided that a board had the power to expel any pupil whose conduct off school grounds was violative of a publicized board policy and was seriously disruptive of the educational process. The court declared that &sect; 10-233d was unconstitutional and therefore null and void. Even though a presumption as to the constitutionality of legislation existed, an ordinary person must know what conduct was permitted and prohibited under a statute.&nbsp;Section 10-233d failed to provide any standards for when expulsion was appropriate. The evidence was so lacking that the board denied its rights pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 10-233d by preventing a meaningful right to cross examine to the student during the hearing.</SPAN></P>

The statewide grievance denied the motion to dismiss. The attorney filed the instant action which sought to enjoin the statewide grievance committee from conducting any further hearings on the client's complaint. The reviewing court applied the doctrine of exhaustion. Other remedies available to the attorney were judicial review of a decision to reprimand the attorney pursuant to Conn. Gen. Prac. Book &sect; 27N, a de novo court trial, and appellate review of a decision by the statewide grievance committee to present the attorney to the superior court. The attorney had to resort to the foregoing remedies unless his case fell within very limited exceptions to the exhaustion doctrine. The attorney's claim of an exception to the doctrine, that an administrative remedy would be futile, was rejected.

The court found that while plaintiff was removed from his discretionary, at-will position of chief deputy, he remained a deputy of the sheriff's department. Therefore, because plaintiff was not removed as a deputy, he did not and could not allege a violation of &sect; 6-45. The court thus held that plaintiff failed to allege an exception to the rule of sovereign immunity.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owners owned a lot that was part of an original subdivision that contained six lots. The property owners submitted an application to the planning and zoning commission for a resubdivision of their existing lot to a two-lot subdivision. The property owners requested a waiver of the town's subdivision regulation that provided that no shared driveway with a grade in excess of 12 percent would be permitted. The driveway that was proposed to serve the two requested lots already existed, and served both the subject parcel and a parcel abutting the lower portion thereof. The planning and zoning commission approved the requested driveway grade waiver, but denied the subject resubdivision application. On appeal, the court found that the planning and zoning commission's denial of the application could be sustained on several regulatory grounds, including the ground that the lot shapes and boundaries did not comply with a town subdivision regulation that required the avoidance of irregular lot shapes and uneven boundaries. Accordingly, the decision of the planning and zoning commission was sustained that the appeal was dismissed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant state moved for dismissal of a count in a complaint by plaintiffs, a mother and her two minor children, alleging that the state negligently administered a rental assistance program causing the children to be exposed to lead paint.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state moved to dismiss the claims based on sovereign immunity. Because sovereign immunity could be raised at any time, the court held that the motion was not procedurally defective even though it was not filed within 30 days after the state's appearance and after a default had entered against it. Plaintiffs argued that Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 17b-812(b) contained an implied waiver of sovereign immunity because it imposed an affirmative duty on the state to provide safe and healthy premises. The court held that plaintiffs failed to demonstrate that any exception to sovereign immunity applied. The statute did not waive sovereign immunity by implication where nothing in it indicated an intention to hold the state monetarily liable for the alleged negligent administration of the program. Further, plaintiffs failed to show that the state's actions were either unconstitutional or unauthorized. Rather, the complaint simply alleged that the state's agent was negligent in performing his authorized duties by allowing plaintiffs to occupy the premises before he inspected them. This alleged negligence did not compromise any constitutional right and did not exceed the agent's authority.</SPAN></P>

A defense motion for summary judgment was filed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner sought damages under &sect; 1983 based on the action of three government officials. While one was a town employee, the others were area health district employees. The town's summary judgment motion was denied. As to the argument that the owner's claims were time-barred, the court found that the three-year limitations period did not begin to run until the alleged &quot;taking&quot; was deemed complete because no further state law reviews were available. The court concluded that any taking was complete when the State Health Department rejected the owner's appeal and that the &sect; 1983 claim was timely. The court also found no merit in a claim that the town had no liability because two of the three officials were not its employees, ruling that to the extent that those officials were exercising the town's policy-making authority, the town could have Monell liability therefor and that issues of fact precluding summary judgment were implicated. The court also refused to dismiss the owner's state constitutional claim because there was a question of fact whether a &quot;taking&quot; occurred for state law purposes. The court also rejected a claim of immunity under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 52-557(b)(7), (8).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant filed a motion with the court (Connecticut) to dismiss Counts One, Two, and Five of an amended information that charged defendant in those counts with risk of injury to a minor under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53-21(1), conspiracy to commit risk of injury to a minor under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 53-48(a), 53-21(1), and abandonment of a child under the age of six under Conn. Gen.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was the father of a child that he deliberately placed into the care of a stranger with the intention to sell the child. The woman who took the child turned herself in and provided a statement that served as the basis of the State's information. Defendant asserted that Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53-21(1) was unconstitutionally vague. The court denied the motion to dismiss. The court stated that &sect; 53-21(1) was not unconstitutionally vague because a person of common sense and ordinarily intelligence would reasonably have known that a parent who gave a six-week old baby to a stranger, for ultimate sale and delivery to an unknown person, placed the baby in a life endangering situation and in a situation where health was likely to be injured. The court noted that defendant likely knew his actions were criminal because he gave a false statement to the police. The court determined that the subsequent passing of an act that explicitly prohibited the selling of children only stood to clarify what was already implicit in &sect; 53-21. The court concluded that the strength of the witness' statement was such to avoid dismissal of Counts One, Two, and Five.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners, the biological parents of the child, challenged the decision of the Adoption Review Board (Connecticut), which denied the application of the probate court for a waiver of the &quot;placement requirement&quot; pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 45a-764(b) on the ground that the Board lacked jurisdiction or authority to grant a waiver because the child was not free for adoption in that the natural mother's rights had not been terminated.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The biological parents sought to adopt their baby. The probate court denied the adoption on the basis of a statutory interpretation. The parents appealed, and the superior court remanded the case with directions for the probate court to apply to the Board for a waiver of the statutory criteria of &quot;statutory parent.&quot; Application was made, and the Board denied the application on jurisdictional grounds. The court held that the Adoption Review Board incorrectly determined that it lacked the authority or jurisdiction to grant a waiver of the &quot;placement requirement&quot; pursuant to a statutory parent adoption upon the facts of the case. The court found that (1) the parents had exhausted their administrative remedies, were aggrieved, and had standing to bring the appeal; (2) the purpose of the Board was to review those cases where adoption was otherwise meritorious but where the child had not been place by the state or an agency and a waiver of that requirement was necessary; and (3) while the Board had the authority to determine its own jurisdiction, its consideration of factors other than those comprehended by the enabling legislation exceeded that authority.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant planning and zoning commission applied for a change of zoning from agricultural to industrial for certain parcels of land which included plaintiff property owner's land.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A public hearing was properly noticed and held. The commission voted on April 2nd to approve the zone change, effective April 11th. Legal notice of the zone change was published on April 11th. Thus, the notice was published not before but upon the effective date fixed by the zoning commission. The property owner argued the decision was null and void since publication was ineffective. The commission maintained Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 8-3(d) should be construed to allow the zone change to be effective the first day subsequent to publication. The occult noted that the only restriction on the effective date was that it not be set prior to the publication of the decision, which is what occurred, and thus the effective date was invalid. Concerning the issue of ex parte communication, a juxtaposition of the transcript and letter revealed that no additional evidence was presented by the letter. The &quot;taking&quot; issue was also resolved in the commission's favor as there was no evidence which would at all indicate the property owner had no reasonable alternate uses of his property.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The presentment alleged that respondents' representation of client purchasers and banks in real estate closings, without their consent after consultation, was materially limited by their own interests and interests of their business partner in violation of Conn.

The court agreed in part with petitioner's argument that the reviewing committee was sufficiently constituted, but it was not clear if the reviewing committee was composed of three members or four members. The court required more testimony on this issue.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowner's property was zoned for seasonal use. The city issued a cease and desist order to the landowner to discontinue use of the property as a year-round residence. The landowner applied for a variance, which was denied twice. The city filed an action to enforce its zoning regulations and enjoin the landowner from using the seasonal property as a year-round residence. The landowner filed a special defense in which he claimed the zoning regulations violations the federal and state constitutions because they deprived him of his property without due process, they took his property for public use without just compensation, and denied equal protection. The court held that the mere assertion of a special defense did not preclude it from granting summary judgment. In denying summary judgment, however, the court held that the nature of the landowner's special defense, that the regulations were unconstitutional, precluded summary judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, a licensed real estate broker, brought an action against defendants, a seller and a buyer of real estate. The broker alleged counts sounding in misrepresentation, third-party beneficiary contract, and unjust enrichment, but did not allege that he had a written broker agreement as required by Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 20-325a(b). The seller and the buyer filed motions to strike.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Both the seller and the buyer argued that the broker's complaint failed to state a claim upon which relief could have been granted because of the bar against recovering a fee for broker services absent a written brokerage agreement under &sect; 20-325a. The court granted both motions to strike. It was well established that a broker deprived of compensation for his services in the absence of a contract complying with the detailed requirements of &sect; 20-325a, let alone in the complete absence of any written agreement, was precluded from suing for compensation. This rule also applied to alternative causes of action designed to recover the fee in spite of &sect; 20-325a, such as unjust enrichment, misrepresentation, and third-party beneficiary claims. The broker's counts all fell in the latter category. It did not avail the broker to question the applicability of the rule to the buyer as well as the seller because the statute was not limited by its terms to a suit against the seller.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the driver's car was operating as contemplated by Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 14-227b as it was running, in &quot;drive&quot; position, and braked.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff state sought injunctive relief and assessment of penalties against defendant ticket broker for broker's alleged violations of Conn.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Ticket broker's advertisements directed buyers who wanted to buy tickets to events occurring in Connecticut to call his Massachusetts office. The Connecticut office only sold tickets for events occurring outside Connecticut. The Massachusetts office sold tickets to Connecticut events for prices exceeding the maximum allowed by Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53-289. The state brought this action to enjoin broker from violating the statute and to have penalties assessed under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 42-110o. The court granted the injunction but declined to assess penalties. The court held that the statute was not unconstitutional because the maximum service charge was not arbitrary. It did not matter that broker was selling tickets from Massachusetts. The offer to sell the tickets occurred in Connecticut. There was no business reason for the Massachusetts office besides evading &sect; 53-289. The state was not estopped from bringing this action due to an earlier agreement. That agreement did not cover Massachusetts activities. The court had subject matter jurisdiction. The sales activities took place wholly or in part in Connecticut. The court ordered restitution for some individual transactions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowner filed an application for a change in zoning status from commercial to residential for the purpose of constructing a condominium. The application was denied. On appeal to the court, the court reversed, finding that the denial was arbitrary and based on personal malice. On reconsideration, the commission again denied the application. The landowner then filed a civil complaint. Summary judgment was granted, dismissing the claim of violation of due process under the United States Constitution, and the same claim under the Connecticut Constitution was stricken. After trial, defendants filed a motion to dismiss the remaining counts. The court granted the motion. The court held that there was no unconstitutional taking because the denial of the zoning change did not deprive the landowner from all use of the land. The court further held that the landowner could not establish a claim of violation of equal protection by the city or the commission because the landowner could not show an official policy or custom. The court further determined that there was no individual liability because there was no evidence of any differently treated similarly situated applicants.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff landowners appealed a decision of defendant Zoning Board of Appeals of Fairfield (Connecticut), which denied their application seeking to invalidate a no-rental condition imposed by the Board when it granted the landowners a variance to enlarge their house.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowners obtained a variance to enlarge their home on the ground that the home would be limited to family use and not be used for rental purposes. After the landowners rented the home, a zoning enforcement officer issued an order to comply. The landowners applied to the Board to invalidate the no-rental condition in the variance and reverse the order to comply, which was denied. The court held that it did not have jurisdiction because the landowners' request to reverse the order to comply was an invalid and untimely attempt to collaterally attack the no-rental condition to the variance. The court found that the landowners, having secured the variance subject to the no-rental condition and not having challenged the condition by appeal at that time, were precluded from doing so in proceedings challenging the order to comply. Because the variance ran with the land, 1993 Conn. Acts 385, which applied only to invalid personal conditions, could not be used to bypass the statutory requirement that any party aggrieved by any zoning board decision bring an appeal within 15 days from the date when notice of the decision was published under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 8-8(a) (1985).</SPAN></P>

The trial court and sheriff's office were uncertain concerning the manner in which the virus could be transmitted and how to accommodate the inmate's right to be present during trial. After the trial court decided to conduct a hearing on whether the inmate's presence in court would pose a risk of infection to others, newspapers reported the story. At a hearing outside the inmate's presence, the trial court ordered the trial to proceed with the inmate present. After some jurors were excused based on their discomfort with the inmate's disease, the jury found the inmate guilty on a charge of murder. The conviction was affirmed on appeal. The inmate filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus. The court dismissed the petition, holding that (1) the inmate was barred from asserting due process claims that were not raised at trial or on appeal because he did not show the requisite cause, prejudice, or manifest injustice to avoid procedural default; (2) given the evidence against him, the inmate did not show that, absent his counsel's errors, the result of his trial would have been different.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owners' property contained a modest single-family house on land that was directly under an airline flight path about 450 feet away from the city's airport. Upon review, the court held that the evidence did not support a finding that the value of the property was significantly altered by the jet aircraft flights. Although the value of the property was undoubtedly lessened by virtue of its proximity to the airport, the owners purchased the property with full knowledge of the airport's proximity. Under these circumstances, the court refused to find that a permanent taking had occurred. The owners were not entitled to recovery under the Federal Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act of 1970 (URA), 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 4601 et seq., because they were not displaced persons within the meaning of the URA. Because nothing comparable to either a constitutional taking or a situation requiring permanent injunctive relief was shown, the owners could not recover under the municipal airports statute,&nbsp;Conn.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate filed a three-count habeas petition. In count one, the inmate alleged that his trial counsel failed to present certain testimony regarding his request for a new supplemental jury panel and failed to either request an evidentiary hearing on his claims of unconstitutional jury selection methods or request a continuance for the purpose of gathering probative evidence. In count two, the inmate claimed his trial counsel failed to lay a proper foundation for evidence that could have been used to impeach a witness. In count three, the inmate alleged that his appellate counsel was deficient for failing to argue that the trial court should have held a sua sponte hearing concerning the composition of the jury array. The court dismissed the inmate's petition. The inmate failed to prove the jury selection process resulted in a violation of his constitutional rights to a jury comprised of a fair cross section of the community. The inmate failed to present any evidence in support of his allegations in count two. Finally, the court was unpersuaded that appellate counsel would have been successful if he had raised the claim regarding the hearing as to the composition of the jury array.</SPAN></P>

The governor in its answer did not admit knowledge of any willingness on the part of the tribe to enter into a trust agreement. The governor's major special defense was that the Indian Affairs Task Force failed to issue a final report containing trust agreement recommendations, a condition precedent to the governor entering into a trust agreement according to the terms of &sect; 47-66h. The tribe denied the special defenses. The court denied the request for the writ of mandamus. The court held that the term final report as employed in &sect; 47-66h referred only to the last chronological report of the task force, a 1991 report. The court further found that the final, 1991 report of the task force did not contain any recommendations as to trust agreements as required under &sect; 47-66h.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The driver had been convicted of driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI) in the state of Florida. Under the Driver License Compact, Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 14-11s, the driver was subject to a one-year suspension of her operator's license. The commissioner of motor vehicles (commissioner) held a hearing on its notice sent to the driver proposing to suspend her Connecticut license based on the Florida conviction. The hearing officer found that the driver had been convicted of a DUI in Florida and noted that the penalty for such a conviction in Connecticut was suspension of the person's license for one year. The driver appealed. The court noted that the driver's nolo contendere plea was still a DUI conviction and that because the driver's blood alcohol level was .194 to .193 percent, well above Connecticut's limit of .10 percent limit and Florida's .08 percent limit, the blood alcohol level was not significant in this case since it was above the limit of both states. The court found no merit in the driver's other assertion of error and dismissed her appeal.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff drunk driver complained of the decision of defendant Commissioner of Motor Vehicles (Connecticut), which suspended the driver's motor vehicle operator's license. The Commissioner acted pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 14-227b on the basis that the driver refused to submit to a chemical test of the alcohol content of his blood after being arrested on a charge of driving while under the influence of alcohol.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The driver was arrested on a charge of drunk driving and refused to submit to a chemical test of the alcohol content of his blood. The driver first contended that the A-44 report form and supplement should not have been admitted in evidence because the police officer who would have administered the test, if the driver had agreed to submit to it, was the officer who signed the report as the witness to the refusal. The court held that there was nothing to suggest that the procedure was in any way illegal or even irregular. The hearing officer correctly admitted the report into evidence. The driver claimed that the facts set forth in the report did not support a finding of probable cause. The court disagreed. The report indicated that the police officer stopped the driver after observing him run a red light. He smelled of alcohol and the officer noticed an open can of Budweiser on the floor of the car. The driver failed all of the usual field sobriety tests. The facts established probable cause to arrest on the drunk driving charge. The driver did not sustain his burden to prove that the suspension under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 14-227b amounted to unconstitutional punishment.</SPAN></P>

The court held that to allow recovery under the Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act, Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 442-110a et seq., to a victim who suffered injury, but not where the victim suffered death, was contrary to established practice and a common sense of justice. The court held that the Connecticut Product Liability Act, Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 52-572m et seq., provided the exclusive remedy for harm caused by a product. The court held that the mother was not present when her child was actually injured and was too remote from the alleged act of negligence to meet the criterion for either distress claim.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The corporation filed a request for a zone change with the planning and zoning commission for the establishment of a planned elderly facility on a parcel of land that it owned. The commission denied the corporation's request. The corporation subsequently filed a complaint against the commission and five individual members of the commission. The third count of that complaint was brought pursuant to 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983. The corporation filed a motion for summary judgment as to the third count. The corporation argued that the third count claimed a deprivation of rights in violation of U.S. Const. amend. V and U.S. Const. amend. XIV and that 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 provided redress for such deprivation. The corporation maintained that it was denied its constitutional right of due process of law by the commission's failure to give it a re-hearing for reconsideration of its originally denied zone change application. The court denied the corporation's motion for summary judgment as to the third count because, although the corporation had a right to a rehearing, that right was not grounded in the constitution.</SPAN></P>

The claimant's license to conduct a home daycare center was revoked because the claimant refused to permit an inspection of the premises during operating hours.

The claimant continued to operate the daycare center despite a court order to cease operation. The Department fined the claimant $ 100 per day for each day the operation continued. The fines amounted to $ 20,100. The Department made a motion to find the claimant in contempt. The claimant was found in contempt and was cited and fined. The claimant sought review. The court dismissed the claimant's appeal, holding that the doctrine of election of remedies was not applicable because the doctrine was used to prevent double redress for a single wrong. The Department was authorized to impose a fine of $ 100 per day for the operation of a day care without a license.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff driver sought review of a decision of defendant commissioner of motor vehicles (Connecticut) to suspend the driver's operator's license. The commissioner acted pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 14-227b on the basis that the driver failed a chemical test of the alcohol content of his blood after having been arrested on a charge of operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The driver challenged the commissioner's suspension of his operator's license for failure to pass a chemical test of his blood alcohol level. The driver asserted that the police officer did not have the requisite suspicion to &quot;seize&quot; the driver because the dispatcher's information was based on hearsay. The court rejected that assertion and held that when the officer located the driver, he immediately had ample reason to investigate, independent of any information he was given by the dispatcher. The court rejected the driver's claim that he did not operate the vehicle and found that he was sitting in the driver's seat with the motor running when the officer discovered him. The court found that the commissioner's hearing officer was not hostile to the driver and fairly weighed the driver's evidence prior to rendering a decision. However, the hearing officer's decision to terminate the driver's cross-examination of an expert witness was error. The court noted that the driver attempted to question the reliability of an intoxilizer machine in order to raise the question of whether the results of the blood alcohol test were accurate. The driver's due process rights were violated.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In its action the tribe claimed that the Governor improperly refused to enter into a trust agreement. The tribe moved in limine to exclude three exhibits, allegedly establishing that the 1989 and 1990 reports of the Indian Affairs Task Force were not the &quot;final report&quot; of the task force as set forth in Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 47-66h, on the grounds of irrelevancy and hearsay. The Governor argued that the term &quot;final report&quot; meant the last report in a chronological sequence, that was the 1991 report of the task force. According to the Governor, the fact that the task force did not make recommendations about trust agreements in the 1991 report could not alter the plain meaning of &quot;final,&quot; regardless of any negative implications this strict construction could have on the tribe. After a hearing, the court denied the motion. The court held that the three exhibits were relevant to the court's inquiry as to which report of the task force was &quot;final&quot; as set forth in &sect; 47-66h. The court further ruled that the exhibits fell under exceptions to the hearsay rule, as public records and as evidentiary admissions.</SPAN></P>

The statute specifically required an element of cruelty as applied to wild animals. This required an intentional or wanton infliction of pain or torture beyond that involved in the act of killing. However, the State could not establish that drowning was per se cruelty to nuisance wildlife and did not establish any cruel motive or intent by defendant.

The officer noted the odor of liquor emanating from defendant and defendant failed sobriety tests. The court denied defendant's motion to suppress evidence observed and obtained by the officer in the parking lot. The Fourth Amendment allowed a police officer to detain an individual briefly for investigative purposes if the officer had a reasonable and articulable suspicion that the individual was engaged in criminal activity. The officer's observation that defendant was parked in a high-crime area in the early morning hours with another individual justified the limited intrusion of defendant. Defendant's manner of responding to the officer's questions warranted the officer in investigating further regarding the possibility that defendant was under the influence of alcohol.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowner had submitted two previous applications, which were denied. The commission listed four reasons for denial. The second reason given by the commission was that the construction would have a significant impact on the wetlands existing on the property. Eighty-five percent of the one-acre lot was composed of wetlands. The court held that there was substantial evidence from which the commission could conclude that the house, situated in the wetlands, with the necessary grading around its perimeter, the access required to the well, and the location of the septic system would, together, have a significant impact on the wetlands area. Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 22a-41(b) required that the commission find that a feasible and prudent alternative did not exist before approving an application to conduct regulated activities in a wetlands area. The burden of proof was on the landowner to show that his proposed development was the only alternative that was both feasible and prudent.

Stat. &sect; 12-62(a), defendant city conducted a decennial revaluation of all real property. Plaintiff taxpayers appealed their assessments. Plaintiffs' principal arguments were that 1994 Conn. Acts 4 (Act), an enabling act permitting municipalities to at their discretion postpone implementation of their decennial real property tax revaluations, was constitutionally deficient due to the lack of standards attending the Act's delegation of authority to the municipal level, and that the operation of the Act impermissibly divested plaintiffs and property owners of certain due process rights. The court rejected plaintiffs' contentions and held in favor of defendant. The court held that because the act afforded a person of ordinary intelligence a reasonable opportunity to know what was permitted or prohibited, the statute did not effect an unconstitutional delegation of power and was not unconstitutionally vague.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff high sheriff challenged the decision of defendant, the State Ethics Commission (Connecticut), which found that he violated the state code of ethics at Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 1-84(c) by sharing service of process fees, charging an additional service fee, and using employees for his service of process business.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The high sheriff referred service of process requests directed to him to his deputy sheriffs and he split the fee for service with them. He also billed a law firm a &quot;service fee&quot; in addition to the statutory service fee. This service fee allegedly compensated the high sheriff for advice regarding service methods, reviewing the process for errors, advancement of funds for filing fees, and short-term responsiveness. The high sheriff also directed two state employee subordinates to perform tasks associated with the referral of service of process business. Those employees were not compensated by the high sheriff for those tasks. The Commission found that the high sheriff's actions violated Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 1-84(c). The court dismissed his appeal. The sheriff's fee splitting arrangements were violative of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 6-36 and 6-46. The service fee was not authorized by Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 52-261 and 52-261a. The high sheriff could not use his subordinate employees in furtherance of his illegal schemes. The court rejected the high sheriff's equal protection argument and his argument that Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 1-84(c) was unconstitutionally overbroad and vague.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An estate filed a notice of claim under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 4-147 with the claims commissioner, alleging negligent medical treatment by the State hospital, including the improper placement of a draining tube, which resulted in the decedent's death. The notice sought $ 1,000,000 and permission to sue the State. The commissioner denied the request to sue, holding that the estate failed to meet its burden in demonstrating that the State caused the injury and that its expert was not competent to testify under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 52-184c. By special act, the estate was granted permission to sue the State. The State filed a motion to dismiss claiming that the general assembly's special act, in giving the estate permission to sue, was an unconstitutional exclusive public emolument under Conn. Const. amend. I. The constitutionality of the special act hinged upon whether it served a public purpose. The court held that the purpose in granting the permission to sue was the fact that the claims commissioner exceeded his authority under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 4-160 by inquiring into the qualifications of the estate's expert, which served a public purpose. Therefore, the motion to dismiss was denied.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">DCF seized the parent's child, filed a neglect petition, and obtained an ex parte temporary custody order (OTC). Over the parent's objection the court continued the statutorily-mandated 10-day hearing for more than six months. Alleging that the practice of continuing 10-day hearings was caused by unreasonably crowded juvenile dockets, insufficient staffing of juvenile courts, and inadequate allocation of judicial resources, and violated her rights under the federal constitution, the parent sought injunctive relief directing the administrator (1) to establish new procedures for cases in which an OTC was issued ex parte, and (2) to allocate sufficient resources to the Superior Court for juvenile matters to eliminate the alleged unlawful practices, and directing the commissioner of DCF to restore children to parental custody. The court granted the administrator's motion to strike the prayers for injunctive relief because the administrator did not have the authority to create or change the court's rules. Sovereign immunity barred the court from interfering with the administrator's discretion to allocate judicial resources, or with the DCF's discretion over the commitment of children.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff country club filed a cause of action against defendant builder when it discovered that its clubhouse addition's ceiling tiles were falling out of their support systems, and when it discovered, upon further investigation, a failure of the entire roof system. In response, the builder filed a motion for summary judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The country club alleged that it relied upon the builder's expertise, that the builder had a duty to use reasonable care in constructing the clubhouse's roof system, but that the builder was negligent in failing to use reasonable care in the roof system's construction. The builder asserted that the action was barred by the statutes of limitations, Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 52-577 or 52-584. The builder then filed a motion for summary judgment. The country club filed an objection to the motion, contending that &sect; 52-584 was unconstitutional as applied. In the builder's subsequent response, it stated that any act or omission occurred six years prior to discovery, and eight years from completion of work. The country club then argued that &sect; 52-584 violated Conn. Const. art. first, &sect; 10 because an application of the statute would preclude it from bringing a negligence claim before it knew that it had suffered any harm. The court disagreed; it entered judgment for the builder. Section 52-584 barred the country club's action. It was not unconstitutional as applied because it did not alter the cause of action; it created a time period in which the negligence action must have been brought.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted the builder's motion for summary judgment against the country club in its negligence action.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant Connecticut Commissioner of Education filed a motion to dismiss plaintiff teacher unions' declaratory judgment action in which the unions alleged that the waiver provisions of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 10-264a(3), 10-264f(3) violated Conn. Const. arts. II and III and sought to permanently enjoin granting waivers of statutory or regulatory mandates to local or regional boards of education under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 10-264a(3), 10-264f(3).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Commissioner asserted a lack of standing. The court dismissed the unions' action, finding a lack of standing because the unions did not allege that their individual members had standing and because the unions' claim did not involve the members. The court reasoned that no member was harmed because none of the disputed waivers were sought or granted. The court also held that the unions did not claim any injury to themselves or that the Commissioner's action invaded any legally protected interest of the members. The court further reasoned that precedent showed that being harmed by a statute was a prerequisite for challenging its constitutionality and that it was currently impossible to determine if any future waivers could have an impact upon the unions or their members. The court also found that the unions did not show that the waiver provisions were facially unconstitutional, noting that there were adequate standards with which the waiver authority could have been exercised and that there was a distinction between delegating the power to put the statutory requirements into effect to an administrative board and giving a board the power to waive the statutory requirements.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowners commenced an action for damages and an injunction against the town. The landowners claimed that the town improperly maintained and permitted drainage of surface water from a road onto their property. The court granted the landowners' request for equitable relief on the basis that implementation of the town's plan would not have caused the least damage to the land. Given the topography of the property, the court also found that the town's plan was likely to continue the redirection of surface water drainage onto the house lot. In addition, the court found that execution of the landowners' proposal would have caused the least damage to the property, and that their proposal was most likely to eliminate artificial drainage of surface water onto the house lot. The court also held that Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 13a-138 did not give the town a prescriptive easement because the statute was not interpreted to allow for a taking of private property without compensation. Therefore, the court issued a mandatory injunction permanently enjoining the town from causing surface water from the road onto the landowners' property in a manner that did not cause the least damage.</SPAN></P>

Defendant filed a motion to suppress evidence. The court in granting the motion ruled that a seizure of defendant did take place when the detectives boxed in his car. The court held that the detectives had no information that he carried weapons, no search or arrest warrant was obtained in connection with the complaint, no corroborating evidence of the investigation was offered, and the detective gave no information regarding the complainant. The court concluded that there was no evidence from which the court could determine the reliability and adequacy of the tip. Therefore, the court found that the subjective motives of the detectives did not form a basis for justifying the stop and search of defendant's car. The court held that the evidence was insufficient to prove the informant's reliability. The tip was not adequate to provide the detectives with a reasonable and articulable suspicion to perform the stop. The court ruled that all of the evidence derived from the illegal search and seizure of defendant's car should be suppressed under the fruit of the poisonous tree doctrine.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was 14 at the time of her arrest. The State filed a motion to transfer defendant out of juvenile court pursuant to 1995 Conn. Acts 225 13(b). The juvenile court, after finding probable cause, transferred the matter to the court. Defendant argued that the transfer statute violated her constitutional right to due process and her right to equal protection and was void for vagueness. The court noted that defendant had no constitutional right to be treated as a juvenile. Further, defendant did not sufficiently establish how her constitutional rights were violated by the transfer statute. In the absence of deliberate discretion based on race, religion, and other arbitrary classifications, the statutory exercise of prosecutorial discretion did not violate defendant's due process right. The statute itself did not establish any prohibited arbitrary classification and provided for a rational exercise of prosecutorial discretion. The judge's transfer discretion was based on a finding of probable cause. There was no impermissible delegation of policy that fostered arbitrary or discriminatory applications.</SPAN></P>

Gen. Stat. 30-17. Respondent wholesaler had previously been the county's exclusive distributor of the product.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The brewer contended that the &quot;just and sufficient cause&quot; requirement of &sect; 30-17 was to be imposed only in instances of termination of geographic diminishment of the wholesaler franchise. The court dismissed the brewer's appeal. The brewer showed that it was aggrieved by the decision because it was prevented from implementing its business plan to add an additional distributor. The court found that the commission correctly construed the term &quot;diminishment&quot; in &sect; 30-17 to encompass market share diminishment and that its construction gave meaning to the &quot;just and sufficient cause&quot; requirement in the circumstance of adding a wholesaler. As construed by the commission, &sect; 30-17 did not unconstitutionally discriminate between beer shippers and other alcoholic liquor shippers by imposing the &quot;just and sufficient cause&quot; requirement only on beer shippers. The court determined that the classification was subject to rational basis analysis because it touched on economic interests. The different treatment for beer shippers was reasonable because beer's limited shelf life and bottle bill redemption obligations imposed different obligations on beer wholesalers than on other alcohol distributors.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff condominium association initiated an action against defendant lessors seeking a declaratory judgment as to whether the association was bound by a ground lease, as to what the rights and responsibilities of the parties were regarding that ground lease, and declaring the ground lease unconscionable. Both the association and the lessors filed motions for summary judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The lessors' motion for summary judgment challenged the constitutionality of 95-187 Conn. Acts 27. The State sought and received amicus status. It had filed a brief and argued in support of the constitutionality of that public act. The association's motion requested that the court enter summary judgment as to liability under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 47-210(d). It argued that the lease provisions were unconscionable. The association argued that it established, without genuine rebuttal from the lessors, all of the elements of 95-187 Conn. Acts 27(d). The court found that the ground lease was presumed to be unconscionable. The lessors argued that their affidavits introduced factual issues as to the commercial reasonableness of the lease and therefore summary judgment for the association should be denied. The court held that the presumption of unconscionability created by meeting the statutory criteria would not work to deprive the lessors of their opportunity to overcome the presumption and prove the commercial reasonableness of the ground lease. The court also determined the constitutionality issues were not ripe.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Commission filed a complaint against the officer pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 46a-82(b), alleging that the officer had implemented a discriminatory practice of stopping cars containing African American and Puerto Rican persons. The Commission commenced an investigation of the complaint, but more than two years later it had not issued a reasonable cause determination. After enactment of 1996 Conn. Acts 241, but before it took effect, the officer moved for a dismissal of the complaint. The Commission denied the motion. The officer filed an action seeking a temporary and permanent injunction to prohibit the Commission from taking further action on the complaint. The court denied relief. The legislature could validate complaints that would be otherwise dismissed for failure to make a reasonable cause determination within the nine-month time period in Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 46a-83(d). The obvious intent of the legislature in enacting 1996 Conn. Acts 241 was to preserve the jurisdiction of the Commission over complaints that would have been otherwise dismissed. This was a legitimate purpose and did not deprive the officer of any constitutional right. The Act was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner's property was used as gasoline service station since before the area was zoned residential. The owner applied to the town's zoning board of appeals (ZBA) for a variance to the zoning regulations so that the nonconforming use of the property could be expanded. The ZBA denied the application. The owner appealed and filed an inverse condemnation action. The town sought dismissal of the inverse condemnation action, arguing that the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction due to the pending appeal from the zoning decision. The court granted the town's motion. The owner submitted only one application for a variance and made no attempt to seek a favorable result on another proposal; thus, the ZBA's decision was not final for purposes of the takings clause. Furthermore, although constitutional claims generally could not be heard in an appeal of an administrative agency's adverse decision, an exception existed for a claim of an unconstitutional taking of property in an attack on a regulation as applied to a specific piece of property. Thus, the court did not have jurisdiction over the subject matter of the complaint because no final administrative decision had yet been made.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 8-67, was required to provide written notice of his intention to commence suit, with the housing authority, within six months after the action arose. The resident erroneously served the notice upon the city, which forwarded the notice to the housing authority. The notice, however, was not received by the housing authority within the statutory period. The resident argued that the defect in service was rectified and that the notice was validated by the special act. The housing authority asserted a special defense that the resident's claim was barred by his failure to comply with the &sect; 8-67 requirement. The housing authority filed a motion for summary judgment. The main issue before the court was whether the special act purporting to remedy the defective notice conferred an exclusive emolument or privilege on the resident in violation of Conn. Const. art. I, &sect; 1. The court stated that it was not possible to discern any bona fide public purpose behind the special act, which benefitted one person only. The court held that neither the statute nor the case law supported the resident's claim that an exception should be read into &sect; 1.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff driver appealed a decision of defendant, the Connecticut Commissioner of Motor Vehicles, which suspended the driver's motor vehicle operator's license pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 14-227b upon a finding that the driver failed a chemical test of the alcohol content of his blood after being arrested on a charge of driving while under the influence of alcohol.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The driver appealed the Commissioner's decision to suspend the driver's license to operate a motor vehicle, arguing that the hearing officer erred in (1) determining that the police had probable cause to arrest the driver on the drunk driving charge, (2) determining that the driver's blood alcohol level exceeded the legal limit, and (3) denying the driver's motion for a continuance. The court held that the police officer smelled the odor of alcohol on the driver's breath, the driver admitted that he had been drinking beer and, in the officer's opinion, the driver failed the sobriety tests. There was ample substantial evidence that the breathalyzer machine was functioning properly and it was undisputed that the machine was certified by the department of public health and addiction services, in accordance with state regulations. The basis of the hearing officer's decision to deny the driver's request for a continuance was that the driver failed to subpoena the items from a police department and the state health department even though the driver and his attorney knew that the breath tests were administered not at a state police facility but, rather, at the police department.</SPAN></P>

Gen. Stat. &sect; 52-556. Section 52-556 imposed liability for the negligent operation of state owned vehicles by a state employee.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The motorcyclist crashed after he observed some police cars and thought that he was being chased. The officers denied that a pursuit occurred or argued that, if it did occur, there was a reasonable basis for an investigative stop. The court denied relief. At this stage, it would be premature to determine whether such a pursuit occurred or was reasonable under the circumstances. Nevertheless, the claim that the motorcyclist was deprived of his civil rights under Conn. Const. art. I, &sect; 9 was rejected because mere negligence did not violate a person's due process rights under the state constitution. The officers' contention that the Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 52-556 claim was time-barred lacked merit because the officers failed to timely assert this defense in accordance with established pleading requirements. The motorcyclist's claims based on reckless and intentional conduct survived because Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 4-165 granted immunity only for conduct that was not reckless, wanton, or malicious, and such conduct was sufficiently alleged.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied the officers' motion for summary judgment, but a certain civil rights claim under the Connecticut Constitution was rejected.</SPAN></P>

He claimed that none of the conditions constituted pollution, contamination, emergency, or hazardous waste and that plaintiff exceeded his authority and was barred from collecting the sums sought in the action. The question presented was whether, in a non-emergency circumstance, the legislature intended that the right to notice and appeal were to be considered paramount to a liberal interpretation of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 22a-451, allowing the Commissioner to take action without notice, and without an opportunity to be heard in a non-emergency situation. In essence defendant claimed that the statute was so broad as to give to the Commissioner the right and the power to act arbitrarily, without criteria to place constitutional limits upon the powers so delegated, and hence, ab initio was violative of due process in its general application to any given circumstances. The court came to no decision but denied plaintiff's motions to strike certain defenses.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the rule of lenity did not apply because the statute was not ambiguous.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff Stafford Board of Education filed an administrative appeal from the decision of defendant State Board of Education (Connecticut), which requiried the town board to provide bus transportation to children attending a private religious school under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 10-281.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In deciding whether the town board was required by Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 10-281 to provide transportation services to private non-profit school students, the court held that the issue was not moot, but rather was an issue that was capable of repetition yet evading judicial review. The court further held that the reliable probative and substantial evidence on the record supported the hearing officer's finding that the town board was obligated under &sect; 10-281 to provide transportation services as directed in the hearing officer's administrative decision. The court further held that the hearing officer's decision did not violate principles of freedom of religion under the First Amendment to the United States Constitution or under Conn. Const. arts. I, VII. The court held that the determination of the town's obligation presented a contested case pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 4-166(2). The court also held that transporting children to private non-profit schools facilitated their education through safe transportation and neither inhibited nor advanced religion. The court therefore dismissed the town board's appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that the legislature adopted a policy of public transportation for all children and that the legislature intended to encourage cooperation in coordinating transportation services. The court held that the transportation of local students to private non-profit religious schools was not offensive under the state or federal constitutions. The court dismissed the administrative appeal, and affirmed the hearing officer's decision.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, who was sentenced for robberies in New York and on trial in Connecticut, moved to suppress the statements he made to the detectives in the car while being transported to Connecticut. Defendant argued that his right to counsel under both the federal and state constitutions attached at the filing of the information in Connecticut and that the interrogation by the detectives in the car ride was impermissible and unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">While defendant was serving his sentence for robberies in New York, the State of Connecticut requested his transfer for the purpose of commencing criminal proceedings against him for the robbery in Connecticut. At the conclusion of the extradition hearing, defendant was ordered transferred to Connecticut. A Connecticut detective requested an interview with defendant by telephone, but defendant refused. One detective orally advised defendant of his Miranda rights and after stating that he understood those rights, defendant thereafter made certain inculpatory statements to the detectives. Defendant then moved to suppress the statements made in the car. The main issue before the court was whether filing of the information in Connecticut constituted commencement of adversarial criminal proceedings, requiring counsel to be present for any custodial interrogation. The court held that defendant's right to counsel under the state and federal constitutions did not attach at the time of the filing of the information because the adversary juridical criminal proceedings could not commence until arraignment when defendant was formally charged with a crime and had entered a plea.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court rejected defendant's claims that his inculpatory statements made during his transportation from New York to Connecticut were obtained by the police in violation of his constitutional rights, as well as his corresponding rights under the Connecticut constitution. The court, therefore, denied defendant's motion to suppress.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff landowner sought to gain reapproval of a certain alleged land divisions made by the prior owner to the effect that each lot would contain property located in two adjoining towns, and each would be more than one acre. Defendant New Canaan Planning &amp; Zoning Commission (Connecticut), denied the application because the portion of the parcel under its jurisdiction did not meet the one-acre zoning requirement. The landowner filed an appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowner claimed that the property was subdivided in 1955, and the division was a free cut that he was entitled to without commission approval. On appeal, the court determined that the division depicted on the 1955 map relied upon by the landowner was not a subdivision within the meaning of the local subdivision and street regulations and Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 8-18, and, therefore, was not subject to the commission's approval. Nonetheless, the proposed division was subject to zoning regulations, specifically the lot area and shape requirements. Neither party disputed that the one-acre lot size requirement was in effect in 1955. To be a legal division the lots would have had to meet the requirements. The commission had no power to approve or disapprove any division of land located in the adjoining town. The court concluded that 1955 division did not meet the zoning requirements at the time; thus, the commission's finding that it was not a legal division were supported by the law and the record. Lastly, the necessary evidence for the court to make a determination that denial of the application was, in effect, an unconstitutional taking of the land was not found in the record.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowner's appeal was dismissed.</SPAN></P>

During the hearing, the results of the breath tests were submitted into evidence and the driver opposed the admission thereof.

The driver appealed, contending that there was insufficient evidence in the record to support the hearing officer's determination that the alcohol content of his blood exceeded the legal limit at the time that he operated his vehicle. The court dismissed the appeal.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The town had filed an administrative appeal of the council's decision, which was dismissed for a failure to properly serve the council. The town commenced this action, asserting that the council's decision to grant the request was unconstitutional because it exceeded their power, the notice was incomplete, and various land use regulations were violated. The town asserted that the present action differed from the administrative appeal in that it did not challenge the authority of the council to regulate the location and type of telecommunications tower that may be erected, but was instead challenging the council's authority to approve the construction of an access road without the appropriate planning and environmental considerations. The court found that the town had failed to exhaust its administrative remedies because the present action was seeking essentially to do what the town had attempted to do in the failed administrative appeal. The court stated that the dismissal of the town's administrative appeal did not relieve the town of its duty to exhaust the administrative remedies available.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff police officer filed a lawsuit against defendants, a city and a board of police commissioners, seeking an injunction and monetary damages for alleged violation of his due process rights, secured by the State and Federal Constitutions and by 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983, relating to a charge against him for conduct unbecoming an officer. Defendants filed a motion for summary judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The officer was charged with conduct unbecoming an officer. Following an inconclusive hearing in December 7, 1994, a newspaper published an article that included city police internal affairs information not subject to release. The officer filed a complaint in September 1995 to enjoin further disciplinary proceedings on the ground that the released information would deprive him of a fair and impartial hearing. The board subsequently proceeded with the officer's disciplinary hearing in April 1996, which resulted in a three-month suspension of the officer. The officer appealed the denial of his September complaint, not the actual decision suspending him. As a result, defendants were entitled to summary judgment on the ground that the officer failed to exhaust his administrative remedies. The court also held that defendants were entitled to summary judgment because the officer failed to state a cause of action under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 in that his complaint failed to allege a policy or custom that resulted in a deprivation of a constitutional right. Accordingly, the court granted defendants' motion for summary judgment.</SPAN></P>

The court upheld the regulation but found that the actions of staff members who remained within listening distance of inmates on the phone with attorneys, denied inmates a reasonable opportunity to call their attorneys, and placed a 10-minute limit on attorney-client calls were unconstitutional. The commissioner appealed. The appellate court held that the practices were constitutional, but because the commissioner failed to appeal from the ruling regarding staff members remaining nearby during privileged calls, the judgment remained intact. On appeal, the court held that the prisoners were a &quot;prevailing party&quot; entitled to attorneys fees under 42 U.S.C.S. 1988(b), even though they failed to prevail on their constitutional claim. The court awarded $ 9,000 in fees to the prisoners' counsel, who made a &quot;monumental&quot; effort on behalf of the inmates in the course of an 11-day trial.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the principal was properly disciplined under Conn. Gen.

The principal also filed a breach of contract claim against defendants claiming that the mayor agreed to suspend him with pay pending the outcome of the criminal charges.

These other provisions had been held unconstitutional under the Commerce Clause on the grounds that they were, in effect, a &quot;flow control.&quot; The state argued that the ordinance at issue remained valid in that it provided the town with information needed to come up with a comprehensive plan. The court rejected defendant's argument that the ordinance burdened interstate commerce on the grounds that the weighing of trucks was absolutely evenhanded and that no hauler, landfill, or treatment facility was placed at a greater or lesser advantage because of the weighing requirement. The court also found that the ordinance was not an impermissible use of the town's police power on the grounds that it was not unreasonable for the town to want reliable information concerning the amount of trash generated in order to evaluate the options available to it.

The neighbors appealed the decisions of the zoning board amending the zoning regulations and approving the site plan, arguing that in approving the application the zoning board acted in abuse of the discretion vested in it because the amendment to the zoning regulations was unconstitutionally vague and without appropriate standards. The court ruled that although an ordinance must state its standards with adequate clarity, lack of precision was not, in or of itself, offensive to the requirement of due process. Further, the court held that the neighbors had not sustained their burden of proving that the effect of the challenged ordinance adversely affected a constitutionality protected right they had.

In response, a motion to dismiss was filed that was based on arguments of lack of personal jurisdiction due to insufficient process and the bar of sovereign immunity. A hearing was held on the motion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The first count of the complaint alleged that defendants violated the inmate's due process rights under the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution by failing to clean a wet gym floor. The second count alleged that an administrator and a medical assistant, both identified as John Doe, violated state law and Department of Correction policy by demonstrating a deliberate indifference to the inmate's medical needs. There was no allegation that defendants, as state officials, acted in excess of their statutory authority or pursuant to an unconstitutional statute. Therefore, the doctrine of sovereign immunity was applicable. There was no allegation that the inmate received permission from the claims commissioner to sue the state. Because the state had not waived its immunity from suit for money damages, the doctrine of sovereign immunity required dismissal of all claims against defendants in their official capacities. Also, there was a lack of jurisdiction over the individual defendants. The use of John Doe designations was improper because the court could not ascertain the specific persons intended to be sued. Service of the complaint against them was ineffective.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The board issued an order suspending the physician's license, imposed a period of probation following the suspension, with conditions of inspection and monitoring by a licensed natureopathic physician, and imposed a civil penalty. The court found that &sect; 20-40 prohibited certain conduct by the incorporation of &sect; 19a-17, and that there was a basis for finding the physician guilty of professional misconduct. There was compelling and substantial evidence, in the form of a patient's testimony, that the physician's conduct was illegal. Although the statutes do not specifically refer to abandonment of a patient as a basis for penalizing a practitioner, the prohibition of illegal, incompetent, and negligent practice encompasses abandonment. The court ordered a remand, holding that it was not possible to determine whether it was reasonable for the board to conclude that the physician's actions in terminating his professional relationships with his patients amounted to professional misconduct. The board's conclusions regarding abandonment was ordered to be clarified, and the penalty was ordered to be modified accordingly.</SPAN></P>

The court granted the LLC's motion for summary judgment, holding that there was no material fact regarding the enforceability of the mortgage and that the conveyance of the premises via a tax sale extinguished the plaintiff's mortgage, and that the tax collector's deed was prima facie evidence of a valid and unencumbered title. The court held that even if plaintiff did not receive notice of the sale until after the sale, that alone was not sufficient to invalidate the tax sale and the resulting tax collector's deed.Plaintiff failed to effectively challenge the validity of the tax sale.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a consolidated action, plaintiff taxpayers filed an action against defendants, tax collector and town, seeking a declaration that the auction procedure under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 12-157 deprived them of their property without just compensation. A second action alleged that the acts violated &sect; 12-155, that &sect; 12-157 was unconstitutional, and alleged civil rights violations. Both actions requested an injunction against the threatened property sale.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayers argued that under &sect; 12-155 the tax collector must first levy on the goods of a taxpayer before selling his real property and that &sect; 12-157 must provide a mechanism for setting aside a public auction sale at a commercially unreasonable price. The court disagreed and held that later statutory amendments to &sect; 12-157 left the claim meritless and gave the tax collector authority to sell real property to collect unpaid personal property taxes. The court held that the doctrine of commercial reasonableness could not be imported onto &sect; 12-157 because (1) there was no evidence that the legislature intended the term to apply; and (2) the requirement was interrelated with other UCC rights and duties and the tax collector could not have a duty imposed on him when he was without the tools to discharge the obligation. The taxpayers had no substantive due process right to a commercially reasonable tax sale and this was dispositive of their procedural due process claim, along with the fact that the hearing requirement did not apply where there was only a ministerial duty to conduct the sale fairly. The court also found that the one-year redemption period was not unreasonable.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court entered judgment for the tax collector and town declaring that (1) a prior levy on goods was not a precondition to selling real property for taxes outstanding; (2) real property may be sold for taxes owed on personal property even though no lien on the real property had previously been levied; (3) &sect; 12-157 did not deny the taxpayers procedural due process; and (4) the property redemption period of &sect; 12-157 was not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

The court ruled that there was ample and substantial evidence in the record to support the findings of the hearing officer and the commissioner that the corporation had continuously violated state environmental statutes and regulations as well as the conditions of its own landfill permit over a long period of time. The commissioner's interpretation of the relevant statute, that it gave him the discretion to deny an application for a new permit to conduct solid waste activities, was entirely reasonable. The statute by its plain language did not limit the commissioner's authority to deny an application only in those cases where the applicant had been convicted of a violation. The corporation's prior history of failing to comply with the law and the regulations and the conditions of its existing permit were a sufficient basis for denying the corporation's permit.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested and charged with first degree robbery and conspiracy to commit robbery. Defendant's motions to dismiss challenged the constitutionality of &sect; 13(a), under which he was automatically transferred from juvenile court to superior court. The defendant contended that the automatic transfer provision of &sect; 13(a) violated his federal due process rights. Appellee state argues that juvenile status was not a right but a benefit conferred by the legislature, therefore, &sect; 13(a) did not violate defendant's due process rights. On appeal, the court found that there were two elements which must have been established in order to find a due process violation. First, defendant must have established that he had a liberty interest under the fourteenth amendment. If it was determined that a protected liberty interest was implicated, then the second element was what procedural protections were due. Courts had interpreted juvenile status as a legislative determination, not a constitutional right. Because juvenile status was not considered a liberty interest, it was not afforded constitutional protection. Therefore, &sect; 13(a) did not violate defendant's due process rights.</SPAN></P>

The employee and one of the employers filed cross-motions for summary judgment. The court granted CIGA's motion for summary judgment. The two-year time provision covered workers' compensation claims. The time bar was a statute of repose. It cut off all liability for claims made more than two years after an insurer was declared insolvent, regardless of when the claim arose, who knew or had reason to know about it, or any other factor traditionally associated with a statute of limitations. Neither equitable tolling nor equitable estoppel applied to statutes of repose. The two-year cutoff applied to all claims, not just workers' compensation claims. It was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff landowner sought review of a decision from defendant, the Inland Wetland and Watercourses Commission of the Town of Trumbull (Connecticut), which granted his application to construct two houses and a roadway subject to certain conditions. The Commissioner of the Department of Environmental Protection also was been named a defendant.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowner filed an application for the construction of two houses and a roadway on two of four lots. The commission approved the application for one lot only, subject to certain conditions. The landowner challenged the decision on the ground that the conditions constituted an unconstitutional taking of his property and were illegal, arbitrary, and an abuse of the commission's discretion. The court agreed that a condition requiring the landowner to establish a conservation easement was not supported by substantial evidence in the record, even assuming that it was a condition that was statutorily authorized. The conditions regarding zoning and flood mitigation, which required the landowner to seek the agreement of the town and variances from the zoning board of appeals, were not illegal. Such conditions were contemplated and provided for in Trumbull, CT, Inland Wetlands and Watercourses Regulations &sect;&sect; 17.1 and 11.5. The condition regarding setbacks was also proper. Because the condition requiring a conservation easement was an integral part of the decision, the court could not modify the decision to bring it into conformance with the law. Therefore, the appeal was sustained.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the father was estopped from contesting the paternity of the child at issue. The court found that the father made statements and acted in ways that clearly and unequivocally indicated to the mother that he believed he was and intended to be the father of the child. The court noted that these statements continued 10 days after the birth of the child and when the father signed the acknowledgement of paternity.

The State then terminated the contract and the contractor filed another action. The State filed a motion to strike the counts of the contractor's action alleging a deprivation of the contractor's due process rights and seeking injunctive and equitable relief. The court held that the contractor had a due process claim because the contract created an entitlement to certain work, which was a protected property interest that was being deprived by the State. The court found that the contractor's claim for declaratory relief survived the motion to strike because, although there was an alternative method of redress through arbitration, the court could exercise discretion in the matter. The court ruled that the action for equitable relief and injunctive relief withstood a motion to strike because the contractor would be irreparably harmed by the termination because it would be unable to secure future contracts as a result.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the property owner claimed that the Board acted illegally, arbitrarily, and in abuse of its discretion in denying the applications. The court disagreed, dismissed the appeal, and upheld the Board's decision holding that it would not disturb the Board's finding that the use of the store would be the re-establishment of a non-conforming use requiring the issuance of a variance by the Board. The court further held that the Board properly concluded that the valid local zoning regulations precluded it from issuing the variance. The court also declined to address the merits of the application for parking spaces because the denial of the use variance rendered it moot.

The court held that because the sales tax applied to all newspapers regardless of content, it was not an unconstitutional abridgement of freedom of speech. The court rejected the taxpayer's argument that the exemption for sales of newspapers by subscription violated the principle of uniformity of U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 8, cl. 1. The court stated that the administrative expense of collecting such sales tax would render the imposition of the tax uneconomical, and that the exemption was not content based.

Accepting the facts found by the referee, the court determined that the referee's legal conclusion was not based on any explicit written document, but rather on inferences from certain conduct. The court found that the referee's attempt to rely on inferences based on certain actions by the purchaser in its relationship with a third party, who bought the property from the purchaser, ran contrary to the requirement of the statute of frauds that agreements concerning land must be in writing.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 8-8(b), plaintiff, adjoining property owners, challenged a decision of the Planning and Zoning Commission of the Town of Newtown (Connecticut), which approved a subdivision application submitted by defendant applicant. Plaintiffs alleged that the Commission acted illegally, arbitrarily, and in abuse of its discretion in that concluded the proposal was a subdivision and did not conduct a public hearing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs further argued that the Commission deprived them of due process by refusing to accept letters in opposition to the proposal after the Commission invited public comment and that the proposal was adopted even though it did not conform to the Newtown Subdivision Regulations. On appeal, the court upheld the Commission's decision. The court reasoned that an earlier partition of the land and transfer of a parcel for no consideration did not create an additional building lot and the transfer was not for the purpose of sale or building development. Thus, the transfer did not create a subdivision under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 8-18. Accordingly, the present application was for a subdivision, rather than a resubdivision. Under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 8-26, the Commission was given discretion to determine whether a public hearing was required. It did not abuse its discretion. Section 8-26 was a not unconstitutional in that it was a reasonable delegation of discretion to the Commission to enable them to carry out their duties. The record supported the Commission's decision and the court refused to substitute its judgment.</SPAN></P>

The homeowners had begun construction of the addition when the permit was revoked. The homeowners unsuccessfully appealed the revocation and sought judicial review. The court found that the homeowners met their legal burden of proving that the zoning board acted illegally, arbitrarily, and in abuse of its discretion by failing to state the reasons for its decision upon the record, in violation of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 8-7. The zoning board's memorandum, minutes, and transcript all failed to provide adequate information for the court to review the reasoning behind its action. The zoning board's action could not be found to be in accord with the municipal zoning regulations. The zoning board's action also could not be found to be reasonably based upon evidence presented at the hearing. The court reversed the decision of the zoning board and remanded the matter. The court rejected the homeowners' contention that a member of the zoning board had a conflict of interest because he was acquainted with one of the individuals who had objected to the addition.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Shortly after the party members ran on a third party line for election, their names were removed from the enrollment list of the Democratic Party pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9-61. The party members appealed the removal of their names on the basis that the mandatory erasure statute,&nbsp;&sect; 9-61, was unconstitutional in that it violated their freedom of association. The court sustained the party members' appeal. Specifically, the court held that &sect; 9-61, which provided for the mandatory disaffiliation of a person whose name appears on a ballot label under a party designation other than that of the party in which he was an enrolled member, was unconstitutional where it substantially infringed upon a person's freedom of political association. The court found that the registrar of voters and party chairman failed to prove that there was a compelling state interest justifying the statute and even if there were, they failed to prove that less restrictive means would not have been achieved by this purpose.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The planning commission amended its regulations and established criteria for a minimum area of buildable land. The new criteria prevented the landowner from subdividing his land into four parcels. He brought an action for declaratory judgment, alleging that the regulations were invalid because they usurped the powers of the inland wetlands commission, they had the effect of taking his property without just compensation, they constituted an arbitrary and capricious act, and they were unconstitutionally vague. Defendants filed a motion to strike the complaint in its entirety and argued that it failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted in that there were no substantial issues in dispute. The court noted that a declaratory judgment action was the proper vehicle to make general attacks on land use regulations. Defendants further argued that the landowner's claim of a taking was insufficient because it did not allege that he was precluded from developing his property. The court agreed. The court stated that a final deprivation had not occurred until there were no economically viable uses of land. The landowner did not make such allegations.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant filed motions with the Superior Court of the New Haven Judicial District (Connecticut), wherein defendant sought the dismissal of the two felony counts against him on the ground that 1995 Conn. Acts. 95-225, &sect; 13(a) (Reg. Sess.), the statute mandating the transfer of his case to the court's regular criminal docket, was unconstitutional. The prosecution contested the motions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The prosecution prevailed. The court began by noting that there was no constitutional right to be tried as a juvenile. To the contrary, the entire array of special treatments accorded to juvenile offenders were, at their root, a matter of legislative grace. The statute at issue was presumed constitutional, and defendant bore the burden of proving, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the presumptive constitutionality of the statute had been overcome. Defendant's due process complaints against the statute failed because it mandated defendant's trial as an adult by the application of statutory criteria. The statute, in conjunction with Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 54-56, provided defendant with a means through which he could obtain judicial review of the prosecutor's charging decision. Defendant had no protected liberty interest in a putative right to have his case returned to the juvenile justice system. Defendant's equal protection argument against 1995 Conn. Acts. 95-225, &sect; 13(a) (Reg. Sess.) failed because defendant was unsuccessful in showing that the statutory distinction was without a rational basis, and neither did the statute violate the separation of powers doctrine.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Apparently as a result of past proceedings, certain of debtor's property was placed in receivership due to his failure to pay the utility for electrical power. With regard to the present action, his counterclaim survived the withdrawal of the utility's complaint, which had sought to recover for unpaid bills. The debtor sought a declaratory judgment that Connecticut's receivership statute was unconstitutional. He also claimed that he suffered great injury because, with respect to the seized properties, the utility company failed to collect rents or pay utilities, taxes, and mortgages. He alleged that the properties were forced into foreclosure by the utility's conduct. The utility filed a motion for summary judgment. The court ruled that the debtor had litigated the constitutionality of the receivership statute in the past and was barred by res judicata from litigating it again. The utility was not liable for the debtor's alleged injuries. The receivership statute did not require the utility to perform any acts with respect to rent collection or taxes and mortgage payments. Those were the responsibility of the court-appointed receiver, against whom the debtor had not complained.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pleaded guilty to three counts of tampering with evidence. He was sentenced to three years probation. Defendant was charged with violating the terms of probation when his urine tested positive for cocaine in violation of the probation condition that he not violate any criminal law. The court held that the state probation officer exceeded his statutory authority, under &sect; 53a-30(b), in requiring him to submit to urinalysis as a condition of his probation. The condition was not imposed by the court because there was no evidence of drug use before the court at defendant's sentencing hearing. Moreover, the probation officer imposed a probation condition that was not reasonably related to the purposes of defendant's probation. Therefore, the condition that defendant submit to urinalysis diminished his privacy expectations beyond the extent that was necessary for his reformation and rehabilitation. The evidence against defendant was obtained in excess of statutory authority and in violation of his right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures under Conn. Const. art. I, &sect; 7.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowner sought an earth filling, re-grading, and removal permit under a special exception under Bethany, Conn., Zoning Reg. &sect; 7.5 and a waiver of a buffer under &sect; 7.5(E)(2)(a)(1) for a residential parcel of about four acres and for a second parcel of about eight acres, which abutted the residential parcel. The landowner planned to excavate the sand and gravel on her property in order to expand her residential parcel to about 12 acres by eliminating a hill behind her house, to address a water problem, to add a garage and solarium to her house, and to relocate a stable and pasture land for her horses. After a public hearing, the Commission denied her requests. The court held that the Commission did not act unreasonably in denying the landowner a waiver because the evidence showed that the grant of a waiver of the 100-foot buffer had an adverse impact on the abutting properties owned by the adjoining landowners. The court further held that the Commission acted reasonably in denying the special exception application because the landowner's plan was not compliance with &sect; 7.5.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged in a four-count indictment with the crime of risk of injury to a minor in violation of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53-21. The charges related to acts whereby defendant caused the victim, a 15-year-old female, to be placed in a situation where her health was likely to be injured or morals likely to be impaired by photographing the victim in lingerie and/or semi-nude. Defendant filed a motion to dismiss the charges on the basis that the State failed to charge an offense since a 15-year-old person could provide a valid consent in a risk of injury case and the victim voluntarily consented to the taking of certain pictures. The court, in response to one of defendant's other contentions, first found that &sect; 53-21, as applied to the conduct charged to defendant, was not void for vagueness. Moreover, the court was aware of no decision holding that a minor could consent to being placed in a situation where her health was likely to be injured or her morals likely to be impaired as charged in defendant's information. The court noted that the sexual assault statutes were not identical to the behavior proscribed by &sect; 53-21. Accordingly, defendant's motion to dismiss was denied.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, a mother, a child's agent, and a photographer, filed motions to dismiss charges against them for risk of injury to a minor in violation of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53-21. The charges were brought after the mother allowed her 15-year-old daughter to be photographed in lingerie and semi-nude.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were charged after police discovered the photos, videotape of a photography session, and modeling contracts the mother had signed for her daughter. The court denied their motions to dismiss because the statute, as applied to the offense, was not void for vagueness. To survive a vagueness challenge, the statute had to give a person of ordinary intelligence a reasonable opportunity to know what was prohibited, but a facially vague law was constitutional if prior judicial decisions had provided the necessary fair warning and ascertainable enforcement standards. Prior decisions had held that the part of &sect; 53-21 proscribing the deliberate indifference to, acquiescence in, or creation of situations inimical to the child's moral or physical welfare included photographing a nude or semi-nude child. The behavior was not constitutionally free speech as that constitutional entitlement was not absolute. Because defendants were charged with the part of &sect; 53-21 that prohibited putting a minor in situations inimical to her moral welfare, the child could not give a valid consent and defendants' acts did not have to be sexually explicit to be culpable.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was sued as the owner of the premises upon which the child was injured. However, defendant was transferred ownership of the property, without his knowledge, by his son. The question, thus, before the court was whether defendant was the owner of the property as a matter of law. The court found that under the facts of the case, he was not and granted summary judgment in favor of defendant. The court first noted that generally, it was the possession of land that imposed liability for injuries, rather than the ownership of the land. The possessor was ordinarily the party responsible for the reason that the person in possession was in a position of control and was best able to prevent harm. However, the court noted that Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 19a-111c provided for the removal of lead paint by the &quot;owner&quot; of any dwelling. Such an &quot;owner&quot; was required to abate and manage this dangerous condition consistent with regulations adopted pursuant to the Connecticut statutes. Nevertheless, the court found that defendant was required to accept ownership to be deemed the owner, and acceptance would not be inferred where the deed was not beneficial to him.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the state legislature gave the municipality legislative WPCA to address particularized local concerns under its police power. The proper standards for a delegation of power from the state legislature to a municipality, based on both constitutional analysis and the reality of state and local governmental relations, was that such a delegation should be judged by whether it provided reasonable notice of what conduct may be authorized or prohibited under its provisions.

These exceptions included legislative consent to be sued; action by state officers pursuant to an unconstitutional statute; and action by state officers in excess of their statutory authority. In the light most favorable to the individual, the complaint contained vague allegations of discrimination, threats and a failure to perform statutory duties.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owner had also filed a bankruptcy petition. In his objection, the property owner contended that the motion failed to comply with Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 49-14(a), which was revised to provided that any party to a mortgage foreclosure could file a motion seeking a deficiency judgment at any time within 30 days after the time limited for redemption had expired. The property owner contended that under the revision, based on the use of the word &quot;within,&quot; the statute required a motion seeking a deficiency judgment to be filed at any time before 30 days after the expiration. The court found that the legislative history revealed that the only intent of the revision was to provide a meaningful evidentiary hearing as to the value of property at the time of vesting of title. The court held, therefore, that the filing of the motion for deficiency judgment, when the time limited for redemption had not yet expired, was a fatal defect to the bank's motion as against the property owner. The court further held that the later motion for deficiency judgment filed as to a co-defendant, after the law days expired, was filed far too late to be applicable to the property owner.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee's position was cancelled and he was reclassified at a lower salary. He was later terminated. The court held that it was not barred by Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 4-148(b) from reviewing the constitutionality of the legislature's special act which permitted the employee to present his claim belatedly. That special act did not violate Conn. Const. art. I, &sect; 1. Sovereign immunity was waived due to the Claims Commissioner's authorization of the suit. Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 4-148(a), (c) was preempted by Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 4-148(b) and the special act. Thus, the action was not barred by the one-year statute of limitations. The action was not barred by the doctrine of res judicata, as the prior action for a wrongful reduction in pay was dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. The release under a settlement agreement related only to involuntary termination. The employee could not prevail on his complaint. There was no express or implied contract, as the terms of his employment were purely statutory. The promissory estoppel claim failed because there was no proof that the &quot;agents&quot; were empowered to bind the State by contract and there was no express legislative intent to contract.</SPAN></P>

The licensee appealed the decision pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 4-183. The court dismissed the licensee's appeal. The court determined that the hearing officer had substantial evidence to support his determination that the licensee had refused to be tested. The court found that the police officer testified explicitly that the licensee refused to be tested and that his written report, signed also by another officer, stated the same thing. The court determined that the licensee's claim that the commissioner of motor vehicles' suspension of his license amounted to double jeopardy could not be sustained. The court also concluded that the licensee did not sustain his burden of persuasion with respect to his contention that Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 14-227b violated provisions of the Federal Constitution prohibiting bills of attainder and cruel and unusual punishment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The main point of contention between the parties at the arbitration was the proper method to value the stock at issue. The arbitrator concluded that the proper method to value the stock was the method advocated by defendant, which produced a valuation much higher than the method advocated by the associates. However, unhappiness with this aspect of the award was not an adequate basis upon which the associates could have sought an order vacating the arbitration award, because the arbitrator ordered the purchase of the stock. As to the second contention, the court found that it was clear that it was within the discretion of the arbitrator to find that &quot;gross earnings&quot; was something very different from net profits or net earnings. The court held that it could not have ruled as a matter of law that the definition in Black's Law Dictionary was erroneous. As for the associates' third claim, that the arbitrator failed to rule on a submitted matter, the court determined that the claim was not persuasive. In effect, the arbitrator's ruling rejected any relief sought with regard to the outstanding accounting bill.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After plaintiff was awarded a jury verdict for economic and noneconomic damages in the total amount of $ 7,400,000 in her action against defendants, a husband and a wife, for injuries she sustained as a result of the wife's negligent operation of a motor vehicle, plaintiff filed a motion requesting a computation of prejudgment interest pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 52-192a and Conn. Gen. Prac. Book, R. App. P. &sect; 350.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff requested the prejudgment interest in light of an offer of judgment made by plaintiff on November 25th. In the offer of judgment, plaintiff offered to settle the claim in return for a payment of $ 50,000. Plaintiff offered to stipulate that damages resulting from the wife's negligence were in the amount of $ 5,000,000. Plaintiff further offered to stipulate that the sum of $ 155,179, representing collateral medical benefits, should be deducted from the damages. Defendants objected to the imposition of any prejudgment interest on the ground that the offer of judgment was invalid. Defendants claimed that Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 52-192a and Conn. Gen. Prac. Book, R. App. P. &sect;&sect; 345-350 were unconstitutional. The court held that: (1) plaintiff met the statutory requirements of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 52-192a; (2) the offer of judgment was valid because it was in a form that allowed defendants the opportunity to assess the risks attendant to rejection or acceptance of the offer; (3) the offer could not be interpreted as containing a condition or ambiguous terms; and (4) Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 52-192a and Conn. Gen. Prac. Book, R. App. P. &sect; 350 were not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court ordered that plaintiff was entitled to an adjusted judgment of $ 7,244,820. The court ordered prejudgment interest from the day suit commenced until the date of the court's order in the sum of $ 3,953,886. The court ordered an attorney fee of $ 350. The court ordered judgment for plaintiff against defendants in the sum of $ 11,199,056. The court held postjudgment interest would accrue until the judgment had been paid.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner of the vehicle purchased the vehicle with money he borrowed from the credit union. The police called the bailee to tow the vehicle because it was parked on a sidewalk. While the vehicle was in the custody of the bailee, it was destroyed by arson. The credit union obtained a judgment by default against the owner. The owner did not pay the judgment, and the credit union proceeded with a negligence action against the bailee. The court held that the bailee adequately rebutted the presumption of its negligence by demonstrating that the arson of the vehicle was beyond the control of, and clearly not caused by, the bailee. The court held that the bailee's failure to notify the motor vehicle department within 40 days of the towing and storage of the vehicle under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 14-150(i) was not a proximate cause of the credit union's loss. The court ordered the bailee to pay to the credit union the amount of insurance proceeds received by the bailee that were in excess of the bailee's storage fees, because the proceeds stood in place of the collateral, and the credit union had the right, upon default, to the collateral under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 42a-9-503.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court ordered the bailee to pay over to the credit union the surplus funds the bailee received from insurance proceeds that exceeded the amount of the bailee's storage lien on the vehicle.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A pool and home retail store applied for a revised special permit in order to alter its window structure. The town Planning and Zoning Commission denied the application. The store appealed the denial, alleging that the Commission acted arbitrarily and illegally, abused its discretion, and violated the store's constitutional due process rights. The court noted that when an application for a special permit was considered, the Commission had to consider whether the renovations would be compatible with the particular zoning district under the circumstances then existing. The court noted that the Commission considered the factors enumerated by the local zoning code in making its decision and the reasons given comported with the requirements of the code. Because the court would not substitute its judgment for that of the Commission in its factual decision, the court held that the store did not meet its burden of identifying the adaptability of the store to the proposed use. Finally, the court held that the local zoning code was not unconstitutionally vague and that the Commission acted with impartiality. Accordingly, the court dismissed the store's appeal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parents contended that the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction because the grandparents did not have a common law right to visitation and there was no statutory basis for visitation. The parents were not a party to any dissolution of marriage, legal separation, or annulment action; were not a party to any action involving custody of their children; were not separated from one another; and were not deceased. The court granted the parents' motion to dismiss finding that, although Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 46b-56 and 46b-57 expressly mandated threshold requirements prior to the court assuming jurisdiction over visitation, while Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 46b-59 did not, &sect; 46b-59 was consistent with the rest of Connecticut's statutory scheme in this area only if the threshold jurisdictional requirements of death or de facto separation were found to exist. The court held that because the parents were not in the process of obtaining a divorce, separation or annulment, were both alive, and were not de facto separated, the grandparents could not seek visitation rights with the children pursuant to &sect; 46b-59.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The liquor distributors awarded wholesalers a case return for selling beer. The department determined that the cash return violated Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 30-94, 30-63(b) and assessed a penalty and a fine. The distributors appealed, claiming that the department erred. The court held that its standard of review was limited to whether the facts before the department had mistaken the law, or whether it has reached a conclusion untenable in the light of logic and reason. The court stated that the cash return violated Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 30-94, 30-63(b) because it prohibited a rebate or discounts. The court also determined that the state law did not violate federal antitrust law because the prohibition on giving discounts or rebates did not have an anticompetitive effect.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff alleged that the police violated his constitutional rights during a search and interrogation. Plaintiff was convicted of the charges to which these actions related. In granting defendants' motion for summary judgment in part, the court noted that the sixth count of the complaint related solely to the interrogation. Because the court found that a judgment for plaintiff on this count would implicate the validity of his conviction, a &sect; 1983 claim based on this count did not lie. In denying the motion in part, the court held that some aspects of the search and seizure could be held to have violated plaintiff's Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment rights without invalidating the conviction. Accordingly, plaintiff could proceed on the basis of these allegations. But the court held that plaintiff had not alleged any violation of his Fifth or Sixth amendment rights. The court also rejected defendants' contention that a violation of the Connecticut Constitution could not support an action for money damages.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The issue raised on appeal was whether Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 45a-438b (1991) was retrospective in its application to determinations regarding the distribution of an intestate estate of a child to a father whose paternity was established after the child's death. The court held that the determination of whether a statute was retrospective was a question of legislative intent and that where there was no specific provision to that effect, the question became one of presumed intent. The court further held that a statute affecting substantive rights was to be applied only prospectively unless the legislature clearly and unequivocally expressed its intent that the legislation be applied retrospectively. The court found that &sect; 45a-438b undeniably affected and changed substantive rights and that the rights which were affected had vested. It also found that there was no clear and unequivocal expression of legislative intent in the statute to overcome the heavy presumption that &sect; 45a-438b was to apply prospectively only and thus, the probate court incorrectly applied &sect; 45a-438b retrospectively in determining that a deceased minor's heirs at law were his mother and his putative father.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff landowner brought a three-count revised complaint against defendant town and sanitarian. The challenged complaint arose out of the landowner's inability to construct a dwelling on his land. It recited causes of action based on negligent misrepresentation, fraud, and a violation of 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 alleging an unconstitutional taking without just compensation. The town and the sanitarian moved to strike the three counts.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The town and the sanitarian contended that the first count fell before the defense of statutory and common law immunity for non-willful acts. The ground stated for striking the second count was that the landowner had not alleged a legally sufficient claim for fraud. The ground advanced for striking the third count was that he failed to allege a taking of his property without just compensation and exhaust his remedies available under state law. The court held that as to count one, a Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 52-577n(b)(7) argument was the only ground proffered for striking the claim and refused to grant the motion to strike. As to count two, the landowner failed to plead specific acts of fraud relied; therefore, the motion to strike count two was granted. Because the landowner had not alleged that he had proceeded against the town by way of an inverse condemnation action, his just compensation clause claim was premature. As a plaintiff seeking relief from a taking by way of U.S. Const. amend. V, the landowner was required to first exhaust his state law inverse condemnation remedy before the issue was ripe. Accordingly, the motion to strike count three prevailed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Connecticut Environmental Protection Department issued a permit to defendant waste management company to increase the height of a landfill. Plaintiff town passed a zoning ordinance, which limited the height of the landfill. The company successfully sought relief in an administrative appealed. The town appealed and sought an injunction. The Connecticut Supreme Court reversed and remanded for consideration of the claim for injunctive relief.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The company argued that its actions were based on the advise of counsel, that it could not have anticipated the supreme court's decision, and that its violation of the ordinance was not willful but was in good faith based on the trial court's favorable decision. First, the court granted the injunctive relief, subject to the Department's approval of clean closure. That the trial court ruled in its favor did not immunize the company from complying with the ordinance, which the supreme court found valid. That the company weighed the potential risks by consulting with counsel did not militate a finding of willfulness. Second, the court ordered the company to apply to the Department for a permit to remove all waste in excess of the height limitation. The ordinance and Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 8-12 permitted the town to take action to abate and correct the company's violations. Third, the court fined the company in accordance with &sect; 8-12 from the date the landfill violated the ordinance to the day a temporary injunction stopped further violation. When the company made the decision to continue to utilize the landfill in excess of the limitation, it &quot;took the gamble&quot; and lost.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted the town's request for injunctive relief, subject to approval of the landfill's clean closure, ordered the company to apply for a permit to remove the waste that exceeded the height limitation, and ordered the company to pay statutory fines to the town.</SPAN></P>

A protective order was issued against him with regard to his former wife. He was not informed that he could no longer possess a handgun or that he must surrender any handguns in his possession. After being informed by his former wife that he owned handguns, the city police obtained and executed a search warrant for his residence. Five handguns were found and he was charged with multiple offenses as a result. Defendant filed a motion to dismiss, which the court granted. The court construed &sect; 53a-217c to require the state to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant knew or should have known that he was required to transfer or surrender his handguns within two business days after the issuance of the protective order against him.

The court noted that sovereign immunity did not bar suits against state officials acting in excess of their statutory authority or pursuant to an unconstitutional statute. However, the inmate did not allege that the officials acted in excess of their statutory authority or pursuant to an unconstitutional statute. The court therefore granted the motion in part because it found that the doctrine of sovereign immunity was applicable to the claim for monetary damages. However, the inmate also alleged that the officials were guilty of wanton, reckless, and malicious conduct in their individual capacities. The court held that sovereign immunity did not apply to those claims and further held that the issue of whether the inmate's claims were cognizable under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 could not be addressed on a motion to dismiss.

Gen. Stat. &sect; 20-29.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The chiropractor contended that the board erred in applying the usual civil standard of proof, that is, proof by a fair preponderance of the evidence rather than the clear and convincing evidence standard. He argued that the board acted in violation of constitutional provisions requiring due process in failing to apply the higher standard of proof. The board took the position that it had adopted the hearing procedures of the Uniform Administrative Procedure Act (UAPA), Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 4-166 et seq. The court dismissed the chiropractor's appeal, finding that where the legislature had not imposed a different standard of proof by statute, courts construed the applicable adjudicative standard of proof to be the general civil standard, proof by a fair preponderance of the evidence, absent countervailing constitutional constraints. Further, the court determined that the Connecticut Supreme Court had never held that decisions of professional examining boards undertaken pursuant to UAPA required a standard of proof higher than proof by a preponderance of the evidence. Therefore, the court concluded that the higher standard of proof was not constitutionally required.</SPAN></P>

A hearing officer proposed that the complaint be dismissed, but the Commissioner ordered the operators to pay a civil penalty and concluded that they did not properly declare a quantity of both weight and count on their packaged food products. The operators filed an appeal. In dismissing the appeal, the court found that the operators failed to prove the unconstitutionality of the regulations as they were applied by the Commissioner. The court stated that the operators did not established that they were denied due process because they failed to show that they were denied a fair hearing. The court found that the statute and the regulations did not require the Commissioner to allow any variation between the actual weight of the goods and the weight declared on the label. The court stated that because the food was packaged and sold at the same location and therefore remained in the control and possession of the operators, variations were not allowed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff applicant appealed a decision by defendant Wallingford Inland Wetlands and Watercourses Commission (Connecticut), which denied the applicant a permit to construct a bulky waste disposal facility and recycling facility on a 52 acre parcel of land.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parcel of land was in an industrial zone and consisted of an undeveloped parcel and a parcel with a mobile home trailer park. The application, as modified, sought to fill approximately 3.2 acres of wetlands. The court held that the regulatory taking claim might have been combined with a wetlands appeal. While the court expressed no opinion on the applicant's right to raise its claim of physical invasion in an appropriate action, the court held that the physical invasion claim, in contrast to the regulatory taking claim, was not properly before the court. Such a claim could not be properly joined with an administrative appeal. Equally important, indispensable parties were missing from the proceeding so that a physical invasion claim could not properly be adjudicated. The court determined that the administrative record supported the permit denial. The administrative record did not support a determination of &quot;finality&quot; of the Commission decision. The applicant had failed to show that the agency would not allow any reasonable development of the property and therefore a decision on the merits of his regulatory taking claim was premature.</SPAN></P>

Gen. Stat. &sect; 10-153f(4) was unconstitutional. Plaintiffs, towns and other individuals, intervened. Defendants, the State Commissioner of Education, an arbitration panel, a federation of school administrators and an education association, filed a motion to dismiss the action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The amended revised complaint alleged that the rights of elected officials to vote as they saw fit were violated by Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 10-153f, calling for binding arbitration of labor contract disputes with teachers and administrators, unless elected officials were given veto power over the arbitration award. Plaintiffs claimed that the statute was unconstitutional for violating several provisions of the Connecticut Constitution and U.S. Const. amend. XIV, &sect; 1. Defendants' motion to dismiss claimed a lack of standing. The court held that two of the three questions posed in the action had nonconstitutional elements and that the towns had standing to pursue such questions. The court treated the resident, also a member of a town legislative body, as a town for standing purposes. The other individuals did not have standing because they could not show that they could be distinguished from taxpayers in general. The board of education association had standing because its members would have had standing, the interests sought to be protected were germane to the association's purpose, and neither the claim nor the relief requested required the participation of the individual members.</SPAN></P>

Customers completed a questionnaire, which the individual then faxed to the franchise office. The office then returned a completed document that the individual turned over to his customer. The individual claimed that because he had no input into the questionnaire, he was not practicing law. The court granted the grievance committee's petition, holding that the individual's conduct was in violation of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 51-88. Thus, the court enjoined and restrained the individual from carrying out any further acts as described, which constituted the unauthorized practice of law. Although the individual advertised his office as a non-lawyer legal document center, the court found that he nevertheless held himself out as a person creating legal documents. He was the catalyst that was responsible for the creation of the various instruments and therefore the court concluded he was engaged in the unauthorized practice of law. The court rejected the individual's argument that &sect; 51-88 was unconstitutional and void for vagueness.</SPAN></P>

The court stated that prior to requesting an attorney, defendant voluntarily made incriminating statements against himself; however, defendant subsequently invoked his right to counsel. Thereafter, defendant did not knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily waive that right. Accordingly, any incriminating statements made by defendant after requesting an attorney were unconstitutionally obtained by the police, under Miranda and its progeny and, consequently, had to be suppressed.

The administrator brought the instant action to compel the Commissioner to hold a hearing on the claim that was filed in the decedent's name. The Commissioner argued that the action was barred under the doctrine of sovereign immunity.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff filed a complaint against defendants, state troopers and the State of Connecticut, alleging that the troopers failed to take certain investigatory steps, failed to discover certain evidence, and wrongfully issued an infraction to plaintiff. Defendants moved to dismiss the matter on the grounds that there was no personal jurisdiction over the troopers and that the action against the State was barred by sovereign immunity.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants filed a motion to dismiss based on the allegations of the complaint. The court noted that on the face of the personal jurisdiction issue the troopers would have been entitled to claim there was no jurisdiction over their person because service was defective. However, a police operations manual regarding service of process raised a number of questions that required an evidentiary hearing. The court then analyzed the State's claim to sovereign immunity, and defendants' motion to dismiss was granted. The State could not be sued without its consent and because the State could only act through its officers or agents, a suit against a state trooper was also an action against the State. Nonetheless, sovereign immunity did not bar suits where it was alleged that the acts complained of were unconstitutional. The court found that many of plaintiff's allegations were not clearly related to each other let alone to any recognizable claim of unconstitutional activity by the troopers and therefore the State. At most, there was an allegation of inadequate police investigation. There was not even an explicit claim of a constitutional violation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff contractor filed a complaint against defendant, the State of Connecticut, seeking temporary injunctive relief to compel the State to rescind a termination letter pending arbitration so as to prevent irreparable harm to the contractor. The complaint alleged that the State unconstitutionally and wrongfully terminated a multi-million dollar contract to construct a state office complex. The State filed a motion to dismiss.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State's motion to dismiss was based on the grounds of (1) the prior pending action doctrine; and (2) sovereign immunity. The contractor commenced an arbitration proceeding pursuant Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 4-61(b) after disputes arose concerning the project. The contractor continued to perform under the contract. But without any notice or opportunity to cure, the State terminated the contract by letter referencing a specific contract provision. The contractor was not provided an opportunity to respond or be heard. The contractor alleged that as a result, it was irreparably harmed and that it had no adequate remedy at law pending the determination of its rights in arbitration. The court denied the State's motion to dismiss, reasoning that there was insufficient identity of claims or relief sought to apply the doctrine of prior pending action. The court further concluded that the complaint sufficiently alleged violation of a due process interest to require development of a factual record to determine whether the contractor was entitled to an injunction preserving the status quo until its contractual rights were resolved in the pending arbitration under &sect; 4-61(b).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied the State's motion to dismiss the complaint for injunctive relief.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, the owner of two office buildings and its tenants, sought damages and a permanent injunction to restrain the City of Hartford, Connecticut, from enforcing a regulation denying vehicular access to a named street during a daily three-hour period. The owner and tenants contended that they had lost tenants and rental income and that the value of their properties had been impaired.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner and tenants contended that the regulation was illegal because the deed conveying the land to the City provided for use as a road and for no other purposes, because the regulations were not adopted by ordinance, and because the closing was intended to promote private rather than public interests; that the regulation obstructed the owner's easement; and that it constituted an unconstitutional taking without compensation. The court ruled in favor of the City. It held that the term &quot;road&quot; did not require the street to be open to vehicular traffic at all times; that the regulations were properly adopted under the express authority of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 7-148 C(7)B and Hartford, Ct., City Ordinance ch. V, &sect; 7; and that the restriction of vehicular use fell well within the ambit of &quot;public use.&quot; It further held that the owner and tenants had not proved any substantive interference with their easement or any violation of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 132a-55, since the street had not been discontinued or abandoned. The court also held that the mall did not create an unreasonable restriction upon pedestrian access or delivery services and was a legitimate exercise of the police power.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 46b-59, for visitation with their four-year-old grandchild. Defendant parents objected because they claimed that &sect; 46b-59 was unconstitutional as applied to them in that they were an intact, married couple and were not contemplating divorce of separation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The family services officer testified that the parents' reasons to cut off contact between the child and her grandparents were insubstantial and pretextual. The court found the officer's testimony thoughtful, incisive, and credible and agreed that it clearly would be in the child's best interest to maintain the close and loving relationship she had with her grandparents. The court also found from the evidence that a denial of visitation with the grandparents would be harmful to the child and not in her best interest. Therefore, considering all of the circumstances in weighing the interests of the minor child against the rights of the parents, the court found that the pendente lite visitation order, pursuant to &sect; 46b-59, did not rise to the level of a significant infringement of the parents' right to familial privacy. The court concluded that &sect; 46b-59, as applied to the facts in the case, bore a rational relationship to the legitimate state purpose of protecting the welfare of the minor child by affording her access to her paternal grandparents, who manifested a deep concern for her growth and development and had a special interest in the child's well being.</SPAN></P>

The complaint alleged that defendants breached fiduciary duties owed the tribe, as well as violating the tribe's constitutional rights. Defendants, pursuant to Conn. Gen. Prac. Book, R.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The tribe filed a complaint alleging that defendants violated their fiduciary duty to the tribe and that the State encroached upon or transferred tribal land. The tribe contended that defendants' actions or omission constituted takings in violation of U.S. Const. amend. XIV. The court ordered certain revisions and denied others. The court held that where a pleading did not fully disclose the grounds relied thereon, the rules of practice allowed defendants to move the court to order a more complete statement of the claim raised in a pleading pursuant to Conn. Gen. Prac. Book, R. App. P. &sect;&sect; 108 and 147. The court granted defendants request to separate allegations of the first count of the tribe's complaint because it appeared to the court that each land site, involved a separate transaction, or series of transactions pertaining to the particular land site, and therefore, a separate cause of action with respect to each alleged property. A number of the requests to revise asked that the tribe plead the complete legal description of the alleged reservation property.

The court held that the landowner had the burden of proving that the Commission agency acted arbitrarily, illegally, or that the decision was not reasonably supported by the evidence. The court held that the landowner was not entitled to judicial review of the merits of his takings claim because the landowner did not submit alternative applications to the Commission, exploring every reasonable option for developing the property. The court also determined that the Commission complied with Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 22a-42a(d) by stating its reasons for the denial in the record. Finally, the court concluded that the Commission's consideration of open space concerns did not invalidate the Commission's denial of the landowner's application, and the evidence supported the Commission's finding that the wetlands would be damaged by the development.</SPAN></P>

Defendants moved to dismiss the entire action on the grounds of judicial immunity, absolute legislative immunity, and sovereign immunity. The court held that (1) the doctrine of judicial immunity did protect each defendant from the claims for damages, punitive damages, costs, and attorney's fees because all defendants engaged in judicial acts or were part of the judicial process when they made state bar admissions decisions, and that (2) the claims for damages were barred by the doctrine of sovereign immunity for the alleged constitutional violations, but Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 17a-550 constituted a waiver by the legislature of sovereign immunity as to claims that were made under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 17a-549.

The partnership sought approval to reconfigure a proposed apartment complex to include elderly units. The commission ultimately approved of the site plan, and the apartment owner appealed. The court dismissed the appeal. Specifically, the court held that what the partnership submitted to the commission was a new site plan where the plan as presented, although requiring a valid variance, complied with all current zoning regulations. Furthermore, the court found that because the apartment owner was not affected by the fact that the notice of the variance recorded in the land records did not specifically mention certain zoning regulations, as required by Meriden, Conn. Zoning Regs. &sect; 8-3d. He lacked standing to challenge the sufficiency of the recording. Finally, the court held that when the city had not, in its zoning regulations, distinguished between condominiums and apartments, there was no reason to find a limitation in the variance regarding apartments which was not contained in the regulation itself.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff law firm sought a multimillion dollar judgment against defendant corporation and defendant controlling shareholder, on grounds that defendants had reneged on a promise to compensate plaintiff for legal work involving a construction project.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff law firm sued defendant corporation and defendant controlling shareholder, claiming that defendants had reneged on a promise to compensate plaintiff for legal work involving a construction project. Plaintiff sued defendant on seven different theories, allegedly breach of contract, failure to pay on a promissory note, quantum meruit, promissory estoppel, breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing, fraudulent conveyance, and violation of the state's unfair trade statute. Defendant counterclaimed, asserting that plaintiff had breached the parties' contract, breached its duty of good faith and fair dealing, and unlawfully retained its legal files. Plaintiff prevailed on all its claims, and defendant failed on all of its, the court resting its judgment on credibility determinations. Plaintiff therefore garnered a multimillion dollar damages award, plus legal fees and interest. Notably, defendant shareholder was also held personally liable, the corporate veil being deemed pierced.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment was entered for plaintiff on its claims, and a multimillion dollar judgment entered in its favor. Defendant's counterclaims were rejected, and defendant was also ordered to pay attorney fees for the instant litigation plus judgment interest.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The defendants' first and second special defenses claimed that under Conn. Gen. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 52-584, 52-577 the plaintiffs' action was time barred. The court granted the plaintiffs' motion because Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 52-577d permitted filing the action within 17 years from the date of the minor's reaching the age of majority and the minor was still under 17. Further the scope of &sect; 52-577d permitted filing that action against the defendants and not just the perpetrators of the abuse. The court granted the motion on the third defense that raised Conn. Gen. Stat. Ann. &sect; 52-557n because its limitation of liability was excepted under &sect; 52-577 for an injury to a child being transported to school. The fourth special defense of governmental immunity was rejected because &sect; 52-577 abrogated that immunity. But the sovereign immunity defense was granted because the defendants were acting under state mandate pursuant to Conn. Agencies Regs. &sect; 10-76d-19 and as state agents they were immune. The defendants' laches defense was rejected for failure to properly plead the claim. The final defense was also rejected because the defendants had a special duty of care to protect the minor.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted the plaintiffs' motion to strike the defendants' special defenses of statute of limitations, governmental immunity, laches, and lack of a duty of care.

The defenses asserted by the director and the driver included claims that the student's action was barred by certain limitations periods, by governmental immunity and sovereign immunity, by the doctrine of laches, and by a superseding cause. On appeal, the court held that (1) the student's claim was timely and his motion to strike was granted with respect to the statute of limitations special defenses because they were not applicable to the action; (2) the special defense of governmental immunity was unavailable; (3) the laches special defense was insufficiently and inappropriately pleaded; and (4) the superseding cause special defense was inapplicable because the director and the driver had a duty to protect the student from harm.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The school board ascribed to a &quot;profanity rule,&quot; which the teacher violated.

The teacher claimed that the school board terminated her employment because of her free speech activities. The school sought summary judgment on the ground that the teacher did not exhaust her administrative remedies as required by Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 10-151. However, the teacher was not contesting her termination. The court held that because the teacher was seeking to recover for alleged violations of her first amendment rights pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 31-51q, the exhaustion doctrine did not apply. The court also held that there was a genuine issue of material fact regarding whether the teacher's activities &quot;substantially or materially&quot; interfered with her job performance or with the working relationship between the teacher and the school board, a key component in determining whether the school board may be exempt from liability pursuant to Conn.

The court held that this comported with the literal requirement of &sect; 14-295, so there was no need to allege recklessness or that the violation of the listed statute constituted recklessness.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The zoning board granted the corporation's application for a change in the zoning regulations pertaining to certain premises for the purpose of constructing a two-story addition to a building. The property owners, whose family home was adjacent to the premises, appealed the decision. The property owners obtained an ex parte temporary restraining order enjoining further construction. The court considered the probable outcome of the litigation and whether an irreparable loss would result unless the status quo was preserved. The court found that the issuance of the injunction was not warranted because the property owners did not satisfy their burden of showing probable success on the merits. Under the balancing of the equities test, the damage to the corporation from a delay in construction and in occupying the subject premises outweighed any benefits to the property owners from the continued prohibition of continuing construction. The court concluded that the issuance of the injunction was contraindicated, and the status quo should be maintained until a full hearing was held. The court vacated the temporary restraining order and ruled that the corporation could proceed.</SPAN></P>

The court observed that the term &quot;payment&quot; in &sect; 52-352b was used to refer to monies actually paid to and received by a judgment debtor from the statutorily exempt enumerated sources, not monies derived from nonexempt sources not yet paid for exempt purposes. The court held that there was no statutory exemption listed for monies from a nonexempt source merely earmarked by the judgment debtor to pay child support payments or alimony.

The court found that although the attorney had advanced a panoply of reasons why it should enjoin the committee from proceeding, the lionshare of his claims did not fall within the ambit of the narrow exceptions that had been grudgingly carved out of the exhaustion of remedies doctrine. The court held that the efficient operation of the judicial system, which depended upon the policy against piecemeal litigation inherent in the final judgment rule, strongly militated in favor of requiring the attorney to exhaust remedy under the grievance procedures.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner statewide grievance committee sought to restrain respondent paralegal from engaging in the unlawful practice of law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The committee sought to restrain a paralegal from practicing law. The paralegal filed a counterclaim and 12 special defenses. The court held that the paralegal's counterclaims should have been stricken. While the claims purported to allege defenses to the complaint, they did not allege facts, which established a cause of action against the committee. The court held that the statute forbidding the unauthorized practice of law was sufficiently definite to withstand constitutional scrutiny. The court also found that the paralegal did not have a right to a trial by jury under the constitution of Connecticut because the unauthorized practice of law action was equitable. The court rejected the paralegal's argument that he had been denied equal protection of the law because paralegals supervised by attorneys were able to perform the same services as provided without being subject to the unauthorized practice of law. The court found that the distinction between supervised and unsupervised paralegals was a valid one and was rationally related to a legitimate state interest and therefore not in violation of the paralegal's right to equal protection of the law.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted the committee's request to restrain the paralegal from engaging in the unlawful practice of law.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The union and the commission were parties to a collective bargaining agreement, which provided for the arbitration of disputes with respect to its interpretation and application. The union alleged that the commission violated the agreement when it failed to pay double time to employees who met the requirements of the agreement. The arbitrator determined that the commission violated the agreement when it failed to pay double time to employees and that the employees were to be paid the difference between the time and one half pay which they received and the double time pay which they should have received. The commission filed an application to vacate the award and alleged that the arbitrator exceeded his authority by modifying the terms of the agreement. The union filed a counter-application, seeking confirmation of the award. The court held that the award conformed with the submission and denied the commission's application and granted the union's counter application. The court noted that the arbitrator's decision directly answered the question of whether a particular provision of the agreement was violated by the commission's failure to pay certain wages.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant harassed police officers by letters and post cards. The state brought an action and defendant filed a motion to dismiss, arguing that Conn. Gen.

The court denied defendant's motion to dismiss, holding that the statutes were valid and constitutional in their application to defendant's conduct as they proscribed his course of intentional criminal conduct, rather than the content of any of his communications. Defendant's behavior simply failed to rise to the level of speech protected by the first amendment. Defendant's overbreadth challenge was without merit as he failed to show beyond a reasonable doubt that &sect; 53a-183(a)(2) substantially swept into an area protected by the First Amendment. Because defendant's conduct struck at the core of the activity prohibited by Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-183(a)(2), he was not permitted to raise a facial vagueness challenge to the statute. He failed to meet the heavy burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that &sect; 53a-183(a)(2) was unconstitutional in all of its applications.</SPAN></P>

The design engineer contended that the complaint against him was barred by Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 31-293(c). Plaintiffs alleged that &sect; 31-293(c) did not apply because the design engineer not only designed the town's new facility, but oversaw its construction. They further alleged that the building and premises were controlled, possessed, managed and maintained by the design engineer. The court held that &sect; 31-293(c) was applicable because the services provided by the design engineer fell within the ambit of professional services provided by architects and engineers. The court also held that &sect; 31-293(c) did not violate the worker's fundamental rights because he had not fundament nor a constitutional right to bring a common law negligence action. Furthermore, under a rational basis analysis, the court found that &sect; 31-293(c) was not unconstitutional because the specific grant of immunity to design professionals was rational in the construction industry where the entire responsibility for safety was placed on the contractor.</SPAN></P>

The commission denied the application. The property owner contended that the commission's decision was erroneous because the project did not negatively affect any statutory or regulatory factors which the commission was to consider, there was no substantial evidence to support the denial, and the denial constituted a taking of property. The court held that the commission's stated reasons that the project would negatively impact the wetlands and the floodplain were supported by the record. The court found that both reasons were legitimate. The court found that the commission's third reason, the impact on safety to surrounding neighbors, was not supported by substantial evidence to legitimize its denial. The court found that the commission's denial of the property owner's application did not constitute an unconstitutional taking.

In addition, the corporation contended that if penal statutes were ambiguous, they must be strictly construed against punishment and that &sect; 21-438 was unconstitutional. The court found that the DEP had authority to assert the second prayer for relief seeking a fine and denied the motion to strike as to the first, third, fourth, fifth, seventh, eighth, and ninth counts.

The landowners made an application to the planning and zoning commission for the subdivision of their undeveloped land into approved building lots. The application provided for the extension of a street, an already existing temporary cul-de-sac. The planning and zoning commission unanimously approved the application. Subsequently, the planning and zoning commission voted to deny the application based on the concern by some members over the length of the proposed extension of the existing cul-de-sac. The landowners appealed the decision. The lower court dismissed the appeal. The landowners then filed a 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 action against the City and planning and zoning commission. The City and the planning and zoning commission filed a motion for summary judgment. On appeal, the court granted the summary judgment.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The tenants agreed not to permit any illegal drug activity to be conducted on the premises. There was a drug offense arrest. The arrest resulted in a prosecution. After the prosecution had been terminated, the landlord filed a summary process action to evict the tenants. They sought to exclude the evidence from the proceedings, based on the exclusionary rule. The court determined that it did not need to reach the greater issue of whether the exclusionary rule applied to all civil actions. Instead, the court decided that, under the particular facts of the case, the exclusionary rule did not prevent illegally seized evidence from being admitted. The court balanced the interests of the parties with that of the police officers. The court noted that the police department had no further interest in the criminal prosecution of this particular matter and that the landlord, on the other hand, had a great deal of interest in seeing that drug possession and drug trafficking ceased in the tenants' complex. The court noted that the tenants also had an interest in enforcing the terms and conditions of the lease.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant filed a motion to dismiss the charge against him for allegedly violating Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 14-227a(a) for operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor (DUI). Defendant also filed a motion to suppress the results of a stop under Conn. Gen. Prac. Book, R. Super. Ct. &sect;&sect; 820, 821, arguing that the stop at a DUI spot check and the arrest violated the U.S. Const. amend. IV and the Conn. Const. art. I, &sect; 7.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The police officers acquired the advance approval to operate a DUI spot check. An Administration and Operations Manual (A&amp;O) and the Operational Plan for Spot Check, along with the state and federal constitutions, were supposed to guide the conduct of the officers at the checkpoint. Defendant was stopped at the checkpoint. Tests revealed an alcohol concentration above the &quot;legal limit.&quot; At the motion hearing, the court found that there was no compliance with the notice requirements of the A&amp;O and plan. The State failed to offer evidence that mandatory prior media publication of the checkpoint ever occurred. The police also failed to ask the same questions to each checkpoint motorist as required. The conduct at the checkpoint violated defendant's constitutional right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures. The State failed to satisfy its burden of proof of sustaining, and failed to satisfy a three-prong balancing test in upholding, the constitutionality of the checkpoint. The police severely failed to follow or even &quot;substantially comply&quot; with its guidelines. The State's subjective intrusion on defendant's liberty interest was substantial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Considering the totality of the circumstances in applying the three-prong test, the court granted defendant's motion to suppress the results of the illegal stop, including the trooper's observations of defendant and the subsequent evidentiary breath sample garnered, as fruit of the poisonous tree. The court declined to decide the motion to dismiss.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 42-110m. The company filed a motion to strike and asserted that &sect; 14-153b was unconstitutional and void for vagueness. The court denied the motion because it found that the company's contentions were not sufficient to meet its heavy burden of proving that &sect; 14-153b was unconstitutional. The court noted that the statute prohibited the company from making a credit card the key to the rental of a passenger motor vehicle and required that the company look at other security; namely, suitable identification and cash. The court held that the company's policy of requiring cash customers to endure a 30 day waiting period clearly denied cash customers the ability to rent motor vehicles. The court held that &sect; 14-153b was not unconstitutionally vague because it sufficiently notified a person of ordinary intelligence of the prohibition and the alternative means of security.</SPAN></P>

The taxpayer sought relief with respect to the amount of the delinquent taxes, the interest thereon, and the penalty that the department included in the assessment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer failed to pay use tax on in state and out of state purchases and was assessed a penalty and interest in addition to the tax owed. The court held that while there was no basis for reducing the amount of the taxes imposed or the interest thereon, equitable considerations required elimination of the statutory penalty that the Department imposed. The failure to pay in-state use tax was in reasonable reliance on the advice of his accountant and there had been a recent change in the law allowing the assessment of that tax. The fact that the taxpayer failed to pay the use tax on out of state purchases despite the accountant's advice to do so did not require the application of the unclean hands principle. There was no merit to the taxpayer's claim for an abatement of any portion of the use taxes due on in-state purchases because if the taxpayer had received the correct advice he still would have been obligated to pay the full amount of the tax. The legislature, by enacting Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 12-33a, had removed the court's authority to abate statutory interest. Section 12-33a applied retroactively because the appeal was pending as of the statute's effective date.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court sustained the taxpayer's appeal of the claim for abatement of the penalty imposed by the Department with respect to the use tax deficiency on the in-state purchases and denied the other claims for relief.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The commissioner ordered the suspension of plaintiff's license because he determined that plaintiff failed a chemical alcohol test administered pursuant to Conn.

Plaintiff contended that the officer's failure to check the Miranda box when he was arrested rendered the form inadmissible at the hearing and, alternatively, that the hearing officer erred in finding that plaintiff was appraised of his constitutional rights. The court held that the factual issue of whether plaintiff was appraised of his rights was not to be addressed in his suspension hearing. The police officer was not required to indicate that plaintiff was informed of his constitutional rights. The court also found that the officer's failure to check the Miranda box would not render the report inadmissible in the suspension hearing. Plaintiff 's argument that he was deprived of an impartial hearing officer was overruled because he did not meet the requisite burden of proof.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate contended that he had a statutory right to automatically receive good conduct credits, and that the commissioner violated that right by automatically denying the inmate the ability to earn good time credits any time in the future. The court rejected this contention, holding that the inmate could not get automatic good time credits unless he had earned the reduction by obeying the rules. However, the court concluded that prison officials improperly classified the inmate as a Security Risk Group Safety Threat Members (SRGSTM), without first having given the inmate written notice that he was designated as SRG. The court reasoned that the inmate was entitled to a written statement of the evidence and the reasons for a SRGTM designation, a hearing, and the opportunity to have been heard. Therefore, the court held that the directive, which applied to the inmate while he was serving time, was unconstitutional because automatic designation did not provide him with minimal due process. The court held that because the inmate forfeited prospective good time credits without the requisite hearing, the commissioner was required to recalculate the inmate's good time credits.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court initially observed that, because sovereign immunity implicated subject matter jurisdiction, the special public defender properly raised the issue by a motion to dismiss. In Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 4-141 and 4-165, the legislature clarified the class of persons intended to be protected by sovereign immunity by specifically including special public defenders. The court dismissed the client's concern about the fact that the special public defender had served pursuant to a contract with the Public Defender Services Commission, which rendered doubtful in the client's mind the defender's status as a state employee. The court observed that it was more than the defender's contract with the Commission that empowered him to act as a special public defender. As with any public defender, assistant public defender, or a deputy assistant public defender, the special assistant public defender was authorized to act on behalf of a client only when appointed to do so by a judge of the superior court.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state sued a paid solicitor that worked for charitable organizations for violations of several subsections of Conn.

The solicitor moved to strike the counts of the complaint that alleged violations of the Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act, Conn. Gen.

The court denied the motion to dismiss and held that the paid solicitor was not a charitable organization and CUTPA did apply. The court further held that the solicitor engaged in trade and commerce as defined by the statute. The court also held that the statute was not unconstitutional as vague or overbroad as the disputed terms &quot;unfair&quot; and &quot;deceptive&quot; were defined by the court and the statute was highly specific in what it required. The court further held that the solicitor could not challenge a statute for vagueness when its conduct was clearly proscribed by the statute.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, two individuals, sued defendants, the state, its transportation department, and the commissioner of its transportation department, alleging that defendants caused damage to plaintiffs' properties by the improper discharge of storm water. Defendants moved to dismiss eight of the nine counts of the complaint, to dismiss any claim in excess of $ 15,000 under the remaining count, and to dismiss one individual's claims.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">One individual complied with the notice provisions of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 4-147 and received permission to sue the state. There was no evidence that the other individual was granted permission to sue the state. The complaint claimed damages under differing legal theories, including trespass, private nuisance, negligence, and breach of contract. Defendants sought to limit plaintiffs' recovery to a negligence theory. The court granted defendants' motion to dismiss the one individual's claims because he had not been granted permission to sue. It also granted defendants' motion to dismiss any claim in excess of $ 15,000 because plaintiff submitted no evidence that he sought permission to sue for any additional damage occurring after he filed the claim for $ 15,000. It dismissed plaintiff's breach of contract claim because he admitted that he had not brought this claim before the claims commissioner. However, the court denied defendants' motion to limit plaintiffs' recovery to negligence. Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 4-147 did not require the claimant to state the legal theories upon which his claim was based, only a concise statement of the factual basis of the claim and plaintiff had done this.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted defendants' motion to dismiss against all counts pleaded by the individual who had not received permission to sue the state and granted defendants' motion to dismiss the breach of contract claim.

The General Assembly passed 1991 Conn. Acts 8 (Spec. Sess.), which contained a finding that plaintiff had failed to file a timely notice of claim against the State because of the misrepresentation, and which, per Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 4-148(b), authorized plaintiff to sue the State, notwithstanding the expiration of the statute of limitations. In denying the motion to dismiss, the court declined to address the constitutionality of &sect; 4-148(b) because Special Act 91-8 and the allegations in plaintiff's complaint constituted sufficient facts to withstand the constitutional attack. In particular, the court noted that the finding and allegations that plaintiff had been misled constituted a sufficient public interest to validate Special Act 91-8 and avoid the prohibition in Conn. Const. art. I, &sect; 1, against exclusive public emoluments or privileges from the community.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Inmate challenged the practice of the Department of Corrections (Department) of monitoring inmate phone calls and mail and sought injunctive and declaratory relief. The court held that the practice did not violate Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 54-4la et seq. (&quot;the wiretapping statute&quot;), or Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-187 et seq. (&quot;the eavesdropping statute&quot;), because adequate warning was given. The procedure was not an unreasonable search and seizure in violation of Conn. Const. Art. First, &sect; 7. The inmate's right to privacy was counterbalanced by the institution's right to maintain order. The Department's rules and practices regarding attorney-inmate conversations were held to violate Conn.

Telephone monitoring did not force any inmate to disclose his HIV positive status and thereby violate Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 19a-581 et seq.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant moved to dismiss an information that charges him with operating while under the influence. Defendant argued that the sanctions that could be imposed by the administrative &quot;per se&quot; license suspension provisions, were a &quot;punishment,&quot; and because he had previously been exposed to that jeopardy, he can not again be exposed to a second jeopardy in the criminal proceedings brought under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 14-227a.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Department of Motor Vehicles of the State of Connecticut held a hearing to determine whether defendant's operator's license should be suspended because defendant failed a chemical alcohol test. The hearing officer found that she was unable to relate failure of the test to operation. No sanction was imposed. Thereafter, criminal proceedings were set for trial that arose from the same driving incident. Defendant's motion to dismiss implicitly urged the court to a) find that the administrative hearing was a separate proceeding within the contemplation of the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution; b) determine that the sanction to be imposed was punitive not remedial; and c) rule that, in Connecticut, a Department of Motor Vehicle hearing could act as a bar to subsequent criminal proceedings. The court was unprepared to make such determinations on the facts of the case. The common denominator in all of the cases raised by defendant was actual prior punishment. None of the cases approached the issue of whether double jeopardy protection attaches to a civil proceeding where no actual punishment occurred.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, the spouse of a decedent and the co-executors of the estate, commenced an action for wrongful death and for loss of consortium against defendants, a bus company and a bus driver. Defendants filed a motion to dismiss the suit on the ground of lack of subject matter jurisdiction because the action was brought outside the statute of limitations. Plaintiffs argued that Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 52-555 violated their constitutional rights.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court determined that the argument was without merit that &sect; 52-555 violated the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution and Conn. Const. art. first, &sect;&sect; 1, 8, 10, 14, 19 and 20. The state high court had addressed the constitutionality of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 52-555, and had held that it did not violate Conn. Const. art. first, &sect; 10 because the repose period did not abrogate common law or statutory rights of action that existed when the constitutional provision was first adopted. The high court had also pointed out that it could not seriously be argued that a statutory entitlement to sue for wrongful death of another was itself a fundamental or constitutional right. Because the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the wrongful death claim, the claim of the right to a jury trial was unavailing. Conn. Const. art. first, &sect; 8 did not apply because it related to the rights of an accused in a criminal prosecution. An antemortem loss of consortium claim was barred as collateral to the wrongful death claim. Alternatively, if the count was a postmortem loss of consortium claim, it was untimely under the provisions of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 52-555c(a).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The motion to dismiss was granted, and the action was dismissed in its entirety.</SPAN></P>

Gen. Stat. &sect; 7-284, which required payment of fees to police officers for protection by operators of amusements. Defendants sought summary judgment on a counterclaim for funds that they claimed were due them for police protection at a concert run by plaintiff.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff advertised a concert and defendants provided a police presence for which they sought to charge plaintiff. Plaintiff sued, claiming that Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 7-284 was unconstitutional under both the state and federal constitutions. Defendants filed a counterclaim for the funds that they claimed were due for police services. Both parties filed motions for summary judgment. The court found in favor of plaintiff. The statute, as applied to concerts and other events involving protected speech, violated the First Amendment. In invoking &sect; 7-284, defendants based their decision on the direct impact of speech and the listeners' reactions to speech. Speech rights were heightened in a private forum, and the statute imposed an indeterminable fee for the exercise of such rights. The court held that free speech rights could not hinge upon a person's financial ability to pay for those rights. There was no question that safety issues addressed by &sect; 7-284 served a compelling state interest, but the statute was not drawn narrowly enough to meet such end.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted plaintiff's motion for summary judgment and denied defendants' cross-motion for summary judgment, finding that the statute requiring a business operator to pay for police protection during certain amusements was an unconstitutional infringement on freedom of speech.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A reporter for a newspaper was terminated after she had written an article that cast another newspaper in a bad light. The reporter filed a wrongful termination action, alleging that the newspaper falsely claimed in another front page article that the reporter's story had been inaccurate and that she had violated the most elemental rules of journalism. The newspaper filed a motion to strike, contending that the reporter failed to state a legally sufficient claim upon which relief could be granted. The court granted the newspaper's motion, holding that the reporter's complaint sounded in defamation, and thus the law of defamation, not the law of wrongful discharge, provided the appropriate judicial remedy. The fact that an employer acted arbitrarily, capriciously, or unfairly was irrelevant to a wrongful discharge claim; an important violation of public policy had to be shown. The reporter did not have a right to publish the article in question in the privately owned newspaper; thus, her free speech rights were not violated.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The reporter was an editor and reporter for a newspaper. Another reporter for the newspaper was terminated after writing an article and an editor resigned in protest. The reporter, subsequently, resigned because the principals of the newspaper refused to allow her to print letters to the editor regarding the firing of the other reporter. The reporter filed a complaint alleging wrongful discharge, contending that the aforementioned events amounted to constructive discharge. The newspaper filed a motion to strike the complaint as legally insufficient to state a claim. The court granted the motion to strike, holding that an action based on wrongful discharge required a scenario where a claimant was effectively forced out of their employment due to some violation of public policy. The only possible violation that was asserted by the reporter was defamation as to the reporter who was fired. The reporter had no right to control the newspaper's content, because the newspaper was privately owned; thus no First Amendment implications were involved.

In the police officer's report it was noted that the driver claimed that he suffered from a seizure disorder and was taking medication for the disorder. The police officer arrested the driver for operating his vehicle under the influence. The commissioner of motor vehicles, administratively, suspended the driver's operator's license.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parents filed a motion to dismiss the grandparents' complaint seeking visitation pendente lite.

The grandparents opposed the motion to dismiss under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 46b-59, contending that they had standing.

The court held that therefore the grandparents could maintain an action for visitation. The court further noted that grandparental rights had been recognized and that the legislative determination to allow visitation to grandparents and others with special interests in the child's well being significantly contributed to the best interests of the child and safeguarded the reciprocal rights of parents and children.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff Commissioner of Environmental Protection (Connecticut) filed a 14-count complaint against defendant company, alleging violations of the company's permit and Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 22a, governing water pollution, to which the company responded with its answer and four special defenses. The Commissioner filed a motion to strike the special defenses.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The company asserted as special defenses, based on delays in processing its permit modification, that the Commissioner was guilty of laches, that it was denied due process, that it was denied equal protection, and that the Commissioner was estopped from seeking civil penalties. The Commissioner argued that the defenses were not applicable to the government generally or to the specific action and no constitutional rights were violated. In granting the Commissioner's motion to strike in part, the court ruled that where the State was acting in its governmental capacity to enforce environmental laws, the defense of laches was unavailable. The court also ruled that delays in approving the application for permit modification did not deny due process, because approval was discretionary and no &quot;clear entitlement&quot; to approval was shown, and did not deny equal protection or the right to pursue a lawful business or amount to a governmental &quot;taking.&quot; However, the court held that estoppel was available as a special defense because inaction in approving the company's improvements to its treatment process could make civil penalties inequitable or oppressive, or mitigate them.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted the Commissioner's motion to strike as to three of the company's special defenses but denied the motion as to the special defense of estoppel.</SPAN></P>
