</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners, candidates for municipal court judge, filed nomination documents and paid fees to become candidates in the primary election for two positions that were vacated when the incumbents retired.

Petitioners sought a writ of mandate to compel respondent to save, count, report, and certify the results of the primary election. The court held that &sect; 71180, was not unconstitutional on its face because it did not violate the constitution to treat superior and municipal courts differently. The court held that &sect; 71180, was not unconstitutional as applied because the constitution did not require election by majority vote. The court noted that Cal. Elec.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant taxpayers challenged a decision of the Superior Court of the City and County of San Francisco (California), which entered summary judgment in favor of respondents, the franchise tax board, the state, and the state controller.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant taxpayers challenged the withholding of their state income tax refunds by respondents, franchise tax board (FTB), the state, and state controller, pursuant to Cal. Gov't Code &sect; 12419.5. Appellants' refunds were offset due to student loan default, failure to make child support payments, and due to the failure of a spouse to make child support payments pursuant to a child support judgment, respectively. Appellants sought summary judgment, but the trial court found for respondents, ruling that the income tax refund intercept program adequately protected the due process rights of appellants under the California and United States Constitutions. Appellants contended that the implementation of the tax intercept program lacked procedural safeguards, such as notice and the right to be heard, among others. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment, finding that the intercept program as applied to child support obligation debts did not violate appellants' due process rights. The court, however, held that for non-child support debts, due process required that taxpayers be provided with notice and the opportunity for review of his or her objection to an offset.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants challenged the judgment of the Superior Court of Los Angeles County (California), which denied their petitions for relief under the Tort Claims Act, Cal.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants were prosecuted for child molestation. The criminal charges were dismissed and appellants filed claims with respondent county alleging injury arising from the prosecution. The trial court dismissed the parts of the claims that fell outside the 100 day time frame under Cal. Gov't Code &sect; 945.4, which governed suits for money damages against respondent. Appellants challenged the judgment of the trial court. The court found that &sect; 945.4 as amended was constitutional because the government had a legitimate interest in getting notice of potential civil claims in a timely manner. The court further found that appellants' claims were partially barred because the fact that a criminal defendant contested their prosecution did not give respondent knowledge of their claims and the related circumstances. The court found that appellants were required to substantially comply with the requirements of &sect; 945.4, and their failure to do so without presenting competent evidence of any excuse for the failure to timely file the claim barred the action.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant prison officials sought review of a decision of the Superior Court of the City and County of San Francisco, (California) which granted respondent inmate's petition for a writ of habeas corpus.

On appeal, the court reversed, finding that the trial court erred in concluding that appellants' actions were arbitrary and capricious. The court noted that the question presented was whether this internal classification was properly imposed based upon the rape charge, which were found true by a jury but was subsequently dismissed. The court concluded that because the record included more than a modicum of evidence establishing that the classification decision had some basis in fact, appellants' actions should have been sustained according to the &quot;some evidence&quot; standard.</SPAN></P>

The court of appeal reversed the trial court's orders because appellant was convicted of violating an unconstitutionally vague municipal code section. It was a basic principle of due process that an enactment was void for vagueness if its prohibitions were not clearly defined. Further, even a clear and precise enactment could nevertheless be overbroad if in its reach it prohibited constitutionally protected conduct. The court could attempt to preserve an enactment's constitutionality by a reasonable narrowing construction, but if elimination of objectionable parts of a statute required a wholesale rewriting, a court's attempt to do so transgressed both the legislative intent and the judicial function. Judicial construction could not avoid the unconstitutional vagueness in the combination of San Jose, Cal., Municipal Code &sect; 10.20.140, subsection (c) and subsection (d)(5), which exempted from the status of trespassers those who were on another's premises under claim or color of legal right.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant ordinance proponent supported an initiative ordinance that limited the ability of respondent city and school district to lease and sell property. Respondents filed a petition for writ of mandate directing the registrar to remove the proposition from the ballot as being beyond the scope of the initiative power of the people. The trial court accepted respondents' argument and ordered the peremptory writ. Appellant contended that the trial court erred in conducting a pre-election review of the validity of the proposed ordinance because an initiative measure may be deleted only where there is clear invalidity. The court rejected this claim and found that pre-election review was appropriate because the electorate did not have the power to adopt the proposal. The court held that the ordinance could not be applied to respondent school district because it was preempted by the education code and was beyond the power of the people to enact. It found that any restriction on the board of supervisor's charter-based authority to sell or lease city property must be accomplished by charter amendment and not by initiative ordinance.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff students filed a lawsuit which challenged defendant state university's collection and use of a mandatory student activities fee to fund certain activities of a student body organization. The trial court granted a partial summary adjudication in favor of defendant state university, finding that the mandatory student activities fee was constitutional. Furthermore, the trial court determined that the use of the fees was not invalid. Plaintiffs appealed. On review, the court found that defendant state university was a constitutional entity whose powers derived from the state constitution and not from the legislature. Thus, it had the authority to assess a mandatory student activities fee as a condition of enrollment. Furthermore, plaintiffs could be compelled to provide financial support to the student organization because plaintiffs were not obliged to associate with anyone; they were merely required to pay the activities fees. Therefore, the court found that the compelled financial support of the student organization and its funded activities was constitutionally permissible. The trial court's judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant citizens sought to have certain material included in voter's pamphlets, but the lower court ordered deletion of the material. On appeal, appellants claimed that the statutes that provided the authority for the deletion of the material, Cal. Elec. Code &sect;&sect; 3795, 5025, violated U.S. Const. amend. I. The challenged statutes, which were referenced in the city charter, authorized review and amendment or deletion of material for voter's pamphlets that was false, misleading, or inconsistent with the requirements of the statutes. The reviewing court found that the challenged restrictions were constitutional, reasoning that the restrictions were content-neutral and carefully tailored to promote the purpose of providing the voters information concerning the measures on the ballot. Moreover, the challenged provisions neither limited nor curtailed the ability of individuals or groups to assemble, speak, distribute literature, or lobby public opinion. Nor did the city's charter that authorized the pamphlets require inclusion of all arguments in the pamphlets. The court concluded that the restrictions had been applied properly and affirmed the judgments.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant patient and wife sought review of the judgment of the Superior Court of Los Angeles County (California) in a medical malpractice action against respondent hospital and doctors and appellant doctor. The trial court reduced appellant patient and wife's total collective award of noneconomic damages to $ 250,000. Appellant doctor sought review of the trial court's apportionment order. The appeals were consolidated.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant patient's medical malpractice action arose from the removal of appellant patient's healthy left kidney rather than his cancerous right kidney. Appellant wife joined her loss of consortium cause of action with her husband's medical malpractice cause of action. Appellant patient and wife argued that the trial court committed reversible error in excluding expert testimony that appellant doctor's conduct constituted a conscious disregard of appellant patient's safety and that Cal. Civ. Code &sect; 3333.2 permitted medical malpractice plaintiffs who join their independent causes of action in a single suit to recover up to $ 250,000 each in noneconomic damages. The court held that the trial court abused its discretion in refusing to allow appellant patient's medical experts to testify to the ultimate fact whether appellant doctor acted in conscious disregard. The court also held that appellant patient and wife should receive the same recovery as if they had brought separate actions rather than joining in one action. The court ordered a new trial on the issue of punitive damages and reversed the trial court's order reducing appellant patient and wife's noneconomic damage award.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court remanded the matter to the trial court. The trial court was directed to modify the judgment to award appellant patient $ 250,000 in noneconomic damages, to award appellant wife $ 250,000 in noneconomic damages, and to conduct a new trial on whether appellant patient and wife were entitled to punitive damages. The court held that appellant patient and wife should receive the same recovery as if they had brought separate actions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was a juvenile whom officers saw standing at an intersection at 2:30 a.m. Immediately upon seeing defendant, the officers asked defendant to approach the car because he was young and on the street unattended past the curfew time. An officer testified at trial that he did not know why defendant was out at that time so he took him into custody per the local curfew law. The officer in no way indicated that he suspected that defendant had committed a crime. Defendant appealed the court's failure to suppress evidence collected from him as a result of his illegal arrest. The court found that the curfew ordinance was subject to multiple interpretations; therefore, it was void for vagueness because it failed to give the persons subject to it fair notice of what conduct was forbidden and it allowed arbitrary and erratic arrests and convictions. Since defendant was illegally arrested without probable cause, the trial court should have granted defendant's motion to suppress burglary tools found in his possession because they were the fruit of an illegal arrest. The court struck down the ordinance and defendant's arrest; therefore, the judgment was reversed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant state convicted parties who were present at a cockfight pursuant to Cal. Penal Code &sect; 597(b). The parties filed a petition for writ of review on the grounds that the statute unconstitutionally criminalized their acts of merely being present at the scene of a crime. The lower court granted the petition and held that the word &quot;spectator&quot; as used in Cal. Penal Code &sect; 597(b) was unconstitutionally vague and violated due process because it did not give the alleged violators notice as to what conduct was criminal. Thus, such vague terms would have subjected a mere passerby to criminal prosecution. Appellant sought review of the order. On review the court disagreed and ordered the lower court to vacate the order granting the writ of mandate. The court held that Cal. Penal Code &sect; 597(b), criminalized the knowing presence of a &quot;spectator&quot; who was present for the purpose of watching the animal fight and not those parties who merely caught a glimpse. Further, the statute criminalized the act of being a knowing spectator of the illegal sport of cockfighting because such activity could not have taken place without spectators.

Penal Code &sect; 368(a). The two appeals were consolidated for purposes of hearing and review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants' husband and wife challenged their convictions for dependent adult abuse under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 368(a). At trial, it was shown that appellants lived with appellant husband's mother, that appellant took care of his mother's finances, and that she died due to extreme neglect. Appellants claimed &sect; 368(a) was void for vagueness. Because a statute must give &quot;fair warning&quot; and &quot;minimal guidelines&quot; as to what individuals and what conduct was covered by the statute, the court held the statute was unconstitutionally vague. It was not clear whether it applied only to caregivers, or included bystanders who learned of the abuse. Because the statute required &quot;criminal negligence,&quot; this implied a duty of care which &sect; 368(a)(1) did not expressly create. The court affirmed appellant husband's conviction because the statute clearly applied to him. The court held that simply living in the same household was not enough to establish that appellant wife had a duty of care to the victim or the requisite criminal intent. Because appellant wife might have been convicted under the portion of the statute that had been declared void and not as a caregiver, the court reversed her conviction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the conviction of appellant husband but reversed appellant wife's conviction. The dependent adult abuse statute was void for vagueness as to appellant wife because it was not clear that under the circumstances the statute applied to her, or her conduct, or that she had the requisite criminal intent. The statute was not void as to appellant husband because the statute clearly applied to him as the caregiver of the victim.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In prior litigation between appellant city and appellee state, the court held that appellant was entitled to reimbursement under Cal.

When reimbursement was not made, appellant filed a petition for mandate. While the petition was pending, the supreme court ruled that the proper analysis for reimbursement under &sect; 6 was not whether the law was state-mandated, which was the focus in the prior litigation. Rather, the analysis was whether the law imposed a new program or higher level of service. The trial court denied appellant's petition. The court reversed, holding that collateral estoppel precluded appellee from relitigating the issue of reimbursement. In so ruling, the court held that the issue of reimbursement was decided even though appellee had not argued that 1978 Cal. Stat. 2 did not represent a new program or a higher level of service.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the lower court judgment because it found that Cal. Rev. &amp; Tax. Code &sect;214.12 was unconstitutional. The court found that &sect;214.12 conflicted with Cal.

XIII, &sect; 6 provided that the failure in any year to claim an exemption or classification that would reduce property tax would be deemed a waiver of the exemption or classification for that year. The court found that appellant organization had failed to claim an exemption and failed to record its interest in the property with the assessor as required under Cal. Rev. &amp; Tax. Code &sect; 261(a). Appellant's failure to record their interest in the property and the failure to claim an exemption resulted in a waiver of the welfare exemption for the years prior to the recordation. The court concluded that the lower court correctly concluded that &sect; 214.12 conflicted with Cal. Const. amend.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Two lawsuits were filed regarding approval of a timber harvesting plan.

In the other suit, the court reversed the order vacating the permits and requiring Caltrans to hold a hearing in compliance with CEQA. The court held CEQA was not applicable.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant bail bondsman furnished a cash bond to secure the appearance at trial of its client, a criminal defendant. When the client did not appear, the trial court revoked bail. Within 180 days, appellant produced its client and moved to set aside the forfeiture under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 1305(a). The trial court agreed to set aside the forfeiture, but required appellant to pay costs associated with its client's failure to appear. The court affirmed the trial court's order. In so ruling, the court held that it was proper for the trial court to impose such costs. Moreover, the court rejected appellant's argument that the costs were twice what appellant was permitted by law to charge in fees. The court observed that appellant was permitted to charge all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by a breach by an arrestee and may recoup these costs from the collateral posted by the arrestee. The court also chose not to reach appellant's argument that the imposed costs violated the equal protection clause of U.S. Const. amend. XIV, finding no evidence that courts imposed costs on bail bondsmen more often than on individuals who posted their own bail.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's order setting aside a forfeiture of bail because the trial court did not abuse its discretion in conditioning relief on payment of costs to the public proximately caused by appellant's client's failure to appear for trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from the judgment of the Superior Court of San Diego County (California), entered upon a jury verdict, convicting him of burglary in the first degree and other offenses, following the trial court's comment during jury instructions that the location of the alleged offenses was in an inhabited apartment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with first-degree burglary, robbery, assault with a deadly weapon, forcible oral copulation, and forcible rape of a woman who was attacked in her apartment. While instructing the jury on first-degree burglary, the trial court stated that burglary of an inhabited dwelling house, such as that occupied by the victim in the case, would be burglary in the first degree. Defendant was subsequently convicted of all charges and he appealed. In affirming, the court ruled that the comments of the trial court did not amount to a directed verdict of first-degree burglary, as opposed to second-degree burglary, because defendant never disputed the location of the offenses or the fact that the victim had been attacked and the jury was properly instructed otherwise. If there was any error it was harmless because there was no evidence to support a finding that the apartment was uninhabited, so as to reduce the offense to second-degree burglary. Moreover, the taking of the issue of degree from the jury was not reversible error because it did not involve an element of the underlying crime of burglary. The remaining convictions were affirmed by an unpublished opinion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The convictions were affirmed because, inter alia, the trial court's comment did not constitute a directed verdict as to first-degree burglary since defendant never disputed the location, the jury was otherwise properly instructed, the issue of degree was not an element of the underlying offense, and there was no evidence to support a finding that the burglarized premises were uninhabited, so as to reduce the offense to second-degree burglary.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant state employees' association sought review of the trial court's judgment, which refused to enjoin respondent state from entering into personal service contracts under Cal.

Const. art. VII or its purposes. The court distinguished the legislature's authority under the state constitution from that of the U.S. constitution and further noted that the restriction on &quot;contracting out&quot; of state activities to the private sector did not arise from the express language of art. VII. While conflict might arise in the application of &sect; 19130(a), appellant had the burden of demonstrating it inevitably posed a present total and fatal conflict with constitutional prohibitions. After in-depth review of &sect; 19130, the court held that it was carefully crafted to permit personal service contracts to achieve cost savings only when they would have had no detrimental effect on the integrity of the civil service and, therefore, did not displace or destroy the constitutional scheme.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff lettuce growers filed an action against defendant Department of Food and Agriculture for an injunction and writ of mandate concerning defendant's seizure of plaintiffs' crops pursuant to Cal. Food &amp; Agric. Code &sect; 12648. The trial court denied both the injunction and the writ of mandate. On appeal, plaintiffs contended that Cal. Food &amp; Agric. Code &sect; 12648 was unconstitutional. The court agreed, finding that plaintiffs had an interest protected by procedural due process under Cal. Const. art. I, &sect; 7 and that the statute did not meet the requirements of due process for several reasons. First, the statute allowed the seizure of property without any notice or opportunity to be heard and without any requirement that authorization be obtained from a neutral judicial officer. Second, the statute failed to provide for a hearing on the merits of the taking, either before or after the taking. Third, the statute required plaintiffs to file an action instead of defendant. Therefore, defendant never had to carry the burden of proving facts upon which it relied to seize plaintiffs' crops.

Appellant brought a wrongful discharge action against appellee and appellee was granted summary judgment by the trial court, which held that the administrative decision should be given collateral estoppel effect on the issue of whether appellant quit work without good cause. Appellant challenged that ruling, and while the appeal was pending the legislature passed Cal. Unemp. Ins.

Welf. &amp; Inst. Code &sect; 5361 (1979), the trial court granted respondent county's petition to reestablish the conservatorship of appellant and reappoint the conservator. Appellant sought review and argued that Cal. Welf. &amp; Inst. Code &sect;&sect; 5361 and 5365.1 (1979) violated U.S. Const. amend. XIV. The appellate court found that the general reference to physicians in &sect; 5361 did not rise to the level of a constitutional deficiency in the context of the requirements to present the petition for the reappointment. Further, there was nothing in &sect; 5365.1 that compelled appellant to waive the presence of the physicians at the reappointment hearing. The appellate court affirmed the trial court's judgment because the statute on its face did not violate appellant's due process rights and issues as to the qualifications of the physicians and whether they personally examined appellant were matters for the trier of fact when evaluating whether the requisite showing of grave disability had been made.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of setting fire to an inhabited structure, the most serious form of arson, in violation of Cal.

Defendant challenged his conviction, contending that, at the time of the fire, the house was not inhabited as defined in Cal. Penal Code &sect; 450(d). On appeal, the court ruled that inhabitation was an element of the crime that the prosecution had to prove beyond a reasonable doubt. The court held that there was insufficient evidence to prove that the house was actually being used for dwelling purposes at the time of the fire. Thus, the court modified the judgment so as to convict defendant of the reduced charge of arson of a structure in violation of Cal. Penal Code &sect; 451(c).</SPAN></P>

The cause was remanded for resentencing.</SPAN></P>

Upon review, the court affirmed and ordered appellants' counsel to pay an additional penalty for pursuing a frivolous appeal. The court held that the appeal from the denial of the injunction was moot because there was no justiciable controversy where the election appellants sought to enjoin already had transpired. The court reasoned that once the election took place the remedies of appellants were removed from the field of injunctive relief and were relegated to remedies subsequent to the election. The court held the sanctions ordered against appellants for filing a frivolous action were proper where appellants lacked legal grounds, were guilty of latches, and completely lacked evidence to substantiate the allegations contained in their pleadings. The court found that sanctions on appeal were also appropriate because the appeal was completely devoid of merit and that no reasonable attorney would have pursued the appeal.</SPAN></P>

The trial court denied defendant's motion that the prosecution be required to make an election between murder with malice aforethought and felony murder as to the murder charge. Defendant admitted robbing and shooting the victim but claimed diminished capacity. Defendant requested instructions defining malice aforethought, second degree murder, manslaughter, and the absence of premeditation, deliberation, malice, or intent to kill due to diminished capacity. The trial court refused to give the instructions and defendant was found guilty as charged. On appeal, the court found the trial court committed error in failing to give these instructions. Their omission practically guaranteed defendant's convictions of robbery and first degree felony murder as the defendant had admitted robbing and killing the victim, but offered the sole defense of diminished capacity with respect to the mens rea elements of robbery and murder. Failure to give the instructions required reversal of defendant's conviction of murder; the court remanded for further proceedings. The conviction for robbery was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

Defendant did not appeal her conviction for perjury, Cal. Penal Code &sect; 118. Affirming the conviction, the court decided that the test whether a series of acts constituted one felony or a series of misdemeanors depended upon whether the evidence disclosed one general intent or separate and distinct intents. The primary concern was whether the acts were pursuant to one intention, one general impulse, and one plan. The court rejected defendant's claim that the legislature did not intend to provide so much discretion in the application of a penal statute and that the discretion violated equal protection rights. The court also rejected her claim that Cal. Welf. &amp; Inst. Code &sect; 10980(c)(2) was void for vagueness, explaining her conduct fell clearly within its bounds.</SPAN></P>

Even if the constitution did not specifically permit the legislature to delegate the function to the superior courts, such delegation was not necessarily unconstitutional because the doctrine of separation of powers did not prohibit one branch from exercising in some degree the functions of another branch.</SPAN></P>

Appellant argued that the overflight violated his U.S. Const. amend. IV rights and that the police violated the &quot;knock-notice&quot; provisions of Cal. Penal Code &sect; 1531. The court affirmed the judgment, holding that defendant's U.S. Const. amend. IV rights were not violated, as the plants were visible without the use of electronic aids and the flight was conducted in a &quot;physically nonintrusive manner,&quot; and that the superior court properly found that &sect; 1531 was not applicable, as the door was open and the officers were not told they could not enter.</SPAN></P>

The court found that &quot;good cause&quot; had acquired reasonable certainty by established usage, interpretation, and a settled commonsense meaning.

After consideration, the court concluded that it was not error for the trial court not to instruct the jury on a definition of sexual offense within the meaning of &sect; 6316.2. The court also found that it was not error to allow certain documents into evidence, the jury was not inaccurately instructed on the definition of conservatorship, and the recommitment scheme was constitutional.

The principal, believing that the article would damage the reputations of the girls, the school, and the school district, prohibited distribution of the newspaper.

Additionally, the court held that the school yearbook's rejection of an advertisement for the group was allowable because appellee school district had validly adopted a closed-forum policy, in which only school-sponsored clubs were authorized to function or advertise in school publications.

The court held that with the exception of the claims raised by plaintiff city on its own behalf, the action against defendant insurance company was barred by the exhaustion of administrative remedies doctrine. Administrative remedies were available under Cal. Ins. Code &sect; 1858, and no exceptions to the exhaustion rule applied. Plaintiff individuals did not have standing to sue because they failed to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action for taxpayer relief. Plaintiff city lacked standing to sue, individually and as a representative, because it was not a member of the class. Plaintiff organization had standing. The redlining practice was not a state action. The authority under &sect; 11628 to differentiate in rates between geographical areas did not allow invidious discrimination.

Respondent department of personnel administration denied plaintiff's administrative appeal and plaintiff filed a petition for a writ of administrative mandate in the superior court, which found that Cal. Gov't Code &sect; 19996.2 was constitutional on its face and as applied to plaintiff and that the administrative decision denying plaintiff's reinstatement was supported by the weight of the evidence. On appeal, plaintiff contended that the automatic resignation statute was so arbitrary, unreasonable, and unduly harsh that it ran afoul of substantive due process and equal protection of the laws. The court affirmed that the plain language of Cal. Gov't Code &sect; 19996.2 clearly stated that absence without leave for five consecutive working days was an automatic resignation; thus, plaintiff's intent was irrelevant.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant bail bond surety posted bail for a criminal defendant who failed to appear in the trial court.

The judgment against appellant included the amount of the bond, costs, and postjudgment interest. Appellant challenged the ruling and contended that the trial court entered the ruling on postjudgment interest in excess of its jurisdiction. Appellant claimed that the general provisions of the statute concerning enforcement of money judgments controlled, and that the statute prohibited a penalty assessment. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment and held that the legislature intended to impose postjudgment interest on bail bond forfeitures to compensate local governments for the loss of use of money while a judgment remained unpaid. The court further held that the prohibition of a penalty assessment applied to a criminal defendant's posting of bond, and did not apply after forfeiture of the bond.</SPAN></P>

The court concluded that such prosecution constituted an improper invasion by the executive of the province of the judiciary, and was therefore violative of the separation of powers set forth in Cal. Const. art. III, &sect; 3. The doctrine of separation of powers demanded that the branches of government were to be coequal. The judicial power therefore had to be independent, and that power was compromised when an individual judge wished to perform his functions but had to first consider the possibility that the prosecutor could disapprove and charge him criminally.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following a corporate consolidation by stock transfer, appellants, counties and state board of equalization, issued assessors' letters, to respondent subsidiary, indicating that the acquisition of a corporation through stock transfer resulted in a change of ownership which required reappraisal of any real property owned by the parent and the subsidiaries under Cal.

The trial court held that &sect; 64(c) was inapplicable to respondent, as a subsidiary of an acquired corporation, and that appellants should refund excessive taxes paid by respondent. Appellants sought review. Finding that the lower court's ruling that &sect; 64(c) applied to property owned by respondent, as a subsidiary, was contrary to the language to the tax code, the court affirmed the judgment of the trial court.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant county challenged a decision of the Superior Court of Merced County (California), which held that Cal. Rev. &amp; Tax. Code &sect; 61 was unconstitutional as being in conflict with the provisions of the Cal. Const. art. XIIIA, &sect; 2, in respondent landowner's challenge to reappraisal of his land. Appellant contended that it was not unconstitutional, under its power to levy taxes.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant county reappraised respondent landowner's property, after respondent entered into a 30-year lease, with two successive 10-year renewal options, thereby significantly raising respondent's tax responsibility. Respondent challenged the reapprasial, contending that Cal. Rev. &amp; Tax. Code &sect; 61 was unconstitutional under Cal. Const. art. XIIIA, &sect; 2. The trial court found in favor of respondent, and appellant challenged. On appeal, the court held that the statute was to be construed to have its common sense meaning in order to avoid an unreasonable or absurd result. Because the Legislature had the authority to levy taxes, and enact statutes toward that purpose, the provisions of the statute defining a change in ownership as a leasehold period that approximated the valuation of the lease fee interest for revaluation purposes were not unconstitutional. The court reversed the trial court's decision in favor of respondent landowner and awarded costs to appellant county.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court's judgment in favor of respondent landowner, holding that because a lease to use a structure had, inherent in it, the right to occupy the land, appellant county's reappraisal was justified under a 35-year lease as a change in ownership, and that it was an unreasonable construction of the controlling statute to conclude that lease renewal options should not be included in the lease term for revaluation purposes.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, a city and its city attorney, appealed an order of the Superior Court of Santa Clara County (California), in which Mountain View, Cal., Ordinance No. 27.85 was found invalid because it impermissibly conflicted with Cal. Civ. Code &sect; 827.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, two landlords and an apartment association, sought declaratory and injunctive relief from the enforcement of Mountain View, Cal., Ordinance No. 27.85. Plaintiffs asserted that the ordinance was invalid because it conflicted with Cal. Civ. Code &sect; 827, which dealt with notification for increasing rent. The trial court found the ordinance invalid and an appeal ensued. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment. According to the court, a city could make and enforce within its limits all ordinances and regulations not in conflict with general laws. The court stated that a determination of whether local legislation was in conflict turned on whether the state's preemption of the field was complete. The court stated that the task was to determine whether the state had occupied a relevant field that included the subject of the local legislation, and was sufficiently related so that a court could detect a patterned approach to the subject. The court concluded that the ordinance dealt with notification, not rent control, and that &sect; 827 specified not only a time for notice to tenants, but also prohibited the parties from agreeing to a shorter notice than another specified period.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment finding that a local ordinance extending the notice requirement for a rent increase was invalid because the state legislature had specifically addressed the very issue of notice. Therefore, the ordinance impermissibly conflicted with a state statute.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged his conviction from the Superior Court of Contra Costa County (California) for first-degree burglary under Cal. Penal Code &sect;&sect; 459, 460(1), contending multiple errors, including that the trial court erred in instructing the jury as to degrees of conviction, his involuntary confession and identification testimony of a key witness should have been suppressed, and ineffective assistance of counsel.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant and accomplices were observed by a neighbor while removing items from complainant's residence. At trial for first-degree burglary, the trial judge instructed the jury that if they found defendant guilty, as a matter of law, the offense was first degree burglary. Defendant was convicted and challenged, alleging as the primary error, that the trial judge's instruction denied him a trial by jury on the essential element of whether the residence was a dwelling, thereby making the offense first-degree burglary. On appeal, the court held that because defendant had not submitted evidence that the residence was not a dwelling, the jury instruction did not improperly relieve the prosecution of proving each element beyond a reasonable doubt. Further, the court held that where the error complained of was harmless, the per se rule of reversal did not apply and the court affirmed defendant's conviction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction for first-degree burglary, holding that the evidence before the trial court established degree as a matter of law, and showed that contrary evidence was not worthy of consideration. Therefore, the trial court's jury instruction did not deprive defendant of a jury trial on every essential element of the crime.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Superior Court of Santa Clara (California), which entered a conviction against him for the offense of threatening a public employee, a felony under Cal.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury found defendant guilty of threatening a public employee, a felony under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 71. Defendant argued on appeal that his conduct did not violate &sect; 71 because his threats were not &quot;directly communicated&quot; to the service manager of his former employer where he left a message on an answering machine, and in another instance he conversed with a co-employee. The court found that &sect; 71 expressly provided that the phrase &quot;directly communicated&quot; included, but was not limited to, communication to the recipient of the threat by telephone, telegraph, or letter and that each of these methods of communication may involve an intervening agency. Therefore, the court held that the word &quot;directly&quot; required that the threat must reach the public officer personally to be &quot;directly communicated&quot; to the officer within the meaning of &sect; 71. Furthermore, the court held that &sect; 71 was not unconstitutional because it was not vague or ambiguous. As such, the court affirmed defendant's conviction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment from the Superior Court of Los Angeles County (California) convicting him of murder and robbery in violation of Cal. Penal Code &sect; 190.2(a)(17) and finding appellant used a revolver in the commission of the offenses pursuant to &sect;&sect; 120.225 and 1203.06(a)(1) and inflicted great bodily injury pursuant to &sect; 1203.075. Defendant contended the trial court erred in refusing two jury instructions and in excluding evidence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of a judgment from the trial court convicting him of murder and robbery in violation of &sect; 190.2(a)(17) and finding that in the commission of the offenses defendant used a revolver within the meaning of Cal. Penal Code &sect;&sect; 120.225 and 1203.06(a)(1) and inflicted great bodily injury pursuant to &sect; 1203.075. The court affirmed the conviction and judgment. Trial court did not err by refusing defendant's request for a modified version of jury instructions to pinpoint his defense of third party culpability because defendant did not present sufficient evidence of third party culpability linking any particular third person to actual perpetration of the crime. The trial court also did not err in applying Cal. Evid. Code &sect; 351.1 to bar evidence of polygraph results because the exclusion of the evidence did not deprive defendant of his constitutional right to compulsory process. The court held that concerns for reliability and fairness outweighed the relatively weak exculpatory significance of the proffered evidence, and thus, application of Cal. Evid. Code &sect; 351.1 did not deny defendant due process or violate his state and federal right to compulsory process.</SPAN></P>

The instructions regarding third party culpability were not supported because defendant did not link any third person to the actual perpetration of the crime. In addition, the polygraph was properly excluded because concerns of reliability and fairness outweighed the significance of the evidence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant ex-husband sought review of a lower court determination that he was not entitled to reimbursement for his separate property contribution to a condominium bought during his marriage to respondent ex-wife, which condominium was taken in both parties' names, contending that Cal. Civ. Code &sect; 4800.2 governed the proceeding because the divorce was filed after the effective date of the statute even though the property was purchased before the statute's effective date. On appeal, the lower court determination was affirmed. In support of its ruling, the court held that if a property right vested before the enactment of a statute, such a right may not be altered except in those rare instances when it was necessary to promote a significantly important state interest. With respect to the instant case, the court found that no state interest was promoted by divesting respondent of her interest in the property in question when she had acquired her community property interest at a time when the only method of defeating or diminishing that right was by proof of an agreement to the contrary.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant State of California sought review of dismissal of the charges of possession for sale of methamphetamine, possession of a syringe, and giving false information to a police officer against respondent, contending that the lower court erred in granting respondent's motion to suppress narcotics found in a closed container during an automobile inventory search. On appeal, the charges were reinstated. In support of its ruling, the court rejected respondent's contention that the inventory conducted by the police was unlawful because the officer had no right to impound his automobile even though such vehicle, and the property it contained, could not be secured from theft if left alone. The court further held that the police had authority to impound the vehicle to protect the property inside irrespective of his statutory authority to impound vehicles on highways. The court also found that no U.S. Const. amend. IV violation was found when police opened either a closed glove compartment or closed container during an inventory search.

Whatever invasion of privacy occurred was minimal. The officers were visible to the occupant through the screen door. In addition, the uncontradicted evidence demonstrated that the officer made eye contact with defendant, announced his authority by identifying himself as a peace officer, and announced his purpose by saying he had a warrant to search the premises.

In October 1981 the parties stipulated to a disposition of property. In January 1982, appellee's attorney forwarded a proposed judgment to appellant's attorney. Appellant signed the proposed judgment on September 10, 1982 and returned it to appellee's attorney on January 27, 1983. The stipulation was signed by the judge on February 15, 1983. Over a year later, the lower court granted appellee's request for modification and gave her a share of appellant's pension. Appellant sought review. The court found that the trial court did not have power to modify the judgment because appellee did not request the modification until after the usual time limits for modification had expired. The trial court could use its nunc pro tunc power to consider the judgment as if it was entered on an earlier date because appellant agreed to the judgment on an earlier date and prevented entry of the judgment until after appellee's right to share appellant's pension benefits under Cal. Civ. Code &sect; 5124 had expired. The court affirmed because it was within the trial court's power to enter relief and allow appellee benefits.</SPAN></P>

The county did not have a diversion program.  Cal. Penal Code &sect; 1001.50 delegated authority to the county board of supervisors to implement a diversion program, subject to the prosecutor's approval. There was no constitutional mandate that required diversion to be uniformly available throughout the state and there was no fundamental right to a diversion program. The court found the statute did not violate equal protection because there was a reasonable basis for the statute. The state legislature had authority to delegate the ability to create a diversion program. The prosecutor's right to approve the program was nothing more than what the prosecutor already had the ability to do. The court granted the writ of mandate because respondent did not have jurisdiction to order creation of a diversion program. The court ordered the proceeding be reinstated.</SPAN></P>

The trial court denied a request for fees under the private attorney general statute,&nbsp;Cal. Civ. Proc. Code. &sect; 1021.5, and 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1988. When defendant's hospital later sought to reduce plaintiff's morphine dosage, she secured a temporary injunction. Her fee request was again denied. The court on appeal reversed the denial of attorney fees requested under &sect; 1021.5, based on the removal of the feeding tube, because plaintiff secured the enforcement of an important right affecting the public interest by helping to clarify the rights of all persons who received medical treatment. The court affirmed the denial of fees under &sect; 1988 because the record failed to show that plaintiff's alleged injuries were proximately caused by the execution of a governmental policy or custom.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of a decision of the Superior Court of Sonoma County (California) decision, which denied defendant's motion to suppress, filed pursuant to Cal. Penal Code &sect; 1538.5, and entered judgment against defendant after defendant pleaded no contest to assault with a firearm and inflicting great bodily harm, in violation of Cal. Penal Code &sect;&sect; 245(a)(2), &sect; 12022.7.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged the trial court's denial of his motion to suppress the search and seizure of his wallet and a subsequent confession as the unlawful fruit of that seizure at defendant's trial. Defendant was on trial after pleading no contest to assault with a firearm, in violation of Cal. Penal Code &sect; 245(a)(2), and to inflicting great bodily harm with intent to inflict such injury, in violation of Cal. Penal Code &sect; 12022.7. The court affirmed the judgment because the seizure of the wallet was reasonable and proper. The seizure of the wallet was used to determine defendant's identity after he denied having identification upon his self. Accordingly, the papers observed were lawfully seized and defendant's spontaneous confession was not the fruit of an illegal search. The search was also proper as a search incident to a lawful arrest since the officer had probable cause to arrest given the similarity in descriptions, the location of defendant when stopped, and the information hidden from the officer. The court also affirmed the sentence because the finding that the victim was particularly vulnerable was supported by the facts and supported the imposition of an upper term.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's sentence and the denial his motion to suppress. The court held that the seizure of defendant's wallet was reasonable under the circumstances, which precluded a spontaneous confession from being the fruit of an illegal search and seizure. Additionally, a search of defendant was valid as a search incident to a lawful arrest, as the officer had probable cause to arrest defendant on suspicion of attempted murder.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the legislature presented the annual budget to respondent governor, he reduced, under his line item veto power, the aggregate funds appropriated to the Department of Industrial Relations (DIR) in a stated effort to terminate the state's enforcement of Cal/OSHA in the private sector.

The court granted the petition and ordered respondent director of DIR to allocate funds from the items of appropriation to enforce Cal/OSHA. The court held that respondent governor's reduction of the amount of funds to be appropriated was simply that - a reduction of funds - and did not actually affect the laws to be enforced, even though that was the stated purpose. Thus, the action was constitutional. Because there were funds available to respondent director of DIR, he was required to allocate the funds for administration and enforcement of Cal/OSHA.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant contractor sought relief from a summary judgment entered against it in a foreclosure action. Appellant worked as a general contractor on a particular project and some years after the project started, respondent limited partnership was formed to obtain additional funding for the project.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A police helicopter overflight above appellant's property revealed marijuana growing outside, and within a partially covered greenhouse. Appellant was thereafter charged with cultivation of marijuana and possession of marijuana for sale. He pled guilty, and was sentenced to two years in prison for cultivation. On appeal, he contended that the helicopter overflight was an invasion of his expectation of privacy. The court evaluated whether appellant had an expectation of privacy in the area under surveillance, and noted that he possessed a great expectation of privacy in the curtilage around his home. To determine whether the area under surveillance constituted protected curtilage, the court looked upon: the proximity of the area to appellant's home; whether the area was included within an enclosure surrounding the home; the nature of the uses to which the area was put; and the steps taken by appellant to protect the area from observation. The court in turn concluded that area under surveillance was within the protected residential curtilage, and that the surveillance of appellant's property was unconstitutional. The judgment of the trial court was therefore reversed.</SPAN></P>

Police helicopter overflight above appellant's property infringed upon the reasonable expectation of privacy that he possessed relative the area under surveillance.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his sentence for committing a lewd and lascivious act with a child under age 14 in the Superior Court of Stanislaus County (California), contending that the trial court erred when it relied upon the provisions of Cal. Penal Code &sect; 1170.71 in selecting an upper eight-year prison term.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court convicted defendant of committing a lewd and lascivious act with a child under age 14. Defendant appealed his sentence, alleging that the trial court erred in selecting the upper eight-year prison term by relying on the provisions of Cal. Penal Code &sect; 1170.71, which made using obscene matter to induce a minor to engage in a lewd act a factor to be considered in aggravation of a sentence. Specifically, defendant argued that the time interval of approximately a year between the act of molestation and the prior exhibition of harmful or obscene material to the minor was too long to sustain an inference that the material was used to induce the minor to engage in the proscribed conduct. The court affirmed the conviction and sentence, holding that the time interval was not determinative. Rather, the focus of the statute was the purpose of the use. There was substantial evidence before the trial court that defendant showed the minor the sexual materials to influence her to engage in lewd and lascivious acts, and no other reason for doing so was suggested by defendant.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's sentence for committing a lewd and lascivious act with a child under age 14 was affirmed because the applicable statute used to enhance defendant's sentence was properly applied. The court explained that there was sufficient evidence to make the requisite showing that defendant showed the child the sexual materials to influence her to engage in the proscribed acts.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In consolidated appeals, the state challenged a judgment from the Superior Court of Mendocino County (California), which granted the motion of defendants, husband and wife, to suppress evidence under Cal.

Defendant husband appealed his conviction, claiming execution of a search warrant unconstitutionally resulted in seizure of property not described therein.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Two separate appeals were consolidated for review. The state appealed the lower court's grant of the motion of defendants, husband and wife, to suppress evidence under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 1538.5, claiming entry into defendants' residence by an officer with a warrant, after the officer identified himself, said he had a search warrant, and entered through an unlocked screen door did not fail to give defendants reasonable time to refuse admittance. The court held that refusal of admittance may not be necessary in situations not involving closed or locked doors, and reversed the order dismissing the action because the officer yelled through an open door, and that was considered as having warned defendants of his presence and purpose. Defendant husband appealed his conviction for receiving stolen property, claiming evidence of stolen car parts should have been suppressed because they were not the subject of the search warrant. The court affirmed because the parts were in plain sight, and were observed and examined without being moved and before the officer had knowledge they were stolen. The court held that the parts were subject to seizure and could be introduced into evidence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The lower court's dismissal of the action against defendants, husband and wife, was reversed because suppressed evidence should have been admitted where entry into defendants' residence by an officer with a search warrant through an unlocked door, after he identified himself and his purpose, was sufficient warning. Defendant husband's conviction was affirmed because evidence not the subject of a search warrant, but in plain sight, was admissible.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant taxpayers filed an action against respondent trustees, trustees of the fine arts museums, a charitable trust, for breach and mismanagement of the trust.

The trial court sustained respondents' demurrer. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment of the trial court, holding that appellants had no standing to bring an action against respondents because appellants had no special interest in the trust other than as taxpayers and members of the public. The court found that although the fine arts museums was allegedly administered by city officials, the trust assets did not constitute public assets but rather the res of a charitable trust. The court determined that Cal. Civ. Proc. Code &sect; 526(a) did not give rise to a right of action by appellants because respondents, in operating the museums, were fulfilling their fiduciary obligations as trustees, and the alleged misfeasance was not illegal governmental activity or the misappropriation of public property, but the mismanagement of a charitable trust.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant cable company sought a preliminary injunction that would allow it to reconnect subscribers in an apartment complex owned by respondent apartment owner. Respondent apartment owner had disconnected appellant's system in favor of respondent provider's satellite system. The trial court denied the preliminary injunction and appellant sought review. The court noted that delivery of cable television involved a permanent and physical invasion of a property owner's building and, as a result, differed significantly from the delivery of print medium. The court also noted that, while cable television was subject to local regulation, cable television regulations did not include the right to &quot;take&quot; private property for the private use of a cable company. Accordingly, the court found that appellant did not have a constitutional right of access to the tenants of respondent apartment owner's complex. The court found that the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it refused to grant a temporary injunction, and affirmed the order of the trial court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant electric utility sought review of an order from the Superior Court of Ventura County (California), which granted the motion of respondent minor for a new trial, contending there was sufficient evidence to justify the jury's finding that the accident occurred on premises in which appellant had an interest under Cal. Civ. Code &sect; 846 making it appropriate to instruct the jury on immunity under that statute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent minor brought an action for personal injuries sustained when he touched a wire dangling from an electric pole that belonged to appellant electric utility. In a special verdict, the jury found facts that established appellant's immunity from liability under Cal. Civ. Code &sect; 846 and judgment was entered for appellant. The trial court then granted respondent's motion for a new trial, finding there was insufficient evidence to justify the finding that the accident had occurred on premises in which defendant had an interest within the meaning of Cal. Civ. Code &sect; 846 and it was error to instruct the jury on immunity. Appellant sought review and the court reversed the order, finding that appellant had a nonpossessory interest in the land on which its poles were located and had a duty to keep the premises safe for entry. The court concluded that while the utility poles were not recreational in nature, the remainder of the land surrounding the poles was suited for such use and that such use was foreseeable. The court found that the use of appellant's land did not fall within the exception to Cal. Civ. Code &sect; 846 as an area unsuitable for recreation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the order that granted respondent minor a new trial, finding that appellant electric utility had a nonpossessory interest in the land where its poles were located, therefore coming within the provisions of the recreational use immunity statute. The court concluded it was appropriate to instruct the jury on immunity and their finding of immunity should be reinstated.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged a judgment of the Superior Court, Kern County (California), which based upon a jury verdict, convicted appellant for first-degree murder under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 189.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Based upon a description received from several witnesses and one victim, appellant was arrested and the state charged him with murder in violation of Cal. Penal Code &sect;&sect; 664 and 187, in addition to various other charges. Following a jury trial, appellant was convicted of first-degree murder and the jury also found he personally used a deadly and dangerous weapon and that appellant was engaged in the commission of a robbery at the time of the murder. Appellant challenged, arguing that he could not be convicted of felony murder, a violation of Cal. Penal Code &sect; 189, when the information charged only murder with malice, a violation of Cal. Penal Code &sect; 187. The court affirmed, holding that because the offense charged in this case included both degrees of murder, appellant could be legally convicted of either degree warranted by the evidence. While identification of the statute violated was advisable, it was not required. Furthermore, under the facts at bar, appellant was not prejudiced by the prosecution's failure to specifically charge appellant with violation of Cal. Penal Code &sect; 189.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was affirmed. Appellant was properly convicted for first degree murder, because despite the fact that the information charged appellant of murder with malice, whether murder was committed with malice or in the context of felony murder, the crime committed was still murder, and while identification of the statute violated was advisable, it was not required.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant Department of Health Services challenged a judgment of the Superior Court of Alameda County (California), which in respondent individuals' class action suit entered a summary judgment, later incorporated into a final judgment, ordering appellant to retroactively award respondents with certain Medicaid benefits as calculated under by Cal. Lab. Code &sect; 14005.16(a).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When the legislature infused community property concepts into Medicaid benefit calculations by enacting Cal. Welfare &amp; Institutions Code &sect; 14005.16, it provided that any provision conflicting with federal statutes or regulations should be severed. After federal authorities determined Cal. Welfare &amp; Institutions Code &sect; 14005.16 indeed conflicted with federal law and denied conflict waivers, appellant Department of Health Services withheld implementation of the statute. Respondent individuals, potential beneficiaries under the statute, then filed a class action suit seeking injunctive relief and retroactive application of the statute, which would increase their Medicaid benefits. Intervening legislative action mooted final injunctive relief. The trial court ordered appellant to pay retroactive benefits to respondents and all the class members. The court affirmed. Appellant was barred from refusing to enforce a statute based on a conflict with federal law under Cal. Const. art. III, &sect; 3.5, unless an appellate court had found such conflict.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was affirmed. Appellant Department of Health Services was properly ordered to retroactively pay respondent individuals and all class members Medicaid benefits in an amount reflecting a statutory formula. Although the state law creating the formula stated it was inapplicable if it conflicted with federal law, the state constitution forbade appellant from recognizing any conflict not previously found by an appellate court.</SPAN></P>

Code &sect; 23153(a), the offense of felony drunk driving that caused injury or death to another person, pled nolo contendere to the charge, pursuant to a plea bargain that she would receive local time rather than a prison commitment. The Superior Court of Kings County (California) sentenced defendant to probation subject to conditions that she contended were unreasonable.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, who pled nolo contendere to the charged offense of felony drunk driving that caused injury or death to another person, was sentenced to probation subject to conditions that included a requirement that she pay restitution to the victims of the accident in an amount to be determined by the probation officer up to and including $ 60,000, a condition that defendant contended was unreasonable. The court held that based on the circumstances of the case, the order of restitution was not a reasonable condition within the meaning of Cal. Penal Code &sect; 1203.1 because it was made without regard for defendant's ability to pay, and nothing suggested the trial court considered alternative means to serve the rehabilitative purpose of probation. Defendant also contended a condition that required her to seek and maintain gainful employment was unconstitutional pursuant U. S. Const. amend. XIII. The court held that a particularized inquiry was needed to establish a record by which the reasonableness of the condition could be determined. The trial court's judgment was affirmed. The court remanded the matter for reconsideration of the conditions of probation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, parent and activist taxpayer, appealed from the denial of their motion for a preliminary injunction by the Superior Court of Los Angeles County (California). Plaintiffs sought to bar enforcement of Cal. Educ. Code &sect;&sect; 44811 and 4812 by defendants, school and law enforcement officials. Plaintiffs argued that the statutes, which outlawed verbal abuse of a teacher in the presence of pupils or school personnel, were unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, parent and activist taxpayer, appealed the trial court's order that denied their motion for a preliminary injunction. Plaintiffs sought to bar defendants, school and law enforcement officials, from proceeding against plaintiff parent under Cal. Educ. Code &sect; 44811 for insulting a teacher in the presence of a pupil and for abuse of a teacher in the presence of other school personnel or pupils under Cal. Educ. Code &sect; 4812. Plaintiff parent was charged with a misdemeanor in connection with an altercation she had with her daughter's teacher on school grounds. She filed her action when defendants refused to cease prosecution. The court ruled that the trial court abused its discretion when it denied plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction. The court ruled that both statutes were so broadly drawn that they prohibited not only unprotected speech, but also speech protected by U.S. Const. amend. I. The court held that plaintiffs had satisfied both elements necessary for the issuance of a preliminary injunction because the statutes were unconstitutional and because the denial of basic constitutional freedoms even for only a brief period constituted irreparable harm.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged in a county with an offense while he was confined in another county.

Defendant sought review of the sentence imposed, contending that he was entitled to presentence custody credits on the basis of his &sect; 1381 demand for trial. The court agreed and remanded the matter to the trial court for resentencing. The court reasoned that &sect; 1381 was beneficial to prisoners because the advantage of having a trial on pending charges while serving an unrelated sentence provided the potential of a shorter sentence. The court ruled that the prosecutor's refusal to comply with &sect; 1381 requests in some instances but not in others due to any of a myriad of reasons created unconstitutional classifications in violation of U.S. Const. amend.

Appellant district attorney determined that the game as it was being played in respondents' card rooms was an illegal banking and percentage game. The trial court granted respondents' preliminary injunction enjoining appellant from preventing the playing of the game and specifically finding that the game, when played according to the trial court's order, was not a banking or percentage game. The order stated that a rental fee could be collected from a player's winnings, the amount wagered, or for the time that each participant played. The court reversed, agreeing with another appellate court's construction of Cal. Penal Code &sect; 330 that a percentage game was any game in which the house collected money calculated as a portion of the wagers made or sums won in play and did not need to involve house participation in the game, and, thus, the game of Pai Gow as played in respondents' card rooms was illegal.</SPAN></P>

Petitioner sought review by certiorari, arguing that there was no substantial evidence she had the ability to comply with the order or that she willfully disobeyed its commands. The appeals court annulled the judgment. The court ruled that the burden was on father to prove contempt beyond a reasonable doubt. The court stated that the trial court could not merely assume that petitioner could reasonably compel the teen to visit against the teen's strong wishes because there was no evidence to that effect. Similarly, the court ruled there was no showing that petitioner willfully violated the order. The court ruled that petitioner's mere joining with the teen in a telephone call to petitioner's attorney to inform him that the teen refused visitation was insufficient proof of willful violation.</SPAN></P>

Appellant board found that respondent had terminated the franchise without just cause under Cal. Veh. Code &sect; 3060. Respondent petitioned for a writ of mandamus, and the trial court overturned appellant board's decision. On appeal, the court reversed and rendered judgment for appellants, finding that because the dealer members of appellant board took no part in the decision, appellant board's decision was not unconstitutional. The court also found that the trial court incorrectly applied the independent judgment standard and that its determination that respondent had &quot;good cause&quot; to terminate the franchise was erroneous, regardless of the standard applied. Since appellant board's finding that the franchise was &quot;terminated&quot; was supported by substantial evidence, the trial court's finding to the contrary exceeded the proper scope of its review. Because respondent failed to send out appropriate notice, the court said that it failed to trigger the running of the limitations period for appellant franchisee's protest.</SPAN></P>

The Act differentiated between families receiving Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) grants and those who were not in determining the amount of child support awards. Plaintiff state of Washington, through which the child was drawing AFDC benefits, appealed the judgment. The reviewing court reasoned that in ordinary equal protection cases not involving suspect classification the classification was upheld if it bore a rational relationship to a legitimate state purpose. The maximization of benefits for needy families, minimization of public support burden, and maintenance of stable households for financially impoverished children was a legitimate state interest. The statute was constitutional and judgment was reversed.</SPAN></P>

The court held that even under a strict scrutiny standard of review, &sect; 798.76 did not violate constitutional principles of due process and equal protection, because the legislature had a sound basis to support its conclusion that a compelling state interest was involved in the sui generis treatment of mobilehome parks.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court granted a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction to plaintiff property management corporations. Defendant citizen's organization challenged the grant of the orders, and plaintiffs challenged the portion of the order invalidating plaintiffs' rules and regulations proscribing the solicitation of funds from plaintiffs' patrons in plaintiffs' downtown shopping center. The court reversed the grant of the preliminary injunction, holding that a significant part of plaintiffs' application process and by far the majority of the written and unwritten rules were constitutionally defective. The court held that much of plaintiffs' application procedure was overbroad and therefore constitutionally invalid. The court stated that the issue of the temporary restraining order was moot, but the court reached the merits of the argument, holding that the issue was likely to recur and yet evade review. The court held that the temporary restraining order, to the extent it enforced the Christmas holiday ban on petitioning activity, was justified.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, who were a student and a taxpayer, obtained judgment from the superior court declaring unconstitutional, under both state and federal constitutions, the inclusion of a religious invocation in defendant school district's high school graduation ceremonies. The graduation ceremony was a school-sponsored event, held upon school property purchased with tax funds. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's judgment, holding impermissible the inclusion of an invocation at a public school graduation ceremony, finding that it violated both the state and federal constitutions. The court noted that the Supreme Court had long interpreted U.S. Const. amend. I as commanding an absolute separation of church and state. The appellate court used the three-part Lemon test to determine whether defendant's action was a violation: the state action must have a secular purpose, its principal or primary effect must be one that neither advances nor inhibits religion, and it must not foster an excessive entanglement with religion. The also court noted that California had adopted the test. The court concluded that the state action violated the Lemon test.</SPAN></P>

Appellants challenged the judgment requiring reimbursement of the AFDC funds, alleging it violated equal protection. On appeal the court reversed the judgment, finding that the reimbursement of the AFDC funds by appellants was precluded as it violated the guarantees of the equal protection clause. The commitment of the ward to the group home was for the protection of society, protection of the public, rehabilitation of the ward, and protection of the family under Cal. Welf. &amp; Inst.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner accused murderer was charged with first degree murder in violation of Cal. Penal. Code. &sect; 187. At trial, he challenged each of two jury panels on the basis that neither panel represented a fair cross-section of the community. Petitioner moved to quash the venire or for mistrial, asserting that the Black population which was jury-eligible for that judicial district was unconstitutionally underrepresentative of the total jury-eligible Black population of Los Angeles County. The trial court denied appellant's motions finding that petitioner had failed to make a prima facie case of showing of a significant underrepresentation of a cognizable group. The court found that to make a prima facie showing of a violation of the fair cross-section requirement in the jury venire, a criminal defendant was required to show that the distinctive group in the venire from which jurors were selected was not fair in relation to the percentage of that group living within a 20-mile radius of that court.

Gov't Code &sect; 1126.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant police officer was granted a permit by the police department to serve civil process for a local hospital and that permit was subsequently revoked as being in conflict with his police duties under the restrictions in Cal.

Appellants, police officer and police officer's union, filed a grievance against appellee city and claimed that it imposed additional restrictions which were not included in &sect; 1126. On petition for writ of mandate to the trial court, appellants were denied their requested relief because the trial court found that appellee was allowed to impose any restriction under &sect; 1126 which did not conflict with the California constitution. On appeal, the court reversed and held that the list contained in &sect; 1126 restricted the ability of appellee to impose additional restraints on outside collateral employment by appellants under a plain meaning review of the statute. The court found that &sect; 1126 was not unconstitutional because off duty work by city police was a matter of statewide concern and the fact that &sect; 1126 impinged somewhat on local control was acceptable under Cal.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment which denied the petition for writ of mandate sought by appellants, police officer and police union, because the language of the statute imposing limitations on outside collateral employment should have been narrowly interpreted.

The court further held that the area on which appellant had an easement was suitable for recreational use because it was open and accessible to anyone hiking or biking and was, therefore, subject to the immunity provisions of &sect; 846.

Respondents mobilehome park owners requested rent increases from the rent review commission; the commission denied one increase and granted another.

In a writ of mandate proceeding under Cal. Civ. Proc.

Appellants sought review of the reversal of the commission's determinations. On appeal, the court and reinstated the commission's decisions. The court found that the rent increase did not involve an administrative decision that substantially affected fundamental rights and therefore the substantial evidence standard applied.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city's residential rehabilitation loan program provided property owners in designated areas with low-interest loans to rehabilitate residential property. Appellant landlords were allowed to pass through to tenants, under a prescribed rent formula, increased monthly loan payments and payments unrelated to rehabilitation of the property. Respondent tenants objected to a notice of rent increase. Rent board denied their appeal. Respondents petitioned to superior court for a writ of mandate, pursuant to Cal. Civ. Proc. Code &sect; 1094.5(b). The trial court granted a peremptory writ. The court found that the rent board had always allowed pass-throughs of preexisting debt service, not just rehabilitation-related loan payments, and that borrowers like appellant landlords had obviously relied on being able to pass through their mortgage debt. The court stated that its decision was based on compelling practical considerations. The success of the program depended on owners using the loan. Unless they would be able to pass through their costs, They would refrain from using the program. The judgment of the trial court in granting the writ was reversed.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed as to the application of MICRA to the state and the order allowing periodic payments by appellees, affirmed the rest, and remanded for modification of the judgment.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with first degree murder, attempted murder, and assault with a deadly weapon. A jury instruction provided that the jury must assume that defendant was of sound mind at the time of his alleged conduct. The jury found defendant guilty of all the charges and defendant was convicted of the charges. Defendant challenged the murder and attempted murder convictions. Upon appeal, the court reversed. The court held that the jury instruction was improper where the jury could have interpreted the instruction to mean defendant was required to prove his claim of diminished capacity. The court reasoned that it was the state's burden to show that defendant possessed the required state of mind when he committed the overt acts and that requiring defendant to prove diminished capacity was an unconstitutional shifting of the burden of proof of intent. The court held that the error was prejudicial where the instruction required the jury to assume defendant was of sound mind unless he proved contrary and the presumption directly affected the only element of the offenses that was in doubt and a reasonable juror could have entertained reasonable doubt as to intent.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner library district sought a writ of mandate against respondent county auditor when it challenged the constitutionality of Proposition 13's, Cal.

Proposition 13 substantially reduced the property tax revenues available to governments in the State of California. Petitioner claimed an exemption from Proposition 13's supermajority requirement on the grounds that the library district was not a special district within the meaning of the proposition and petitioner was not government by the supermajority requirement. Petitioner also alleged that the supermajority requirement should have been scrutinized because it interfered with the district's fundamental right to education guaranteed by the California Constitution. The court denied the writ of mandate and rejected both contentions.

The trial court heard argument on the merits of plaintiff contributing co-owners' suit to recover maintenance costs for a private right-of- way, confirmed the award of an arbitrator, and rendered a judgment against defendant.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff contributing co-owners applied with the trial court to obtain an impartial arbitrator to apportion costs associated with the maintenance of a private right-of-way pursuant to Cal.

The trial court appointed an arbitrator who held a hearing and rendered a decision that apportioned liability for the maintenance costs among the co-owners equally, which included defendant property owner. The trial court, without a trial de novo, confirmed the arbitrator's award. Upon review, the court reversed. The court found the confirmation arbitration procedure under Cal. Civ. Proc. Code &sect;&sect; 1286.2, 1286.6, did not apply to arbitration under Cal. Civ. Code &sect; 845 because those sections only applied to voluntary arbitration pursuant to an agreement. The court held that under Cal. Civ. Code &sect; 845 defendant was afforded the right to a trial de novo because fewer than all co-owners of the private right-of-way accepted the arbitrator's award apportioning maintenance costs. The court found that &sect; 845 entitled defendant to a trial before a judge and that it did not afford the right to a jury where the request for contribution was an equitable action.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court regarding five of the six settlements, holding the legislative scheme for sliding scale recovery agreements did not interfere with equal protection considerations. The parties that entered into the agreements were required to promptly inform the court and any jury. The court reversed one of the settlements because there was no notice to defendant and its existence was unknown but moments before its approval.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant minor appealed from the order of the Superior Court of Santa Clara County (California), which declared him a ward of the juvenile court and committed him to a rehabilitation facility for committing a battery on school grounds under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 243.2, and claimed that the trial court incorrectly used the clear proof standard under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 26 to determine his mental capacity, rather than beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant minor was declared a ward of the juvenile court and committed to a rehabilitation facility for 120 days as a result of being charged under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 594(b)(2) for malicious damage to property, under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 12020(a) for carrying a concealed dirk or dagger, and under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 243.2 for committing a battery on school grounds. Only the battery count was sustained. Defendant argued that the standard used at trial to determine his mental capacity should have been beyond a reasonable doubt. The court disagreed, affirmed the trial court's decision, and held that capacity of a minor to commit a crime within the meaning of Cal. Penal Code &sect; 26 was not an element of the crime and was not within the limited circumstances in which the reasonable doubt requirement applied to facts not identified as elements. The due process clause of the federal constitution did not require abandonment of the clear proof standard. The court held that the testimony at trial, the evidence of defendant's age, and the written and verbal instructions he received amply supported the trial court's finding that defendant knew it was wrong to fight at the time of the offense.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the lower court's judgment, which declared defendant minor a ward of the juvenile court, because defendant's criminal capacity was not a separate element of the crimes charged and the policy arguments provided no independent basis for judicially annulling the clear proof standard set forth by the legislature. Thus, the trial court correctly applied the clear proof standard in its determination of defendant's mental capacity.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff newspapers challenged, on constitutional grounds, the validity of a business tax collected by defendant city. Defendant was awarded summary judgment, and plaintiffs appealed. The court found that there was no constitutional problem with the tax and affirmed the judgment. The court noted that although the government could not unduly burden free speech through taxation or other regulatory measures, it was beyond dispute that the federal constitution did not exempt newspapers from generally applicable regulations and taxes. The court further stated that a compelling state interest was not needed to collect such a tax as long as newspapers were treated no differently than others who were similarly situated. The tax collected by defendant was applicable to those engaged in wholesale or retail business activities and, therefore, was a generally applicable tax that presented U.S. Const. amend. I problems. Furthermore, the various classifications and rates within the tax were neither arbitrary nor unreasonable. Finally, the court held that the tax provided clear guidelines for its administration, thus, it could not be considered an impermissible delegation of legislative duties.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the summary judgment awarded to defendant city because the business tax, which was challenged by plaintiff newspapers on First Amendment grounds, had broad application, and the various rates and classifications contained within it were neither arbitrary nor unreasonable.

On appeal, the court held that the trial court's application of &sect; 892 to determine paternity did not violate defendant's constitutional rights. Defendant did not prove that his rights under U.S. Const. amend. I were violated. Defendant was not wrongly denied a jury trial because U.S. Const. amend VI did not provide a right to a trial by jury in a paternity action which was civil in nature, and neither did U.S. Const. amend. XIV. Likewise, defendant did not have a right to a jury trial under U.S. Const. amend. VII because that right had not been incorporated into the due process clause of U.S. Const. amend. XIV and was not binding on the states. The paternity determination did not violate due process because the trial court's sanction met a two prong test: first, it was &quot;just;&quot; and second, ordering the blood tests was related to the particular &quot;claim&quot; in the discovery order, namely, evidence to prove defendant was the father.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner employer challenged a remedial order issued by respondent California Agricultural Labor Relations Board (board), arguing that the board's make-whole remedy under Cal. Lab. Code &sect; 1160.3, could not have been imposed in the absence of a finding that petitioner and real party in interest union would have entered into a collective bargaining agreement but for petitioner's bad faith bargaining.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the court remanded the case to respondent Agricultural Labor Relations Board (board) in order for the board to make findings as to whether petitioner employer and real party in interest union would have consummated a collective bargaining agreement in the absence of petitioner's unlawful refusal to bargain. The court found that consummation of a collective bargaining agreement was implied in Cal. Lab. Code &sect; 1160.3 as a prerequisite for application of the make-whole remedy. The test which the board was to apply was whether, but for petitioner's unlawful refusal to bargain, the parties would have concluded a collective bargaining agreement. On remand, the board was to apply a rebuttable presumption, affecting the burden of proof that such an agreement would have been consummated had the parties bargained in good faith. Good faith bargaining was defined as such bargaining that led to either a contract or a bona fide impasse (a deadlock). A legally cognizable impasse could not exist if the deadlock in negotiations was due to the failure of one of the parties to bargain in good faith.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court remanded the case to respondent Agricultural Labor Relations Board to allow it to make a finding as to whether petitioner employer and real party in interest union would have consummated a collective bargaining agreement providing for higher pay for employees in the absence of petitioner's unlawful refusal to bargain. The court upheld the board on all other challenges made by petitioner.</SPAN></P>

Appellants assessed the value of the hotel based on the purchase price. After the Assessment Appeal Board (AAB) denied his appeal, respondent filed a complaint for refund of real property taxes paid asserting that appellants had overvalued the hotel by failing to account for the below-market interest rate loan which respondent assumed from the bank as required by Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, &sect; 4. The trial court granted summary judgment and awarded respondent a refund for taxes paid and attorney fees. On appeal, the court affirmed in part holding that the debt at a below-market interest rate was to be discounted to its cash equivalent value to determine the value for purposes of property tax based on tit. 18, &sect; 4 and the legal definitions of fair market value. The court held that attorney fees were properly awarded under Cal. Rev. &amp; Tax. Code &sect; 5152.

Defendant legal father filed a motion for summary judgment contending that there was no triable issue as to the application of the conclusive presumption of Cal. Evid. Code &sect; 621(a). The trial court granted the motion, and on appeal, the court affirmed the grant of summary judgment, but remanded for determination as to whether cross-complainant was entitled to attorney fees and costs. Applying a balancing test, the court concluded that plaintiff and cross-complainant were not denied due process because their interests were outweighed by the state's interest in upholding the integrity of the family. The court rejected cross-complainant's equal protection claim, as &sect; 621 did not bar a suit by a child to establish paternity. Finally, the court held that defendant legal father was not estopped from asserting the conclusive presumption of &sect; 621, and that the law did not recognize both a legal and de facto father of the same child.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The prosecution appealed from a judgment of the Appellate Department of the Kern County Superior Court (California), which reversed the trial court's order dismissing the charges against respondents, cotton farmers, for violation of Cal. Food &amp; Agric. &sect; 5784 and holding that the charges should be reinstated, but that respondents were entitled to a jury trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent cotton farmers were charged with violation of Cal. Food &amp; Agric. &sect; 5784 and Cal. Admin. Code, tit. 3, &sect; 3595 (mandatory plowdown of cotton stalks). The trial court dismissed the charges because of an unconstitutional statutory denial of respondents' right to jury trials. Upon the state's appeal, the appellate division reinstated the charges, but held that respondents were entitled to jury trials pursuant to U.S. Const. art. III, &sect; 2, cl. 3 and Cal. Const. art. I, &sect; 16. On certified question, the court affirmed the order reinstating the charges against respondents, but remanded the case to the trial court with instructions to proceed to trial without a jury. In so holding, the court found that Cal. Penal Code &sect; 654 prohibited additional fines and assessments for multiacre violations of &sect; 5784, and thus the maximum that each respondent could be penalized was $ 850 ($ 500 fine plus $ 350 assessment). The court ruled that an $ 850 penalty constituted a petty offense and did not warrant a jury trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed in part and reversed in part. The court agreed that the charges against respondent cotton farmers should be reinstated, but held that, because each respondent could only be penalized $ 850 (a $ 500 fine plus a $ 350 assessment), respondents were not entitled to a jury trial. The court opined that, for an individual citizen, a penalty would have to exceed $ 1000 in order to warrant a jury trial.</SPAN></P>

The court, analyzing the language of &sect; 64(c), and declining to extend its provisions by implication, noted that &sect; 64(c) omitted any reference to property of the subsidiaries owned by the acquired corporation.

On appeal, the court reversed and held that the cocaine was inadmissible because the identification search of appellant's wallet violated the U. S. Const. amend. VI. The court found that the initial detention was proper because of the parking violation and an outstanding warrant, and that it was proper to order appellant out of the car because of the driver's furtive gesture, but there was no basis to search appellant's wallet.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant corporations, real property owners, merged with other companies. Respondent county subsequently reassessed appellants' real property for ad valorem tax purposes. Appellants filed action against respondent for refunds of ad valorem taxes paid on the grounds that the mergers did not constitute a change in ownership authorizing reassessment by respondent, and thus violated Cal. Const. art. XIII A, &sect; 2. The trial court affirmed the Assessment Appeals Board of Orange County's decision rejecting appellants' claim. Appellant sought review and the court affirmed, holding that under Cal. Rev. &amp; Tax. Code &sect; 64(c) appellants' mergers constituted changes of ownership justifying respondent's reassessment of the real property. The court rejected appellants' argument that their mergers fell within the &quot;affiliated group&quot; exemption to the change of ownership rules under Cal. Rev. &amp; Tax. Code &sect; 64(b), finding that this interpretation would allow corporations to easily avoid the &quot;ultimate control&quot; principle of &sect; 64(c).

The common law duty to support minor children did not authorize the state to recover the costs of confinement imposed for the protection of society and the minor and his rehabilitation.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An ordinance impacting governmental control of land use was proposed and adopted by referendum. Plaintiff citizens challenged the constitutionality of the ordinance by bringing suit against defendant county and its official representatives. Plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief, as well as a writ of mandate compelling defendant county officials to perform duties imposed by state law without regard to the provisions of the ordinance. Defendants did not contest the lawsuit and stipulated to the entry of judgment in favor of plaintiffs. The cause proceeded to trial with participation of intervenor residents, and the ordinance was declared unlawful on the ground that the ordinance purported to abrogate state laws. The writ of mandate was issued. On appeal by intervenors, the reviewing court found that specific provision of the ordinance were in conflict in whole or in part with state planning and zoning statutes as well as the California Environmental Quality Act, Cal. Pub. Res. Code &sect; 21000 et seq. Those portions that could not be severed to prevent conflict were deemed void; other portions were severed; and those portions not in conflict remained valid.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiffs' request for attorneys fees was denied, and all other requests for sanctions were denied.</SPAN></P>

The reasons why private litigants are required to comply with this type of statute apply equally to public agencies raising such challenges.  As the Supreme Court explained in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">City of L.A</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">., California decisions have not tended to exempt local governmental entities from these requirements.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court remanded the case to the court after having held that a &quot;capacity fee&quot; assessed by respondent water district against users of its sewer system, including appellant school district, constituted a special assessment from which governmental entities were impliedly exempt. The court was directed to consider whether appellant was entitled to a refund of the capacity fees it paid to respondent in prior years. The court held that appellant's claim for a refund was barred by Cal. Gov't Code &sect; 54995. First, the court noted that the capacity fees appeared facially barred by the 120-day limitations period in &sect; 54995, because appellant failed to take any legal steps to dispute the fees and filed its action for a refund nearly four years after the last fee payment. Second, appellant asserted that its refund claim was not time-barred under the common law rule that statutes of limitation did not apply against the state unless the legislature expressly made them applicable. The court held, however, that the common law rule relied on by appellant was inapplicable to school districts.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant taxpayer brought an action against respondent county for a refund of real property taxes paid in the first year of its ownership because the purchase price was much less than respondent's current assessment. Respondent successfully demurred and the action was dismissed. Appellant argued that respondent's assessment procedures violated Cal. Const. art. XIII A, &sect; 2. The court held that nothing in Cal. Const. art. XIII A expressly changed or prohibited the challenged aspect of the assessment procedure. Accordingly, the legislature did not violate this article when it incorporated the rate and assessed value restrictions of the constitutional amendment into the existing assessment procedure by enacting Cal. Rev. &amp; Tax. Code &sect; 50.  Cal. Rev. &amp; Tax. Code &sect; 50 provided that appellant's property would be reappraised as of the date of its purchase and entered with the new value on the roll for the next succeeding lien date.

The court further held that the penalty was not cruel or unusual as to defendant in light of her personal characteristics and the nature of the crime.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">By way of a petition for a writ of administrative mandate, appellant employee sought to reverse respondents', a county sheriff and board of supervisors', decision to terminate appellant from his deputy sheriff's job. After a pharmacist called respondent sheriff claiming that appellant had just filled a questionable prescription and appeared to be &quot;on&quot; something, appellant admitted injecting himself with drugs during work hours and falsifying a prescription. Appellant claimed he injected himself with a painkilling prescription drug to combat a migraine headache. Respondents fired appellant for dishonesty and for discrediting the county by conduct unbecoming an officer. Upon review, the court of appeals held that appellant's behavior violated Tuolumne County, Cal., Ordinance 2.56.269(f) and (o). The ordinance was not void for vagueness because it gave a person of ordinary intelligence notice of the prescribed conduct. Appellant's theory that he was actually fired because of absenteeism due to a disability, chronic migraines, was not supported by the evidence. An almost three-year delay in commencing the disciplinary action did not violate due process. The court affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant physician appealed from a decision by the Superior Court of Los Angeles County (California) that denied defendant's request to reduce the award of noneconomic damages and to order periodic payment of certain future damages to plaintiff patient in a medical malpractice case.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant physician was plaintiff patient's anesthesiologist during a surgical procedure that resulted in plaintiff sustaining permanent brain damage and being rendered a quadriplegic. Plaintiff filed a medical malpractice action and obtained a damage award. The issues raised by the appeal focused on the damage award and the constitutionality and applicability of various portions of the Medical Injury Compensation Reform Act of 1975 (MICRA). Defendant requested the court to apply MICRA to reduce the award of noneconomic damages to $ 250,000 and to order periodic payment of future damages in excess of $ 50,000. The court denied defendant's request, and defendant appealed. The court found plaintiff's constitutional claims failed under the doctrine of stare decisis. MICRA had been constitutionally upheld by the state supreme court. The court also found that defendant had not waived his right to invoke either Cal. Civ. Code &sect; 3333.2 or Cal. Civ. Proc. Code &sect; 667.7. Therefore, the court found that it was appropriate for the award of noneconomic damages to be reduced and for defendant to be able to make the periodic payments. The decision was reversed and remanded.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decision awarding plaintiff damages was reversed and remanded. The court found the legislative intent was for a medical malpractice defendant's noneconomic damages to be limited and for defendant to be able to make periodic payments. Under the doctrine of stare decisis, precedent holding the limitation of noneconomic damages to be constitutional was binding on the court.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff homeless residents appealed from a judgment of the Superior Court of San Diego County (California), which dismissed their lawsuit for mandate, injunction, and declaratory relief after sustaining without leave to amend the demurrer of defendant county supervisors. The lawsuit challenged the validity of county regulations terminating general relief payments to any recipient not obtaining a &quot;valid address&quot; within 60 days.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A county regulation terminated general relief payments to recipients not obtaining a &quot;valid address&quot; within 60 days. Challenging the regulation as statutorily and constitutionally invalid, plaintiff homeless residents filed a lawsuit for mandate, injunction, and declaratory relief. The trial court sustained the demurrer of defendant county supervisors, and dismissed. The court reversed. The court held that defendants' action in not providing general relief to homeless but eligible residents violated its statutory duties under Cal. Welf. &amp; Inst. Code &sect; 17000 to aid its indigent resident population. The court found, for example, that one homeless plaintiff had been a resident of the county for most of the past 41 years. The court said that to be valid under the general relief statutes, a county's &quot;valid address&quot; regulations had to be consistent, not in conflict with the statutes and reasonably necessary to effectuate the statutory purpose. Although a &quot;valid address&quot; could have been an objective criterion useful in proving residence, it was not necessary to a determination of &quot;true residence.&quot; The court did not need to address plaintiffs' constitutional claims.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the judgment of the Superior Court of San Diego County (California), which convicted him on one count each of conspiracy to commit murder, Cal. Penal Code, &sect;&sect; 182(1) and 187, and attempted murder, Cal. Penal Code &sect;&sect; 187 and 664, and found true the allegations that defendant used a firearm and inflicted great bodily injury.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed convictions of conspiracy to commit murder and attempted murder. The court affirmed the convictions but struck certain sentencing enhancements, finding that error in admitting evidence of an unrelated conspiracy did not require reversal because it was not reasonably probable that a more favorable result would have been reached. The court found no reversible jury instruction error. The incomplete instructions on conspiracy to commit first-degree murder did not require reversal because defendant could not demonstrate that he was guilty of a lesser offense, nor did the express malice instruction pose a danger of misleading the jury. Further, the trial court was not required to instruct the jury that defendant's wife was an accomplice because that was a fact question, and defendant waived other error by failing to object. The court reversed the sentence enhancements pursuant to Cal. Penal Code &sect; 667 because prior convictions only established those facts which were necessarily adjudicated. The court also reversed the great bodily harm enhancement because it did not apply to the crime of murder and, thus, did not apply to conspiracy to commit the crime.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court struck the sentencing enhancement and the great bodily harm enhancement but affirmed the rest of the trial court's judgment convicting defendant of conspiracy to commit murder and attempted murder and enhancing his sentence for use of a firearm. The court found that no jury instruction error was reversible.</SPAN></P>

Appellant's petition for a writ of mandate was denied, and she sought review. The court held appellant waived her objection to the trial court's failure to file a written decision because she did not request a written statement orally or in writing. The court found that the personnel rule under which appellant was terminated was not unconstitutionally vague because the prohibitions included in the rule were ascertainable to a person of common intelligence; appellant knew or should have known that the commission of welfare fraud would discredit respondent. The court determined that substantial evidence supported the finding that appellant violated the personnel rule, and concluded that appellant's termination was not an excessive punishment. As there was a rational connection between appellant's conduct and her employment, appellant clearly discredited and defrauded respondent, and there was no abuse of discretion in terminating appellant.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant theater owner challenged a judgment denying writ of mandate by which appellant sought to set aside the revocation of his permit to conduct a motion picture show. Appellant contended that the revocation of respondent Board of Police Commissioners of the City of Los Angeles violated his state and federal free speech guarantees. The court disagreed, concluding that an U.S. Const. amend. I analysis was inapplicable to appellant's challenge to Los Angeles, Cal.., Municipal Code &sect; 103.109(e)(2). Section 103.109(e)(2) was not directed at any First Amendment activity but went to unlawful public sexual conduct. Cal. Const. art. I, &sect; 2's additional free speech guarantee did not afford further protection to appellant because the state's interest in regulating theaters was lawfully furthered by the prohibition of illegal sexual conduct. Substantial evidence, including that a guard was employed for cosmetic purposes, supported the trial court's finding that appellant failed to take vigorous action to supervise his premises. Section 103.109(e)(2) did not require evidence that appellant had personal knowledge of each incident of unlawful conduct. Accordingly, the judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant state controller sought review of the decision of the Superior Court of Santa Clara County (California), which ordered the state to pay attorneys' fees in the matter of a contested inheritance tax, from the funds of the Office of the State Controller and directed that the payment be made from the 1985-1986 budget of the state of California or from other appropriated funds.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An inheritance referee reported that decedent's estate owed inheritance taxes. Respondent executors objected to the taxes because the inheritance tax was repealed by a local proposition. The appellate court held that the imposition of inheritance taxes was precluded as to deceased. Upon remand, respondents were awarded attorneys' fees under Cal. Civ. Proc. Code &sect; 1021.5. After appellant informed respondents that attorneys' fees were limited, they sought to collect the attorneys' fees from the State Board of Control, which requested monies to pay the award from the then current budge act. That collection effort failed when the appropriation was deleted. The lower court ordered that the attorneys' fees be paid from the 1985-1986 budget. The court reversed the lower court's order because it violated the separation of powers doctrine insofar as it directed the controller to pay an amount in excess of those restrictions. Furthermore, no party pointed to appropriations other than line-item 9810-001-001 of the 1985 Budget Act which were available for payment of respondents' fee award. Consequently, the lower court's order was overbroad.</SPAN></P>

The trial court entered a judgment in respondent's favor, awarding general and punitive damages. Appellant then unsuccessfully filed a motion for a new trial and for judgment notwithstanding the verdict. After appellant's motions were denied, it filed a timely notice of appeal. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's award of general damages in favor of respondent and reversed the punitive damages award with the right of new trial on the basis of tort liability. The court held that under the given instructions, the jury could not have determined that appellant was liable in tort for breach of covenant of good faith and fair dealing because of special relationship, because as a matter of law no special relationship existed between the parties.</SPAN></P>

The court also held that the trial court properly conducted the trial in accordance with the limitations of Cal.

Appellant did not seek judicial review of the decision and respondent filed a petition for writ of mandate and complaint for declaratory judgment. The trial court issued a writ of mandate and ordered appellant to pay the costs. On appeal, three cases were consolidated. The court affirmed with modifications and held that appellant had waived its right to challenge the board's findings and also was collaterally estopped from doing so.

The U.S. Supreme Court remanded for further consideration in light of its decision in Metromedia, Inc. v. City of San Diego, 543 U.S. 490, 69 L.Ed.2d 800, 101 S.Ct. 2882 (1981).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant outdoor advertiser challenged the constitutionality of respondent city's ordinance, which regulated offsite signs in general commercial zoning districts and in unclassified zones. The trial court concluded that the ordinance was valid, that appellant's signs were public nuisances as a matter of law; and that appellant was not entitled to damages for the removal of its offsite advertising signs. On remand from the U.S. Supreme Court, the court held that appellant was entitled to damages for a sign that was in place prior to the federal Highway Beautification Act, 23 U.S.C.S. &sect; 131, but affirmed the remainder of the trial court's order, finding that the ordinance was constitutional. The terms &quot;commercial&quot; and &quot;noncommercial&quot; did not need to be codified because they were sufficiently defined by the U.S. Supreme Court. Also, the ordinance constitutionally favored property owners because a private individual has greater protection under U.S. Const. amend. I to free speech on his own property, and discrimination between offsite and onsite billboards without reference to the contents of the message was valid where the shape of the sign was the concern addressed by the ordinance.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">During the initial dissolution of marriage proceedings, the trial court concluded that appellant wife had a community property interest in a certain portion of respondent husband's judicial retirement benefits, but reserved jurisdiction over valuing appellant's share until such time as respondent was eligible to retire. When respondent became eligible to retire, appellant filed a motion seeking her proportionate share of respondent's retirement benefits. The trial court ordered that appellant receive monthly payments at a percentage of the gross amount during the joint lives of appellant and respondent, to terminate and revert to respondent on appellant's death. Appellant challenged the validity of the terminable interest rule, as applied to the Judges' Retirement Act. On appeal, the court held that the trial court's order was correct when entered, but nevertheless reversed the order and remanded the cause. The court directed the trial court, on rehearing, to apply the recently enacted Cal. Civ.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff injured party, a passenger in a minor's car, was injured when minor caused the automobile to crashed. Plaintiff brought an action against defendant hosts, who had sold alcohol to minor at a private party earlier in the evening when he was obviously intoxicated. The trial court sustained defendants' demurrer without leave to amend, holding that defendants were immune from liability under Cal. Civ. Code &sect; 1714(c), and Cal. Bus. &amp; Prof. Code &sect; 25602(b). The court deemed the minute order sustaining the demurrer to incorporate an order of dismissal and considered the appeal. The court held that the legislature enacted &sect; 1714(c), and &sect; 25602(b), to overrule a line of case law that had extended liability against alcoholic beverage providers for injuries arising from alcohol consumption. The court held that the exception to this immunity, Cal. Bus. &amp; Prof. Code &sect; 25602.1, could not be invoked because defendants were not licensed vendors. The court held that the legislature created broad immunity against liability occasioned by the furnishing of alcoholic beverages, which extended to an unlicensed host who sells alcoholic beverages to an obviously intoxicated minor.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff fabricator and defendants, wholesaler and retailer, filed petitions for alternative writ and writ of mandate in the California Supreme Court after the appellate court affirmed the trial court's ruling that the Fair Responsibility Act of 1986, Cal.

Code &sect;&sect; 1431.1-1431.5, and the trial court held that the Act was lawful , that it applied to all cases not yet tried before its effective date, while no fault was attributable to the manufacturers, fault was attributable to all who contributed to plaintiff's injuries and not just plaintiff and defendants, and liability for future medical expenses and lost earnings were joint and several obligations. All parties sought writs of mandate which were denied by the appellate court.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state appealed a decision of the Superior Court of Los Angeles County (California), which declined to sentence defendant to the minimum sentence of three years for pandering in violation of Cal.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state sought review of the trial court's decision to refuse to sentence defendant to the minimum sentence of three years, pursuant to Cal. Penal Code &sect; 1203.06, for pandering in violation of Cal. Penal Code &sect;266(i) because it would have constituted cruel and unusual punishment. The state contended that the pandering statute did not inherently impose cruel and unusual punishment. The court held that Cal. Penal Code &sect;1203.065 was constitutional and did not inherently impose cruel and unusual punishment. However, the court held that there was nothing in California law which limited the trial court's discretion to determine that the sentence was disproportionate to a defendant's individual culpability. The court affirmed the decision of the trial court because the application of a minimum three-year prison sentence to the defendant in this case constituted cruel and unusual punishment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the ruling of the trial court to refuse to invoke a three year minimum sentence on defendant because there was nothing in California law which prohibited a trial court from using its discretion and determining that the sentence was disproportionate to defendant's culpability.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant agency sought review of the decision of the Superior Court of Calaveras County (California), which issued a peremptory writ of mandate directing appellant to relieve respondent former employer's reserve account of charges for claimant former employee's unemployment benefits.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Claimant, a former employee, filed for unemployment benefits after she voluntarily resigned from her employment with respondent former employer in anticipation of imminent marriage and relocation to a new residence, making her commute to work impracticable. Appellant agency granted claimant's application for unemployment benefits pursuant to Cal. Unemp. Ins. Code &sect; 1256 and charged respondent's reserve account for the amount paid to claimant. The lower court issued a peremptory writ of mandate directing appellant to relieve respondent's account of charges for claimant's benefits, holding that the word &quot;spouse,&quot; which for purposes of &sect; 1256 included &quot;imminent spouse,&quot; had the same meaning for purposes of Cal. Unemp. Ins. Code &sect; 1032. The court reversed, construing the word &quot;spouse&quot; to mean a husband or wife, not someone who has not yet attained that status, based on the clear and unambiguous language of &sect; 1032. The court found that the amendment to &sect; 1256 chose to enlarge the meaning of the word &quot;spouse&quot; as used in that section without mention of &sect; 1032. The court noted that such selective silence was significant in showing that a different intent existed as to each provision.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment, holding that the word &quot;spouse&quot; in one provision was not synonymous with the identical word as used in another provision of the unemployment insurance code. The court remanded the matter with directions to the lower court to deny the writ.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's denial of the declaratory and injunctive relief sought by appellant commercial parking facility against respondent city, which had passed an ordinance imposing a business license tax upon such parking facilities. Finding that appellant had failed to exhaust its administrative remedies in challenging the way respondent classified its business, the court then considered the constitutionality of the tax. It rejected appellant's claim that the tax should have been apportioned because a substantial part of its revenues was derived from driving its customers outside the city, finding that the taxable event was its provision of a parking facility inside the city. It found that the ordinance did not violate appellant's equal protection rights, noting that tax classifications carried a presumption of constitutionality and that respondent's justification for the ordinance, equalizing the tax burden among various municipal businesses, was rational. Finally, the court found that although appellant's customers were air travelers, the ordinance's effect on interstate commerce was so indirect and insubstantial that it could not be described as discriminatory.</SPAN></P>

When he was arrested, the police failed to advise him, as was required by statute, that if he took a breath test, the results could not be preserved for later reanalysis.

Petitioner moved to suppress the evidence of the breath tests for the failure of the police to give the statutory advice. After denial of his motion, petitioner pleaded not guilty, lost an appeal of his subsequent conviction, and sought habeas corpus review. Petitioner asserted that the police department had a deliberate policy of not giving the required statutory advisements.

No. 244-81, which imposed a fee designed to compensate for the increased transit traffic resulting from construction of new office space in the downtown area. Appellant developers sought to have the ordinance declared invalid on its face, and challenged retroactive application of the ordinance. The trial court found that the ordinance was not a tax but a development fee, and its retroactive application was legal. The court held that the charge was a reasonably imposed fee to compensate for the additional burden on city services occasioned by the new construction and was not violative of appellants' due process or equal protection rights. The court upheld the trial court's judgment against one class of appellants who sought to declare the ordinance invalid. The court reversed the judgment as to the other class of appellants and found that retroactive application of the ordinance was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, city and county, enacted an ordinance to provide public transit services for new downtown development. The ordinance required owners of certain buildings to pay a transit fee as a condition of issuance of a certificate of completion. In a consolidated appeal, plaintiffs, building owners, appealed from a judgment upholding the validity of the ordinance. They contended that the trial court erred in treating the ordinance as a development fee and in finding that the ordinance could not be successfully challenged under the constitution. The court affirmed, holding that the transit fee was not a special tax within the meaning of Cal. Const. art. XIII A, &sect; 4 and therefore was not the type of revenue intended to be controlled by art. XIII B. It was imposed as a condition of development of real property, which was not a regulatory license, user fee, or charge. It was charged one time, and did not recur as does a property tax. Furthermore, the transit fee was designed specifically to fund maintenance and development, whereas a property tax provides general revenue to cover a wide range of municipal services.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff cable company signed a franchise agreement with defendant city that purported to regulate the rates plaintiff could charges. Subsequently, plaintiff filed an action claiming that the Cable Rate Deregulation Act, Cal. Gov't Code &sect; 53066.1, preempted local rate regulation. Reviewing the language of &sect; 53066.1, the court held that the statute preempted municipal regulations governing cable rates because the statute fully covered the issue and indicated its subject matter was of statewide concern. Additionally, the court held that federal law, specifically the Cable Communications Policy Act of 1984, sanctioned the state's preemption of cable rate regulation. The court then rejected defendant's claim that preemption by &sect; 53066.01 amounted to an unconstitutional impairment of contracts; instead, the court held that plaintiff, as a political subdivision of the state, had no standing to raise the defense of impairment of contracts in opposition to a legislative act. Nonetheless, the court found that the statute did not unconstitutionally impair the right to contract. Thus, the court affirmed the grant of summary judgment in favor of plaintiff.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Subsequent to being convicted of pimping and pandering, defendant argued that the trial court violated his right to counsel by denying his motion for a continuance to seek substitute counsel on the first day of trial. However, the court held that the trial court acted within its discretion in denying defendant's motion for a continuance because defendant failed to establish that he made a good faith, diligent effort to obtain retained counsel before the scheduled trial date. In so holding, the court noted that defendant's right to counsel did not include the right to be represented by a specific attorney from the firm appointed to defend him and that the counsel representing defendant stated that he was prepared for the trial. Reviewing the case, the court then held that any prosecutorial comment concerning defendant's failure to testify at trial was harmless error in light of the trial court's curative instruction and the overwhelming evidence in support of defendant's guilt. Applying a three-part test, the court then concluded that the trial court's denial of the opportunity for probation, pursuant to Cal.

Defendants appealed, arguing that the jury was not instructed that it was required to unanimously agree upon which overt act was committed in furtherance of a conspiracy and that they were erroneously punished for both the conspiracy and the substantive offenses which were its object. The court ruled that any error in failure to give a specific unanimity instruction was harmless because there was no realistic possibility of disagreement among the jurors as to the fact of the alleged overt acts. Further, the court held that punishment for both conspiracy and the underlying offense was impermissible when the conspiracy contemplated only the act performed in the offense. The court modified and affirmed the judgment, concluding that sentencing under Cal.

After the hearing, the Federal Uniform Former Spouses' Protection Act, 10 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1001 was enacted and retroactively allowed modification of community property judgments to include division of military retirement benefits. California also passed sunset legislation,&nbsp;Cal. Civ. Code &sect; 5124, to allow retroactive modification. Thereafter, appellant filed a motion to modify the dissolution judgment to include respondent's military retirement. The trial court denied her motion and declared that Cal. Civ. Code &sect; 5124 was unconstitutional. Appellant filed a notice of appeal. The court first held that the entry into the minutes of the trial court denial of appellant's &sect; 5124 postjudgment motion was an appealable order. However, the court held that it was without jurisdiction to hear the appeal because her notice of appeal was filed over a month late. Pursuant to Cal. R. Ct. 2(a), appellant had 180 days after the date of entry of judgment to file her notice of appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court dismissed appellant former wife's appeal of the trial court's denial of her motion to reopen and modify her dissolution of marriage from respondent former husband to include respondent's military retirement as a divisible community property asset. The court lacked jurisdiction because the time for filing notice of appeal was mandatory and because appellant's notice was filed subsequent to expiration of the statutory period.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court determined that despite a history of violent offenses against women, appellant was not a habitual offender as defined by Cal.

The court further found that the trial court had erred in instructing the jury on the elements which made an enhancement applicable, but determined the error harmless beyond a reasonable doubt because the missing element was proven by uncontroverted evidence.

Appellant also claimed the ordinance was an antitrust violation because it was an unlawful restraint on trade. Appellant sought declaratory and injunctive relief from the court, which granted summary judgment in favor of respondents, the municipality and its police chief.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner seller was charged with violating Los Angeles, Cal., Municipal Ord. 42.03, which prohibited selling tickets in public places to events to take place in a place of public assemblage. Petitioner challenged the constitutionality of the ordinance, which was upheld by the lower court. He then sought a writ of review, claiming the ordinance was an anti-scalping ordinance that deprived him of property without due process. The People, real party in interest, asserted that it was not an anti-ticket scalping ordinance because it did not totally prevent sale or resale of tickets or regulate resale prices, just sales at certain locations. The court found the ordinance to be overly broad, but that it was rationally related to protecting the public against fraud and counterfeiters. The court affirmed the lower court's finding that the ordinance was constitutional, but gave it a narrow construction to preserve its validity. The court determined that the ordinance applied only to offers to sell or resell made by those in the business or practice of selling tickets where both the solicitation and sale took place on public property.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The lower court's determination that an anti-ticket scalping ordinance petitioner seller was charged with violating was constitutional was affirmed because, narrowly construed, the ordinance was reasonably related to the People's interest in protecting the public against fraud.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff brought a personal injury action against defendant employer. The trial court granted defendant's motion for summary judgment on the grounds that when plaintiff was injured, he was defendant's employee as a matter of law pursuant to Cal. Lab. Code &sect; 2750.5 and that the dual capacity doctrine was inapplicable. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment. First, the court held that plaintiff was not an independent contractor because a prerequisite of being an independent contractor was being properly licensed. The court stated that although plaintiff was hired through third party, a finding that third party was defendant's employee due to his failure to be properly licensed, meant plaintiff was also defendant's employee. Thus, plaintiff was limited to the workers' compensation. Lastly, the court held that defendant was not liable under the dual capacity doctrine because plaintiff failed to demonstrate that defendant manufactured a product for sale to the public and the risk thereby created was the same as the one to which plaintiff was exposed. In addition, the court held that the doctrine was not applicable to defendant's concurrent role as an owner or occupier of land.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court.

She received the lower term of three years in prison after the trial court stated that it would have granted probation except for the mandate of Cal. Penal Code &sect; 1203.065. Defendant argued that the legislature could not validly deny probation to all persons convicted of violating Cal. Penal Code &sect; 266i, nor impose a mandatory three-year minimum sentence for a nonaggravated, nonviolent pandering offense. These punishments, she contended, were cruel and unusual. The court held that although defendant argued that pandering was not a serious crime, the opinion of the legislature was to the contrary. The panderer commonly preyed on very young women. The court concluded that it was legislatively reasonable to make prostitution a misdemeanor, but to impose a more serious penalty for one who would force, promise, threaten, or encourage another to be a prostitute.</SPAN></P>

The amended provisions of Medi-Cal, which limited health services to those medically necessary to prevent significant illness, to alleviate severe pain, to protect life, or to prevent significant disability, were consistent with the Act. Medi-Cal's definition of medical necessity in Cal. Welf. &amp; Inst. Code &sect; 14059.5 was a proper limitation on services within the discretion provided by the federal law because it did not single out any particular condition and it was reasonable on its face. Moreover, the system of prior authorization was not violative of the Act because it was a permissible utilization control device contemplated by the Act, approved by the responsible agency and upheld by the court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment in part and vacated the writ in part. The court concluded that the provisions of Medi-Cal, Cal. Welf. &amp; Inst. Code &sect; 14000 et seq., were not inconsistent with the federal Medicaid Act, 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1396 et seq., because the restrictions were reasonable and within the state's discretion. The court also held the system of authorization was not violative of the Medicaid Act, and therefore, the cross-appeal was moot.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of possession of marijuana for sale, Cal. Health &amp; Safety Code &sect; 11359. Defendant appealed, arguing his motions for mistrial, acquittal and suppression should have been granted, and asserting the search of his property violated U.S. Const. amend. IV. The court held that defendant's motion for mistrial was properly denied because the objectionable testimony did not prejudice defendant's defense. Defendant's motion for acquittal was also properly denied because all elements of the crime were established by substantial circumstantial evidence and reasonable inferences. The court found that defendant failed to preserve his objection to the search of his property because he did not object to the search at trial. Regardless, defendant did not have a reasonable expectation of privacy in crops in a field, and the aerial search of his fields was constitutional; police observations occurred within public airspace in a nonintrusive manner. Finally, defendant's motion to suppress evidence was properly denied as the police substantially complied with the evidence destruction requirements of Cal. Health &amp; Safety Code &sect; 11479. Defendant's conviction was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">During their marriage, appellant wife and respondent husband established a joint bank account that was almost exclusively funded from respondent's separate property funds. Respondent used that account to make payments on his separate property, including a home and several motor vehicles. Appellant requested reimbursement of those contributions from the joint account but the trial court, applying Cal. Civ. Code &sect; 4800.2, traced respondent's separate property through the joint account to subsequently purchased or improved property and confirmed the subsequently purchased property was his separate property. Therefore, the trial court ordered respondent reimbursed for his separate contributions to improved community property, and denied appellant's request for reimbursement. On appeal, the court held that application of Cal. Civ. Code &sect; 4800.2 to property acquired prior to January 1, 1984, deprived appellant of vested property rights without due process of law because her property rights vested before the enactment of the statute and could not be altered, absent a significantly important state interest.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A marital settlement agreement between appellant husband and respondent wife, which included a provision that appellant's military retirement benefits were his separate property, was incorporated by reference into a final judgment of dissolution. The trial court subsequently granted respondent's request to divide those retirement benefits pursuant to Cal. Civ.

On appeal, the reviewing court rejected appellant's contention that the application of &sect; 5124&nbsp;unconstitutionally impaired his contract rights under the United States and California constitutions. Although the court found that under certain circumstances, modification pursuant to &sect; 5124 might result in an unconstitutional distortion of the parties' bargain, here the parties had stipulated to a substantially equal division of their community property. There was no evidence that modification would result in a substantial unequal division of the remainder of the marital property.

Thus, appellants were not beyond &sect; 4370's reach. Further, the court held that the trial court had jurisdiction to make an award of fees. The trial court acquired subject matter jurisdiction by respondent's complaint in joinder alleging appellants held and claimed properly in which she had a community property interest. The court concluded that application of &sect; 4370 was reasonably related to a proper legislative goal, was fundamentally fair, and did not violate the constitutional rights of appellants.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Intervenor Department of Fair Employment and Housing filed an accusation against plaintiff club for alleged violations of the Fair Employment and Housing Act (FEHA), Cal. Gov't Code &sect; 12920 et seq. The accusation alleged that plaintiff, as an employer covered by the FEHA, had, in violation of the FEHA, pursued a discriminatory hiring policy which systematically excluded women from all temporary and permanent jobs at certain locations. The trial court granted plaintiff's petition for a writ of mandamus and dismissed the action against plaintiff. On appeal, the court stated that the FEHA's inclusion of private clubs in no way hindered the overriding objective of eliminating employment discrimination in Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 2000e. The evidence overwhelmingly established that club members preferred male employees; however, customer preference could not form the basis of a bona fide occupational qualification defense. The court held the fact that plaintiff was a private club did not exempt it from high legal authority which unequivocally declared that employment decisions could not be predicated upon stereotyped characterizations of the sexes.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed that part of the judgment denying attorney fees to plaintiff club and in all other aspects reversed the judgment with directions to the trial court to reinstate the findings of defendant Fair Employment and Housing Commission. Plaintiff's employment decisions could not be predicated upon stereotyped characterizations of the sexes, and club members' preference for male employees could not form the basis of qualification defense.</SPAN></P>

The court held that although the court possessed the authority to strike the enhancement, it abused its discretion because it made no finding of circumstances which could support striking the enhancement other than that it took the circumstances into consideration in selecting the upper term.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner, inmate at a state hospital, was charged with various criminal offenses and found not guilty by reason of insanity. Petitioner was committed to a state hospital. Petitioner sought a writ of mandate after respondent court refused to grant petitioner's demand to have a jury determine whether he was suitable for a one-year placement in a local mental health program. The court denied petitioner's request for a writ of mandate and found that the language and the requirements of Cal. Penal Code &sect; 1026.2(e), did not require that a jury make the initial placement decision. The court held that because of the procedural safeguards found in Cal. Penal Code &sect; 1026.2(a), (d), (j), due process did not require that an applicant pursuant to &sect; 1026.2(e) be given a jury trial at the initial placement proceeding.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, indigent proponent of a ballot argument, challenged the decision of the Superior Court for the City and County of San Francisco (California), which denied appellant's petition for a peremptory writ of mandate. Appellant contended that a local regulation which required the proponent of a ballot argument to pay a fee before it was published in the voter's handbook violated U.S. Const. amend XIV; Cal. Const. art. I, &sect; 7.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, indigent proponent of a ballot argument, submitted to respondent, registrar of voters, a ballot argument in favor of an act and a declaration of indigency. Respondent returned appellant's argument for failure to prepay the estimated printing costs. Appellant petitioned the trial court for a peremptory writ of mandate to require respondent to accept his ballot argument for inclusion in the voter information pamphlet and to waive the publication fee required by the San Francisco Administrative Code. Appellant's petition was denied and he sought review. The court held that by permitting individuals to submit ballot arguments for publication in the voter's information handbook the city and county created a forum for the exercise of political expression. The court held that San Francisco, Cal. Admin. Code &sect; 5.74, violated state and federal guarantees of equal protection by qualifying an individual's participation in the electoral process solely upon his ability to pay the administrative (i.e., publication) costs. The court reversed the denial of appellant's petition and remanded the cause to the trial court with directions to dismiss the petition as moot.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed and remanded to the trial court with instruction to dismiss the petition as moot. The court held the denial of petitioner's, indigent proponent of a ballot argument, request for a writ of mandate was improper where the city ordinance requiring payment of a fee before a ballot argument was published violated the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and impeded free expression guaranteed by the First Amendment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant property owners brought an inverse condemnation action against respondents, Imperial Irrigation District and the Coachella Valley Water District, after respondents flooded their land. Appellants vacated their land, and then unsuccessfully requested relocation assistance benefits from respondents under the Relocation Assistance Act, Cal. Gov't Code &sect;&sect; 7260(c)(g), 7262. Appellants sought judicial intervention to compel respondents to provide the assistance, but the trial court denied their request holding that the statute was inapplicable to inverse condemnation actions. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment in part, and reversed in part. The court held that appellant's request was premature. The court noted that parties who successfully bring inverse condemnation actions are entitled to relocation assistance benefits under the statute if they are actually displaced by the inverse condemnation. In the present case, however, appellant's condemnation claim had not been fully and finally adjudicated. Therefore respondent's negative determination of benefits was untimely. The court awarded appellants costs on appeal.</SPAN></P>

The city made an agreement with plaintiff police association to amend its Public Employee's Retirement System (PERS) contract and add a benefit provided by Cal. Gov't Code &sect; 20862.8.

Plaintiff was granted a preemptory writ of mandate requiring the amendment's acceptance. Defendant sought review of the writ, and plaintiff sought review of a denial of attorney fees under Cal. Civ.

It determined that the rationale that justified the different treatment was that more children were in need of foster care than were receiving it; that persons having a family tie to a child would provide assistance without financial incentive to do so; that persons having no family tie would not provide foster care unless financially induced to do so; and that if the savings resulting from the denial of benefits to related foster parents were instead used to increase the benefits to unrelated foster parents, more foster care would be provided to all children in need thereof than if the limited public funds available were used to provide benefits to related as well as unrelated foster parents.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his conviction for possession of methamphetamine in violation of Cal. Health &amp; Safety Code &sect; 11377 on the ground that the drug evidence should have been suppressed. The court affirmed the conviction and held that defendant was lawfully detained at the time the drugs were discovered because the officer suspected that defendant had violated Cal. Bus. &amp; Prof. Code &sect; 25665 by accompanying an underage girl into a bar, and suspected that he was under the influence of methamphetamine and in possession of methamphetamine. The court determined that under the specific circumstances of defendant's detention, it was constitutional for the officer to direct defendant to produce written identification and that, when defendant insisted he had no identification, it was proper for the officer to direct defendant to produce identification because the officer observed a wallet-sized bulge in his pocket. The court held that the officer did not violate defendant's rights under U. S. Const. amend. IV when he took the wallet and examined it, because defendant's movements created a reasonable suspicion that he was attempting to destroy or conceal evidence, or that he had a weapon.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction for possession of methamphetamine and remanded because defendant was lawfully detained when the drug evidence was obtained. Under the specific circumstances of defendant's detention, it was not violative of defendant's Fourth Amendment rights for a police officer to request identification or to examine his wallet.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Neighbors discovered appellant as he broke into a house. After throwing clothes onto the front porch, appellant came out of the house at a neighbor's threatening behest. At appellant's trial for burglary, Cal. Penal. Code &sect; 459, he admitted to prior convictions for burglary and attempted robbery, Cal. Penal Code &sect;&sect; 664/211. Appellant was convicted of burglary, after accepting appellant's jury waiver on the issue of the prior convictions, and his sentence was enhanced. Appellant challenged the finding of the prior offenses and the sentence enhancement. On appeal the court affirmed, holding that appellant was free to attack respondent state's case following the waiver of his jury trial so that it was constitutionally sufficient. The court also held that admissibility of evidence of prior convictions was not contingent on a foundational showing that they were constitutionally valid. The court further held that enhancement could be the same for dissimilar offenses. Finally, the court held that any ineffective assistance in allowing the impeachment by prior offenses was harmless error due to the overwhelming evidence of guilt.</SPAN></P>

Rev. &amp; Tax Code &sect; 5147 was unconstitutional because its requirement of summons and proof of service returned within one year bore no rational relationship to a legitimate state purpose where respondent county had answered the complaint. The court affirmed and held that appellant had failed to demonstrate that Cal.

Furthermore, the court held that because the one-year limitation was applicable to all litigants, &sect; 5147 did not violate the equal protection clause. Finally, the court held that respondent was not estopped from applying &sect; 5147 to this case because the request to transfer was employed properly and was filed early in the statutory period.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The People appealed from an order of the Superior Court of San Diego County (California), which dismissed criminal proceedings against respondents after the court sustained respondents' motions to suppress evidence seized in a search authorized by a warrant issued following a helicopter flight observation of marijuana growing in a backyard greenhouse on the grounds that the aerial surveillance violated U.S. Const. amend. IV.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A search warrant was obtained after a deputy sheriff observed what he believed to be marijuana plants growing inside a 15 by 20 foot greenhouse located in respondents' backyard. In order to see inside the greenhouse, the helicopter had to circle respondents' backyard at an altitude of 400-500 feet and the deputy had to look through holes in the roof and side created by missing panels, as a tall pine tree and heavy vegetation inhibited a direct view into the structure. The trial court granted respondents' motion to suppress evidence obtained via the search warrant and dismissed the people's case against respondents. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that a search warrant obtained based on greenhoused marijuana visible only to an eye in a circling helicopter positioned such as to enable &quot;a peek at the pot through the gaps&quot; violated the constitutionally protected reasonable expectation of privacy contained in U.S. Const. amend. IV. In so holding the court noted that, although, at 400-500 feet, the helicopter in question was lawfully operated, it was not within navigable airspace and thus the observation constituted an unreasonable invasion of respondents' expectation of privacy.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the dismissal of the action against respondents, holding that helicopter views from non-navigable airspace of marijuana glimpsed through the missing panels of a greenhouse constituted an unreasonable invasion of respondents' expectation of privacy, and the seizure of the contraband under the warrant issued pursuant to the helicopter viewing violated respondents' Fourth Amendment rights.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">People challenged the decision of respondent superior court in which real party in interest was released on her own recognizance pending habeas corpus proceedings, in an action involving extradition pursuant to Cal. Penal Code &sect; 1550.1, which denied real party in interest's bail.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Real party in interest was arrested pursuant to another state's arrest warrant based on a charge of felonious interference with child custody. The governor issued an arrest warrant, pursuant to Cal. Penal Code &sect; 1549.2, but pending habeas corpus proceedings, respondent superior court released real party in interest on bail because it believed Cal. Penal Code &sect; 1550.1, which denied bail, was unconstitutional. People sought a writ of mandate to compel real party in interest's immediate incarceration without bail, arguing that respondent exceeded its jurisdiction. The court issued the writ, concluding that respondent had no legal basis to declare the controlling statute unconstitutional; real party in interest was not entitled to bail. Respondent's role was limited to determining: the identity of the person, status as a fugitive from justice, pendency of a criminal charge in the demanding jurisdiction, and regularity of the extradition documents; to grant bail on a nonstatutory ground was interference with the exercise of executive discretion. Real party in interest should have been readily available for the demanding state which would presumptively accord her all her legal rights.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court issued the writ of mandate directing respondent superior court to vacate its order granting bail to real party in interest and to immediately remand her to custody pending her habeas corpus proceedings, because none of the statutory exceptions to withholding bail were found to exist. The purpose of denying bail was to maximize the probability that real party in interest would be available when the demanding state's officers arrived.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner candidate filed a petition for writ of prohibition and sought review of a judgment of the Orange County Superior Court (California) that sustained real party candidate's writ of mandate and complaint for an injunction that alleged that portions of petitioner's statement was false and misleading, pursuant to Cal. Elec. Code &sect; 10013.5.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner candidate and real party candidate sought the office of sheriff. Petitioner submitted a candidate statement for inclusion in the voter information. Real party filed a petition for a writ of mandate and a complaint for an injunction, alleging portions of petitioner's statement was false and misleading, pursuant to Cal. Elec. Code &sect; 10013.5. The superior court found the statute to be constitutional, and that some of the challenged statements were false and misleading. Petitioner then sought a writ of prohibition and alleged that the statute effected a prior restraint and was unconstitutional. The appeals court denied the petition for writ of prohibition, holding that the state had a rational interest in restricting the speech and the statute provided adequate procedural safeguards to reduce the risk of restraining constitutionally protected speech. The statute was not invalidated due to being a prior restraint. The court struck that part of the statute that prohibited statements which were misleading, as overbroad and vague. The court found that petitioner's statements were false; thus, they were appropriately eliminated from the pamphlet.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs appealed from the judgment of the Superior Court of the City and County of San Francisco (California), which sustained the demurrer of defendant California Franchise Tax Board in plaintiffs' petition for writ of mandamus to compel defendant to enforce regulations regarding the deduction of alcohol-related business expenses. The trial court dismissed plaintiffs' action after they chose not to amend their complaint.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs sought to compel defendant California Franchise Tax Board to adopt certain specific procedures to control the use of alcohol entertainment expense as a business deduction on state income tax returns. Plaintiffs alleged that despite defendant's mandatory duty to administer and enforce the income tax laws, it had taken no action with regard to taxpayers' allegedly unlawful deductions of drinking expenses for business purposes. Plaintiffs further alleged that defendant's inaction constituted a blanket affirmance of all deductions for drinking expenses, entailing a waste of public funds that was harmful to the economic well-being of the state. The trial court sustained defendant's general demurrer and dismissed the action. The court affirmed, holding that defendant's statutory duty, while mandatory, was broadly defined to enforce and administer the income tax powers of the state. With regard to the prescribing of rules and regulations affecting the income tax laws, discretion resided solely in defendant. The court held that a writ of mandamus could not lie to compel the performance of a discretionary act in a particular manner.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's dismissal of plaintiffs' petition for writ of mandamus was affirmed. A writ of mandamus could not be issued to compel an administrative agency to perform its discretionary functions in a specific manner desired by plaintiffs.</SPAN></P>
