</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">Plaintiff, the secretary of a labor federation (secretary), appealed a judgment of the Superior Court of Kings County (California) that was entered against it in its action that sought to restrain defendants, county and county officials, from interfering with the labor federation's peaceful picketing and from enforcing certain county ordinances relating to parades and use of loud speakers on public highways.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">The secretary filed an action against defendants in his individual capacity and on behalf of the labor federation. The action sought to obtain an injunction against the county officers that would restrain them from interfering with peaceful picketing and the enforcement of two ordinances. One ordinance dictated controls for parades and processions on public highways in the county (parade ordinance), and the other ordinance set forth guidelines for the use of loud speakers in public (speaker ordinance). The trial court sustained defendants' demurrer to the complaint and entered judgment in favor of defendants. On appeal, the court reversed that portion of the trial court judgment that sustained defendants' demurrer to the action against the parade ordinance. Its holding rested on the conclusion that an ordinance that vested arbitrary discretion in a county officer for issuance of parade permits presented an unconstitutional restraint on the picketers' free speech rights. However, the court affirmed that portion of the of the trial court's judgment that upheld the speaker ordinance, as it was a constitutional limitation on speech rights of the picketers.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">The trial court's judgment that was entered in favor of defendants and that sustained their demurrer to the complaint was reversed as to the secretary' constitutional challenge to the county ordinance relating to parades on public highways. However, the trial court's judgment entered in favor of defendants was affirmed as the ordinance that governed the use of loud speakers in public venues.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">The dog owner argued that the governmental unit's ordinance was void because it placed unreasonable restrictions on the ownership and possession of dogs in rural and sparsely inhabited areas. He also contended that the ordinance did not contain a definite or ascertainable meaning for the word &quot;premises.&quot; Finally, the governmental unit's ordinance attempted to legislate in a field completely occupied by state statute. The court rejected all of the dog owner's arguments and affirmed the trial court's decision to deny the writs. The court pointed out that once the legislature had spoken, the question for the court was not the propriety of the legislation but rather the power to legislate. The court then noted that the law was well settled that the legislative bodies had the right to impose restrictions on the rights of dog owners. The court also noted that the word &quot;premises&quot; was clear and certain and not vague so as to render the ordinance unconstitutional. Finally, the ordinance at issue here was not precluded due to being preempted by state statutes.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court that denied the dog owner's petition for writs of mandamus and prohibition.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">Defendant city sought review of a judgment of the Superior Court of Los Angeles County (California), which granted plaintiff landowners' prayer to declare Los Angeles, Cal., Municipal Code &sect;&sect; 12.11-C, 4, 12.21-C, 1(j), and 12.21-C, 1(k), unconstitutional as to them and to enjoin the city from prosecuting or bringing any action based on the ordinances against them.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">The ordinances provided that every lot in a multiple dwelling zone had to have a minimum width and area, and that no lot held under separate ownership at the time of the ordinances' adoption could be separated or reduced below the minimums. After adoption, the landowners purchased the disputed lot and sold part of it so that neither resulting lot met the width requirements. The landowners were then criminally prosecuted for failing to comply with the municipal code. The court found that the ordinances were invalid as applied to the landowners' sale of part of the lot and to their ownership of the remainder because they did nothing out of conformity with the general conditions in the neighborhood. For at least 75 years, the neighborhood had been permitted to develop without interference by the city and enforcing the ordinances against such property did not accomplish any legislative purpose. The landowners and the buyer had all the usual residential facilities and their occupancy as separate owners did not interfere with the health, safety, or welfare of the community. The court affirmed the judgment that granted the landowners' prayer for injunctive and declaratory relief.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">The court affirmed the judgment that declared certain ordinances invalid as to the landowners and that restrained the city from prosecuting or bringing any civil or criminal action based on the ordinances against them.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">Plaintiff State appealed from an order of a trial court (California), which first awarded it judgment in its suit against defendants, a maintenance contractors association and its members, for violations of the Cartwright Act, Cal. Bus. &amp; Prof. Code &sect;&sect; 16,700 through 16,758, but which then granted the association and its members a new trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">The association supplied 90 percent of the janitorial services in San Francisco, California, that were contracted out. The association only allowed competitive bidding on jobs under certain circumstances. The State alleged violations of the Cartwright Act for restraint of trade. The trial court enjoined the association from continuing its alleged conspiracy, but then instead granted a new trial. The court reversed on appeal, finding that the original injunction was correct. The court found that Cal. Bus. &amp; Prof. Code &sect;&sect; 16,723 and 16,725 were both unconstitutionally vague in that they created exceptions for &quot;reasonable profits&quot; and the &quot;furtherance of trade&quot; that could not be defined with precision. Thus, both statutes were struck down. The only &quot;trade&quot; being &quot;furthered&quot; was that of the members themselves. Both statutes were severable from the Cartwright Act, leaving the original judgment against the association and its members intact. The association was a &quot;trust&quot; in violation of Cal. Bus. &amp; Prof. Code &sect; 16,720.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">Police officers recognized suspicious circumstances at defendants' house. Upon questioning and following one of the defendants, who was a doctor, back into the house the officers found an aborted girl and instruments of the abortion. Defendant urged that the evidence was insufficient to sustain the verdict and judgment. The court held that a showing of another offense, similar in all respects, committed by the same defendant, and based on the same plan was good corroboration. The proven abortion of the first count was legally sufficient to corroborate the similar abortions in the other counts. As to the evidence of the doctor defendant, all the elements of participation in the crimes were shown. It was shown that he got the abortees, furnished his kitchen for the operations, and aided his codefendant in performing the operations. As to the codefendant, the evidence plainly supported the conviction on the first and fifth counts of abortion. The evidence was less satisfactory as to the other accounts. The judgment against defendant was affirmed in all five counts. The judgment against the codefendant on the first and fifth counts was affirmed. The remaining counts were reversed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">Respondents levied various property taxes against the decedent's estate. After the executors challenged the tax assessment unsuccessfully before the county board of supervisors, they paid the taxes involuntarily and under protest. The executors then brought suit against respondents in the superior court. The superior court sustained a demurrer to the executors' complaint and dismissed the action. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that federal reserve notes and bank notes in the estate were not exempt from taxation under Cal. Rev. &amp; Tax. Code &sect; 212 because they were not encompassed in the meaning of the word &quot;notes&quot; as used in &sect; 212. The court reasoned that the legislature intended the word &quot;notes&quot; to have included unconditional promises to pay an amount of money. Because federal reserve notes and bank notes were actual legal tender, the court determined that they were not intended to have been covered by &sect; 212. The court also found that the federal reserve notes and bank notes were not solvent credits under &sect; 113.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">After defendant was convicted of conspiracy to violate Cal. Penal Code &sect; 337a, defendant appealed to the court. The court affirmed the trial court's decision. Thereafter, defendant filed his petition and notice of motion to vacate or set aside the judgment that was entered against him. After the trial court denied his motion, defendant appealed. On appeal, defendant challenged the constitutionality of Cal. Penal Code &sect; 1265. Section 1265 provided that if a judgment had been affirmed on appeal it was not proper to bring a coram nobis proceeding. According to defendant, the amendment to Cal Penal Code &sect; 1265 was an unconstitutional legislative encroachment on the original jurisdiction of the trial court as provided in Cal. Const. art. VI8 &sect; 5. The court held that the amendment to Cal. Penal Code &sect; 1265 did not divest the trial court of any measure of jurisdiction conferred upon it by the California Constitution. Moreover, the court held that Cal. Penal Code &sect; 1265 was procedural in character and therefore, within the constitutional power of the legislature. Lastly, the court found that there were no violations of defendant's due process rights.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">Defendant was charged with disturbing the peace. When her case came to trial, the municipal court had a doubt as to her sanity and ordered the criminal proceedings suspended. After a municipal court trial on defendant's sanity, defendant was found insane and was committed to the state hospital until she should regain her sanity. The court stated that the municipal court did not have jurisdiction to conduct a proceeding to determine the present sanity of a person whether the question arose in the course of a criminal cause or otherwise. Although the municipal court had jurisdiction of misdemeanors, a proceeding to determine the question of sanity of a defendant was not a part of a criminal trial. It was a special proceeding that was civil in character. When a doubt arose as to the sanity of defendant, it was not only the duty of the municipal court to order a trial of the issue and to suspend all proceedings in the criminal prosecution, but the trial court also had to certify the proceedings to the superior court. Therefore, the commitment of defendant to the state hospital was void and she was entitled to be released from the custody of that institution.</SPAN></P>

Under &sect; 10177.5, the Commissioner had conducted a hearing and revoked the brokers' real estate licenses based on a civil judgment of fraud in dealing with a client. The court found that the superior court had not erred in denying the brokers' petition for a writ of mandate because the code sections were constitutional. The court found that the brokers had their day in the civil court where they were represented by counsel. It concluded that no due process violation occurred in having the evidence in the fraud action used in the Commissioner's hearing to revoke their licenses. Further, the brokers had an opportunity at the Commissioner's hearing to tell their stories. Section 10177.5 did not compel revocation.

He also appealed from an order denying a new trial. Defendant contended that Cal.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">Defendant was charged with robbing two banks. In each information he was also charged with a prior felony conviction in Oregon for forgery, resulting in a term of imprisonment in that state. In rejecting defendant's argument that Cal. Penal Code &sect; 668 was unconstitutional, the court held that the question was academic. No unconstitutionality appeared insofar as the statute affected defendant. He was not adjudged as a habitual criminal, and the provisions of &sect; 668 had no direct application. Moreover, the matter of a prior conviction related only to punishment for a crime committed in California and to its use for purposes of impeachment. Both punishment and impeachment were matters for state determination, and the rules established applied to everyone alike. It was not error for the trial judge not to give an instruction on circumstantial evidence because there was sufficient direct evidence to sustain the verdicts. There was no prejudice to defendant in the trial court giving the jury an instruction to the effect that the fact that defendant had been convicted of a felony, if such was a fact, might have been considered in judging his credibility.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment of the trial court in favor of the taxpayers and the railroad company after rejecting the buyers' argument that a tax deed established prima facie evidence of title in the buyers and also made out a prima facie case of nonpayment of taxes thereby casting on the taxpayers and railroad company the burden of proof as to payment of taxes. Specifically, the court held that whether the buyers' prima facie case was satisfactorily rebutted was a question of fact for the trial court's determination and that the record contained substantial evidence that the property was included in the taxpayers' operative property on which it paid a gross receipts tax for the year in question. Thus, the court held that such taxes were in lieu of all other taxes, making the property, in practical effect, exempt from additional assessments by the state or any of its subdivisions vested with taxing power, pursuant to Cal. Const. art. XIII, &sect; 14(a). Accordingly, the court concluded that the sale by the tax collector was unauthorized and void and the tax deed given in pursuance of such a sale conveyed no title.</SPAN></P>

Defendants argued that it was error to admit parole evidence of the contract between the parties. The court found that the subcontractor furnished the material and performed the labor and services for which they sought compensation, the admission of parol evidence relative to the contract between the principal and the sub-contractor was immaterial because it did not affect the result of the litigation. The record was devoid of any evidence that the subcontractor or the principal did any work not required by the original contract, its plans and specifications, or authorized by proper change orders in accordance with the terms in the original contract. In addition, there was no abuse of discretion in fixing the attorney's fee because it was reasonable. The bond upon which the suit was instituted provided in part that in case an action was brought on the bond, the trial court would fix a reasonable attorney's fee.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the grocers argued that the evidence did not support the findings of fact. The court found that the evidence established without question that the competitors advertised and sold certain grocery articles below cost. However, there was evidence that the competitors did not know that the grocers were opening their market until much later. The sale of the items below cost was made in good faith and not for the purpose of injuring the grocers. It was found that the grocers were damaged nominally, but the judgment was that the grocers take nothing. The findings of fact and the judgment were not inconsistent.</SPAN></P>

The trial court denied both of defendant's motions. On appeal, the court held that Cal. Welf. &amp; Inst. Code &sect; 5502.5, pertaining to the procedure for defendant's release from the state hospital, was not unconstitutional. Defendant claimed that &sect; 5502.5 was unconstitutional because it did not impose a duty on the hospital superintendent to form an opinion that defendant was no longer a menace to the health and safety of others. The court found that the intent of &sect;5502.5, with respect to the superintendent's duties, rendered the language thereof mandatory and that the statute was neither vague nor uncertain, but a valid procedural statute.</SPAN></P>

The trial court overruled defendants' demurrer to the suit, issued a temporary restraining order, and granted the writ of mandamus. Defendants appealed, and upon review, the court dismissed the appeal of the order overruling the demurrer. The court held that that order was not appealable. The court affirmed the grant of the writ of mandamus and the issuance of the temporary restraining order. The court held that &sect; 4850 was not unconstitutional as defendants asserted. The court held that payment under &sect; 4850 was workmen's compensation under Cal. Lab. Code &sect; 3207 and Cal. Lab. Code &sect; 5001.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">Appellants, a turbine maker and its purchaser, contracted for the construction and installation of an electrical turbine. The components were assembled out of state, then installed on real property owned by appellate purchaser in California. Respondent state Board of Equalization ruled that the transaction was a sale and denied appellants' claim for a refund. Appellants filed a lawsuit to recover the alleged overpayment of taxes. The trial court held that respondent had imposed the proper tax and denied the refund. Appellants sought review and the court affirmed. The court found that under Administrative Rule 11, Cal. Admin. Code &sect; 1921, there was a distinction between structures and fixtures so far as contractors were concerned. A contractor who furnished a fixture that lost its identity primarily sold services, while a contractor who furnished a fixture that did not lose its identity sold tangible personal property. The court found this distinction to have been reasonable and nondiscriminatory. Thus, the court found that neither respondent nor the trial court had erred in having concluded that the turbine was tangible personable property and that the transaction was a sale.</SPAN></P>

He was convicted, and filed a motion for retrial. The motion was denied, and defendant sought review. The court affirmed defendant's conviction and the trial court's denial of his motion for retrial. It found that the evidence was sufficient to sustain the conviction because the honest inferences and indisputable facts established the guilt of the defendant. The fact that defendant ordered someone else to remove the file did not negate his culpability. Also, the records removed were public records as defined in the statute. It was not necessary for the state to prove that defendant intended to violate the statute because the statute imputed intent. Furthermore, there was no reversible error where the prosecutor asked improper questions and the trial court instructed the jurors to disregard the statements.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">The company and the state entered into a contract for goods and services. The contract specified an agreed upon price and was silent on the issue of sales tax. The company alleged that the sale price was exclusive of sales tax. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment of the trial court and stated that the company did not have the right to collect sales tax from the state in this instance because the contract was interpreted as to be the total sale price for the services provided by the company. The court found that Cal. Rev. &amp; Tax Code &sect; 6052 allowed the imposed sales tax to be passed on to the consumer, but the amount of the tax should have been specified in the contract not presumed to be exclusive of the selling price. The court stated that there was no mandatory duty on the part of a retailer to collect the amount of the tax from the consumer. The court rejected the company's argument that Cal. Rev. &amp; Tax code &sect; 6053 required that sales tax be added as an additional charge to the selling price. The court determined that the right of a consumer to collect sales tax may be waived and, if it is not waived, it must be asserted upon the contractual agreements of the parties.</SPAN></P>

The trial court entered judgment for the taxpayer and awarded the city the amounts received by the employees as salaries.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">The taxpayer contended that the appointment of the two employees was illegal because neither employee possessed the necessary qualification of two years' admission to practice law, as required by San Francisco, Cal., City &amp; County Charter &sect; 34. The trial court held that the two employments were illegal. It also found that the treasurer and the controller were not legally responsible for the illegal payments because they had paid the salary claims of the two employees in accordance with charter provisions. On appeal, the court reversed the trial court's judgment in part. The court held that the two were lawfully employed as warrant and bond clerks under San Francisco, Cal., City &amp; County Charter &sect; 30, and not as assistant attorneys. Section 30 clearly provided that the deputy in charge of the warrant and bond office did not act as the representative of the district attorney. The court held that the two years' service requirement was not applicable to either employee. While the court agreed that one of the employees did not meet the one-year city residency requirement, it found that the district attorney did not act in bad faith in making the illegal appointment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">The court affirmed the portion of the judgment in favor of the treasurer and controller, who did everything required of them by the charter.

The food company further alleged that &sect; 28007 did not bear a real or substantial relation to the object sought to be obtained and that it was arbitrary, unreasonable, and capricious, and, therefore, unconstitutional. Affirming, the court held that the trial court's findings were supported by substantial evidence. The court also held that the enactment of &sect; 28007 was a legitimate exercise of the state's police power as it was the manifest and imperative duty of the California Legislature to regulate the sale of canned horse meat to insure that dog food labeled &quot;with gravy&quot; would not be mistakenly eaten by human beings.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">Plaintiffs were mutual share building and loan associations organized under a state statute or mutual share savings and loan associations created under a federal statute. For two taxable years, the Board disallowed certain deductions and assessed additional franchise taxes. The trial court held that the limitation of the allowable deduction was unconstitutional and void. On appeal, the court affirmed. First, the court determined that there was no misjoinder because there was only one question of law, the validity of the assessments, and it was common to all plaintiffs. Second, the court determined that the portion of &sect; 8(j) of the Act limiting the deduction of the return paid, credited on, or apportioned to the withdrawable shares to the average rate as determined by the building and loan commissioner was unconstitutional as a delegation of uncontrolled legislative power to an administrative officer to determine an average rate paid by all savings and loan associations in the state. The invalid portion of the statute was severable, and the deduction was permissible under the remainder of &sect; 8(j) of the Act.</SPAN></P>

The ordinance also provided that due to the urgency of filling the vacancy of the office of city manager, the ordinance was effective immediately. The taxpayer brought an action challenging the ordinance's validity on the ground that the emergency clause was unconstitutional. The trial court upheld the ordinance. The taxpayer appealed. The court affirmed, holding that although the emergency clause was unconstitutionally void, it did not void the entire ordinance. The emergency clause was separable and hence the ordinance was otherwise valid. The court found that the language of the saving clause indicated that the council intended to adopt the ordinance even if the emergency clause was invalidated.

Equalization R. 54, Cal. Admin. Code, tit. 4, art. 10, &sect; 54. The exporters filed complaints against the state treasurer and others seeking review of the dismissal of their petitions. The actions were consolidated and defendants demurred on the ground that the actions failed to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action. The trial court sustained the demurrers without leave to amend and the exporters sought review. The exporters argued that they were statutorily exempt from excise taxes on exported beer and that the board's rule could not destroy that exemption. The court found that the board's rule was within the authority delegated to the board and that it was not an invalid limitation of the statutory exemption.

The first count of the complaint against appellant presented issues of fact under &sect; 26270, not under &sect; 26271. Thus, the petition did not challenge the jurisdiction of the municipal court to proceed under the first count. This was sufficient to deny the petition.

On appeal, the court rejected defendants' argument that &sect; 11500 was unconstitutionally vague and ambiguous on the alleged ground that in prohibiting possession of a narcotic except by prescription, &sect; 11500 related entirely to narcotics and could not be understood to apply to marijuana without reference to Cal. Health &amp; Safety Code &sect; 11001, which defined &quot;narcotics&quot; to include marijuana. The court held that &sect; 11500 was clear and that it was not necessary that the definition of &quot;narcotics&quot; appear therein. Addressing defendants' argument that marijuana was not a narcotic but an herb, the court held that the legislature was empowered to enact &sect; 11500 based on its rational belief that marijuana was a narcotic. Also, the court held that the evidence was sufficient to support the verdicts.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">Appellant, the guardian of an incompetent person, sought review of an order of the Superior Court of the City and County of San Francisco (California), which allowed the claim of respondent, the Department of Mental Hygiene, for charges for maintenance of the incompetent at a state hospital. The Department brought the proceeding pursuant to Cal. Welf. &amp; Inst. Code &sect; 6655. The guardian was ordered to pay the charges.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">The guardian was ordered to pay an amount that was greater than the actual cost of caring for the incompetent. The guardian claimed that &sect; 6655 required the rate to be set at the actual cost of the care, support, and maintenance furnished. The rate assessed was based on the per capita cost of all of the inmates at the hospital, many of whom required a great deal more care. The court affirmed the assessed amount. The method of determining the rate was correct. Section 6655 had given the director of the Department the duty of fixing the rate but did not necessarily prevent a uniform rate for all patients able to pay although it told the director to fix it at &quot;the actual cost.&quot; In 1933, the words &quot;actual cost&quot; were deleted from the statute. The state desired to make no profit from the care of its patients if all paid the rate so fixed. The basing of the rate upon per capita costs was more practical and less expensive than to keep books on each patient. The statute was not unconstitutional as returning a profit to the state because its purpose was to facilitate the efficient conduct of the state's business rather than to make a profit or to give something of value to another patient.</SPAN></P>

Nonetheless, the court granted the writ, and the court affirmed. The court ruled that the commission had acted arbitrarily and capriciously in promulgating its rule and that the rule violated the equal protection guarantees of the state and federal constitutions.

The property that became subject to the lien of the bond was delinquent for state and county taxes. It was sold and deeded to the state. The state sold the property to the city. The bondholder alleged that the city's interest was subordinate to the lien of the bond. The trial court decreed that the property be sold and ruled that after the time allowed for redemption had expired, the city would be barred of all rights in the property. The city contended that the bondholder did not exercise its right to foreclose within the time allowed under Cal. Civ. Code &sect; 2911. The bondholder argued that the lien of the bond was superior to the state's title and, therefore, did not come within the parity rule. The court found that the bondholder's right to enforce the lien of the bond had expired because the action was not commenced within the time prescribed by &sect; 2911. Therefore, the demurrer of the city should have been sustained. Section 2911 made no distinction between a lien when there was parity and when there was not. It applied to all liens to secure payment of a public improvement assessment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">Defendants, a church and its members, appealed the decision of the Superior Court of Butte County (California), which enjoined the church from conducting church services in a house located in an area zoned for single-family residential use. Plaintiff city objected to the house's use. The church argued that the decision, and local permit requirements, violated its members' constitutional rights.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">The city filed an action for injunctive relief against an area homeowner who was allowing a church to conduct worship services out of his home. Chico, Cal., Mun. Code &sect; 1790(3) prohibited churches in areas zoned for single-family residential use unless the church obtained a special use permit. Chico, Cal., Ordinance 404 &sect; 1796 created an action for abatement of a nuisance against landowners whose use of their premises were contrary to city laws. The church argued that the ordinance violated its members' constitutional rights to freedom of religious expression. The court explained that the church was a corporate entity organized under state law. Zoning ordinances were clear expressions of the state's police power, delegated by the state to the local government. The denial of a special use permit for a building did not prevent anyone from worshipping. But the church was required to obtain a special permit to do so in the disputed location. Although the church claimed to have applied for a permit, the court found that this was not the case. The church was required to exhaust its administrative remedies. The court affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">The court held that the church was required to follow the city's zoning laws and abide by local permit requirements. The court observed that denial of a special use permit would merely prohibit the use of the house as a church; it did not prohibit church members from exercising their constitutional rights to worship as they chose. The court affirmed.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's finding that the city was entitled to use tax funds for such an improvement. The court found no indication of legislative intent to limit the cities in the construction and maintenance of state highways within their boundaries to state funds. The court also found that Cal. Sts. &amp; High. Code &sect; 113 expressly permitted the use of any funds that the city might properly use for the construction and maintenance of its own streets. The court held that the city and its inhabitants received a special benefit, as compared with the rest of the state, in the improvement of the state highway that was within the city limits; therefore, such an improvement was a municipal purpose.

The executors also appealed the trial court's orders amending the judgment and striking the cost bill. Respondent contestant had challenged the executors' propounding of the decedent's will.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">After a jury sustained the decedent's will, a judgment denying a petition for revocation of the will was filed containing a provision that the will's proponents could recover their costs and disbursements from the contestant. Upon the contestant's motion, the trial court struck the provision for costs from the judgment. Cal. Prob. Code &sect; 383 provided that a will contestant had to pay the costs of trial if the probate were not revoked. The court found that if &sect; 383 were held to be mandatory, it would be contrary to the requirement of Cal. Const. art. I, &sect; 11 that all laws of a general nature had to have a uniform operation. No logical or reasonable basis existed for mandatorily awarding costs against a contestant after a will was admitted to probate and not awarding the same costs against a contestant before the will was admitted to probate. The court concluded that, by construing the statute as merely directory, it was consistent with the constitutional provision. Thus, the trial court correctly struck the provision from the judgment and made an order leaving the determination of costs until there had been a final determination of the litigation on appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">The court affirmed the part of the trial court's judgment from which the appeal was taken.

The trial court found in favor of the employer. On appeal, the court reversed in part and affirmed in part. The court found that the section was to be liberally construed. The court concluded that the cause of action for his salary was not barred by the statute of limitations because it did not accrue until after the end of the year, which was the earliest point at which he could have known that he was absent less than 30 days. The court found that although his vacation and holiday privileges could not have been diminished because of his absence, he did not receive the privilege during his absence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">After filling out the required forms, the agent received licenses as an insurance and interinsurance agent. On the forms, the agent indicated that he had never been convicted of a misdemeanor.

The commissioner revoked the agent's licenses, finding that he knowingly made a misstatement and obtained each license by concealment and misrepresentation. The agent filed a petition for a writ of mandate to vacate the revocation order, which the trial court denied. The court reversed, finding that although there was evidence to support a finding that the agent knowingly misrepresented the convictions, the charge of concealment could not stand because there was no evidence that the misrepresentation had any bearing on his obtaining the licenses; the offenses were ancient and bore no relation to his qualifications for a license. In addition, because the commissioner made a single order of revocation based on his conclusions that both charges had been substantiated, the court remanded to the commissioner for reconsideration of the penalty for the first charge.</SPAN></P>

The lienholders appealed the superior court's decisions. The court reversed the superior court's judgments for the owner in the foreclosure actions and modified the judgment for the owner in the quiet title action through declaring the owner's title to the building subject to the lienholders' liens. The court held that the superior court erred in disallowing the liens, as the termination of the land purchase contract by the decree in the quiet title action did not nullify the lienholders' liens against the building.</SPAN></P>

The trial court entered a judgment in favor of defendants, and the taxpayer appealed. The court affirmed. Under Cal. Sts. &amp; High.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">Plaintiff state brought an action against defendant grocer under the Unfair Trade Practices Act, Cal. Bus. &amp; Prof. Code &sect; 17000 et seq. (the Act). The Superior Court of Santa Clara County (California) granted a temporary restraining order against the grocer, denied his motion to dissolve the order, entered a minute order granting a preliminary injunction, and then formally issued a broader preliminary injunction. The grocer appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">The state's action was based on violations of &sect;&sect; 17043 and 17044 of the Act, which prohibited selling products below cost and using products as &quot;loss leaders.&quot; The grocer claimed that the minute order disposed of the state's case and that the Act and its application violated the Commerce Clause and equal protection and conflicted with the Sherman Act. The state claimed that it did not purposefully discriminate against the grocer and that relevant limitations of the Act should be considered incorporated in the injunction. The court held that the minute order was not a final disposition of the state's action, as it did not detail the acts prohibited. The Act did not regulate interstate commerce but was a valid exercise of the state's police power. The Act did not conflict with the Sherman Act, as it did not address price fixing. The Act was uniform in application; the grocer might have been the first in his area against whom action was taken but did not show that the state purposefully discriminated. As the injunction did not limit its prohibition on selling below cost to conduct that had a purpose to injure competitors, the injunction had to be modified to comply with the Act.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">The court modified the preliminary injunction to add the words &quot;if such act is done for the purpose of injuring competitors or destroying competition.&quot; The court affirmed the preliminary injunction against the grocer, as modified, and dismissed the grocer's appeals of all other orders.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">Defendant was tried for murder for shooting and killing the 17-year-old daughter of his nephew. During voir dire, a jury of 12 was chosen and the trial court began the selection for an alternate juror without first swearing in the jury, as required under &sect; 1089. During the selection of the jury, defendant used 18 of the 20 peremptory challenges allowed by Cal. Penal Code &sect; 1070. He then exercised two more peremptory challenges during the selection of the alternate. When another potential alternate was subjected to voir dire, defendant sought to use another peremptory. The trial court denied the request, holding that defendant has used his 20 peremptories. The alternate was sworn in with the jury. The court held that the trial court committed reversible error in denying defendant the peremptory challenge afforded him under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 1089, which allowed one peremptory for each alternate. In total, defendant had 21 peremptories available to him. The fact that he exercised two of them during the selection of the alternate did not preclude his right to exercise his final peremptory challenge. By denying him this right, the trial court unconstitutionally denied him a fair trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">On appeal, defendant argued, inter alia, that the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction because the victim's testimony was incredible and because her testimony conflicted with that of an examining physician.

Further, the fact that the testimony of an examining physician indicated that the victim had engaged in sexual activity only recently contradicted the victim's testimony that she had been submitting to defendant for over two years did not render the victim's testimony unreliable. The physician's testimony gave substantial support to the victim's testimony as to the commission of the crimes on the dates charged.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">After following defendant to several locations, city police officers arrested him as he entered the home of a woman whose name was found on a betting slip with an amount noted that corresponded with the amount the woman informed police she owed defendant in bets on horses. On defendant's person, the officers confiscated betting slips, an owe sheet, scratch sheets, and a daily racing form. At trial, the State's expert described betting operations and the documents and papers used therein. On appeal, defendant contended that the trial court should have defined the term &quot;to engage&quot; as meaning activity that was continuous in nature and connoting more than a single act. He also argued that there was insufficient evidence to sustain his conviction. In finding otherwise, the court affirmed the judgment of conviction and held that Cal. Penal Code &sect; 237a made it clear that a single violation thereof constituted the proscribed offense. Further, &sect; 237a was not so vague that a person of ordinary intelligence could not understand the meaning of terms such as &quot;bookmaking&quot; and &quot;pool-selling&quot; as such terms were well understood in modern society. Finally, the evidence supported the jury's finding.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">Plaintiffs challenged the constitutionality of the Caravan Act of 1937 (Act) which imposed a fee upon caravans traveling inter-and intrastate as well as vehicles being transported for sale being driven into state individually and not as part of a caravan. Plaintiff asserted that the Act violated the commerce clause of U.S. Const. art.

I, &sect;&sect; 11 and 21. One plaintiff transported his vehicles in tandem caravans, and the others transported them individually. The trial court entered judgment in favor of plaintiffs. On appeal, the court reversed the trial court's judgment. The court held that the statute's classification and tax of vehicles transported on the state's highways for gain was proper even though it did not create any additional traffic hazard or undue wear and tear than vehicles not transported for gain; the legislature had the authority to regulate commercial and noncommercial traffic differently.</SPAN></P>

The court held that &sect; 7.3 of the Alcoholic Beverage Control Act (1949) did not prevent specific performance of the agreement because the limited partners' right to the liquor license accrued prior to the enactment of &sect; 7.3. The court found that a sworn statement required under &sect; 7.3 was not necessary for specific performance of the transfer agreement under the circumstances.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">The state officials were state right-of-way agents charged with procuring property from individuals for the right-of-way of the Hollywood Freeway in the city of Los Angeles.

The real estate broker contracted with individual property owners to sell their home before the property owners were approached by the state. The real estate broker split his commission from the sales with the state officials. A jury composed of 11 women and 1 man did not violate defendants' constitutional rights to a fair trial. The state officials alleged that they were entitled to acquittal on the charge of conspiracy because they were acquitted on the charge of embezzlement that arose from the same facts. The court held that the state officials were not entitled to acquittal on the charge of conspiracy because the substantive crime of embezzlement and the crime of conspiracy were separate and distinct offenses. The court held that the trial court did not err in replacing a juror with an alternate juror after the juror's father suffered a stroke.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">Petitioners, union, affiliated organizations, and members, appealed from the order of the Superior Court of Contra Costa County (California) that held that petitioners violated a temporary restraining order and adjudged them in contempt. This order was issued in an action brought by respondent company to enjoin the commission of certain activities by petitioners in their strike of respondent company.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">Respondent company brought an action to enjoin petitioners, union, affiliated organizations, and members, from destroying property and intimidating people during a strike. Respondent court entered a temporary restraining order (TRO) to enjoin this activity and subsequently held that petitioners violated the TRO and adjudged them in contempt of court. The court affirmed in part and reversed in part. Although a few judgments were reversed because the complaints did not allege the commission of acts enjoined by the TRO, the evidence was sufficient to sustain the majority of the judgments. The TRO did not violate U.S. Const. amend. I and was applicable to petitioners, union and affiliated organizations, because the definition of &quot;person&quot; in Cal. Civ. Proc. Code &sect; 17 was not restricted to &quot;natural persons.&quot; The Labor Management Relations Act of 1947 and the National Labor Relations Act of 1935 did not preclude respondent trial court from enforcing its TRO. The court's inquiry was limited to jurisdiction, and it could not consider the affidavits used to support the subpoenas duces tecum. Finally, oral arguments were a privilege, and respondent company was properly joined.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">The court affirmed respondent trial court's order, which found that petitioners, union, affiliated organizations, and members, violated a temporary restraining order and adjudged them in contempt. Although a few judgments were reversed because the complaints did not allege the commission of acts enjoined by the TRO and thus did not implicate respondent trial court's jurisdiction, the evidence was sufficient to sustain most of the judgments.</SPAN></P>

The court concluded that an amendment which addressed the issue in question was not effective at the time of the claim. Further, since there was no agreement against the appropriation of attorney fees the grant of the same was proper. Therefore, the decision was reversed and remanded for fee determination.</SPAN></P>

The trial court held that the ordinance was adopted as an initiative measure without appropriate power in the electors of the city and granted the developer declaratory relief, declaring the ordinance null and void as against the developer and enjoining the city from enforcing the ordinance against him. The city appealed, contending that declaratory relief was inappropriate and that the ordinance was a valid exercise of electors' power. On appeal, the court reversed, ruling that although declaratory relief was appropriate, adoption of the ordinance was a valid exercise of the electors' powers under the city charter and the court did not find anything in the general laws of the state that limited such powers. Thus, the trial court erred in declaring the ordinance null and void.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">In 1925, the property was sold to the state for nonpayment of taxes. It was deeded to the state on June 30, 1930. Notice of sale was published on December 3, 1937 and the county tax collector mailed a copy of the notice to the original property owner. The original property owner never received the letter sent by the county tax collector and had no knowledge of the sale until 1939. The purchaser acquired the property as the success in interest to the person who bought the property at the public auction. No physical occupancy of the property was ever effected by the parties or the lessee. In 1945, the purchaser commenced a quiet title action. The trial court entered a judgment for the purchaser and the original property owner appealed. The court affirmed and determined that the lack of notice to the original property owner was cured by the statute of limitations. The court found that the original property owner was barred from challenging the validity of the tax deed to the state and could not raise the invalidity of the tax deed in her action to quiet title to the property.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">Decedent was a United States citizen and California resident.

On appeal, the court found that the Attorney General, as successor in interest, relied on his vesting order and sought distribution to himself of the legacies to the three German citizens. The court found that pursuant to Cal. Prob. Code &sect; 259 the German legatees would be ineligible to take under the will if German wartime law prohibited United States citizens from taking under German wills. In affirming, the court found that German law in 1946 provided for a reciprocal right to United States citizens to take by inheritance personal property or proceeds under the same terms and conditions as German residents and citizens.</SPAN></P>

Ordinance 385 was invalid and that the company was not required to comply with the provisions of the ordinance. The trial court sustained a general demurrer to the complaint filed by the inspector.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">The company, which was in the home building business, attacked Ordinance 385 and the amendments to Ordinance 385 in numerous respects and for various reasons. The company contended that Ordinance 385 did not intelligibly classify buildings subject to its own regulatory provision, that there was an inter-mixture of zone lines, dates of subdivisions, legal method of subdivision, type of operation, and type of property, that it was not only discriminatory in its application but was vague and indefinite. The court held that it did not need to pass on the specific questions of unconstitutionality urged by the company further than to determine that there were justiciable questions suggested which could not have been determined in the absence of evidence of the actual facts existing in the county which may or may not have made the classifications of the ordinances under attack reasonable or unreasonable. The court found that the company's complaint suggested constitutional questions, which the court could not say lacked merit on the facts alleged. The court concluded it was prejudicial error to sustain the demurrer without granting the company leave to amend the complaint.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">The bank challenged the constitutionality of the statutory scheme on the grounds that it did not satisfy due process requirements. The bank argued that that unless the property was seized before the administration commenced, the statutes were required to provide for the restoration of the property to the missing person whenever he reappeared, after however long a period. In affirming the judgment, the court concluded that the bank's argument placed too great emphasis on the purely mechanical. After the lapse of three years of administration (or of one if the missing person had been unheard of for 10 years prior to commencing the proceedings), the statutory scheme provided for a final distribution and barred the missing person's rights by limitation. The court found that the statutory scheme's time limits were not unreasonable and its provision for notice was adequate.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">Appellants, a city and a county, challenged a judgment of the Superior Court of Los Angeles County (California), which awarded respondent taxpayer a refund of solvent credits tax paid under protest on the amount the taxpayer held in excess of balance of accounts receivable and accounts payable. The trial court found that the federal agencies doing business with the taxpayer were bona fide residents of California under Cal. Const. art. XIII, &sect; 1.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">The taxpayer had accounts receivable from agencies of the United States government of $ 4 million and accounts payable to the same agencies of $ 2 million. A solvent credits tax was levied by the city and the county against the full amount of accounts receivable, without deduction of accounts payable. The taxpayer paid under protest and later was awarded a refund. The trial court found that the agencies were bona fide residents of California and that the taxpayer's taxable solvent credits due from the agencies were $ 1.8 million, representing a net balance owing to the taxpayer. The court affirmed on appeal, finding no error. The court found that Cal. Const. art. XIII, &sect; 1, was constitutional. The legislature could permit taxpayers to deduct the debts due to persons doing business in California. Thus, the taxpayer had properly taken the deductions. The taxpayer also properly filed his statement under Cal. Rev. &amp; Tax. Code &sect; 1060; no balance sheet was needed. It was the duty of the assessor to credit the taxpayer for its bona fide debts. Failing in that duty, it was the province of the trial court to make the deduction and to declare the amount of the tax, which it did.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">The question on appeal was whether defendants had authority to revoke the driver's license. The ground of suspension was that the driver was involved in an automobile accident and had failed to deposit security in the amount demanded by the Department of Motor Vehicles. The driver argued that all the provisions of the financial responsibility statutes which referred to licenses of &quot;operators,&quot; were properly construed as applying to &quot;operators' licenses&quot; but not to &quot;chauffeurs' licenses. Reversing, the court held that the driver's contention that the Department of Motor Vehicles was without authority to suspend his chauffeurs' license had no support in the applicable provisions of the California Vehicle Code. Even if the driver was able to prove that he was a chauffeur, as defined by Cal. Veh. Code &sect; 71, and was acting as such at the time of the accident, such proof would not have entitled him to a judgment directing the restoration of his suspended license. The financial responsibility requirements applied to the licenses of all operators of vehicles, whether they were operators' licenses or chauffeurs' licenses.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">The oil field was in the City of Los Angeles. Wells were permitted, drilled, and spaced at one well to an acre. Affirming, the court concluded, as a matter of law, that the ordinance was unduly oppressive and not reasonably necessary to promote the general welfare of the community. The reasonableness of the ordinance was not fairly debatable and the facts did not show a case where there may be a difference of opinion on the subject. The exercise of legislative power exceeded constitutional limitations. The ordinance did not afford adequate means of protection as a substitute for the right to drill an offset well. It deprived the lessees of their right, coequal with the right of other owners and lessees in the oil field, to recover their fair share of the oil from the common source of supply and, consequently, infringed upon the constitutional guaranties invoked. There was no equality of production. When the block was considered as a whole, at least another well was needed thereon to prevent discrimination and confiscation.</SPAN></P>

Nevertheless, the trial court overruled the husband's demurrer to the complaint on this ground because it declared the foregoing requirement of &sect; 108 to be unconstitutional. The court agreed. The court held that a classification could not be arbitrary. It had to be based upon some difference in the classes having a substantial relation to a legitimate object to be accomplished. The requirement at issue in &sect; 108 constituted a classification based on financial ability which was without reasonable relation to either of the legislative objects of (1) providing a manner of proof where the ground for divorce was incurable insanity, or (2) securing financial support for the insane spouse. Such classification was an arbitrary denial of equal protection and was invalid. The remainder of &sect; 108 could be given effect and a divorce granted on the ground of incurable insanity.</SPAN></P>

Code Civ. Proc. &sect; 1274.1 to &sect; 1274.17, against defendant successor bank upon the bank's motion to dismiss.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">Depositor made certain deposits in a predecessor bank. After almost 20 years and no withdrawals or deposits being made in the account, the successor bank paid the amount due on the account to the treasury of the state under the Abandoned Property Act. While the administrator's proceeding was pending against the state under Cal. Code Civ. Proc. &sect; 1274.10, he commenced the current action against the successor bank because he allegedly could not recover interest from the state. The administrator made no appearance on the hearing of the motion to dismiss. Because no evidence before the trial court was supplied to the court, it was presumed that the evidence supported the order. The administrator argued that the trial court's order was not based on facts specified in Cal. Code Civ. Proc. &sect; 581 et seq. and was, therefore, void. The court held that the trial court had inherent power to dismiss actions which were made to appear fictitious and sham.

The court held that: (1) the words &quot;due process of law&quot; in the Fourteenth Amendment did not require an indictment by a grand jury in a prosecution by a state for a felony, and a conviction upon an information filed by the district attorney did not deprive a defendant of life, liberty, or property without due process of law; (2) contrary to defendant's contention, the evidence was sufficient to sustain the trial court's judgment; (3) defendant's contention that he was entrapped was not sustained by the evidence; (4) entrapment was available as a defense when a criminal design originated with an officer who, by persuasion or deceit, enticed a law-abiding citizen to commit a crime that he would not have committed in the absence of such inducement; and (5) whenever the design of a person to commit a crime was clearly shown, slight acts done in furtherance of the design would constitute an attempt.</SPAN></P>

The children filed a contest to the wife's application for letters of administration on the ground that she was not the lawful widow of the decedent.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">The wife was refused a health certificate sought for the purpose of obtaining a marriage license because the examining physician found her to be afflicted with a communicable disease. A month later, the wife and decedent were married in Arizona in accordance with the laws of that state, and returned the next day to California where they lived until the decedent's death less than a year later. The children alleged that the marriage of the wife and the decedent was void because it was contracted between the parties for the specific purpose and with the specific intent of evading the laws of California. The court rejected the children's contention, holding that if California residents were married in another state in conformity with the laws of that state, even if their marriage in California would have been invalid, and they entered the other state with the avowed purpose of evading the laws of California, such motive did not invalidate the marriage. The court held that the marriage of the wife and the decedent, because it conformed with the laws of Arizona, was a valid marriage. The court rejected as inapplicable several cases cited by the children.</SPAN></P>

Specifically, the contractor claimed that Cal. Bus. &amp; Prof. Code &sect; 7116 was unconstitutional because it made any act which was &quot;wilful or fraudulent&quot; a subject of disciplinary action and that, since it was penal in its nature, it did not define the &quot;crime&quot; with sufficient particularity. The court held that &sect; 7116 was not a penal statute and the rules covering due process in criminal proceedings therefore did not apply. Likewise, the court held that Cal. Bus. &amp; Prof. Code &sect; 7114 and 7119 were not penal statutes. The court also held that there was sufficient evidence substantiating the allegation that the contractor charged an unlicensed builder a fixed commission for the use of his license.</SPAN></P>

Stat. 695, entered in the Superior Court of San Francisco County (California). Defendant argued, among other things, that the Act violated his constitutional right to bear arms and that he was subjected to an unconstitutional search and seizure.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">Defendant and a companion, while driving in a car, were followed by police officers whose suspicions were aroused. The officers stopped the car for investigation. As one officer opened a door of the car, he saw defendant slip a gun under his seat. While questioning defendant, the officers learned that he was on parole for a felony conviction. Defendant was convicted for possession of a deadly weapon as a convicted felon, in violation of the Act; the trial court denied his motion for a new trial. On appeal, the court held that the Act did not violate defendant's right to bear arms under Cal. Const. art. I, &sect; 1 because the Act was a proper exercise of the State's police power in protecting the welfare of society. Further, in addressing defendant's argument that there was a variance between the information and the proof in that the information charged that he owned and possessed the gun but there was no proof of ownership, the court found that the Act was worded in the disjunctive, so that proof of possession alone was sufficient; thus, defendant was not prejudiced by the information's wording. Also, the officers' warrantless search and seizure was not improper under the facts.</SPAN></P>

The trial court sustained the clerk's demurrer to the official's petition for a writ of mandate. The official argued that the ordinances were void and that &sect; 24300 left the question of consolidation of county offices to the board of supervisors and was therefore an unconstitutional delegation of powers under Cal. Const. art. XI, &sect; 5. The court affirmed, finding that &sect; 24300 was not unconstitutional. The statute did not attempt to delegate the legislative power to create a public office, fix the terms of the office, or prescribe the duties of the office. The statute did not lack uniformity of operation. The fact that the ordinances did not first separate the officers before the consolidations was not material.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">Plaintiff corporation challenged a decision of the Superior Court of Los Angeles County (California), which entered judgment notwithstanding the verdict (JNOV) in favor of defendants, a corporation and its driver, in a tort action. The trial court also ordered a new trial on defendants' cross-complaint.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">Four motor vehicles were involved in an accident. Plaintiff's vehicle was known as a tanker, and defendants' vehicle was a cattle truck and trailer. On appeal, plaintiff argued that the trial court erred in overturning its verdict. The court reversed the judgment notwithstanding the verdict and ordered a new trial on all issues. In doing so, the court held that there was evidence that both sides violated provisions of the motor vehicle code. However, the trial court did not instruct the jury relative to speed and other provisions of the code. Whether the speed of plaintiff's or of defendant's vehicle was the proximate cause of the damage, or was a bar to recovery because of contributory negligence of either driver, were jury questions that were not fully and fairly considered by the jury. Accordingly, the appellate court exercised its discretion to order a new trial on all of the issues. The court also determined that the JNOV was without support because of substantial evidence in the record to show the negligence of defendant's driver.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">The order granting a new trial as to part of the issues was affirmed. The JNOV was reversed. The appeal from the order granting the motion for JNOV was dismissed. The action was remanded for a new trial on all of the issues.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">Defendant appealed from the Superior Court of Los Angeles County (California), which entered a judgment convicting defendant of bookmaking, in violation of Cal.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">On appeal, the court rejected defendant's attack on the constitutionality of &sect; 337a. The terms &quot;pool-selling&quot; and &quot;bookmaking&quot; were so well understood that no person of ordinary intelligence could have misunderstood the import and meaning of the terms. These terms were of general use, and they had a well-accepted and recognized meaning throughout many jurisdictions. The court concluded that the term &quot;bookmaking&quot; clearly meant the making of a betting book. Further, the court rejected defendant's argument that the evidence was insufficient to support the conviction. The evidence showed that at the time of defendant's arrest he was in possession of all the paraphernalia and equipment necessary to perpetrate the crime of bookmaking as denounced by &sect; 337a(1). He had in his possession all of the paraphernalia commonly used by bookmakers in plying their trade. He was possessed of scratch sheets, owe sheets, and betting markers, the presence of which constituted the major element of the crime charged. The court concluded that logical and proper inferences could be drawn that such paraphernalia was being used for bookmaking purposes.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">The court dismissed defendant's attempted appeal from the judgment and affirmed the trial court's order denying defendant's motion for a new trial.</SPAN></P>

The court denied petitioner's alternative writ, holding that respondent's allegations supported his contention that he was justified. The facts did not establish abuse of discretion and respondent was not limited to taking action only in an urgent emergency situation. Alternative remedies suggested by petitioner were either equally drastic and injurious to petitioner, or did not provide adequate protection to the policyholders and the public. The fact that respondent's writ was granted without prior notice and hearing did not violate due process because the public interest required immediate action.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">The Superintendent refused to issue the building permit because the lot on which he sought to build a dwelling house did not front upon a public street nor upon a private easement that the city planning commission determined to be adequate as required by Los Angeles, Cal., Zoning Ordinance &sect; 12.03. The applicant argued that the planning commission wrongfully, arbitrarily, and capriciously refused to approve a private easement and that &sect; 12.03 was an unconstitutional delegation of legislative power to the planning commission. The trial court held no hearing and took no evidence when it denied the applicant's petition. On appeal, the court found that the city could properly prohibit the construction of a dwelling on property that had no access to a public street or an adequate easement when the city was concerned with access to a house by the fire or police department. The court interpreted &sect; 12.03 as granting the planning commission authority to grant a variance from the requirement of having access to a public street where a private easement served as an adequate substitute, and operation under &sect; 12.03 was not an exercise of legislative power.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">Upon decedent's death, it was discovered that he had money and personal property in excess of the amounts allowed for a recipient of old age security aid. The Department made a claim against the estate for double the amount of improperly received aid under Cal. Welf. &amp; Inst. Code &sect; 2223 and, after he refused the claim, brought suit against the executor. The trial court denied the executor's demurrer and, after the executor refused to answer, rendered a judgment for the Department. The court affirmed. The court refused to accept the executor's contention that &sect; 2223 was unconstitutional as a bill of attainder. While the double recovery was in the nature of a penalty and did not become effective until the decedent's death, the decedent was neither deprived of a trial nor adjudged a criminal. In order for the Department to recover, certain facts had to be judicially established and the penalty was effective against the decedent's estate rather than the decedent. Noting that the penalty was imposed both to further the desired ends of the benefit law and to secure compliance with it, the court found that the imposition of this penalty was within the legislative power of the state.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">Defendant appealed the judgments of the Superior Court of Marin County (California), which convicted him of possessing a dagger or sharp instrument while committed to a State prison, in violation of Cal. Penal Code &sect; 4502. Defendant also appealed the denial of his motion for a new trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">Defendant did not deny that he had been found to possess a homemade sharp-pointed knife with a 5 1/2-inch blade sharpened along one side. As a juvenile offender, defendant had been committed to the State prison by the California Youth Authority after he was convicted of second degree burglary at the age of 18 years. He alleged that he was not a prisoner &quot;committed&quot; to a State prison within the meaning of &sect; 4502. The court found the argument to be fallacious. A &quot;commitment,&quot; in the legal sense, could be lawfully issued by other than a judicial body. The Penal Code gave the Authority the lawful power to make orders transferring prisoners under their supervision from one state institution to another. Next, the court held that the fact that defendant was convicted of a misdemeanor, not a felony, did not make his commitment to the State prison by the Authority unlawful. Cal. Penal Code &sect; 5077 and other statutes authorizing the Authority to make such commitments were not unconstitutional. Lastly, even if defendant had been unlawfully confined, Cal. Penal Code &sect; 4502 still applied. An unlawful commitment did not confer upon defendant the right to possess weapons denied to other inmates.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">The commissioner revoked the broker's real estate license and business opportunity license based on his violation of Cal.

The court determined that the revocation of the broker's licenses under Cal. Bus. &amp; Prof. Code &sect;&sect; 10177(b), 10302(b) was legally proper because the commissioner could have suspended or revoked the licenses of a broker who had been convicted of a felony, knowledge of which the commissioner did not have at the time of last issuing a real estate license to him. The court did not agree with the broker's contention that Cal.  Bus. &amp; Prof.  &sect;&sect; 10177(f), 10302(e) were void for uncertainty and unconstitutional. The court explained that because the statutory standards of truth, honesty, and good reputation had been held to be constitutional in license application cases, it followed that they were constitutional insofar as the lack of those qualities constituted a cause for disciplinary action under &sect;&sect; 10177(f), 10302(e).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">The policeman worked for the city for 17 years, served in the armed forces for three years, and was reinstated to his former position upon discharge. The policeman worked for another two years and then applied for a retirement pension pursuant to 1931 Cal. Stat. 2785, &sect; 187(2), which was denied because he had not served 20 years &quot;in the aggregate&quot; as a member of the police department. The court found that the policeman was entitled to credit for the time served in the armed forces because at the time he entered the military, there was an established practice on the part of those that administered the pension program to include leaves of absence in computing &quot;aggregate&quot; service. The court also found that the city had the power to modify the pension plan and that 1945 Cal. Stat. 2954 &sect; 187.1 effectively limited the policeman's pension right to 50 percent of his salary. The court modified the award by striking the part that granted the policeman 1-2/3 percent of his annual salary for each year of service over 20 years because he could not earn any additional pension above that to which he was entitled on the effective date of the amendment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">The court modified the judgment that awarded mandamus relief to the policeman by striking the portion of the writ that compelled the city to pay him as part of his annual pension 1-2/3 percent of his annual salary for each year of service over an aggregate of 20 years. The court affirmed the judgment as modified, which compelled payment of an annual pension equal to 50 percent of the policeman's annual salary.</SPAN></P>

The trial court had based its finding upon an amendment to Cal. Civ. Code &sect; 139 (amended 1933). The wife had filed an action against defendant, a personal representative of the estate.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">The wife had procured a decree of divorce from the deceased husband in 1926. She was awarded monthly alimony. After his death in 1945, the wife sued the representative for the accrued balance of alimony. The trial court found that the wife had remarried in 1937, and that be reason of such remarriage the alimony obligation was terminated under &sect; 139. The court affirmed the judgment. The court held that as it read when the decree of divorce was entered, &sect; 139 constituted a statutory reservation of the power of modification, including termination, of the provisions for future alimony installments in all decrees of divorce entered in the courts of California. The amendment to &sect; 139 operated prospectively from the date of remarriage only upon installments of alimony not yet accrued at that time. It therefore could not have been said to deprive the wife of any right that had already vested in her by virtue of the decree.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">Plaintiff landowners appealed from a judgment of the Superior Court of Santa Clara County (California), which denied their request to compel defendant building inspector to issue a building permit.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">The landowners sought a writ of mandamus to compel the issuance of a building permit for construction of a business. The landowners contended that an ordinance limiting the use of the landowners' property to residential purposes, as applied to the landowners, was arbitrary, unconstitutional, discriminatory, and confiscatory and not a proper exercise of the police power. The landowners also claimed that defendant city was estopped from setting up the ordinance as a defense in the action. The court found that the ordinance as applied to the landowners was valid. Zoning ordinances, or ordinances excluding any commercial use, had to be reasonable, and the use excluded had to bear some reasonable relation to the public interest. Where reasonable minds differed as to the propriety of the classification, the legislative determination was conclusive. Under the applicable principles, there could be but little doubt that the ordinance involved represented a valid exercise of the city's police power. The right to use private property could be restricted by an ordinance that followed a reasonable plan. Further, the evidence failed to show the essential elements of an estoppel.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">While living single in Pennsylvania, the intestate borrowed money to purchase certain stock. After marrying, the intestate and his wife moved to California. The stock-related debt was repaid entirely from the intestate's post-marriage earnings. Neither the intestate nor his predeceased wife left a will. The wife's relatives filed a petition for determination of heirship and claimed that under Cal. Prob. Code &sect;&sect; 228, 229, they were entitled to all of the wife's separate property and one-half of the couple's community property. The intestate's heirs at law claimed that the entire estate was the intestate's separate property. The trial court found that the relatives were entitled to one-half of the intestate's personal property and that the heirs at law were entitled to the other one-half, together with all of the intestate's real property. On appeal, the court held that the trial court properly reclassified the property acquired in Pennsylvania in accordance with California's community property laws. Because the stock was paid for after the marriage and the remaining personal property was acquired after the marriage, the relatives were statutory heirs under &sect;&sect; 228, 229.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">Appellant, the State Board of Dry Cleaner, challenged an order of the Superior Court of Alameda County (California) granting a preliminary injunction. The injunction enjoined the Board from enforcing as to respondent dry cleaner or seeking to enforce any of the price orders and price lists, and from establishing any minimum price schedules pursuant to the provisions of Cal. Bus. &amp; Prof. Code &sect;&sect; 9553-9566 until further order of the trial court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">A majority of the Board's licensees in the county, pursuant to Cal. Bus. &amp; Prof. Code &sect; 9563, filed a petition to establish minimum price schedules for various items of cleaning, dyeing, and pressing service. The dry cleaner alleged that the prices established by the Board were exorbitant and unfair to the public. It argued that if the minimum price schedules were enforced it would lose the lower price-bracket group of its customers. Simply because the injunction issued, the court noted that it did not necessarily follow that the trial court entertained the conviction that the legislation was unconstitutional. It could also be reasonably assumed that the trial court concluded that the Board would suffer no serious detriment by permitting prices to remain as they were, and that less harm would come by granting the injunction than by denying it. The court lastly noted that the Board's treatment of the case bore out the dry cleaner's contention that the facts relating to the actual conduct, practices, and usages of the trade, of which courts had no judicial knowledge, was required to be brought out at a trial, before any court could decide the ultimate question of constitutionality.</SPAN></P>

Each defendant had prior felonies and was found to be an habitual criminal under the Habitual Criminal Act, Cal. Penal Code &sect; 644. On review, the court held that the evidence was amply sufficient to support the verdicts, including the positive identification of defendants by three witnesses, their possession of the second car, and their unsatisfactory explanations of that fact. By pleading not guilty to the counts charging possession of a prohibited firearm with a prior felony conviction, defendants put into issue all of the facts necessary for a conviction of the charge and thus the necessary reference to prior convictions could not be held to be prejudicial. Moreover, the trial court instructed the jury that, aside from purposes of impeachment, the evidence of the prior felony convictions could be considered only in reaching the verdicts on those possession counts. The court rejected defendants' contention that &sect; 644 made the act of being a habitual criminal a separate felony, holding that the allegations of previous convictions were not allegations of substantive crimes.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">The taxpayer alleged that the statutes under which the board appropriated funds for the association were unconstitutional. At the hearing to show cause why the taxpayer's motion for a preliminary hearing should not be granted, it was learned that the board had already appropriated the funds and delivered them to the association. Thus, the issue of a preliminary injunction was moot. The court affirmed the trial court's dismissal of the taxpayer's complaint, holding that because the injunctive relief was moot, only the declaratory relief was before the trial court. The court held that the trial court did not err in refusing to issue a declaratory judgment because it had discretion to do so if it determined that the declaratory judgment was not necessary or proper at the time. Secondly, the court held that it was not error for the trial court to refuse to permit the taxpayer to amend his first amended complaint at the hearing on the demurrers filed by the board and association. The taxpayer had not served the opposing parties with the proposed amendment or demonstrated why its filing was necessary or proper.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the landowners' relied on a prior appellate opinion regarding costs. The order was affirmed. The court noted that there was no question in the prior appeal as to whether the amounts or the subject matter of the items of costs were proper. The court ruled that not all costs incurred by the landowners were recoverable. The landowners had to rely on a statute for an award of costs, and the measure of the statute was the measure of the right to recover costs. The court concluded that Rule 26(c) was a reasonable regulation in the matter of allowing costs for printing briefs, including the briefs in an eminent domain case. The trial court ruled correctly in striking out the amount of claimed costs for printing briefs in excess of $ 100.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">Appellants, arrested individuals and a club, sought review of two decisions of the Superior Court of the City and County of San Francisco (California), which denied the petition for a writ of prohibition and an injunction to restrain the trials of the individuals who had been arrested in raids of the club for keeping and maintaining a place where draw poker was carried on and conducted in violation of San Francisco, Cal., Police Code &sect; 288.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">The writ of prohibition sought to restrain the trial and the injunction sought to prevent further raids and arrests on similar charges. After the trial court denied the requests the individuals and the club filed two appeals, which were consolidated for review. The individuals and the club argued that &sect; 288 was unconstitutional on the grounds that it was a duplication of state law and in conflict with that law, the portions that did not conflict with state law were inseparable from those that were in conflict and therefore the whole section must fall, and the legislation was unreasonable. The argument was that &sect; 288 conflicted with Cal. Penal Code &sect; 330. The court disagreed and determined that there was not a conflict that required invalidation of the ordinance. Neither draw, nor draw low ball poker was prohibited by state law and therefore San Francisco, Cal., Police Code &sect; 288, when invoked against places where those gambling gamers were played, was not in conflict with Cal. Penal Code &sect; 330, or any other state law. Finally, the court concluded that the legislation was not unreasonable or oppressive. The municipality had the right to condemn gambling.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">The court affirmed the trial court's judgment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">An incompetent was found insane at the time of the commission of a burglary and committed to a state hospital for the criminally insane. The probate court denied the department's petition for an order directing the guardian of the estate to pay the incompetent's board, care, and maintenance at the hospital on the ground that the matter was better threshed out in a civil action. The department appealed. The court reversed because the election to proceed under Cal. Welf. &amp; Inst. Code &sect; 6655 was that of the department and not the probate court, which was required to accept jurisdiction over all the issues that could have been raised in a proceeding under Cal. Welf. &amp; Inst. Code &sect; 6658. The court held that the estate was liable for care furnished before and after the 1945 amendment to Cal. Welf. &amp; Inst. Code &sect; 6650, which clarified the existing law regarding liability for care for persons committed to custodial confinement under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 1026. The court found that &sect; 6650 was not inconsistent with the veterans' guardianship law and or unreasonable in requiring establishment of sanity by jury rather than a superintendent's certificate.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">Appellant devisee sought reversal of the judgments of the Superior Court of Yuba County (California), which decreed partial distribution and settled the first account of appellee executor. The trial court authorized the executor to deduct the amount of the inheritance tax due the state, as well as the pro rata share of the federal estate tax, from the real and personal property that the executor proposed to distribute to the devisee.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">The will provided that the real property left to the devisee was to be free and clear of all liens of any kind and character and description, and if there were any such liens at the time of the testator's death, the same were to be paid before any other payment or distribution. On appeal, the court made a de novo interpretation of the will and concluded that the testator intended the devisee to receive the real property but not the personal property free and clear of all liens, including tax liens. The court noted that Cal. Rev. &amp; Tax Code &sect; 13401 et seq., made the tax a lien on transferred property, directed the executor to collect the tax from the transferee, and provided for nondelivery until collection. The court also noted that Cal. Prob. Code &sect; 970 directed the executor to prorate the federal estate tax among the various distributees unless otherwise directed by the will. The court ruled that &sect; 970 did not violate the Fourteenth Amendment. The court held that in determining the amount of state inheritance and federal estate taxes that the executor was authorized to deduct from the devisee's share, the value of the real property could not be considered.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">The court annulled the order of the trial court and remanded the matter to the trial court.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">In respondent tobacco exporter's action to obtain a refund of personal property tax that appellant county assessed against a shipment of tobacco, the Superior Court of Los Angeles County (California) entered a judgment for the exporter and ordered the county to refund the tax. The county appealed. It contended that the conclusion of law that the tax was illegally assessed was erroneous.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">The Virginia tobacco exporter placed a quantity of tobacco on a steamship for shipment to Hong Kong. The ship put in at Los Angeles to take on additional cargo. Because of the declaration of war with Japan and orders of the United States Navy, the voyage was terminated at Los Angeles. The exporter immediately made plans to ship the cargo by rail back to Virginia. The county taxed the cargo. In upholding the illegality of the tax, the court held that the tobacco was in the course of a foreign and interstate movement and in transit on the taxing date, and that it was not legally assessable or taxable by the county by virtue of the provisions of the Commerce Clause, U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 8. cl. 3, and the Export-Import Clause, U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 8, cl. 2. The court found that (1) the interruption in the shipment of the tobacco was an involuntary interruption caused by the intervention of duly constituted governmental authority owing to wartime conditions, and (2) the delay in Los Angeles did not constitute such a break in its foreign or interstate transit as to remove the tobacco from the protections of the Commerce Clause or the Export-Import Clause.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">The lower court judgment that ordered the county to refund the personal property tax it assessed against the tobacco exporter was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

The property owner contended that this was in error. The court found that under Cal. Civ. Proc. Code &sect; 330 and Cal. Civ. Code &sect; 2911, the bond holder was barred from recovery on the bond. The court also found that the amendment to the aforementioned statute was constitutional because it provided the bondholder, and others similarly situated, a reasonable time in which to recover on the contract.

The judgment held that the trust was void in toto because several of its provisions violated the rule against perpetuities and the rule against restraints on alienation, and it awarded the entire estate to respondent, the testator's daughter.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">The testator's testamentary trust gave its income to his daughter for life. If the daughter survived the testator but died within 24 years of the testator, and left issue, the child or children received the income until the 24-year period elapsed, at which time the trust terminated and the remainder interests vested in possession. The probate court found that the trust violated the rules against perpetuities and against restraints on alienation, that the invalid provisions were not severable from the trust, and that the daughter was entitled to the entire estate. The remaindermen argued that the rule against perpetuities did not exist in the State, and that even if it did, the invalid provisions were severable from the valid provisions. In reversing the probate court's judgment, the court held that the State had both the rule against restraints on alienation, with its statutory period of lives in being or 25 years, and the rule against remoteness of vesting, with its common-law period of lives in being and 21 years. The court found that several trust provisions violated the rule against perpetuities but that they were severable from the remainder of the trust.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">On appeal, the transportation company argued that the trial court erred in denying its request for the recovery of transportation license taxes it paid the Board under protest. Upon review, the court found the transportation company's argument without merit. If the legislature intended, by the slight changes made in the wording of the law, that in determining gross receipts subject to taxation, only that portion of a single fare attributable to transportation in unincorporated territory should be taxed, no reason appeared why cryptic language should have been used. Where prorationing was intended, as provided in Cal. Rev. &amp; Tax. Code &sect; 9606, the legislature so provided in definite terms. Its failure to provide for the apportionment of gross receipts from intercity travel on a mileage basis, when it specifically so provided regarding interstate travel, was convincing evidence that no such result was intended. The fact that the legislature did not intend to provide for prorationing as claimed was indicated by Cal. Rev. &amp; Tax. Code &sect; 9652.</SPAN></P>

The executors were to recompute ratable distribution accordingly. The trial court found that the petition for ratable distribution, as supplemented, was contrary to the terms of the will and the law applicable, and did not correctly set forth the items chargeable against the gifts contained in the will and accordingly did not represent the net amount due to respondents, the legatees and devisees, after deduction of charges.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">Appellant attorney challenged a judgment from the Superior Court of Los Angeles County (California) upholding the validity of Los Angeles, Cal., Code &sect; 21.190 (1946) imposing a business license tax on the conduct of certain businesses within the city, in an action against respondents, city clerk and others. The attorney asserted that the ordinance was unconstitutionally vague and that the city lacked authority to impose the tax.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">The attorney brought a declaratory relief action against respondents attacking the constitutionality of &sect; 21.190 on the grounds of vagueness and lack of authority in the city to impose a tax on occupations. The trial court rendered judgment for respondents, upholding the constitutionality of the ordinance, and the attorney appealed. The court affirmed, ruling that, although the ordinance had not specifically stated that it applied only to persons engaged in business within the city limits, it was manifest that it did. The court applied the rule that where an ordinance was susceptible of two constructions, the court would adopt the construction that rendered it valid and constitutional. The court further held that the contention that respondent city was without power to levy a business tax for revenue purposes was without merit. The city of Los Angeles had taken advantage of the privilege of legislative autonomy extended by the provisions of Cal. Const. art. XI, &sect;&sect; 6, 8. The imposition of the tax for revenue purposes was a municipal affair, which the municipality possessed, and the city's charter had not limited that power. Thus, the court concluded that the tax was valid.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">Certain property was assessed for taxation in 1932. When the taxes went unpaid, the tax collector sold the property to the state on September 2, 1933. The property was not redeemed and was deeded to the state on July 2, 1933. In 1945, the tax sale purchaser bought the property from the state. The tax sale purchaser brought an action to quiet title after the landowners claimed an interest in the property. The trial court quieted the title in favor of the tax sale purchaser. The landowners sought review and the court affirmed. The court rejected the landowners' claim that the deed to the state was improper because it was issued less than five years after the sale. The court agreed that under Cal. Pol. Code &sect; 3785, it appeared that a deed made less than five years after the sale was invalid. However, the court said that that section was required to be read in concert with other sections of the Political Code pertaining to sales of delinquent tax property. Those sections originally set the time for the 1933 sale as July 1, but then extended the period by 61 days. Further, the court said, if no extension had been made, then the time for the sale would have been July 2, 1938.</SPAN></P>

The theater claimed that the license tax constituted an impermissible double tax under Cal. Const. art. XIII and was imposed in a discriminatory manner. The court affirmed the judgment, concluding that the license did not constitute a double tax because art XIII applied to property and was inapplicable when a municipality imposed a license for the purpose of regulation of revenue. The court observed that the mere fact that a business was required to pay regulatory taxes under the police power and also pay additional property taxes for the purpose of revenue under another ordinance did not render the ordinances void on the grounds of double taxation which did not apply to excises. The court explained that the city ordinance was an authorized levy and collection of license taxes for conducting business within the city. The court further found absent a city charter provision prohibiting such a levy, the license tax was a substantive and procedurally valid exercise of municipal police power.</SPAN></P>

The trial court found in favor of the state. The corporation appealed, contending that the tax did not apply to it as a foreign corporation and that the action was barred by res judicata. The court rejected both contentions, finding that evidence at trial supported the finding that the corporation was actively engaged in business transactions in California for financial and pecuniary profit and therefore liable for taxes. The court also found that a federal judgment was not res judicata of the issues of the suit. The court noted that the former federal judgment, which was offered in evidence as a bar to this action, was merely against certain named officers of the state, as such, and not against the State of California. The court therefore found that the federal case was not a suit against the State of California, and it was therefore not res judicata in the action or an estoppel against the state maintaining the action for unpaid franchise taxes.</SPAN></P>

Petitioner was convicted of a violation of a city ordinance prohibiting the obstruction of a street or sidewalk by a crowd or persons when directed by police officers to disburse. Petitioner was standing on a lightly-traveled street addressing between 100 and 150 workers on the Taft-Hartley Act then pending before Congress.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">Petitioner was directed to move on by a police officer but refused to do so. The conviction was affirmed on appeal. Petitioner contended that the ordinance was unconstitutional in that it was an abridgment of the rights of free speech and assembly and was a violation of the privileges and immunities clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Petitioner particularly asserted that the United States Supreme Court, by case law dictum, limited the scope of regulations on the user of streets for public meetings to &quot;busy&quot; streets or intersections. The court disagreed and held that the essence of the issue was whether or not the regulation was reasonable. The court held that the ordinance was constitutional and did not prevent, or attempt to prevent, any use of the public streets which did not obstruct the free passage of the general public; rather, it prohibited the obstruction of passage of some members of the public along the street. Whether the obstruction merely impaired the progress of one member of the general public, or a thousand, did not alter the case and the factual determination that petitioner obstructed the passage of persons and refused to leave when requested.</SPAN></P>

A warrant was issued for his arrest for the purpose of his extradition to Colorado. He was placed under arrest and detained in Los Angeles. Petitioner contended that his arrest and detention were unlawful in that Cal. Penal Code &sect; 1549.1 was in conflict with the Constitution and laws of the United States. Petitioner was not in Colorado on the date that the alleged crime was committed. Thus, he argued that he could not have fled or been a fugitive from justice as stated in U.S. Const. art. IV, &sect; 2, cl. 2 or 18 U.S.C.S. &sect; 662. Under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 1549.1 there was no requirement that in an extradition proceeding the accused must have fled from justice. Petitioner argued that this was inconsistent with 18 U.S.C.S. &sect; 662 because the demanding state, Colorado, had not also adopted such a statute on extradition. The court held that &sect; 662 placed minimum requirements on the duty to extradite and did not prevent or preempt the States from allowing extradition on lower standards.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">Plaintiff corporation appealed the judgment of the Superior Court of Santa Barbara County (California), which denied the corporation's writ of mandate to compel defendants, city, its mayor, and city council (council), to annul and rescind their action in revoking a permit for the drilling of an oil well within the city limit.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">The corporation owned an oil lease for 10 years over approximately 80 acres in the city. The corporation applied to the council for a permit to drill an additional well. Santa Barbara, California Ordinance No. 1613, which governed the issuance of drilling permits, provided for a hearing by the council on each application and provided that a permit should be granted unless it materially affected the health and safety of the public. The council granted the corporation's permit, and the corporation promptly commenced drilling the well. A subsequently enacted city zoning ordinance prohibited oil drilling in the area of the city. The council revoked the corporation's permit at a special meeting without any notice and without a hearing. The trial court held that the revocation was a valid exercise of the city's police power. The court disagreed and held that the council could not exercise unlimited discretion to revoke permits. The corporation had a vested property right under the permit. The corporation had begun construction of the oil well and incurred liability for future work. The court held that the corporation's permit could not be revoked arbitrarily without cause.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">The court reversed the judgment of the trial court and held that the city, its mayor, and council arbitrarily revoked the corporation's permit to drill an oil well without prior notice, without a hearing, without evidence, and in violation of the corporation's right to due process. The court ordered the trial court to grant the corporation's writ of mandate.</SPAN></P>

The corporation owned and operated both the power and telephone lines. Respondents brought an action to recover from the corporation the expenses incurred by their fighting and extinguishing the fire, under the fire liability law, 1931 Cal. Stat. 1644. The case was consolidated for purposes of trial with two other actions filed against the corporation by persons whose property was damaged by the same fire. Judgment was rendered in favor of all plaintiffs, but the corporation only appealed from the judgment in favor of respondents. The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court. The court held that the corporation, charged with knowledge of the condition of its equipment, took no steps to prevent the occurrence of fire, which was the reasonably foreseeable consequence of that condition. The court held that the fire liability law treated all persons similarly situated in the same manner and that the classification made by the statute was a rational and justifiable one.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">The painter instituted an action against the state to challenge the requirement that the painter possess a contractor's license and to restrain the state from prosecuting him for carrying on his business without a license. The superior court sustained the state's demurrers to the complaint without leave to amend and entered judgment for the state. The court affirmed and held that the licensing requirement applied to the business of painting buildings and other structures, that Cal. Bus. &amp; Prof. Code &sect; 7-26, the section defining contractors, was not void for uncertainty, and that the California Business and Professions Code was not unconstitutional. The court held that if all contractors were not builders under the common definitions of those words, then they were made so by the special definition of the statute and that a painting contractor was a contractor under the statutory definition. The court also found that the regulation of the business of painting contractors was within the state's police powers and served the public interest by providing protection against possible frauds.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">Defendant sought review of the decision of the Superior Court of San Joaquin County (California), which entered a judgment of conviction against him after a jury found him guilty of concealment of stolen goods, a violation of Cal. Penal Code &sect; 496bb, and denied his motion for a new trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">Defendant was convicted of concealing a vehicle that was stolen in another county, painted, and stored in a garage in the county where he was charged. After the trial court denied his request for a new trial, defendant appealed. On appeal, defendant claimed that the evidence was insufficient to support the judgement because, first, even if he had committed the crime as charged, it occurred more than three years before the indictment. Therefore, the statute of limitations had run. Second, the crime, if committed by defendant, was committed in another jurisdiction. On review, the court held that the evidence showed specific affirmative acts of concealment calculated to conceal the car from its owner at the time charged in the indictment and not merely one act of concealment. The court further held that there was ample evidence that the car's storage in a camouflaged state, the failure to register the vehicle, among other things, were all acts of concealment within the county of jurisdiction. Finally, the court noted that the verdict was proper in that it expressed an intent to convict for the crime charged, and the form of the verdict was not material.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the manufacturers, in their complaint for the injunction, failed to show compliance with the provisions of Cal.

Defendant argued that the statute was too vague to meet due process requirements. The trial court convicted defendant and he appealed. On appeal the court affirmed defendant's conviction. The court held that as long as a key operated more than one lock or ignition switch, but each such lock or ignition switch also could be operated by a key that would not work in the lock or ignition switch of any other vehicle whose lock or switch could be operated by the first key, then the first key was a master key. Defendant also argued that the statute was vague and uncertain because it referred, in the singular, to a key, while the evidence at the trial showed that more than one key was necessary to constitute a set capable of opening all of the cars of a given group. The court concluded that the argument overlooked the fact that Cal. Penal Code &sect; 7 stated that the singular number included the plural.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">Appellants, company and two employees, sought review of various convictions on several counts of misdemeanor violations of safety provisions of the labor code by the Municipal Court for the Los Angeles Judicial District of Los Angeles County (California). The trial court convicted appellants for failing to follow special orders given by the engineer with the California Division of Industrial Safety.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">Appellants, company and two employees, were convicted of misdemeanor violations for failure to follow special orders by the California Division of Industrial Safety under Cal. Lab. Code &sect;&sect; 6300- 6604. Counts were tried separately and as a result, some convictions were reviewed before the other counts were tried and it was found unconstitutional to predicate criminal charges on the orders issued under Cal. Lab. Code &sect; 6313 because the statute provided no prior notice to appellants and no opportunity to be heard. The court reversed the convictions and found that the special orders appellants were convicted of violating were unconstitutional. The instructions given to the jury at trial purported to give the special orders the effect of law in violation of the requirement that safety orders be promulgated in compliance with due process prerequisites of notice and hearing, and therefore, the misdirection of the jury was not harmless error under Cal. Const. art. VI, &sect; 13. Additionally, supervisors, such as two employee appellants, were excluded from Cal Lab. Code &sect; 6304 by amendment in 1973.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">The court reversed the misdemeanor convictions based on the special orders because such convictions were deemed unconstitutional between the time appellants, company and two employees, were convicted on different counts. The court applied the standard that they were unconstitutional because the statute provided no prior notice to appellants of intent to issue them and no opportunity to be heard concerning their issuance.</SPAN></P>

No. 95789 &sect; 2, subd. h and Cal. Penal Code &sect; 602.4 for selling newspapers at the Los Angeles International Airport.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">Appellant vendor sold alternative newspapers at the airport. He did not have a permit to sell newspapers, and one vendor was granted the exclusive permit to sell the newspapers, with the unilateral right to decide which ones were sold. Appellant was convicted of violating Los Angeles City Ord. No. 95789 &sect; 2, subd. h and Cal. Penal Code &sect; 602.4 both of which precluded commercial activity at the airport without a permit. The court held that Cal. Penal Code &sect; 602.4 did not apply and, as the prosecutor concurred, treated the concurrence as a reversal of the conviction under that charge. The court held that the ordinance was too broadly drawn and interfered with appellant's protected rights to free speech under U.S. Const. amend. 1, and further held that the city's action in giving the unilateral right to decide what newspapers were sold to the single vendor licensed to sell newspapers also violated U.S. Const. amend. 1. The court reversed the conviction and found that the sidewalks were a historical forum for free speech and the prohibitions against commercial activity at the airport were not balanced with the right to free speech.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">The court reversed the convictions because the city ordinance and the manner in which the sole holder of the newspaper permit determined what newspapers were to be sold at the airport violated the First Amendment and because the prosecutor conceded that the penal code provision did not apply to the activities at the airport.</SPAN></P>

Code Regs. tit. 14, &sect; 108, adopted pursuant to 50 C.F.R. &sect; 280.7(b)(2). The complaint alleged that defendant was in charge of a fishing vessel after the closing of the yellow fin tuna season, entered the regulated fishing area, and willfully and unlawfully possessed on board an amount of yellow fin tuna in excess of 15 percent by round weight of his total catch. The trial court convicted defendant, placed him on probation, and ordered that his fish be forfeited. On appeal the court reversed defendant's conviction. The court concluded that the state regulation under which defendant was charged was an infringement of a preempted area of law. The court held that while existing statutes may be incorporated by reference, prospective incorporation had never been approved by a California court. Defendant may not have gained knowledge of the federal law because the regulation may have been adopted after he had checked the federal register. Such notice did not afford a person of ordinary intelligence a reasonable opportunity to know what was prohibited so that he may act accordingly.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">Appellant received a citation alleging that he was in violation of Cal. Veh.

Appellant contended that the issue existed as to whether one charged with, and convicted of, the commission of an infraction in violation of this section was unconstitutionally deprived of the right to a jury trial. The appellate court held that such a person was not entitled to a jury trial, and affirmed the judgment. It stated that offenses of the same class as those now classified as infractions by the California Vehicle Code were historically triable by courts sitting without juries.

The court reversed the judgment. The court held that the limited and peculiar nature of the interest asserted by respondent was not of the fundamental kind of right which invoked an attitude of critical analysis, subjecting the classification to strict scrutiny and to proof of a compelling state interest. Respondent's desire to resist and defeat his duty to support his child unless and until appellant proceeded against the mother did not invoke subjecting classification to strict scrutiny. The court concluded that it was the legal duty of both parents to support their children, but that in the existing state of society, fathers generally were better situated to meet the obligation. The court opined that the fact that there could be exceptions such as indigent or dissolute fathers, or wealthy and independent mothers, did not vitiate the reasonableness of &sect; 270.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">Appellants, residents of California, had filed an action against respondent, a resident of Washington, seeking monetary damages for respondent's failure to properly service appellant's automobile. Arguing that it constituted property, appellants attached respondent's insurance company's contractual obligation to defend and indemnify respondent in case of a civil suit. Respondent moved to quash, challenging both personal and quasi in rem jurisdiction. The motion was granted and appellant sought review. The court reversed the lower court's order. It held that a contractual obligation to indemnify constituted a property right, one that furnished a nexus with the forum state, was present in the state, and was created upon filing of the action. It was thus subject to attachment. Additionally, the debt was attachable because the obligation to defend was certain; only the amount of damages was uncertain. Finally, respondent's argument claiming state law prohibited direct actions against insurers was a misreading of the law.</SPAN></P>

Penal Code &sect; 311.2. Applying the Roth test, it held that the book was obscene, finding that it appealed to a prurient interest in sex, was patently offensive by contemporary community standards, and was without redeeming social value. The court found that the jury instructions accurately reflected the standard used to define obscenity and correctly defined the state of California as the area to be considered in determining community standards, writing that even if there had been error it would have been harmless beyond a reasonable doubt because the materials were unquestionably obscene. It rejected appellants' argument that the people had failed to prove that they had knowledge of the book's contents, noting that appellants were adult booksellers who worked on site and that their knowledge could be established through this circumstantial evidence. Finally, it found that the procedures used in issuing and executing the search warrant for the materials were more than adequate to avoid suppression of constitutionally protected publications.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">Defendants were convicted of violating Cal. Penal Code &sect; 302 and other violations. On appeal, defendants urged that the trial court erred in refusing to grant their motion for substitution of counsel, that the jury committed misconduct, and that &sect; 302 was unconstitutionally vague. The court affirmed the convictions. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to allow a substitution of counsel, given that defendants had ample time due to continuances to procure other counsel, but did not, and did not renew their objection at trial. The court held that conversations overheard by jurors did not constitute discussions of issues in the case; nor was it improper for the jury forewoman to draw up a diagram and list of issues for the jurors to consider. The court held that &sect; 302 was not unconstitutionally vague because defendants were on notice that their conduct in banging on doors and windows, screaming and running through the church, and assaulting churchgoers, would constitute &quot;rude behavior&quot; and &quot;unnecessary noise&quot; within the statute.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">In consolidated appeals, the state appealed judgments that dismissed charges against defendant fisherman that alleged that defendants used an illegal purse seine net, in violation of Cal.

The reviewing court rejected defendants' contentions, as accepted by the trial court, that defendants' illegal activity, which occurred three miles offshore, was not within the state's boundaries and that the state had no authority to regulate the activity. The court ruled that prevailing case law restricted only the state's power to convey real property; the cases did not determine the political boundaries of the state.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">Respondents were charged with violating a city ordinance, which prohibited nude dancing in city bars. The municipal court sustained the demurrers to the criminal complaints on the ground the ordinance was unconstitutional. The court reversed.  Cal. Penal Code &sect;&sect; 318.5 and 318.6 permitted the city to adopt this type of ordinance free from the restraint of preemption. Further, the ordinance was constitutional. Where speech and nonspeech elements were combined in the same course of conduct, a sufficiently important governmental interest in regulating the nonspeech aspect would justify incidental limitations on First Amendment freedoms. The city council found in the ordinance's preamble that nude performances in bars involved police problems that substantially increased the police department's workload and provided greater opportunity for lewd conduct thereby adversely affecting the general welfare. Thus, there was a substantial governmental interest served in regulating businesses that caused police problems. This governmental interest was unrelated to the suppression of free speech; and the incidental restriction was no greater than was essential to the furtherance of that interest.</SPAN></P>

The court found that defendants were on school property or adjacent property without any lawful business. The court stated that the assertion of U.S. Const. amend. I rights did not permit defendants to flout traffic laws and that picketing in a manner that interfered with traffic was clearly not lawful business as defined by &sect; 602.9. The court stated that continuation of the conduct after defendants were requested to leave exhibited the general intent required by the statute. Further, the court found that defendants disrupted school activities by obstructing the entrance to the school and that after being asked to leave, defendants continued to pass out leaflets and talk to drivers who were forced to slow down and stop because of the group activity.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">Defendant, during a period of campus unrest, was arrested for remaining at a meeting after issuance of an administrative order prohibiting all meetings except classes, and charged with unlawful assembly under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 409. Defendant refused to present a defense, was convicted, and refused probation. Defendant appealed. The court found that state showed that the order banning assemblies on campus was properly authorized and that there was sufficient evidence of the threat of violence prior to the meeting to justify its issuance. The temporary order was not overbroad given the emergency that precipitated the ruling, and it clearly furthered school administration. The court concluded that school officials had to protect the constitutional rights of all, even a majority, in danger of violence. Furthermore, there was no duty to consult with student groups before issuing the order. Accordingly, the conviction was affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">The court affirmed defendant's conviction for unlawful assembly. The court found that state presented substantial evidence to support the finding that defendant's college's president validly issued the administrative order prohibiting student assembly in response to campus violence and that defendant could be convicted of unlawful assembly under the requisite criminal statute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">The trial court granted defendants' motions to suppress evidence of the contents of the sacks held by the passengers upon departing the fishing vessels upon which defendants were deckhands. The fish and game wardens had no cause to believe that either passenger had committed any crime and had no reason to believe that the sacks contained fish which were in such condition that the species could not be determined. The determinative question was whether a warden could have searched a sack without a warrant. Defendants contended that any right of inspection was conditioned upon a demand being first made by a warden that fish be exhibited and that no such demand was made. The court did not read Cal. Fish &amp; Game Code &sect; 2012 as qualifying all of the other provisions of the code relating to inspection. Defendants next contended that if the search was purportedly authorized by statute, it nevertheless was an unconstitutional search and seizure. The court found that the search made and the subsequent seizure of fish, each pursuant to statute, were not unreasonable.</SPAN></P>

In appealing his probation order defendant alleged that &sect; 614(d) was unconstitutionally overbroad and could not be enforced. The court on appeal affirmed the probation order. Under principles of statutory construction the statute was presumed to be constitutional and was to be given a constitutional interpretation if it was susceptible to two interpretations. In construing the statute the court held that the statute could not be violated by the use of words only. The general connotation of the statute was that it was meant to apply acts of flag desecration and not words. Therefore, use of the word &quot;defile&quot; in the statute did not render the statute unconstitutional. In addition, there was a legitimate state interest in protecting the flag, preventing violence, and maintaining the public peace that justified incidental limitations of the protection afforded symbolic speech by the First Amendment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

When their trial date was set in the municipal court nearly two months after their initial appearance before the magistrate, they moved to dismiss the misdemeanor count because they were not brought to trial within the time limits of &sect; 1382. On appeal, the court held that the municipal court erred in granting defendants' motion to dismiss. The court ruled that because defendants initially appeared before a magistrate, they were not arraigned on any criminal complaint in an &quot;inferior court.&quot; Thus, the court held, dismissal under &sect; 1382 was not available until they appeared before the municipal court, which was less than 30 days from the date set for trial. The court held that &sect; 1382 dealt with trials, therefore, the municipal court erred in holding that &sect; 1382 became operative upon defendants' arraignment before the magistrate, which invoked no trial court jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>

The conduct of defendants only had to disturb the public peace. It was not necessary that defendants' acts were violent in order to constitute a breach of the peace under &sect; 415.

Penal Code &sect; 647, which included among the acts constituting disorderly conduct, the acts of loitering and wandering upon the streets from place to place without apparent reason. Defendant appealed, contending that the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction. The arresting officer had received a report of a male prowler. Although the hour was not late, it was dark. He saw an isolated male pedestrian walking along the street in a suburban residential neighborhood at a point five blocks away from a reported prowling incident. The court held that it was the officer's duty to investigate the prowling complaint and when defendant could not seem to answer where he was going, the court held that his subsequent arrest and conviction could not be labeled as arbitrary or offensive. The court affirmed his conviction, finding no constitutional grounds for disturbing the judgment convicting him of disorderly conduct.</SPAN></P>

The trial court dismissed the action, finding that &sect; 12049(a)-(b) was facially invalid. The People appealed. The court affirmed, holding that &sect; 12049(a)-(b) was void on its face because it invaded defendant's freedom of speech in violation of U.S. Const. amends. I, XIV. The court relied on a United States Supreme Court opinion that held a similar ordinance unconstitutional.

There was also evidence that the hypnotist advertised his services. The fact that he did not claim to be a physician was not dispositive because he publicly professed to be able to diagnose and treat human ailments. The court also found that appellant was not entrapped by a state board medical examiner during her questioning of him because appellant denied the commission of the crime. Because he advertised and practiced hypnotism in the line of his regular business, he was caught, not entrapped. In addition, the court found that &sect; 2141 was not unconstitutional because it was not so vague or uncertain as to make it impossible for a defendant properly to defend himself.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">The trustee, as the trustee in bankruptcy for the estate of the debtor corporation, sought to foreclose a mechanic's lien upon the property owners' property. The trial court sustained the demurrer. It was undisputed that the trustee failed to comply with the provisions of Cal. Code Civ. Proc. &sect; 1193, which required written notice of an intent to file a mechanic's lien 15 days prior to filing the claim of lien. As such, the sole question on appeal involved the validity of &sect; 1193. Relying on a prior decision, the court ruled that &sect; 1193 was not valid. Specifically, the court relied upon the fact that the California Constitution placed mechanics, materialmen, artisans, and laborers in the same class, and that this equality thus could not have been impaired or destroyed by the California Legislature. The court rejected the argument that the prior decision dealt with substantive matters, while &sect; 1193 was procedural in nature. The court explained that even though a procedural classification might have been proper, it still had to have been reasonable and based on some legitimate difference. There was no sound basis for the distinction between the different types of laborers.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, defendant argued that &sect; 20007 was unconstitutional because of the uncertainty in the meaning of the word &quot;unattended.&quot; Defendant also contended that the complainant's vehicle was attended and that he was therefore, charged with a violation of the wrong statute. The court found that the meaning of &quot;unattended&quot; in &sect; 20007 was sufficiently certain and that the statute was constitutional. The court held, however, that to constitute an attended vehicle it was not necessary that the attending person be in the car when it was struck. It was only necessary that he be on or appear on the scene in time for defendant to give him the information required by Cal. Veh. Code &sect; 20005.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">Defendant's conviction arose from an accidental overdose of insulin combined with taking two drinks containing vodka. Defendant contended that the evidence was insufficient, that an instruction was erroneous, and that the use of the word &quot;drug&quot; in Cal. Veh. Code &sect; 23102 was unconstitutionally vague. Defendant also contended that the real constitutional problem was not whether insulin was a drug but whether drugs such as insulin when taken normally may have been the basis of a prosecution under &sect; 23102. The court held that no penalty was placed on the use of the drug itself. The penalty was placed upon driving under the influence. No matter how innocently a person may get &quot;under the influence&quot; of intoxicating liquor or drugs or both, his safety and the safety of others required that he not drive. The court held the trial court modified a jury instruction requested by defendant regarding the jury's need to determine whether or not insulin was a drug within &sect; 23102a. The court held although the instruction was confusing and erroneous it was helpful to defendant, and the issue of whether insulin was a drug was not an issue for the jury. The court concluded defendant was not prejudiced.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">Defendants appealed the judgment of the Municipal Court for the Pasadena Judicial District (California), which convicted defendants for gambling in violation of Cal. Penal Code &sect; 330 and for knowingly being present at a place where gambling was being conducted, in a violation of a city ordinance. The trial court rejected defendants' offer of proof that the statute and ordinance were deliberately applied differently by reason of race and color.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">The court found that question before was whether the offered proof was admissible as tending to show deliberate and intentional racial discriminatory enforcement of the criminal laws in violation of the equal protection guarantee of the 14th Amendment to the Constitution of the United States and of Cal. Const. art. I, &sect; 11. The court reversed defendants' convictions and held that the trial court should have permitted defendants to introduce any evidence they offered which tended to show actual intentional discrimination in the enforcement of the statute and ordinance. The court noted that it was not holding that the offered evidence proved the defense of discriminatory enforcement, rather, the court was merely holding that it was admissible in defendants' efforts to prove that defense. The court held that it was error and wholly unsatisfactory to determine whether that defense was sufficient merely on an offer of proof.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">The court reversed the judgment of the trial court and remanded the case to the trial court with direction ordering that the trial court was to admit all competent evidence not inconsistent with the court's opinion on the issue of the unconstitutional application of the statute and ordinance in question.</SPAN></P>

The trial court sustained a demurrer filed by the owner and contractor for on the ground that the complaint failed to comply with the notice requirements of Cal.  Code Civ.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">The materialman recorded a claim of lien for materials furnished and then brought this foreclosure action. The demurrer to the complaint was sustained without leave to amend because the complaint did not allege that the materialman gave written notice to the owner and contractor prior to the filing of the claim of lien as prescribed by &sect; 1193. The materialman argued on appeal that the notice requirement of &sect; 1193 was unconstitutional because it discriminated between materialmen, who were required to provide notice, and certain classes of laborers who were not. The court ruled that pursuant to Cal. Const. art. XX, &sect; 15, both materialmen and laborers had a constitutional right to a lien. The effect of the constitutional provision was to place mechanics, materialmen, artisans, and laborers in the same class. Their equality was thus established by the state Constitution and could not be impaired or destroyed by the legislature. The distinction drawn by the notice requirement of Cal Code Civ. Proc. &sect; 1193 therefore violated the Constitution and the demurrer to the materialman's complaint should not have been sustained.</SPAN></P>

The trial court dismissed the case, finding that the state conducted discriminatory enforcement of the gambling laws. On appeal, the court reversed. The court found that the trial court's minute order failed to show the reasons why the dismissal was in the interest of justice as required by Cal. Penal Code &sect; 1385. The dismissal was void because the trial judge acted in a matter where he openly declared his bias and prejudgment without disqualifying himself. The trial judge revealed that he personally had charged that there was discriminatory law enforcement by the chief of police in an exchange of correspondence before the case was called for trial; that he rejected the official statement in response to his charge; and that he acted upon his own extrajudicial belief that there was discriminatory enforcement of the gambling laws against blacks, without receipt of evidence or a hearing. The trial judge exceeded his discretion confided to him under &sect; 1385.

Defendant conceded that it was within the power and discretion of the municipality to require a fence but contended that the requirement that the fence must be solid was for no other purpose than the aesthetic one of screening an unsightly business from the view of the passing public. The court determined that because the sole purpose of a solid fence was aesthetic, the requirement was an unreasonable interference with the right to carry on a lawful and legitimate business. San Diego, Cal., Municipal Code, Ordinance No. 33.0903.7 provided that the premises of an automobile wrecking establishment should be so arranged that reasonable inspection or access to all parts of the premises could be had at any time by proper fire, health, police and building authorities.

The State's argument that the ordinance could be enforced at the discretion of the municipality was of no comfort to the court, which held that this was the type of arbitrary and discriminatory aspect that invalidated an ordinance.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">Defendant contended that the ordinance violated the First and Fourteenth Amendments. The court affirmed defendant's conviction, holding that the First Amendment historically meant &quot;freedom from censorship&quot; or &quot;prior restraints&quot; which prevented free discussion of political questions or governmental action. Free speech had never meant that a speaker was free from accountability for what was written or printed. The requirement that the desired information be placed upon a handbill did not restrict what could be said, except the purely speculative personal possibility that someone might hesitate to identify himself with his own statements therein contained. Accordingly, the court held that the requirement was reasonably germane to the exercise of the police power because it provided a means of determining and securing responsibility for what was said. The state could by general and nondiscriminatory legislation regulate the times, places, and manner of speech, including the distribution of written speech. The court concluded that the ordinance's effect upon freedom of speech was too indirect and insubstantial for it to be unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

The court also found that Cal. Const. art. I, &sect; 15 prohibited imprisonment for civil debts. The court reversed, finding that &sect; 216 did not apply to defendant's situation as the employee was paid the agreed wages and that the employee was not entitled to have enforced the union contract when he agreed to wages on his own. The court also held that Cal. Lab. Code &sect; 204, which made it a misdemeanor not pay wages twice a month and Cal. Lab.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">A criminal complaint was filed against defendants for a violation of &sect; 2110. On a motion by defendants, the trial court dismissed the complaint on the ground that &sect; 2110 was unconstitutional as constituting imprisonment for debt. The State appealed and the court held that the constitutional prohibition against imprisonment for debt applied in criminal cases. The court found that the workers' contributions required under &sect; 2110 were taxes, and that the prohibition against imprisonment for debt applied to taxes. The court also held that &sect; 2110 came within the fraud exception to the constitutional prohibition against imprisonment for debt because an employer who knowingly withheld the deductions and then willfully failed to pay them did an act against good morals and fair dealing and necessarily intentionally did an act which prejudiced the rights of the employee. The court found that such conduct amounted to &quot;a case of fraud.&quot; The court further held that the word &quot;willfully&quot; in &sect; 2110 qualified not only the word &quot;fails,&quot; but also &quot;is financially unable&quot; and that a showing of willfulness was necessary for a conviction.</SPAN></P>

Code &sect; 307, plaintiff, the People of the State of California, appealed from the Municipal Court for the Glendale Judicial District (California), which sustained defendant's demurrer to the complaint and discharged defendant.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">On appeal, the court stated that the M2 zone designated in &sect; 307 was a zone where any use &quot;not prohibited in the city&quot; was expressly permitted. Nowhere in &sect; 307 was a &quot;bus storage facility&quot; expressly permitted, with the result that it was not expressly allowed in any of the zones other than zone M2, but neither was it expressly prohibited in the city, and so could be maintained in that part of the city falling within zone M2. The court agreed with the trial court that one of the items listed in &sect; 307 was too vague and uncertain to be valid legislation. However, it did not follow that a use, not one of the 22 expressly permitted, was, because of the uncertainty of item 23, thereby authorized. The court stated that the complaint should have alleged that defendant maintained his bus storage facility in a C3 zone, but this defect was not particularized in the demurrer, and in view of the terms of &sect; 307, no misunderstanding was possible as to the charge made.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">At the times charged in the complaint and for several years prior, defendant was and had been engaged in the business of operating tank trucks and other tank vehicles as a highway common carrier and as a petroleum irregular route carrier.

On appeal, the court held that it was clear that the regulation of the business in which defendant was engaged had been committed to the Public Utilities Commission to the exclusion of all local authorities. The court reversed, determining that the city never possessed the power of statewide regulation of a transportation business whose use of the streets of the city was merely incidental to the carrying on of business which by definition of Los Angeles, Cal., Ordinance 5860, &sect; 710 itself was exclusively nonlocal.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed the judgment and held that the waiver provision in the collective bargaining agreement was invalid not only because it was against public policy, but also because it was contrary to an express provision of the law. The court determined that the language of &sect; 5699 was clear and unambiguous and therefore there was no room for statutory construction.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">The complaint charged all of the offenses identified in &sect; 311(3), even though there was no evidence that defendant had committed the majority of the offenses set forth in &sect; 311(3). The court ruled, however, that there was no legal error to charge all of the offenses within one count. The court also observed that even if an error had been made, defendant failed to make such an objection by demurrer. Moreover, the court noted that defendant was not prejudiced by the form of the complaint because defendant would have been no better off if the complaint had merely charged that he had kept obscene books for sale. The court also ruled that the words &quot;obscene and indecent,&quot; as they were used in &sect; 311, were not unconstitutionally indefinite. Prior decisions had established that the meaning of these words was well understood. Finally, the court rejected the argument that defendant's use of the United States mail to distribute the lewd books did not render the statute inoperative.</SPAN></P>

The court concluded that both subsections of &sect; 24242 were, on their face, sufficiently definite to constitute criminal statutes; that to warrant a conviction under the section proof must have been made that it was a contaminant that was discharged into the atmosphere, and that the contaminant was either of a shade as dark or darker than Ringelmann No. 2, or that it obstructed the vision at least as much as would be smoke that was as dark as Ringelmann No. 2. The court further rejected the contention that &sect; 24242 was unconstitutional because the ordinary person, having no special training, would not have been able to tell whether his smoke was as dark as Ringelmann No. 2. The court reversed the order denying one defendant a new trial, holding that the error in failing to advise the jury that each essential fact had to be proven beyond a reasonable doubt could not have been said to have been without prejudice.

The Municipal Court for the San Diego Judicial District (California) dismissed the case on defendant's motion that asserted &sect; 52.65 conflicted with Cal.

The court held that the City of San Diego Ordinance, &sect; 52.65 was unconstitutional under Cal. Const. XI, &sect;11 because a state statute,&nbsp;Cal. Health &amp; Safety Code &sect; 11721, outlawed the very same activity. The court held that the local ordinance covered the same ground as the penal code and was therefore invalid because it conflicted with the general laws of the state. The court reasoned that if defendant were first tried and convicted or acquitted under the local ordinance, he could not then be tried for the same offense under the state statute. In affirming the dismissal, the court held that its decision did not preclude the state from filing a new complaint under &sect; 11721.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the trial court exceeded its authority in dismissing the action based on its finding that the facts stated did not constitute a public offense; the trial court was only authorized by statute to dismiss the prosecution in the furtherance of justice. Further, the trial court was in error in holding that &sect; 973 was invalid. The statute's intent was to protect workers from misrepresentation, and the terms of the statute were definite and understandable. Thus, &sect; 973 was not unconstitutional for being vague and uncertain, and a new trial was warranted.</SPAN></P>

The court held that because those allegations charged respondent with a crime defined in the act, they stated a public offense. The court found that the amended complaint regarding the Architects' Act failed to state a public offense in the terms of the statute because respondent's activities with respect to a concrete building over one story in height were not ad hoc prohibited, and upon those considerations, the complaint in the engineer's case failed to state a public offense.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">The tenants refused to sign a certificate provided by the housing authority, by which the tenants would have disavowed membership in certain organizations listed as subversive. When the tenants refused to sign the certificate, the housing authority elected to terminate their leases under a clause permitting termination upon 10 days' notice. When the tenants refused to leave, the authority brought an action in unlawful detainer. The trial court granted the housing authority's motion for summary judgment. On appeal, the court reversed the judgment of the trial court. The court noted that membership in the organizations designated by the attorney general as subversive did not, even for the purposes of public employment, determine that the employees were in fact disloyal to the United States. The court held that, once the government elected to provide low-income housing, it could not discriminate among its citizens in granting access to that housing. The court further held that the purpose for the act which created the housing authority was to eradicate slums, not to combat subversive organizations. The goal of combating subversives was not advanced by making such people live in slums.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the responsibility for one's speech was also necessarily implied in the First Amendment guaranties of freedom of speech and of the press. There was no constitutional right to remain anonymous. The manner of exercising the right of free speech could be regulated under the state's police power. Here the regulation provided a means by which one who was defamed could seek redress and also served to insure the effective enforcement of laws against obscenity.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">The accountant, an agent admitted to practice before the Treasury Department, had prepared tax returns for the clients for several years.

The court held that the accountant had engaged in the unauthorized practice of law. In determining that the accountant's actions were the unauthorized practice of law, the court rejected the &quot;incidental test,&quot; which looked to whether the services rendered were incident to accounting work. Instead, the court looked to 31 C.F.R. &sect; 10.2(f), subtit. A, part 10, which granted a nonattorney agent certain privileges before the Treasury Department, but did not authorize persons not members of the bar to practice law.  Cal.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">Defendant contended that Berkeley, Cal., Ordinance 3262-N.S. was unconstitutional as written and as applied. Determining that the trial court had failed to admit all competent evidence on the issue of the unconstitutional application of the ordinance, the court concluded that defendant was entitled to a new trial. The court held that Berkeley, Cal., Ordinance No. 3262-N.S. was constitutional as written because the administration of an ordinance which regulated activities that were mere privileges could be left to the uncontrolled discretion of the licensing authority. Further, even though the city was under no duty to permit the use of tables on its sidewalks, if it had granted that privilege to some, it could not have denied the same privilege to others under similar circumstances merely because its officials disagreed with their views.</SPAN></P>

On appeal of the denial of the parents' motion for a new trial, they argued, inter alia, that &sect; 16601 was unconstitutional in that it deprives parents of the right to determine how and where their children may be educated. The court agreed that if the statute, without qualification or exception, required parents to place their children in public schools, it would indeed be unconstitutional. However, the court determined that the statute recognizes the right of parents not to place their children in public schools if they elect to have them educated in a private school or through the medium of a private tutor or other person possessing certain specified qualifications. The parents' claim that they came within the classification of a &quot;private school&quot; within the meaning of Cal. Educ. Code &sect; 16624 was without merit.

The court directed its attention to the constitutionality of &sect; 1(a) of the ordinance, which related to the requirement that the junkyard business premises be enclosed by a fence. The court noted that a junkyard business was subject to police regulation to prevent unscrupulous persons from disposing of stolen property through such medium. Other provisions of the ordinance described the fire risks involved from gaseous fumes of unused gasoline in tanks and greasy upholstery of secondhand automobiles, which reasonably suggested police regulation by adequate housing or fence or wall enclosure. The court found nothing in &sect; 1(a) violated defendant's constitutional right to conduct his lawful business.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">Defendant had allegedly modified the exhaust system of his car in a manner that increased the noise of the motor over that of the original muffler.

Further, since the jury was discharged with the consent of defendant without rendering a verdict, there was no jeopardy and no acquittal. Hence, jeopardy did not attach at defendant's trial.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">The trial court sustained defendant's demurrer based on a finding that the word &quot;mingle&quot; as used in No. 33.1541.1 was vague, indefinite, and uncertain, thereby rendering the ordinance unconstitutional. On appeal, the court disagreed and reversed. A legislative enactment was inoperative if a definite meaning could not be given to its terms in order to ensure the giving of fair warning in ordinary language as to what conduct would be criminal under given circumstances. Some definite meaning was to given to the words used in order to give them effect, and the legislative intent was to be gathered from the whole act. After construing the word &quot;mingle&quot; in context with other words of the ordinance, the court found that the ordinance clearly sought to prohibit activities of female employees in liquor establishments other than those normally, usually, and properly associated with that occupation and that the language used was adequate, unambiguous, and understandable. Finally, the court held that the extent of the alleged impropriety depended on the facts in each case, such that the question of whether defendant's actions were improper was one for the trier of the fact to determine.</SPAN></P>

It held that the terms did not create an unascertainable standard of guilt. At the time that he was charged with the offense the weather was dry and there was no mud on the road. Defendant was driving a truck with the mud flaps rolled up. He contended that his vehicle was properly equipped and that if it started raining he could comply with the statute by merely rolling his mud flaps down. The court held that the statute required that the mudguards be in place at all times, or if they were not, that there be some kind of mechanism within the cab of the truck by which defendant could lower them.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">Defendant was charged with refusing to leave a race track when requested due to prior ejections from race tracks based on practices inimical to the public interest. Section 337.5 established a misdemeanor if a person refused a request to leave a race track if the person had been ejected from any race track for touting or practices inimical to the public interest. The court on appeal reversed the judgment of conviction, holding that &sect; 337.5 was void as a violation of the due process requirements of the Fourteenth Amendment. Due process required that a penal statute had to provide notice of the conduct criminalized by the statute. The court concluded that the element of the crime identified by the phrase &quot;practices inimical to the public interest&quot; was not an ascertainable standard of guilt. The statute was therefore unconstitutionally vague and indefinite and could not be a viable basis for a conviction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">The People appealed from a judgment from the Justice's Court of San Antonio Township (California) and from the Justice's Court of Belvedere Township (California) sustaining defendants' demurrer to complaints filed against each defendant for failing to register as members of a communist organization, as required by Los Angeles County, Cal. Ordinance 5578.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">Defendants claimed that the ordinance was without void due to constitutional restrictions. The court agreed, concluding that the ordinance violated Cal. Const. art. I, &sect; 13 as compliance with the ordinance amounted to a virtual confession that the registrant violated the Criminal Syndicalism Act, 1919 Stats. p. 281; Gen. Laws tit. 8428 (Deering). As the danger of self-incrimination appeared on the mere reading of the ordinance, the constitutionality of the ordinance was fairly at issue under the attack of a demurrer. The ordinance was not a simple police power regulation requiring the identification of citizens as it compelled a citizen violating the Act to register and the registration provided the clues to establish his guilt. The fact that the registration statements were unavailable for public examination granted no immunity from prosecution. Moreover, the evidence of a registration was admissible despite its compulsory element. The court rejected the Peoples' contention that the ordinance did not violate the rule against self-incrimination on the basis that it required a person to state a fact which might incriminate him under an offense created by another government entity.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">Defendants, corporation, manager, and secretary, sought review of the judgments of the Justice's Court of Compton Township (California) of conviction for violations of Cal. Health and Safety Code &sect; 24242, arising from the discharge of smoke from a place of business.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">Defendants were convicted on charges of violating Cal. Health and Safety Code &sect; 24242. One defendant was a corporation, while the other defendants were the manager and the secretary. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgments of conviction against the corporation and the manager. First, the court held that the statutory mode of determining and stating the density and opacity of smoke by referring to an official publication of the United States Bureau of Mines was a reasonably certain mode, and the statute was not lacking in certainty. Next, the court held that the application of the statute to industrial areas, while exempting agricultural operations, was not an unreasonable classification by the legislature. However, as to the secretary of the corporation, the court held that he was merely a ministerial officer, without authority to transact the business of the corporation upon his independent judgment. Thus, he was not criminally answerable for the act of the corporation, if he was not personally a participant. The judgment against the secretary was reversed. The case was remanded to the municipal court for a new trial as to him.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">The court affirmed the municipal court's judgment of convictions of two defendants, the corporation and its manager, for violation of air pollution control laws, but reversed the judgment of conviction against defendant, the secretary of the corporation, and remanded the case for a new trial as to him.</SPAN></P>

Elec. Code &sect; 5699.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">The 48 employees took two hours time off on November 8, 1948, a general election day, to vote. They successfully claimed their wages for those hours under Cal. Elec. Code &sect; 5699. The employers alleged that the statute was unconstitutional. The court disagreed, affirming the result below with a small modification for employees who did not establish that they went to vote that day. The court found that the statute was a proper exercise of the state's police power. Its means were reasonably necessary to accomplish its important purpose, and it was not unduly oppressive on the employers. Instead, the employers were presumed to have taken the statute into account when it made contracts with the employees.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">Defendant, a chiropractor, appealed his conviction, by a jury, in the Municipal Court of the City of San Diego (California), for his illegal use of the word &quot;physician&quot; on his office window and business cards.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">Defendant, a licensed chiropractor, held himself out to the public by business cards and a sign on his office window as a &quot;chiropractic physician.&quot; He was convicted in a trial by jury of violating &sect; 15 of the Chiropractic Act (Act), which restricted the use of the term &quot;physician&quot; only to practitioners who were authorized to heal with drugs or medicines. The jury had been instructed that if they found that defendant used the word &quot;physician&quot; they had to find him guilty. Defendant appealed, contending that his use of the term &quot;chiropractic physician&quot; was not deceptive of his status as a licensed chiropractor. The court held that defendant, under &sect; 15, was specifically denied the right to employ the word &quot;physician,&quot; because he professed to heal without drugs or medicines. The use of the word &quot;physician&quot; by a practitioner of the healing arts implied a license to practice with drugs, which the chiropractor did not have. The distinction made by the Act between practitioners who used drugs and those who did not was a reasonable classification. Therefore, there was no error in the instruction given the jury at the trial.</SPAN></P>
