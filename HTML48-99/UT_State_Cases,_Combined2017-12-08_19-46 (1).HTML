</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that the trial court should have dismissed this action on the ground it lacked jurisdiction to render an advisory opinion. The allegations concerning the unconstitutionality of the Act were all pleaded in the abstract. There were no concrete facts pleaded indicating any specific injury sustained or threatened to the individual personally. There were no allegations that he had sustained a particularized injury that set him apart from the public generally and would give him standing to challenge the constitutionality of the Act. While statutes authorizing courts to render declaratory relief were to be liberally construed, a court must, nevertheless, operate within the constitutional and statutory powers and duties imposed upon it. To maintain an action for declaratory relief, a plaintiff must show that the justiciable and jurisdictional elements requisite in ordinary actions were present, for a judgment could be rendered only in a real controversy between adverse parties. The individual in this case failed to meet these conditions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the guilty verdict was issued, defendants each waived the jury for the penalty phase. The trial court then sentenced each defendant to death by shooting. Under &sect; 76-3-207, Utah Criminal Code, when a defendant has been found guilty of a capital felony, a penalty proceeding was to be conducted before a jury, unless the defendant chose to waive the hearing before a jury. In addition, the court found that pursuant to &sect; 76-3-207, Utah Criminal Code, in the penalty phase, evidence could have been presented that the court deemed relevant to the sentence, including but not limited to aggravating and mitigating circumstances. The court determined that the trial court properly weighed the aggravating and mitigating circumstances offered at the penalty phase. Specifically, the court held that it was relevant for the trial court to consider the ruthlessness and brutality of the murder when imposing the sentence. Because the evidence established that defendants voluntarily waived the jury penalty hearing, the court held that the trial court properly imposed the death sentence after considering the aggravating and mitigating circumstances involved in the crime.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In two consolidated cases, plaintiff applicants sought review of a decision of defendant Industrial Commission of Utah, which found that the applicants had violated U.C.A. 1953, 35-4-5-(e), by knowingly failing to report work and earnings during times they claimed to be unemployed and without earnings. Pursuant to the Act, the Commission assessed a 52-week disqualification period against them and required the repayment of benefits paid to them.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The applicants argued the Commission's findings of fraud were not supported by substantial evidence. They also argued that the Act was unconstitutional because they were subjected to a &quot;dual&quot; penalty based on the 52-week disqualification period and the requirement that they repay funds they received during that period. On appeal, the court held that the applicants' intention to defraud was shown by the claims themselves, which contained false statements and failed to set forth material facts required by the Act. The filing of such claims evidenced a purpose to present false claims to obtain unlawful benefits, therefore, they were manifestations of intent to defraud. The fact that the Act worked a hardship in some circumstances did not render it unconstitutional. The Act's purposes in protecting the public welfare by providing benefits during unemployment and deterring violations thereof, were reasonable, and the provisions requiring repayment of funds received due to fraud had a substantial relation to those purposes. It was reasonable to require those who received unlawful benefits to repay them and not to require such an obligation of persons who received no unlawful benefits.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the Commission's decision and awarded no costs.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from his conviction, after a jury trial was held in the District Court for Salt Lake County (Utah), for aggravated robbery, under Utah Code Ann. 1953, &sect; 76-6-302, as amended in 1975.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A store employee testified that a man ordered him to place the store's money in a paper bag. He stated that the man told him that if he did not do as he was told, he would get &quot;blasted.&quot; The employee identified defendant as the robber. The employee also testified that part of a gun barrel was protruding from underneath defendant's shirt during the robbery. He admitted that the object which he saw had no sight on it but that during the robbery, he was sure the object was a gun. The district court instructed the jury that a facsimile was an exact copy of anything and that a facsimile of a firearm was any instrument that by its appearance resembled a firearm. On appeal, the court rejected defendant's claim that the district court's instructions made the phrase &quot;facsimile of a firearm&quot; so vague as to make &sect; 76-6-302&nbsp;unconstitutional as applied. Under &sect; 76-6-302, a person committed aggravated robbery if he used a firearm or a facsimile of a firearm. The district court's definition of a &quot;facsimile of a firearm&quot; was a sensible interpretation of the statutory language that was sufficiently clear and definite to inform defendant what constituted the offense with which he was charged.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A companion criminal was found guilty and also sentenced to death. The testimony of an eyewitness was to the following effect. There was some type of discussion of forcing Drano into three victims. Defendant was nervous and upset and asked why the companion had fired his gun and said that he could not do it. Defendant told a hostage that there was a gun to his head after the companion told the hostage to use the Drano. The court ruled that based on the overwhelming evidence the jury properly found reasonably and without arbitrariness in favor of imposition of the death penalty. The court found no disproportionality. The court took into consideration defendant's background and characteristics and defendant's deep complicity in the murders and that his actions were bold and gross. The court ruled further that the death-penalty statutes,&nbsp;Utah Code Annotated, 1953, &sect;&sect; 76-3-206, 76-3-207, as enacted in 1973, were not unconstitutional. The court also found that defendant did not show any actual bias by any juror from publicity of an improper nature and that he did not show that the publicity was per se prejudicial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of three counts of first-degree murder and two counts of aggravated robbery. The District Court of Davis County (Utah) sentenced defendant to death for the murder charges. Defendant appealed, claiming that Utah Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 76-3-206 and 76-3-207, which provided for the death penalty, did not conform to constitutional requirements.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant claimed that Utah's death penalty statutes were unconstitutional because they did not provide for automatic judicial review at the time of defendant's sentence. The court disagreed and held that the statutes were constitutional. The court found that Utah Const. art. I, &sect; 12 and Utah Code Ann. &sect; 77-1-8 (1953) extended to defendant the right of appeal in all cases and, when an appeal was taken, as in this matter, &sect; 76-3-207(3) provided for a comprehensive review of the entire case, including a review of a sentence of death to determine if that sentence resulted from prejudice or arbitrary action or was disproportionate to the penalty. The absence of an automatic and mandatory review of death cases and penalties in the Utah statutes at the time defendant was charged, tried, sentenced, and appealed did not provide a ripened basis for a claim of prejudicial error. Because of his right to appeal, which he exercised, all procedures of review were afforded to him that he would have had under a statute compelling automatic review. The court further held that the state was not required to prove the absence of mitigating factors beyond a reasonable doubt in the sentencing phase.</SPAN></P>

Defendant had been charged with altering a forged prescription for a Schedule II controlled substance, Demerol, in violation of Utah Code Ann. &sect; 58-37-8(4)D(a)(iii) (1972). The trial court ruled that the Controlled Substances Act (Act) unconstitutionally delegated legislative power to the attorney general.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Demerol was not listed as a Schedule II controlled substance in Utah Code Ann. &sect; 58-37-4(3)(b). It was subsequently added to the Schedule II by the state attorney general under Utah Code Ann. &sect; 58-37-3(2), which gave the attorney general power to administer the provision of the Act and to add or delete Schedule II substances. After she was indicted, defendant successfully filed a motion to quash, asserting that the legislature had unconstitutionally delegated its authority when it empowered the attorney general to criminalize Demerol by placing it on the Schedule II list. The state sought further review. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that Utah Const. art. V, &sect; I prohibited the delegation of power among the three branches of government. It noted that it was the legislature's function to determine the elements of crimes and their appropriate punishments and held that this function could not be delegated to the attorney general, who was a member of the executive department under Utah Const. art. VII, &sect; I. The court held that the Act conflicted with Utah Crim. Code &sect; 76-1-105 (1974), which limited crimes to those found in the criminal code or other statutes.</SPAN></P>

He made the petition after he was convicted of first-degree murder and was sentenced to life in prison. His sentence was imposed under U.C.A. 1953, &sect; 76-30-4 (Utah). An issue was the effect of federal case law on the penalty statute, &sect; 76-30-4, which also dealt with imposition of the death penalty.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The jury recommended leniency regarding the sentencing. The court assumed, arguendo, that the death penalty under U.C.A. 1953, &sect; 76-30-4, was unconstitutional per the ruling of the U.S. Supreme Court on which the applicant relied, but he did not have standing to challenge &sect; 76-30-4 on that basis because his sentence was life imprisonment. Before one could attack the constitutionality of a statute, one had to be affected adversely by that statute. Thus, per the court, the applicant's contention that the invalidation of &sect; 76-30-4 left the State without a penalty for murder was to him unavailing. Also the court cited a previous opinion by it to the effect that the federal decision at issue did not necessarily invalidate &sect; 76-30-4 in toto or in part. It had been determined that &sect; 76-30-4 was not separable. In that previous opinion, the court refused to declare &sect; 76-30-4 unconstitutional. According to the court in that previous opinion, it was the imposition and carrying out of the death penalty in certain cases that amounted to cruel and unusual punishment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Two of the debtors were a married couple. The creditor had obtained a judgment against the husband. When the couple sold real property three years after the creditor's judgment, the creditor executed on the proceeds of that sale. The wife asserted her right to 50 percent of the proceeds as joint tenant and also claimed one-third of the rest of the proceeds by virtue of her inchoate interest granted in lieu of dower by the provisions of Utah Code Annotated, 1953, &sect; 74-4-3. The creditor only challenged the wife's claim to her interest in the proceeds. The creditor argued that &sect; 74-4-3 was unconstitutional on the ground that it constituted a statutory discrimination based on sex. On appeal, the court held that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment to the debtors. The wife could not claim her &quot;wife's interest&quot; because it did not vest until the death of her husband. Further, the wife had relinquished her interest by joining with her husband in the conveyance of the real property. Accordingly, the wife could not in any event claim the proceeds from the sale, but her share had to be apportioned out of the real property itself.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The guardian ad litem appealed from a summary judgment in favor of a school district and others in a negligence action following injury to the minor's finger. On review, the guardian contended that the differing notice requirements of Utah Code Ann. tit. 63, ch. 30, &sect; 12, 13 (1953) created discrimination constituting an unconstitutional denial of due process, the lower court's action in hearing the motion as one for summary judgment was contrary to Utah R. Civ. P. 12 (b) and 56 (b), (c), and that the minor plaintiff, being only 12 years of age, should not have been barred from bringing the action. The court noted that the general legislative intent to protect the causes of minors was abundantly clear by amendment and the specific provisions of the general statute of limitations. Accordingly, notwithstanding the prior pronouncements of the court, the court held that a minor claimant was justly entitled to the protection afforded by Utah Code Ann. &sect; 78-12-36(1) (1953) in all cases, including notice requirements of the type contained in the Utah Governmental Immunity Act.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The business owner instituted an action against the Department for a declaratory judgment that he was not engaged in the practice of dentistry when he furnished dentures to patients or, in the alternative, that &sect; 58-7-6, U.C.A. 1953, was unconstitutional. The Department brought a counterclaim in which it sought to have the business owner enjoined from practicing dentistry without a license. The trial court concluded that the business owner was engaged in the practice of dentistry, and it rejected his contention that the statute was unconstitutional. The business owner appealed the trial court's order. The court found that the trial court correctly ruled that the business owner's activities fell within the scope of &sect; 58-7-6. The court determined that, regardless of how beneficial the services of the business owner were, the care of the teeth and the mouth was subject to regulation in the interest of the public health and welfare. The court further determined that, because it was not within the province of the courts to intrude upon the legislative prerogative to define the practice of dentistry, it could not declare the statute unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

The trial court determined that the act discriminated against financially sound insurers in a manner unrelated to the act's objectives in denial of equal protection rights, and that it discriminated against such insurers in depriving them of property without substantive due process. Defendant appealed. In reversing the trial court's order, the appellate court determined that the legislative purpose was to assist in detecting and preventing insurer insolvencies, and that the authorization to exempt assessments, where a member's capital would be impaired, fulfilled this purpose. Further, although plaintiff's business may have been less prosperous as a result of the regulation, this diminution in value did not amount to an unconstitutional &quot;taking.&quot;</SPAN></P>

The United States Supreme Court reversed, holding that the former Utah statute provided that the period of minority extended in males to the age of 21 years and in females to 18 years and that it was, therefore, unconstitutional and discriminatory.

The district court determined that for the purpose of child support, children attained their majority at age 21, and it entered judgment for unpaid child support.

The Act required all unresolved issues to be submitted to arbitration. The determination of the arbitration panel was to be final and binding on all matters in dispute.

The court concluded that appellant's allegation that all of the elements of the offense were not proved was without merit because the state proved the two elements of the offense and because venue was not an element of the offense and did not need to be demonstrated beyond a reasonable doubt. The court held that the trial court's admission of evidence of prior crimes for which appellant had not been convicted as proper because the evidence was not admitted to impeach appellant's testimony, but rather to establish a common plan or scheme and to show a motive for the jury to assess the honesty of appellant's testimony as to his believe that the money belonged to him.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff motorist brought an action against third-party plaintiff driver to recover for injuries suffered in a car collision. The driver appealed from a Utah trial court's summary judgment dismissing his amended third-party negligence complaint against third-party defendant, the State of Utah, Department of Highways, on the ground that the driver did not comply with the notice of claim requirements of &sect; 63-30-12, Utah Code Annotated (1953).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The driver filed a notice of claim against the State 20 months after the collision for contribution proportionate to its negligence in failing to place warning signs on the highway before conical signs blocked a lane of traffic. He filed his complaint against the State, which he amended after filing a notice of claim. The court held that the grant of a summary judgment was proper. Highway maintenance was not a proprietary function but a governmental one. It did not fall outside the scope of the Utah Governmental Immunity Act, Chapter 30, Title 63, Utah Code Ann. (1953) and its notice of claim requirements of &sect; 63-30-12, Utah Code Annotated (1953). Those requirements did not violate equal protection guarantees as there were rational bases for the classifications of government and private tortfeasors. A notice of claim provided governmental units with an opportunity to investigate and remedy any defect before additional injury was caused, it helped avoid unnecessary litigation, and it minimized difficulties arising from changes in administrations. Though the State was at the scene of the collision, the driver was not relieved from fully complying with the notice requirements.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant state officials challenged a judgment of the Third Judicial District Court (Utah), which found in favor of respondent agency in the agency's action seeking a declaration that the Utah Housing Finance Agency Act, 63-44a-1, U.C.A. 1953 (1975 Pocket Supp.), was constitutional and seeking a writ of mandamus compelling the officials to release funds authorized for the agency's use.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Act was passed and created the agency to deal with an inadequate supply of safe, sanitary housing for those of low and moderate income by increasing the availability of mortgage funds for such housing. The Act permitted the agency to obtain funds by selling tax exempt notes and bonds. The officials refused to release funds that the legislature authorized for the agency, claiming that the Act was unconstitutional. On review, the court affirmed the judgment in favor of the agency. In reaching its conclusion, the court held that the issue of the shortage of safe and sanitary housing for those of low and moderate income fell within the state's police power. Additionally, the court held that increasing the availability of financing for such housing served a valid public purpose. The court then held that the general scheme by which such financing would be obtained, through the sale of tax exempt notes and bonds, was constitutionally permissible. The court held that the fact that the plan would confer a private benefit, was merely incidental and did not render the Act unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owners bought a lot of land in a subdivision. The lot was in a cul-de-sac, which had access to a graveled road.

They filed the instant action for damages, for restoration of their access, and for removal of equipment sheds placed on the land by the State. The trial court granted summary judgment to the State on the ground that it was immune from suit. The court affirmed, holding that the property owners had failed to file a claim as required by Title 63-30-12, U.C.A. 1953, which barred claims under the Governmental Immunity Act, Title 63-30, Utah Code Annotated 1953, as amended, unless written notice of such claim was filed with the state attorney general and the appropriate state agency within one year after cause of action arose. The court found that the roadway in front of the access was completed two years before the property owners filed suit and thus, their claim against the State was barred.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Industrial Commission reduced an award of workmen's compensation benefits to a widow after she remarried. The widow argued, that Title 35-1-73, Utah Code Annotated 1953, which allowed for the reduction, was discriminatory because it created a disincentive for remarriage. The court affirmed the Commission's order, rejecting the widow's argument that the statute was discriminatory because the same result would not have occurred in the case of a minor daughter marrying. The court found that the difference in the classifications, either a widow remarrying or a minor daughter marrying, were obvious. In the event of remarriage of the widow, at least part of the burden of supporting her was shifted to her new husband. The court found that the urged discrimination was not only reasonable and uniform as to classification but also was free from constitutional objection or restraint. The minor child was in another class whose members, during minority, may be legal dependents, and where marriage, during such period, is not available save by the consent of parents.</SPAN></P>

The affidavit for attachment properly alleged that the bank was entitled to possess the property, that the debtors wrongfully detained detention of the property, the value of the property, and that the sheriff's sale brought in less than the property's value. However, even assuming that a technical deficiency existed, the court held that any error was harmless because the bank had a security interest in the property under Utah Code Ann. &sect; 70A-9-503 and was entitled to possession, and if there had been no possession before judgment, the court would have ordered the property sold.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The county had filed a motion to dismiss the complaint on the ground that the motorist had failed to file a notice of her claim within 90 days.

The motorist claimed that the county was negligent in designing the bridge so that it created an unreasonable hazard for motorists using the street. The period during which notice had to be given was one year for the state, 90 days for a county, and six months for a city or town. The trial court was of the opinion that the differences between state, counties, and cities were not such as to require different time periods for filing notices of claims. It further found that the differences had the effect of denying to the motorist equal protection of the laws. In reversing the decision, the court found that &sect; 63-30-13, U.C.A. 1953, should not be stricken down merely because the legislature adopted three periods during which notices of claims had to be filed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A clerk of a coin shop was robbed of gold and silver coins. Defendant was not identified as one of the robbers but was arrested when he attempted to sell a satchel of coins consisting of the coins from the robbery.

Defendant claimed on appeal that the portion of &sect; 76-6-408, U.C.A. 1953 (Utah), as amended, under which he was convicted, was so vague as to render it unconstitutional. The statute provided that a person committed theft if he received, retained, or disposed of the property of another knowing that it had been stolen, or believing that it probably had been stolen. The latter portion of the statute was subject to the constitutional challenge for vagueness. Affirming, the court noted that it did no commend the drafters of the legislation for their choice of language but, on the whole, it was undoubtedly sufficient to inform those who would obey the law as to what conduct was expected. The trial court instructed the jury as to the elements of the crime and the State's burden of proof, and the jury's verdict was amply supported by the evidence.</SPAN></P>

The trial court awarded the requested child support to the mother. The court reversed, determining that &sect; 15-2-1, U.C.A. 1953, which held that girls attained their majority at age 18, was constitutional. Because neither the girl nor the parties' son challenged the constitutionality of &sect; 15-2-1, which held different ages of majority for males and females, the court did not reach the issue.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city filed suit against the county in order to obtain an extraordinary writ to compel the county to comply with Section 17-34-1, et seq., Utah Code Annotated 1953.Section 17-34-1, et seq. Which sought to remedy double taxation which resulted when city residents were required to finance services provided to residents of unincorporated areas of the county. The trial court dismissed the suit but the court reversed and ordered that the county had to be enjoined to stop the practice. The court found no merit in the county's claim that the statute was unconstitutional because it was too vague. The court found that the use of the words &quot;counties of the first and second class' were defined by Section 17-16-13, Utah Code Annotated 1953. The definitions were used historically to define classes for purposes of compensation of county officers and the court found the definitions were clearly intended to be used when interpreting Section 17-34-1, et seq., Utah Code Annotated 1953.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant justices of the peace challenged a writ issued by a district court (Utah), which prohibited them from proceeding in the respective drunk driving cases in which plaintiff drivers had been arraigned. The district court decided that, because the justices of the peace were not members of the Utah Bar, to permit them to preside over the drivers' cases, where possible jail sentences were involved, amounted to a denial of due process of law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The drivers argued that the court should declare that the constitutionally created justices of the peace, who were not required to be lawyers, could not deal with cases wherein jail sentences might have been imposed, or that they could not impose jail sentences in such cases. Recalling the writ, the court ruled that it was vital to the proper functioning of Utah's government to follow procedures for the change of law by the legislature or of the constitution by the amendment process. After discussing the separation of powers, the court stated that the duties and prerogatives of each department were to be scrupulously respected by the others. The court refused to find that the portion of the Utah Constitution which vested the challenged power in justices of the peace was unconstitutional. Due to intervening legislation, the drivers were entitled to have their respective cases handled by a judge who was a member of the state bar, if they wished.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The evidence showed that defendant knew that the property in question was stolen. Defendant contended that the evidence was insufficient to justify beyond a reasonable doubt that she knew the property was stolen and &sect; 76-6-408(2), which allowed a presumption relating to knowledge that property was stolen, was unconstitutional. Affirming, the court held that there was ample evidence that justified the trial court's finding of defendant's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. The court determined that any errors committed by the trial court were harmless and not prejudicial. The court found that the presumption allowed by &sect; 76-6-408(2) did not relieve the State (Utah) from proving any element of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt. The court determined that the part of the statute &quot;knowing it to have been stolen&quot; did not include any innocent or unaware possession of stolen property. The court concluded that the statute did not deprive defendant of due process of law because &sect; 76-1-503, U.C.A. 1953 (Utah) expressly provided that any presumed fact was still a question of fact to be submitted to the trier of fact and it still had to be proved beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>

At the time of his arrest, the prisoner was on probation because of a prior conviction for a misdemeanor. The prisoner was denied bail, because the trial court interpreted Article 1, Section 8, Constitution of Utah, to mean that under these circumstances bail could not be granted. The court noted that because the right to bail was a fundamental right, the State was required to sustain the burden of proving that an accused was within one of the exceptions to the right to bail. The prisoner contended Article 1, Section 8 of the Utah Constitution granted a fundamental right to bail unless one was accused of the commission of a felony while on probation or parole because of a previous felony charge. The State contended that anyone arrested for another offense while on probation for a first offense could not be granted bail. The court concluded, in its reversal, that the exception contained in Article 1, Section 8, Constitution of Utah applied only where a person was accused of the commission of a felony while on probation or parole, because of a previous felony conviction.

On appeal, the court affirmed defendant's conviction for first degree murder. 76-5-202(1)(b), U.C.A. 1953 (1975) (Utah) provided that where two victims were killed at approximately the same time in one affray, the killings amounted to murder in the first degree. The court rejected defendant's claim that double jeopardy barred convictions on two counts of first degree murder when only two people were killed. The court noted that jeopardy attached only after a jury was sworn, and the plea could be raised only in a second trial. The court also ruled that it was not error for the trial court to allow a psychiatrist who had examined defendant to testify concerning his mental state when defendant claimed that he was insane and later attempted to withdraw the plea. The trial court properly instructed the jury on intoxication. The jury had guidelines in determining what verdict they should render. They apparently believed that defendant shot the couple without any reason for doing it and that while he might have been under the influence of drugs, he did know what he was doing when he fired the shots.</SPAN></P>

An omnibus clause of the city's revised ordinances provided for a fine, sentence, or both, when no other penalty was otherwise proscribed. Utah's new criminal code, effective July 1, 1973, provided no jail sentence for trespass, which was newly classified as an infraction. The court affirmed. The city could not impose a greater sentence than that provided by state law. The former state criminal code only provided for felonies and misdemeanors. The new code created a third class of offences known as &quot;infractions.&quot; The city's reliance on former legislation that allowed it to pass ordinances to punish trespassers with fines under $ 300 and imprisonment not to exceed six months were correlated with the former offense classifications. The new code controlled over any general provision of the former code, which also prohibited cities from passing ordinances that were repugnant to state law. Here, the city's old penalty provisions were repugnant to the new law. If a city ordinance penalty conflicted with state law covering the same subject, the ordinance penalty was void.</SPAN></P>

The court determined that the process established by the Utah Air Conservation Act and under the Committee's Code of Air Conservation Regulations was sufficient specific to satisfy due process requirements. The court further determined that the evidence showed that the standards contained in the Code were followed by the inspectors and that the State had proven the manufacturer had violated the standards imposed by the Code.

His defense was predicated on the ground that the ordinance was unconstitutional in that it denied him equal protection of the law, in violation of U.S. Const. amend. XIV. The state supreme court affirmed the lower court's decision, holding that the county taxation scheme was not unconstitutionally arbitrary because there was a reasonable distinction between the class upon which defendant's fee was collected and other classes subjected to a different taxation scheme. Thus, defendant, as a small businessman, was not discriminated against.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged his conviction from the district court (Utah) for loitering after first being convicted in the city court. The issue was the validity of the ordinance under which he was charged. The principal claim made was that the ordinance was too vague to give a person of ordinary intelligence fair notice that his contemplated conduct was forbidden and that it placed unfettered discretion in the hands of the police and the prosecutor.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Police saw defendant driving in and out of a motel parking lot several times in the middle of the night. Within the past week many motel rooms had been broken into with channel lock pliers. Police found defendant's car near the motel's rear door and discovered him prowling the second floor hallway wearing gloves. Channel lock pliers were on the floor of his car. The court disagreed that the ordinance gave police or prosecutors unusual authority. The court pointed out that the circumstances had to be considered in deciding whether conduct did or did not justify suspicion that defendant was engaged in or about to engage in crime. The ordinance gave defendant an opportunity to show lawful purpose and justification for suspicious conduct, and it gave sufficient notice that loitering would cause a reasonable person to suspect criminality. The ordinance was not an ordinary loitering ordinance, which made it a crime to loiter without visible means of support, but it enabled police to prevent crime when it was reasonably certain that crime was imminent. The court concluded that loitering was clearly and unambiguously defined in the ordinance and that the ordinance was valid.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the district court's judgment and sentence. No costs were awarded.</SPAN></P>

The statutes was to be given the presumption of constitutionality and would not be declared unconstitutional for vagueness unless it appeared beyond a reasonable doubt that it was so unclear and unfair that it would have been an imposition upon law abiding citizens. The court found that the statute was sufficiently specific and meaningful to meet the requirement that persons with an ordinary sense of decency and morality, desiring to know what the law is and abide by it, would have no difficulty in understanding what transgresses those requirements.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Individuals contended that the Utah Neighborhood Development Act (Act), Utah Code Ann. 11-19-1 et seq., was unconstitutional. Appellee redevelopment agency was created pursuant to the Act. The court held that the agency was a quasi-municipal corporation and as such it was within the discretion of the legislature to grant it any powers not expressly prohibited by the constitution, including the power of taxation. The plan of redevelopment included the construction and operation of a parking facility, which was financed by a tax allocation and parking revenue bonds. Individuals contended that issuance of the bonds would be the lending of credit in violation of constitutional provisions. However, the proposed bond form only permitted the bondholders to look to the revenues from the facility and allocated taxes for the retirement of the bond obligation. There was no city debt created, nor was there lending of the city's credit. The court acknowledged that the funds would grant at least some private benefit, the funds were being used by a public body for a public purpose, and any private benefit was merely incidental.</SPAN></P>

The ordinance was within the county's police power because among the factors that could be considered in the general welfare were the taking of reasonable measures to minimize discordant, unsightly, and offensive surroundings and to preserve the beauty as well as the usefulness of the environment.

The court reasoned that if a man were unable to work because he was pregnant, the statute would apply equally to him. The court stated that the woman should have sought the repeal the biological law of nature so that men shared equally with women in bearing children. The court pointed out that there was nothing in the state constitution that guaranteed unemployment compensation to any person and that the denial of benefits to a pregnant woman for not working during her pregnancy did not violate any constitutional requirement.</SPAN></P>

The court further held that the first-degree murder charge had been dismissed against defendant and was not tried and thus, if his appeal was granted on the grounds he urged, then he would be subjecting himself to not only a jury trial, but to a first-degree murder trial, a gamble with much higher stakes involved.</SPAN></P>

The trial court held that &sect; 41-6-44.2 was unconstitutional because of vagueness and because it failed to require either a specific intent or an act that implied intent to violate the statute. The court reversed the trial court's judgment. The court found that the statute stated with sufficient clarity and conciseness the two elements necessary to constitute its violation. The court saw no reason why a person of ordinary intelligence would have any difficulty in understanding that if he had drunk anything containing alcohol, and particularly any substantial amount thereof, he should not attempt to drive or take control of a motor vehicle. The court found that the arrestee was not in a position to complain in the abstract that the statute was unconstitutional just because it might unjustly hurt someone else.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At the time of sentencing, &sect; 76-30-4, U.C.A. 1953 provided that every person guilty of murder in the first degree could suffer death, or, upon the recommendation of the jury, life imprisonment, in the discretion of the court. The court held that &sect; 76-30-4 was not separable, and, despite the confusion created by the United States Supreme Court's Furman decision, refused to declare the statute, or the death penalty portion thereof, unconstitutional. The court held that it was the duty of the courts of the State to proceed in all aspects in accordance with the laws of the State and to arrive at the verdict and to impose the judgment and sentence which were in conformity with the law and justice thereunder. Based on Furman, the court noted that there was the possibility that such judgment would not be carried out. However, the court held that this was the responsibility of the federal courts and not of the courts of the State. Therefore, the action required remand to allow the jury to determine whether to recommend life imprisonment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The driver was a Kansas resident that had travelled to Utah for the sole purpose of visiting a national park. The trial court set aside the forfeiture on the basis that the forfeiture statute, title 58-37-13(1)(e), Utah Code Annotated 1953, was invalid or inapplicable under the facts. On the state's appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's decision, finding that the statute as applied to the facts of the case led to an unusually harsh result by imposing an additional fine or penalty in connection with the misdemeanor possession offense. The court ruled that the statute was designed to deter transportation of a controlled substance and that the driver's possession of one ounce of marijuana was for personal consumption only and did not amount to transportation of a drug as contemplated by the statute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The cosmetologist was licensed to cut hair, but &sect; 58-11-12(2)(c) provided that she was only permitted to cut the hair of women or girls, even though licensed barbers were permitted to cut the hair of both males and females. The cosmetologist's license was temporarily revoked upon a complaint that she had cut the hair of a male patron, but the revocation was overturned on judicial review. On appeal, the court ruled that &sect; 58-11-12(2)(c) violated equal protection and due process guarantees. The classification set out in the section was without any reasonable basis and, therefore, arbitrary. Moreover, the restriction unreasonably limited the cosmetologist in her due process right to pursue a lawful occupation, and it did not bear any real or substantial relation to any legitimate objective under the police power.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, the Utah Department of Business Regulation, sought review of the judgment of a trial court (Utah). The trial court entered judgment in favor of respondents railroad company and apprentice plumber in their action to force the Department to award the plumber a journeyman plumber's license. In so ruling, the trial court declared &sect; 58-18-2(a), U.C.A. 1953 (Replacement Volume 6A), unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The railroad company already had one licensed journeyman plumber in its employ and had hired the apprentice plumber. The apprentice and the company sought to obtain a journeyman's license for the apprentice, but the Department denied the license on the ground that the apprentice was not enrolled in an approved apprentice program. The company and the apprentice appealed the decision. The trial court reversed the Department's decision, holding that &sect; 58-18-2(a), U.C.A. 1953 (Replacement Volume 6A), the statute requiring apprentice plumbers to serve under a journeyman to get a journeyman's license, was unconstitutional. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment, but on other grounds. The court first noted that a law should be held to violate the constitution only when necessary to do so in granting a constitutional right to an aggrieved party. Here, it was sufficient for the court to hold that the Department's action was arbitrary, capricious, and without foundation in fact or law.</SPAN></P>

The court held that (1) &sect; 55-10-86 and &sect; 55-10-63 (Utah) created a specific statutory standard within which juvenile courts had to exercise their discretion; (2) the factual considerations and weight to be accorded to them were matters left to the sound discretion of the juvenile courts; (3) while the many factors to be taken into account could not be specifically identified, &sect; 55-10-86, U.C.A. 1953, as amended 1971, (Utah), was not unconstitutional for vagueness; and (4) the juvenile court's oral decision preceding its formal certification order specifically set forth the reasons for the decision, which were sufficient to show that the statutory requirement of a full investigation had been met.</SPAN></P>

I, &sect; 24.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The passengers were injured in separate accidents when they were guests in vehicles. In their negligence actions, the trial courts ruled for the drivers. The passengers' appeals were consolidated in the court because in each case the passenger challenged the constitutionality of &sect; 41-9-1. The court affirmed the judgments below, ruling that the statute was constitutional. The Equal Protection Clause did not compel a state to attack every aspect of a problem or to refrain from any action at all. It was sufficient that the state's action was rationally based and free from invidious discrimination. The court found a rational basis for the statute, and ruled that its classification of an automobile guest did not single out one group for treatment different from that accorded other guests. Utah preserved the distinction between invitees or business visitors and licensees or social guests as well as the distinction between a paying passenger and an automobile guest. Thus, automobile guests were not isolated from all other guests or recipients of generosity and alone denied a duty of care by drivers. The court ruled that it was for the legislature to change the statute's effects.</SPAN></P>

The court also held that the magistrate who issued defendant's warrant could have reasonably inferred from the facts in the officer's affidavit that the marijuana could have been easily destroyed.

The divorce decree required the father to pay child support. He ceased paying for the daughter when she reached the age of 18.

She claimed that &sect; 15-2-1, U.C.A.1953 (Utah), which provided that the period of minority extended in males to the age of 21 and in females to the age of 18, was unconstitutional. The district court denied her petition. The court affirmed, holding that there was no basis upon which it would be justified in concluding that the statute was so beyond a reasonable doubt in conflict with constitutional provisions that it had to be struck down as invalid. There were various factors that had to be considered in formulating the policy of the law as to when the duty to support children would terminate. The opposing contentions with respect to the merits of the mother's proposal were matters upon which reasonable minds could entertain different opinions.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The county and the city constructed and established a hospital by the use of public tax moneys. The hospital then was leased for a nominal sum per year to a nonprofit corporation owned and controlled by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints.

Plaintiff sought a judgment declaring the authorization and issuance of city and county bonds unconstitutional and void. On appeal, the court held that the construction, lease, and operation of the hospital did not violate the establishment clauses of the United States and Utah Constitutions. Specifically, the court reasoned that the plan adopted by the city and the county to establish a hospital and to provide medical care for the inhabitants of the area carefully avoided excessive religious entanglements. However, &sect; 12 of the lease plainly was unconstitutional and in violation of the establishment clauses because it contemplated a gift of a hospital that was constructed and established by the use of public tax moneys.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The contractors sued defendants to enjoin the enforcement of a regulation that required the installation of a certain type of back-flow prevention device in sprinkler systems, arguing that it was so burdensome, expensive, and unnecessary in comparison to any possible benefit that it was an arbitrary and unreasonable infringement on the right to use property, and therefore a deprivation of property without due process of law. The trial court ruled against the contractor, and it appealed. The court found that the evidence in the case demonstrated the soundness and persuasiveness of the contractor's contention that the extraordinary trouble and expense imposed by the regulation was entirely beyond reason compared to the extremely rare possibility of harm that it was intended to guard against. Whatever danger existed could be greatly minimized by simpler and less expensive precautions. The court concluded that the regulation was arbitrary and unreasonable.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was accused of murder in the first degree. Preceding the trial, the district court ruled that, in light of a recent decision of the United States Supreme Court outlawing the death penalty, the proceeding was no longer a capital case, and defendant was only entitled to an 8-man jury. Defendant was convicted, and he appealed, arguing that he was improperly denied a 12-man jury, as guaranteed by Article I, &sect; 10, Constitution of Utah. The court noted that the precise holding in the Supreme Court decision was that the imposition and carrying out of the death penalty in the cases before the Court constituted cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments. The court observed that, because the Utah Constitution provided a system of classifying certain serious offenses as capital cases and then mandated a specific procedural structure for the administration of justice based on that classification, the decision at issue could not be rationally construed as abrogating Utah's fundamental law. The court concluded that defendant was entitled to a 12-man jury, so the district court committed prejudicial error when it denied him that right.</SPAN></P>

The inmate filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus, alleging that he should have been granted credit for the time he spent incarcerated in jails in Texas and Nevada while he was resisting extradition. The trial court denied the petition. The court affirmed, determining that the Board of Pardons properly followed &sect; 76-1-34, U.C.A. 1953 when it refused to allow any time for jail service in any other states. The court held that &sect; 76-1-34 was constitutional and fair.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">It was plaintiff's contention in the proceedings that the Higher Education Act of 1969, Chapter 48, Title 53, U.C.A.1953, was in violation of the provisions of Utah Const. art.

The purpose of the Act was to vest in a single board the power to govern the state system of higher education and within the board's discretion to delegate certain powers to institutional councils. A section of the Act had previously been struck down in another case, but such section was severable from the remaining portions of the Act. On appeal, the court reversed. In view of the long interpretation of Utah Const. art. X, &sect;&sect; 2 and 8 by the legislature, with the acquiescence of the people, as well as the State Board of Education, and the administrators of the institutions of higher learning, the court was of the opinion that Chapter 48, Title 53, U.C.A.1953, except that section before the court in the prior case, was valid.</SPAN></P>

Among other things, plaintiff claimed that under &sect; 10-8-38, U.C.A., 1953 (Utah), only a monthly sewer service fee could be charged. The court held that (1) in prior cases, it was found that sewer charges and connection fees were not revenue measures, taxes, or assessments but payments for services furnished; (2) defendant could exact a reasonable charge for the right to connect to and use the sewer system; (3) the properties actually using the sewer system should alone pay the cost of operation and maintenance, but all properties where service was available should pay for the construction and installation expense; and (4) installation and construction costs, although initially financed by actual users, should ultimately be borne by all benefited properties including unimproved land.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The residents filed a petition with the commission to incorporate a town. The petition was rejected, and the residents sought a writ of mandamus. The district court found for respondents, and the residents appealed, arguing that the duty of the commission, as stated in &sect; 10-2-6, U.C.A. 1953, was simply a ministerial one, so if a petition to incorporate a town met the requirements of the statute, the commission had to approve it. The court disagreed, noting that, if the legislature intended that the commission had no alternative than to give rubberstamp approval to any petition that complied with the specifications of the statute, it could have simply said that upon such filing with the county recorder, the town was thus established. The use of the phrase &quot;on approval of such petition by the board&quot; was not perfunctory and imported that the commission could approve or withhold its approval of a petition. The court rejected the residents' argument that &sect; 10-2-6 was an unconstitutional creation of a municipal corporation by special law or that if it was construed to vest discretion in the commission, it was a delegation of legislative powers.</SPAN></P>

The U.S. Supreme Court vacated the order denying the writ of mandate and directed the court to give further consideration to the matter in light of what was said in a certain case. The court held that the trial court properly refused to make an order that jurisdiction over the absent spouses could be obtained in a manner contrary to law. The court found that publication better met the requirements of due process of law than mailing to the last known address. The court determined that the wives were not denied due process by the necessity of publishing summons as they were allowed to file their complaints without any fee being paid and the sheriff stood ready to serve any and all papers without costs to the wives. The court noted that newspapers could not be compelled to publish the summons without receiving compensation therefor. The petition was denied.</SPAN></P>

Defendants sought rehearing to enable the parties to allocate the duties of the state auditor and of the department of finance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In its previous decision, the court specifically held that the preparation of vouchers was a ministerial act. Consequently, it could be performed by whatever organization the legislature might designate. The department of finance had been so designated to audit and prepare all claims, and the court's decision did not affect that work. In the decision the court said that the issue was very narrow and did not require the court to hold unconstitutional the law which created the department of finance. What the court held was that before the state treasurer could constitutionally pay a warrant, he must have the approval of the state auditor, and that it was the duty of the auditor to verify the correctness of accounts before they were paid. The court held that those duties imposed upon the director of finance were not in conflict with the constitutional duties of the state auditor, and until changed by the legislature they properly belonged to the department of finance. The final auditing function, as to whether a claim was to be paid by the state treasurer, lay with the state auditor.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant putative father appealed from a judgment of a trial court (Utah), which denied his motion challenging the service of process and overruled his objections in an action commenced in accordance with the provisions of &sect; 77-60-1, U.C.A.1953, of the Bastardy Act, whereby a complaint, under oath or affirmation, by a pregnant, unmarried female was made to a justice of the peace, who thereupon issued a warrant against the father.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The father asserted that the trial court erred when it denied the defense motion to quash the service on the ground that no summons was issued and served upon him in accordance with Rule 3, U.R.C.P. The father reasoned that because the trial court characterized an action under the Bastardy Act, Title 77, Chap. 60 as civil in nature, the action had to be commenced in accordance with the Rules of Civil Procedure. The court remanded the case. The court determined that statutes were enacted in almost every jurisdiction to provide for filiation or bastardy proceedings to determine the paternity of an illegitimate child and to compel its maintenance by its putative father. The court explained that the jurisdiction of the court was invoked under the Uniform Act on Paternity, Chap. 45a, Title 78, U.C.A. 1953, as amended 1965. The court noted that there was an express intention upon the part of the legislature to retain the Bastardy Act, Title 77, Chap. 60 and there was no justification for a determination that the legislature intended to repeal the earlier act. The court concluded that the mother could seek the aid of the State and have it proceed on her behalf or seek private counsel.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">While the taxpayers were doing business in Utah, the Commission assessed a deficiency franchise tax assessment against the taxpayers. In assessing the deficiency, the Commission departed from the statutory formula for apportioning business income to Utah. On appeal, the court rejected the taxpayers' claim that because the legislature had adopted a formula for apportionment of business income to Utah, the Commission was unauthorized to depart from that formula and to make its own allocation. In affirming, the court held that in adopting the Uniform Division of Income For Tax Purposes Act as a uniform state law, the legislature also included within the Act &sect; 59-13-95, U.C.A. 1953, which authorized the Commission to employ another method to effectuate an equitable allocation of a taxpayer's income if the Act's apportionment provisions did not fairly represent the extent of the taxpayer's business activity in Utah. Thus, the court held that the Act did not limit the Commission to the use of the statutory formula in all cases. Moreover, in upholding an assessment of interest on the tax deficiencies, the court held that interest was a matter solely within the Commission's discretion.</SPAN></P>

The court explained that the terms &quot;street, alley, crosswalk, sidewalk&quot; were generally held to include the parking strip between the curb and the sidewalk or the building line. The court noted that a party seeking to obtain the benefits of a statute should not be entitled to claim the favorable aspects, which conferred the rights, and disavowed the conditions upon which the rights were predicated. The court concluded that the statute dealing with the specific subject would usually be given preference over a statute of a general nature. The court determined that the parents of the child were fully aware of her injuries and the cause as if it happened to one of them, so they could have proceeded earlier. The court explained that the rule that claims had to be presented within a certain period of time should not be changed judicially.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, a governor and a department of finance, challenged a ruling from the lower court (Utah), which was a declaratory judgment in favor of respondent state auditor in an action to determine the constitutionality of &sect; 67-4-4, U.C.A. 1953, which removed from the state auditor the duty to draw warrants on the state treasurer and placed it with the department of finance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court held that &sect; 67-4-4, U.C.A. 1953 was unconstitutional because it usurped constitutional duties and prerogatives of the state auditor. At and prior to statehood, the state auditor drew all warrants on the treasurer to expend money. To take that duty away from the state auditor would detract from constitutional duties of his office, which could not be done. Typing warrants was ministerial in nature, and the state auditor could not complain if that was done by the department of finance, but presenting warrants to the state treasurer called for discretion, and the state auditor had to decide if a warrant was to be presented for payment. Under the statute in question the state auditor was limited to verifying the accounts of various departments after payments were made by the state treasurer. The court held that the constitutional duties of the state auditor were those which the territorial auditor performed and that the constitutional provision that other duties could be imposed did not permit the legislature to relieve the state auditor of constitutional duties. Before the state treasurer could constitutionally pay a warrant, he had to have the state auditor's approval.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant and another man were discovered near midnight inside a clinic trying to pry open the pharmacy door. When they were discovered, they each ran and hid, defendant in a utility closet under a set of stairs, and his companion under a couch. Defendant emerged from his hiding place when he learned that police dogs were to be sent in after him. Police found a loaded pistol in his hiding place. Defendant was convicted of burglary in the second degree, and he appealed, claiming, inter alia, that &sect; 76-9-3 was unconstitutionally vague and that, because he did not steal anything, the crime was not made out. The court affirmed, holding that &sect; 76-9-3 was amended shortly before the incident. Under the old statute, the difference between burglary in the second degree and burglary in the third degree depended on the time of entry. If at night, it was second degree, and if it was daytime, it was third degree. The amendment provided that breaking and entering, with intent to steal or to commit a felony, was burglary in the second degree. The trier of facts could hardly have failed to believe that defendant, in entering the clinic near midnight, did so with the intent to steal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Land developers in the city were required to pay all of the installation costs of services to property developed, including sidewalks and water mains. Additionally, the city required a building permit for each unit constructed of $ 12. The disputed city ordinance added $ 100 to the $ 12 fee. The stated purpose of the additional fee was to bring the permit fee in line with the costs of regulating building construction. The court affirmed the trial court's declaration that the additional fee was unconstitutional and discriminatory. The court reasoned that even though license fees sufficient to cover such costs were a necessary concomitant of the city's police power, fees in excess thereof were in reality a form of taxation, which could not be imposed by the city without express authorization of the legislature. Thus, where the basic flat-fee charge for a building permit was increased in one jump from $ 12 to $ 112, which increase admittedly had no relationship to increased costs of the service rendered, and where the declared purpose was to raise general revenue for the city, the court held that the increase placed a disproportionate and unfair burden on new households in the city.</SPAN></P>

The statute, by specifying general categories of goods which could be sold or services rendered that were to be excepted from the operation of the prohibitions contained therein, had left it up to those persons who might be affected by the statute to determine what was permitted and what was prohibited. The legislature, by providing exceptions to the operation of the statute in such general terms, had failed to make ascertainable standards of conduct expected of those affected by the statute and also what activities were permitted and what activities were prohibited. One who might be affected by the operation of the statute could be subject to civil sanctions.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Section 16-6-13.5, U.C.A. 1969 (Utah) granted the Utah Liquor Control Commission with the consent of the local authorities the authority to issue a license to a social club which maintained or intended to maintain premises upon which liquor was stored, consumed, or sold. Section 16-6-13.7(9), U.C.A. 1969 (Utah) prevented the club from maintaining quarters for the purpose of barricading or concealing liquor. On appeal, the court affirmed the summary judgment awarded to the state. The court held that the power of a state to regulate or prohibit the possession, sale, or use of liquor was a matter of universal recognition. The state had far broader power to regulate and restrict the use, distribution, or consumption of liquor than to regulate or restrict ordinary business because of the effect of the former on the health and welfare of the public. The court held further that because it was not alleged in the complaint that any local authorities had refused to give consent for the Commission to issue licenses or permits to any of the clubs, they were in no position to question the validity of the act which required permission of local authorities before licenses could be granted.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant motor vehicle dealer sought review of a decision of a Utah trial court, which entered a declaratory judgment holding that a Sunday closing law, Title 76, Chapter 55, &sect;&sect; 5, 6 and 7, Utah Code Annotated, 1953, as amended, was constitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Upon review of the subject declaratory judgment, the argument was made that the legislative purpose of Title 76, Chapter 55, &sect;&sect; 5, 6 and 7, Utah Code Annotated, 1953, was to protect the public against automobile thefts and fraudulent sales. However, the court found that Sunday closing laws did not protect against such an evil since sales at all other times when the offices of record, insurance, and repair shops were closed were not prohibited. In fact, it was obvious that a sale on a Friday evening after the offices of record were closed would be a far greater evil, as it would permit unscrupulous persons to commit unlawful acts some two and one half days prior to detection on Monday morning. It was also clear that the statutes in question discriminated against licensed dealers and their product as well, since all other persons could sell and all types of vehicles could be sold by them on Sunday. The court held that there was no reasonable basis for singling out licensed auto dealers and excluding all others. The statutes did not apply equally to all persons as was required by the Utah Constitution.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judge's term was set to expire in 1971. In 1970, the judge presented to the Secretary his declaration of candidacy for the office of judge and tendered his filing fee. Because the judge was 73 years old when he presented his declaration, and the mandatory retirement age for judges, pursuant to the Judges' Retirement Act (Utah) (the Act), was 72, the Secretary refused to accept the declaration or the fee. The judge sought a writ of mandamus. The court directed the Secretary to accept the declaration and fee and place the judge's name on the ballot. Voters agreed to retain the judge, so the judge sought a writ compelling certification of the election. The court, which had reserved the issue of whether the mandatory retirement provision of &sect; 49-7-1.1 of the Act was constitutional, determined that the addition of &sect; 28 of art. VII of the Utah Constitution clearly authorized the Legislature to provide uniform standards for mandatory retirement of judges, which were separate and distinct from the removal of judges. The mandatory retirement statute was therefore not constitutional, and the judge was not entitled to assume the office of judge.</SPAN></P>

In affirming, the court noted that defendant was charged at a time when he had other cases pending against him. At a hearing for sentencing on one of the other charges, defendant's counsel requested that a psychiatric evaluation be afforded defendant. The trial court granted the request, and in doing so, set aside a trial date for the instant case. The court opined that such a procedure was not inimical to the interests of defendant, although it would appear from the record that he thought his attorney, not he, needed a psychiatric evaluation. The court further noted that about five competent lawyers had been appointed to represent him, but through the firing process or some sort of frustration, they did not survive the privilege of representing defendant, who chose to represent himself on the instant appeal.</SPAN></P>

The trial court enjoined the bond issue and held that the constitutional and statutory provisions were severable. The court reversed, holding that a recent decision of the Supreme Court of the United States rendered invalid the requirement that only voters who paid property taxes were allowed to vote. The court held that the decision was applicable only to bond elections that were final by a specified date and that under the period specified by state law, in Utah Code Ann. &sect; 11-14-12 (1953), the election was final. The court held that the statutory and constitutional provisions in question were rendered inoperable, but that the provisions were severable so that bond elections could be held.

VI, &sect; 7, as claimed by the attorney general in an action against defendant members.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Council was composed of members of the legislature, and the 1967 act allowed them a per diem of $ 25 plus expenses. Defendants were appointed to the Council during that 1967 term, and the attorney general argued that the act violated Utah Const. art. VI, &sect; 7, which prohibited members of the legislature from holding a civil office of profit created during the term for which they were elected. Judgment was entered upholding the 1967 act, and the attorney general appealed. In reversing, the court ruled that the 1967 act did violate &sect; 7, and defendants were precluded from being appointed to the Council, because membership therein was a &quot;civil office&quot; and, because a salary was specified, it was certainly an office of profit. Moreover, under Utah Const. art. VI, &sect; 6, members of the Council were ineligible to be legislators if the 1967 act was valid. Accordingly, the pay prescribed by Utah Const. art. VI, &sect; 9, was the entire remuneration that members were entitled to.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The prisoner was 17 years old when he pleaded guilty in district court to issuing a fictitious check. He was placed on probation, but he was convicted in district court the following year of robbery and grand larceny, and his probation was revoked.

In affirming, the supreme court ruled that the district court had jurisdiction under &sect; 55-10-5, U.C.A. 1953, and the prisoner was not denied his due process and equal protection rights under that statute. The prisoner failed to meet his burden of presenting clear evidence showing an abuse of discretion in not transferring the case to juvenile court. Also, the record affirmatively showed that he waived counsel with respect to the robbery and larceny charges, and his claim that his guilty plea was involuntary was nebulous and without substantial, believable or factual probative substance.</SPAN></P>

The operators were charged with violations of the law, but the charges were dismissed upon a ruling that &sect; 19-4-6 was unconstitutional. The City appealed. In affirming, the court ruled that the word &quot;inspection,&quot; as used in the ordinance, was synonymous with a &quot;search&quot; for Fourth Amendment purposes. Prior judicial precedent established that such warrantless &quot;inspections&quot; of licensed businesses were offensive to the Fourth Amendment.</SPAN></P>

The court determined that pursuant to Utah Const. art.

The court concluded that, insofar as 1969 Utah Laws ch. 138 purported to allow defendants to make the appointments, it was contrary to the provisions of Utah Const. art.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant claimed that the State did not affirmatively prove his criminal intent as was required under Utah Code Ann. &sect; 76-1-20 (1953). The court determined that &sect; 76-1-20 allowed for a finding of negligence and that it appeared that defendant failed to make any effort to determine whether the individual was a juvenile or whether he gave his true name and address in connection with requesting the numerous prescriptions. The court further determined that defendant knew the drugs were dangerous and that he was prescribing excessive quantities to the individual. The court held that there was a basis for finding beyond reasonable doubt that defendant was guilty of contributing to the delinquency of a minor, because he was charged with conduct which amounted to the commission of a crime. The court further held that the terms &quot;delinquency&quot; and &quot;contributing to the delinquency&quot; as applied to minors gave clear and understandable meaning and that, if the court were inclined to consider the claim of a lack of constitutionality, it was clear that defendant had contributed to the delinquency of a minor.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants attended a public meeting at which there was a paid speaker. Although questions were suppose to be in writing, defendant claimed he had no pencil and that he could not write English very well. An exception was made for defendant, who proceeded, not to ask a question but to make a speech taking both the speaker and her theme song apart. The speaker responded in a spirit of reciprocity characterized by some rather untender inferences of her own. On review, the court found that defendants intentionally started the fracas that caused the sponsors of the meeting abruptly to adjourn the meeting. Defendants contended that the statute was unconstitutional because it was vague and overbroad in scope. The court found neither. Defendants also contended that the statute was applied unconstitutionally to them. The thrust of defendants' argument was an attempt to demonstrate that the speaker, by shouting back, was sort of a causa causans of the entire ruckus. However, the speaker was not charged with inciting a breach of the peace. It was defendants who were charged with disturbing or breaking up a lawful assembly.

He sought reversal of his conviction on the ground that he was denied his right to a speedy trial as guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States and article I, &sect; 12 of the Constitution of Utah. The State asked the court to take judicial notice of the congested criminal docket and current backlog of criminal cases and claimed that the delay was necessary in the orderly administration of criminal justice.

The court also rejected the taxpayers' claim that the Act conflicted with Utah Const. art. XIV, &sect;&sect; 3, 4 because the county sanitary service was not a municipal corporation.

A further appeal did not lie except where the validity or constitutionality of a statute was involved. Defendant did not challenged the statute under which he was convicted as invalid.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, the Attorney General of the State of Utah, sought review of an order of a trial court (Utah), which granted a motion to dismiss filed by respondents, members of the Utah State Legislature, seeking to dismiss the Attorney General's declaratory action to determine the constitutionality of amendments to &sect;&sect; 36-4-12 and 36-4-7, U.C.A. 1953 (Utah).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court granted the motion to dismiss and found that the Attorney General lacked standing to bring the action. The statutes, which had been enacted by the Legislature, provided for the payment of a per diem and expenses to members of the Legislative Council and authorized the Council to employ staff and fix their salaries. Pursuant to &sect; 78-33-2, U.C.A. 1953 (Utah), any person whose rights or status were affected by a statute had the right to determine the construction or constitutionality of such statute. Further, the court found that under Article VII, &sect; 18 of the Utah Constitution, the Attorney General was the legal adviser of the state officers. The court held that the Attorney General had common law powers and duties. In addition, under &sect; 67-5-1, U.C.A. 1953 (Utah), the court determined that the Attorney General had the right and the duty to bring suits to clarify the constitutionality of laws enacted by the Legislature. Therefore, the court held that the trial court erred in granting the motion to dismiss.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowner contended on appeal that the trial court erred in holding that the State could not close the access without determining necessity therefor, in refusing to admit evidence on enhancement in value, and in giving an instruction on damages. The court affirmed the judgment. The court noted that there had been testimony to the effect that elimination of access to property next to the interchange facilities was necessary for reasons of safety. The court observed that it was reasonable to conclude that in such times of increasing speed, traffic congestion, and danger, safety features required by those charged with the construction and maintenance of the highways, short of some obvious and proven caprice, inefficiency, or malfeasance, should be respected and endorsed by the judiciary. The court held that to be the case in the case before it. The court stated that evidence of a higher and better use was inadmissible if such use was impossible because of existing, enforceable legislation and that severance damage was not forthcoming where access denied at one place nonetheless reasonably was available at another, although it might involve some degree of inconvenience.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court awarding the landowner smaller damages than those sought in the State's condemnation action.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a hearing, the Tax Commission concluded that the sales of ice cream and other products by the vendor were retail sales and that sales tax deficiency should have been assessed against it.

The court found that the contract was carefully drawn for the purpose of creating a relationship of independent contractor and that it was clearly intended to preclude a claim that a master-servant relationship existed between the parties. The findings of the Commission were insufficient on which to base a determination that the vendor and the operators departed from the provisions of the contract in such a manner and to such an extent that a master-servant relationship was created which made the vendor liable for the payment of sales taxes.</SPAN></P>

On review, the court found the code provision to be ipse dixit, instead holding that under Title 10-6-15, Utah Code Annotated (1953), the city could place reasonable restrictions on its officers and employees. As to the residency requirement, the city had a legitimate interest in requiring its employees to live within a reasonable distance from work, and in collecting taxes for its benefit. As to the restrictions on political activity, the city could restrict political speech only upon a showing that the activity would inure to the detriment of a governmental function or well being.</SPAN></P>

The court held: (1) the fact that the applicant was attending school did not change the fact that he was a full-time employee, but it did affect his status as such because Title 35-4-5(g), Utah Code Annotated 1953, as amended (Vol. 4, Replacement Volume 1963, p. 791) provided that attendance would disqualify the applicant from receiving benefits unless the major portion of his wages for insured work during his base period was for service performed while attending school; and (2) even though the statute exempted students attending night school, a part-time training course, or a course approved by the Commission, this fact alone was insufficient to overcome the presumption that the statute was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

Appellees had advertised products for sale below cost as defined in the Act. Appellees contended the Act was unconstitutional. Appellant grocers' association intervened as a party plaintiff.

XIV and several provisions of the Utah Constitution because determinations of whether a merchant's prices were in violation of the Act placed an unfair burden on merchants; the statutory presumption of cost was arbitrary; and certain phrases in Act were ambiguous, among other things. The court held that the lower court's conclusions were not supported by the evidence nor in accordance with the guidelines used in determining the constitutionality of a statute. The Act was sufficiently clear to require compliance; constitutionality was not to be decided on questions of inconvenience, difficulty in application, or the economic effect of the Act.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant claimed that the erroneously allowed into evidence the results of a blood test administered shortly after the accident.

While in the hospital, defendant had refused to submit to a blood test to determine his blood alcohol content. A county attorney advised the officers that, if necessary, the test could be taken by force. It was conceded that the blood sample was extracted against defendant's will. The court rejected the State's argument that the driver of an automobile, because of the implied consent, had to submit to a test prior to arrest, but not after. This would result in the anomalous situation of an arrested person being afforded more rights than one not under arrest. The court noted cases holding that implied consent could be effective only after a person was placed under arrest and construed &sect; 41-6-44.10 to give implied consent only upon arrest. Defendant did not give his actual consent and his forced submission violated &sect; 41-6-44.10.</SPAN></P>

The Act provided for the construction of a plant by respondent county to extract mineral residues of the great salt lake to be leased to and operated by respondent magnesium project.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The county and the magnesium project entered into an arrangement whereby the county obtained finances via revenue bonds to construct a plant to extract the mineral residues of the great salt lake, which was leased to and operated by the magnesium project. The bonds were to be paid only by the rentals received from leasing the plant. The taxpayers brought an action against the county and the magnesium project, contending that the project and the Act were in violation of Utah Const. art. VI, &sect; 31. The district court found in favor of the county and the magnesium project, holding that the Act was not unconstitutional. On appeal, the court affirmed the district court's decision. The court held that: (1) inasmuch as the bonds were payable only out of the income to be derived from leasing the plant and no resort could be had against the county or its taxpayers, the project was not a &quot;lending of credit&quot; of the county prohibited by the state constitution; and (2) because any tax exemption under the Act applied to the county and not to the private enterprises involved in the project, there was no illicit tax exemption from property taxes.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Section 29 of Title 20 authorized the City to license nonprofit clubs. The Attorney General filed suit for a judgment declaring that the ordinance was unconstitutional. The clubs filed suit to enjoin the enforcement of the ordinance as to them. The cases were consolidated, and the trial court upheld the validity of the ordinance except for the provisions that required the City's police chief to be given a key to the premises of such clubs and that authorized police officers to enter such premises without a search warrant. On appeal, the court held that the entire ordinance was invalid as to incorporated nonprofit associations. Insofar as the ordinance incorporated the language and requirements of &sect;&sect; 16-6-13 through 16-6-15, U.C.A. 1953 and encroached upon the jurisdiction of the Secretary of State of the State of Utah, it was unconstitutional on the ground that it created a conflict with the general laws of the State. Because it was properly the function of the City to regulate nonprofit associations within the express powers granted to municipalities by statute, the court declined to conjecture as to the intent of the City as to the remaining valid portions of the ordinance.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's home was searched pursuant to a search warrant that was clearly insufficient but that was supplemented by oral deposition of the officer who applied to the judge for the warrant.

Marijuana was found in defendant's home, and he was convicted of possession of marijuana. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded for a new trial. The court noted the right of citizens to be secure in their own homes and cited the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States and Article I, Section 14 of the Utah State Constitution, which were identical. The court concluded that Title 77, Chapter 54, U.C.A. 1953, Section 77-54-4 U.C.A. 1953 (Utah), which provided that the magistrate had to, before issuing the warrant, examine on oath the complainant and any witnesses he may produce, and take their depositions in writing and cause them to be subscribed by the parties making them, could not be construed as meaning that a warrant could issue from an oral deposition of the complainant or other witnesses.

The federal district court denied the inmate's request on the basis that he had failed to exhaust his state remedies. The inmate then filed a habeas corpus petition with the court, which denied the petition. The court held that the burden of proof was on the inmate to prove that he had not knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily waived his right to counsel. The court found that the inmate had effectively waived his right to counsel because the court had advised him of his right to counsel, he was not shown to be illiterate or feeble minded, he knew that he was guilty and that the state could prove his guilt, and he stated that he did not want either a trial or a lawyer.

Defendant sought to dismiss on the ground that the statute violated the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution as well as &sect;&sect; 7,9,24 of Article I, and &sect; 26 of Article VI of the Utah Constitution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The crime of which defendant was convicted was a felony. Defendant reasoned that the felony conviction had consequences far beyond the prospect of incarceration, such as deprivation of certain civil liberties and a stringent curtailment of future educational and employment opportunities. He contended that a felony conviction for issuing an insufficient funds check, regardless of amount, constituted a cruel and unusual punishment and that &sect; 76-20-11, U.C.A.1953, Supp.1967 (Utah) was unconstitutional. The court, however, disagreed after finding that the sentence imposed in proportion to the offense committed was not such that would shock the moral sense of all reasonable men as to what was right and proper under the circumstances. Defendant's circumstances included a number of probations or parole periods and a pattern of writing bad checks. The court next found that defendant was defended by a skilled and competent attorney. Finally, the court found that defendant's argument that the statute violated the Utah Constitution was without merit because there was no basis to hold that the statute was not a law of general nature or that it was a special or private law that punished crimes.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted in the city and district courts of aiding and abetting in the commission of a crime by directing a police officer to a certain apartment to obtain sexual intercourse for hire. On appeal, the Utah Supreme Court held that the state by enacting comprehensive and complete laws pertaining to sexual offenses had pre-empted the field of sexual offenses, except where expressly stated otherwise. The city petitioned for rehearing. The court overruled its preemption theory and affirmed defendant's conviction. The court held that the ordinance was a valid exercise of the city's police power and the phrase &quot;sexual intercourse for hire&quot; was sufficiently clear to be understood by persons of ordinary intelligence. There was nothing in the state statutes regulating sexual offenses that evidenced any express or implied intent to preclude local governments from also attempting to prohibit and suppress the difficult problem of the sex offender; thus, the ordinance was consistent with the statutes. The court concluded that the difference in penalties did not create an inconsistency that invalidated the ordinance where there was no valid claim of double jeopardy.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff former employee filed suit against defendant city to obtain review of the city commission's decision to sustain the employee's discharge from employment at the city's cemetery. A district court (Utah) entered a judgment that the city had to reinstate the employee. The city appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee was discharged for refusing to disclose to his supervisor the true facts concerning an incident of horseplay among his co-workers. After his discharge, he appealed to the city employees' appeal board, which voted for reinstatement due to the fact that the employee had been a good worker in the past and that the incident was his first infraction. The city commission voted to sustain the employee's discharge. In ordering reinstatement, the district court ruled that under Utah Code Ann. &sect; 49-2-5 (1953), which provided for the appeal procedure following a city worker's discharge, the board's decision was final and the commission had no choice but to sustain it. On appeal, the court held that &sect; 49-2-5 provided that if the board upheld a worker's discharge, the case was closed and no further proceedings had, but that if the board did not uphold the discharge, the worker had 15 days to appeal to the commission. Based on a reasonable interpretation of the statute, the final ruling on the employee's discharge rested with the commission. That result was consistent with the fact that the responsibility for the operation of the city government rested with the commission.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the district court's judgment and ordered that the commission's decision was to be affirmed. The court also ruled that the parties were to bear their own costs.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The primary question presented concerned the validity of the provisions of the ordinances as applied to the company's operations on the relevant parcel of property. Despite the language of the certain ordinances, the company continued sand and gravel operations until the municipal corporation served them with a stop order. The company then brought suit asking that the zoning and building ordinances relied upon by the municipal corporation in issuance of the stop order be declared invalid as they applied to their operations. On appeal, the court held that, after considering all the factors involved, including the existing use of the property, the availability of a natural resource, the severe loss to both the fee owners and the public as compared to the relatively small inconvenience to owners in that neighborhood, there was evidence in the record to support the trial court's decision that the zoning ordinance as enforced against the company's property was an invalid exercise of the police power.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In appealing her conviction, defendant contended that Salt Lake City, Utah, Revised Ordinances &sect; 32-2-1, under which she was convicted, was beyond the authority granted by the legislature to the City. The court denied the City's claim that the ordinance came within the statutes granting authority to the city to deal with prostitution. The ordinance at issue was not designed to deal with prostitution. The court then held that the general grant of power to the cities by the legislature contained in Utah Code Ann. &sect; 10-8-84 (1953) was not intended to grant to the cities the right to regulate offenses such as those specified in the ordinance. The State, by enacting comprehensive and complete laws pertaining to sexual offenses, had pre-empted that field. The State did not intend that municipalities deal with such offenses except in those areas pertaining to prostitution where the legislature had made specific grants of authority to municipalities. As the ordinance under which defendant was convicted went beyond the grant of any legislative authority granted to the City, it was therefore invalid. The court reversed the conviction and directed the complaint to be dismissed.</SPAN></P>

The court noted that the conspiracy aspect involved in &sect; 76-12-1(5)(d) was in existence at common law and was clearly understood then.

The court directed the Authority's complaint to be dismissed. The court held that the legislature by the use of the words &quot;and its environs&quot; in the act created an uncertainty in failing to spell out the area over which the Authority was to exercise its functions and by reason thereof the act was invalid. The court held further that a careful reading of the act in its entirety failed to disclose any limitation on the power granted to the Authority and the act failed to identify with any degree of clarity the powers, duties, and responsibilities of the Authority.

The challenged ordinance had been passed pursuant to &sect;&sect; 1 to 7 of Chapter 31, Title 17, U.C.A.1953.</SPAN></P>

When summary judgment was granted to defendant, plaintiff appealed. The court affirmed. That transients upon whom the tax was imposed received no benefit thereby did not violate due process guarantees because the tax was levied on the owner's occupation, and legislatures had broad discretion to impose such taxes to generate revenue. Plaintiff's equal protection claim was also rejected. After finding nothing discriminatory about the classification of transients and non-transients, the court held that the fact that the tax was levied solely on plaintiff's group for the benefit of all county businesses did not require a finding of a constitutional violation. That was because a state was entitled to impose occupation taxes on one group to benefit another, and no relation between the class of taxpayers and the purpose of the underlying appropriation had to be shown. Because the ordinance did not violate either constitutional prohibition, the court affirmed the judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The lake authority brought an action, pursuant to Utah Code. Ann. &sect; 65-8, to condemn certain land.

The trial court denied the motion to dismiss. On appeal, the denial was affirmed. The court held that the title of the act was not a part of the act so any ambiguity in the title was not relevant to whether or not the act was valid. The court found that the language of the act itself was sufficiently clear. The court held further that based on the nature of the project, it would have been difficult to spell out the boundaries and authority with greater detail. Finally, the court held that in order to carry out the purposes of the act, the lake authority would have to acquire property and therefore the condemnation proceedings were legal.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant State Tax Commission appealed a decision from a district court (Utah), which declared that plaintiff taxpayer and other taxpayers, who filed their tax returns for 1965 before January 1, 1966, were not subject to increases in state income taxes enacted by Chapter 125, S.L.U.1965, but that the statute was not unconstitutional and void. The taxpayer filed a cross-appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The statute at issue provided for an increase in the tax rates on net taxable income. In interpreting the statute, the court looked to the intent of the legislature and found that the primary purpose of the legislature was to put into effect an increase in state income taxes from and after January 1, 1965. The was found to be a tax on income earned during a taxable year and not upon returns. The return was merely a compilation of data giving information as to the amount of tax due. The new tax rates were to apply to income for taxable years commencing on or after January 1, 1965, and the reference to when the returns were filed was an incidental recital which was not controlling. If the legislature had intended to give the advantage of the lower old tax rates to those who filed early, it undoubtedly would have said so in a direct way. The sensible and practical construction of the statute brought about equal and non-discriminatory taxation and accomplished the legislative purpose.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants sold contracts to furnish embalming and funeral services by mortuary selected by purchaser or his heirs at specified price regardless of future price increases. Plaintiffs, funeral directors/embalmers association and mortuary company, brought action seeking declaratory judgment on right to solicit business of burial and funeral services for dead human bodies. Plaintiffs claimed, inter alia, that such solicitation violated professional and ethical standards under Utah Code Ann. (Code) &sect;&sect; 58-9-10, -22 (1953). The trial court entered judgment against plaintiffs. Plaintiffs appealed. Since defendant solicitors clearly were not funeral directors, registered apprentices, or licensed embalmers, and they did not solicit dead human bodies to be turned over to a particular practitioner of such art, the court held that no violation of professional conduct had occurred. However, insofar as contracts permitted defendants as trustee to withdraw trust funds for their own use, such provision was a nullity in violation of Code &sect;&sect; 22-4-1, 2 &amp; 4, which provided that such funds could not be withdrawn until the beneficiary's death.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted after he struck and killed a pedestrian with his automobile. On appeal, the court rejected defendant's principal contention that the evidence failed to sustain the conviction. The court held that the evidence was sufficient to establish that defendant had operated his motor vehicle in &quot;reckless disregard of the safety of others&quot; within the meaning of &sect; 41-6-43.10, U.C.A.1953. The physical evidence and the testimony of other witnesses reasonably supported the conclusion that defendant was traveling at a high and dangerous rate of speed, in an area with which he was familiar and where he should have realized that people might be crossing the highway, without keeping a proper lookout or control of his car. An experienced officer estimated the speed of defendant's car at between 55 and 65 miles per hour, which contradicted defendant's assertion that he was traveling at a considerably slower speed. The court found no merit in defendant's contention that the trial court erred in its evidentiary rulings.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The insurer brought an action to collect on a promissory note and to foreclose a mortgage on a country club. The country club counterclaimed and asserted that the loan was usurious and claimed forfeiture of unpaid interest. The trial court held that the loan was usurious and awarded the insurer damages and attorney's fees, but credited the country club with treble interest damages on its counterclaim. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court found that the insurer demanded $ 14,500, which was 22 percent of the entire loan, as a consideration for making the loan. The court reasoned that because the $ 14,500 was never credited as principal to the country club, the money could only be considered as additional interest. The court also found that the insurer could not say that it did not have knowledge of the note, while at the same time, by word and action, admit it was aware of the fact, and that the note was part of the consideration in granting the loan. Thus, the court concluded that the insurer entered into the transaction for the purpose of taking profit that was not permitted by statute.</SPAN></P>

Section 17-29-3, U.C.A.1953 provided that counties were allowed to create a county service area to supply services in several areas. The trial court held that the act was constitutional. Reversing, the court held that the act was invalid. The court stated that the innumerable activities in which the Service Area could have engaged could have emasculated the performance of municipal functions vested by the Utah Constitution in the local corporate authorities. The court found that, by the unlimited grant of the act, the Service Area could, in effect, have become the alter ego of the county and other units of local government and provided a means to evade the State constitutional debt limitations under Article XIV, Sections 3 and 4. The court noted that it was not within its function to pick out the valid and invalid portions of the act. The court concluded that the act was invalid and a separability clause, enacted in 1961, was ineffective because of the dependency of the remaining sections upon the provisions declared inoperative.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The complaint was amended to show Section 41-1-127, Utah Code Annotated, as the violated statute. The court noted that the statute concerned with operating a vehicle with a gross-laden weight in excess of that for which it was registered was, in fact, Section 41-1-128, Utah Code Annotated. However, the court held that defendant's complaint about the citation confusion was without merit because the language fully apprised him of the precise charge against him. Defendant contended that because a weighmaster's testimony as to the weight for which the vehicles had been registered was stricken, there was no evidence of that factor of his conviction. The court noted that U.C.A.1953, 41-1-127(h) required that every vehicle registered by gross-laden weight have painted or stenciled thereon the gross-laden weight for which it was registered and the gross-laden weight for a combination of vehicles must be displayed upon the power unit. In its affirmance, the court held that defendant's truck showed that the truck or combination was registered for 12,000 pounds and when the weighmaster accepted the representation as truth, defendant made no protest nor offered any qualifying explanation.</SPAN></P>

Defendants contended that the approval of the Board of Examiners was not required. The court disagreed. Under the 1963 Act, the Director of Finance would have assumed both the prerogative and the duty of determining not only of the availability of funds, but also of passing on the propriety of the expenditures. This usurped powers belonging to the Board of Examiners under &sect; 13. The power to set salaries was necessarily included within the general supervisory power over expenditures of state government adjudicated to be in the Examiners. Essentially the same situation existed with respect to &sect; 63-2-15 of the 1963 Finance Act in respect to expenditures for mileage and travel expenses.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer possessed and used land of the United States under a research and development contract. The county treasurer imposed a privilege tax on the property, under Utah Code Ann. &sect; 59-13-73 (1953). The taxpayer paid the taxes, but brought an action for a refund, contending that the land was immune from taxation by virtue of U.S. Const. art. VI, cl. 2. The taxpayer also contended that statute had been applied in a discriminatory manner. The trial court held that the statute had been applied in a discriminatory manner and ordered a refund. On appeal, the court reversed. First, the court held that the statute did not violate the supremacy clause because the tax did not directly fall upon the United States or its agency. The taxpayer was a for-profit corporation that was an independent contractor, not an instrumentality of the United States government. The court further held that there was no basis for concluding that the statute was discriminatorily applied. Any failure of proper and uniform application of the statute stemmed from a lack of knowledge or misunderstanding.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In finding the Act unconstitutional, the trial court held that the Act's exemptions were discriminatory to unexempt motor carriers and denied them equal protection of the laws guaranteed by Amendment XIV of the U.S. Constitution and Article I, &sect; 7 of Utah's Constitution. On appeal, the court examined &sect; 54-6-12, U.C.A. 1953, which exempted various motor vehicles from the Act's provision. In reversing, the court held that the classes of transportation exempted from the Act under &sect; 54-6-12 were reasonable. In so holding, the court noted that the transportation exempted was casual, seasonal, slow-moving, not on regular routes or schedules, frequently in special equipment, and for comparatively short distances. The court also noted that Laws of Utah 1957, Ch. 107, amending &sect; 54-6-12, U.C.A. 1953, required the exempt carriers enumerated in the Act to provide insurance, comply with safety regulations, and to comply with the provisions relative to accident reports.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff inmate appealed from a judgment by which a trial court (Utah) denied his petition for a writ of habeas corpus. Defendant, who had been re-imprisoned for failing to leave Utah, which was a condition of termination of his sentence, contended that the conditional termination violated Art. I, &sect;&sect; 3, 9 and 26 of the Utah Constitution and the 5th, 6th and 14th amendments of the Federal Constitution and was void as against public policy.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Utah Board of Pardons granted the inmate a termination of his sentence, which was conditioned upon his leaving Utah. The termination provided that if the inmate returned to Utah, he would be re-imprisoned. The inmate agreed to the conditions of the termination, in writing, paid no attention to them, stayed in Utah, and was returned to prison. In his petition for a writ of habeas corpus, the inmate contended that conditioning the termination of his sentence upon his leaving Utah constituted a banishment, which was offensive to Art. I, &sect;&sect; 3, 9 and 26 of the Utah Constitution and the 5th, 6th and 14th amendments of the Federal Constitution and that the condition was void as against public policy. The trial court disagreed and denied the petition. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that the condition was constitutional and was not void as against public policy. The court reasoned that under Art. VII, &sect; 12, Utah Constitution, implemented by Title 77-62-3, U.C.A.1953, the Board had plenary authority to terminate an inmate's sentence on conditions and if an inmate did not like the conditions under which a termination was offered, he was free to reject them.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The minor was conditionally committed to the industrial school. The minor attacked the constitutionality of Utah Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 55-10-1, 55-10-3 (1953) as being violative of Utah Const. art. V, &sect; 1. An amicus curiae brief was filed in support of the minor's attack but it also sought to have the court canvass the constitutionality of other sections, which the court declined to do. The court stated that its conclusions did not affect the status of the juvenile court, its jurisdiction over the subject matter, or the validity of its judgment. There was no question as to the status of the juvenile court. It was a court of law and an integral part of the judicial branch of government in Utah's tripartite system. Any legislative sanction looking toward the invasion of the juvenile court's judicial functions was offensive to constitutional, traditional, and historical precepts. The part of Utah Code Ann. &sect; 55-10-1 (1953), purporting to delegate control and supervision over the juvenile courts offended the constitution. There seemed to be no constitutional objection to the balance of the language of that section and to Utah Code Ann. &sect;55-10-3 (1953), and such could be held separable.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer claimed that &sect; 53-7-24 U.C.A. 1953 (Utah), which provided for the &quot;voted leeway&quot; school financing program was unconstitutional. He filed the present action to have the statute adjudged to be unconstitutional and to have an election held pursuant to the statute declared void. The trial court granted a motion to dismiss by the School Board, and the taxpayer filed the present appeal. The court found that the statute was not unconstitutional, but declared the election to be void. The statute provided for an election in the manner set forth in &sect; 53-2-12. Section 53-2-12 had nothing to do with the manner of holding elections. The court found that the reference to &sect; 53-2-12 was in error, and the intention was to refer to &sect; 53-7-12. Thus, the court interpreted the statute as to fulfill its intended purpose. However, the court found that the property tax qualification was required of the voters under the election. The court analyzed the other statutes referenced in &sect; 53-7-24 and determined that the voting had to be by taxpayers that would bear the burden. Further, the public notice was insufficient because it failed to clearly indicate the proposal to be voted upon.</SPAN></P>

The court determined that the county failed to have an election, which was called for by the Act under the provisions of Utah Code Ann. &sect; 11-11-3, which meant that there was no justiciable controversy. The court held that the Utah Declaratory Judgments Act was not designed for giving advisory opinions in a non-adversary action, or to insure against feared risks, as were expressed by the taxpayer. The court further determined that the Act attempted to violate Utah Const. art. VI, &sect; 29, because the Act attempted to delegate to a special commission power to perform a municipal function. The court finally determined that the Act was intended to apply to a particular county, to the exclusion of others and therefore the Act was not uniform throughout the State, as required by Utah Const. art.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The county recorder testified that she hired the defendant as chief deputy county recorder when she took office and delegated to him the duties of handling the money for the office. The record disclosed that defendant, upon being informed of a prospective audit, disappeared and was not seen again until he voluntarily surrendered himself to the police. The audit revealed a shortage. Defendant sought to avoid his conviction on the ground that he was never in fact or in law the deputy county recorder. It was his contention that he never took the oath of office required by the Utah Constitution and statutory law. The court held that the evidence presented by the State was sufficient to enable the jury to find, beyond a reasonable doubt, that defendant was, for a period of two and one-half years, the de jure deputy county recorder. To hold that defendant's conviction should be set aside merely because the State did not show with conclusiveness that defendant went through some formal ritual in taking the oath would be a travesty and permit a super technicality to defeat the ends of justice. He performed the duties for two and one-half years and was duly compensated for his services.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The case was one of statutory interpretation, and the issue presented was whether or not the prosecuting attorneys were officers under &sect; 78-11-10, U.C.A. 1953. Section 78-11-10 required bonds in certain actions against sheriffs, constables, peace officers, state road officers, and any other persons charged with the duty of enforcement of the criminal laws of Utah. The court ruled that the prosecuting attorneys in the case at bar were not other persons under the statute. A basis for the ruling was that albeit prosecuting attorneys had the duty of enforcing criminal laws they were officers of a significantly different character from those listed by &sect; 78-11-10 such that they were not part of the class that the statute intended to protect. The ruling was made after the court stated various statutory-construction rules one of which was as follows: where general words or terms follow specific ones, the general ones had to be taken as applying to things of the same kind as the specific ones. Because it decided that &sect; 78-11-10 was not applicable to the case at bar, the court did not address the contention that the statute was a denial of the equal protection of the law.</SPAN></P>

The Board reviewed the claims and transmitted them to the Utah Legislature with the recommendation that the claims be denied.

The claimants filed the present action to recover, and judgment was entered in their favor. The Attorney General appealed and the court affirmed the trial court's judgment. The Attorney General claimed that under Article VII, &sect; 13, of the Utah Constitution, the Board of Examiners was vested with final authority to pass upon all claims against the State. The court held that the Board's action was not intended to be so final and absolute as to preclude other action by the Legislature.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff taxpayer appealed from a decision of defendant Utah State Tax Commission, which determined the mining occupation tax due for the years 1959 and 1960 pursuant to Article 7, Title 59, U.C.A.1953.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer filed with the Commission a petition seeking recission of a notice purporting to impose a mining occupation tax for the calendar year 1960, based upon the 1960 production and sought a refund of the payment made under protest. The Commission, after a hearing, denied the petition, and the taxpayer appealed. Upon review, the court reversed the decision. The court held that under L. 59, ch. 106, the tax increase at issue did not take place until January 1, 1960, and that the tax for both the years 1960 and 1959 was to be based upon the 1959 production--the 1959 tax at 1 percent and the 1960 tax at 2 percent. Section 3 of the 1959 amendment was clear and unambiguous. It clearly provided that the tax increase should not take effect until January 1, 1960, and clearly provided that the tax due for the year 1960 should be based upon the 1959 operations. This having been so, the court had no occasion to search for a different meaning. Furthermore, the argument of the Commission that the 1959 amendment was unconstitutional because it did not provide sufficient revenues to cover subsequent appropriations made by the legislature was untenable.</SPAN></P>

The court observed that it was not persuaded that the deceptions were either so grave or so seriously affected the public interest as to justify the measures proposed for their correction and that it saw no real likelihood that the restrictions would materially aid in policing and preventing deception of the public. The court stated that it was not convinced that gas price wars posed any such danger to the public as would warrant invasion of the constitutional rights of complaining dealers. The court was in accord with the determination that &sect;&sect; 41-11-45, 41-11-46, U.C.A. 1953 had to be deemed unconstitutional.

The company appealed arguing that &sect; 34-10-6(a), U.C.A.1953 was inapplicable, and that &sect; 34-10-6(a) was unconstitutional because it denied it due process and was unconstitutional because it was discriminatory and excluded other classes of employers from the penalty provision. The court reversed the judgment as to the penalty awarded. The court found the company's contentions that &sect; 34-10-6(a) was inapplicable and was unconstitutional in that it denied due process lacked merit because the company denied an employee-employer relationship existed. The court found the penalty provision of &sect; 34-10-6(a), which excluded banks and mercantile houses from the penalty provision, was unconstitutional.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Board desired to purchase securities for investment purposes, however, the Commission refused to issue checks for such purposes on the ground that &sect; 65-1-65 was unconstitutional under Utah Const. art. 6, &sect; 31, which provided that the legislature was not to authorize the State, or any county, town, or other political subdivision of the State, to lend its credit to stock or bonds in aid of any railroad, telegraph, or other private individual or corporate enterprise or undertaking. On appeal, the court held that the district court erred in ruling that the statute was unconstitutional. Section 31 was expressly intended to prevent the use of State finances to give support to private interests or enterprises. Unless the element of aiding such an enterprise was present, the State or its agency was not prohibited from purchasing well-established corporate securities in the interest of prudent handling of the funds the Commission was required to manage. When the underlying purpose was to invest for the benefit of the State or a political subdivision thereof, there was no lending of credit or expenditure of funds &quot;in aid of&quot; such enterprise or undertaking.</SPAN></P>

Also interested in the litigation was defendant adoption agency, which cross-appealed from an order disallowing its application for costs.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When the mother became pregnant, plaintiffs were not married, and plaintiff father was married to another woman. Defendant agency arranged for plaintiff mother to consent to give the baby up for adoption, which she did, and the baby's adoption followed. The parents then married in Idaho. When their repeated demands for return of the baby were denied, they sought a writ of habeas corpus, but the trial court denied the application. Plaintiffs appealed, but the court affirmed. After noting that the parents' marriage was void ab initio since the father was still married to his first wife when the marriage was solemnized, the court held that the trial court had properly ruled that the release signed by the mother was effective because there was no proof of duress or coercion. It rejected claims that the statute under which the mother consented to the adoption was unconstitutional in that it required only the mother's consent because the putative father of an illegitimate child occupied no recognized paternal status at common law or under law and he had no rights to the child. Thus, since the baby was illegitimate, the mother's consent was valid, and the trial court's ruling was proper.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city urged that Chap. 111 did not clearly state the subject matter of the act in its title. The title read: An Act Providing for the Deduction and Withholding of Individual Income Tax from Wages Paid by Employers to Resident Employees; and Providing for the Reimbursement of Expenses in Inaugurating and Administering the Withholding Provisions of the Act. The court found that a reading of the whole title and of the whole act was not an indictment of legislative intent. The legislature intended the appropriation to defray expenses of administering the act by the tax and finance commissions until the legislation reasonably became operable. The city also contended that the requirement that the city withhold state income taxes due from employees was a violation of due process. The court found no due process problem. Art. XI, &sect; 5, Utah Constitution provided for the creation, and possible elimination of cities. Cities were the creatures and agencies of the state, which possessed plenary power over them. Nor did the statute subject the city to involuntary servitude. The constitutional provisions against such status was an outgrowth of slavery and applied to individuals, not cities.</SPAN></P>

Defendant sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Under &sect; 77-7-1, the district attorney accused defendant of malfeasance in office. After one count was dismissed, the jury convicted defendant of a second count and acquitted him of a third count. On appeal, the court held that the phrase &quot;malfeasance in office&quot; in &sect; 77-7-1 was not unconstitutionally vague because it had acquired a commonly understood meaning: it required an intentional act or omission relating to the duties of a public office, which amounted to a crime or which involved a substantial breach of the trust imposed upon the official by the nature of his office, and which conduct was of such a character as to offend against the commonly accepted standards of honesty and morality. Next, the statute expressly authorized the district attorney to bring the instant action. Further, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to grant a mistrial at the time that count one was dismissed because the nature of criminal proceedings often made it necessary to charge violations in separate counts. Finally, although the trial court erred in rejecting defendant's request to take depositions of the witnesses, such error was harmless because no prejudice was shown.</SPAN></P>

The taxpayer appealed a decision from a trial court (Utah), which declared the act constitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Allegedly, the Act violated Art. VI, &sect; 29 and Art. XIII, &sect; 5 of the Utah Constitution; it improperly delegated legislative authority to counties over city affairs, it improperly gave legislative authority to the tax commission; it unlawfully interfered with local governmental agencies; it violated Art. I, &sect; 24, and Art. VI, &sect; 26, of the Utah Constitution; and it was either unreasonable, arbitrary and capricious, or too vague, indefinite and ambiguous to be enforceable. The court affirmed. The act extended a privilege and allowed the local government, not the legislature, to impose a tax. No legislative authority over cities was granted to counties, nor was any such authority delegated to the tax commission. The act had uniform operation and its provisions were subject to acceptance by any or all of the counties and by any or all cities within any or all the counties that took advantage of its provisions. Further, by its own provisions, if any section of the act was declared unconstitutional, the whole Act would fail.

If statutes can be given different reasonable interpretations, under one of which they would be constitutional and under the other their constitutionality would be doubtful, the former will be adopted. The statutes could not be so interpreted as to deny him the right to vote, because they would be unconstitutional by discriminating against him and the class to which he belongs.</SPAN></P>

One defendant was given a death sentence, and the other was granted a life sentence. Defendants were represented by different counsel and prosecuted separate appeals. Defendants collectively alleged that the verdict was not supported by the evidence, that Utah Code Ann. &sect; 77-30-2 (1953), pertaining to peremptory challenges, was unconstitutional, and that the trial court abused its discretion in denying a motion for a separate trial. The court affirmed the convictions of both defendants, holding that based on the evidence, the trial court properly submitted the elements of first-degree murder to the jury. The court held that because &sect; 77-30-2 applied the same to each defendant in the exercise of their peremptory challenges collectively, it was not discriminatory and did not deny equal protection of the laws. There was no error in the trial court's refusal to grant a separate trial because the defenses asserted by defendants were not inconsistent, and the jury was properly instructed that certain evidence applied only to one defendant and not the other.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, president of a motel association, challenged the determination of defendant Tax Commission of Utah, which found that amendments to the State Sales Tax Law, added at &sect; 59-15-4(f), U.C.A. 1953 (Utah), were constitutional. The purpose of the amendments was to extend the law to cover a tax on services.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff appeared to argue that the Utah statute excluded competing businesses not specifically named and was therefore discriminatory and invalid. The court disagreed and affirmed the decision below. The legislative purpose appeared to have been to impose a tax on charges made for short-term lodgings of the type traditionally provided by inns or hotels, as distinguished from residential lodgings. The court determined that the 30-day limitation in the statute seemed to be a reasonable time for division of the two classes of tenants. The court ruled that it was the character of the service rather than the name of the establishment that determined its classification and whether it was subject to the tax. Such an interpretation of the statute, making it apply to all persons providing that type of service, meant that it applied uniformly to all in the same class and rendered it invulnerable to attack as being discriminatory. The court concluded that the view adopted by the Tax Commission was in harmony with the general rule relating to the question of constitutionality of statutes: that all doubts were to be resolved in favor of constitutionality.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff State Road Commission of Utah sought review of a summary judgment of a Utah district court, which was rendered in favor of defendant utility companies. The Commission had filed an action under the declaratory judgment act to determine the validity of the Utility Relocation Act, &sect; 27-2-7(22), Utah Code Annotated, 1953. The district court held the Act to be valid and ordered the Commission to reimburse the companies for relocation costs.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Commission's complaint alleged that franchises had been granted by the proper governmental authorities to the companies to locate their utility facilities on public roads and streets; that the facilities had been placed in pursuance of the franchises; that thereafter portions of such roads and streets had been designated as federal aid highways, which required the removal and relocation of the facilities; and that the companies had demanded that the Commission pay the relocation costs as provided by the Act, which had become effective prior to the time demand for removal and relocation had been made. The Commission contended that it could not legally pay such costs, asserting the unconstitutionality of the Act. The common law required utilities to pay the entire cost of removing and relocating any such facilities. The issue was whether the Utah legislature had the power to modify the common law by enacting the Act. Affirming, the court held that in enacting the Act, the legislature remained within the boundaries of Utah Constitution Article VI, &sect; 31, as the companies were simply protected from suffering a net loss in the relocation of their facilities.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The residents owned real property in the district where the county intended to improve the road and add driveways. The residents objected to the county's proposal to issue negotiable bonds to be paid for from special assessments that would become a lien against the residents' property, along with a special property contingent tax against the property of the district. The trial court found no merit to the residents' complaint. On appeal, the court affirmed and held that the county's actions were lawful where each assessment was the same proportionate amount as the total of each separate improvement placed in front of each resident's property and no adjoining landowner was assessed for an improvement that would not be constructed in front of his or her property. Further, the assessment was constitutional where the improvements, although within the boundaries of the roadways on private property, were also for the benefit of the public. Finally, the provision for levying the special tax would not create a debt in excess of the taxes for the current year in violation of the constitutional debt limitation.</SPAN></P>

The limitation was based on the miles of lines possessed by such corporations. The court denied the writ. The court stated that when &sect;&sect; 2 and 3 of Article XIII of the Constitution of the State of Utah were considered together, it was clear that all taxable property within Utah had to be assessed and taxed on a valuation fixed at its actual cash value, or as near such value as was reasonably practicable. As some cooperatives owned property in addition to their lines, while others had little else of value, the effect of the statutes here was to prevent the accurate assessment of property in a given case to its full value. This clearly conflicted with the constitution. Because the statutes were clearly unconstitutional, it was immaterial that they might benefit the public.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff was a resident of Illinois, and defendant was a resident of Utah. Plaintiff recovered a judgment against defendant in Illinois in an action involving defendant's purchase of two horses from plaintiff. Plaintiff claimed &quot;full faith and credit&quot; for the judgment which would preclude any defense upon the merits, but not a challenge to the jurisdiction of the court which entered it. Defendant interposed the latter defense which was sustained by the trial court. On appeal, the court affirmed. The primary question on appeal was whether the transaction involving defendant's purchase of the horses from plaintiff constituted &quot;the transaction of any business&quot; in Illinois within the meaning of paragraphs 16 and 17, Chapter 110, Illinois Revised Statutes, 1955. The court held that the trial court correctly determined that the offer was accepted in Utah and the contract entered into there; and that the correspondence through the mails between the parties plus the incidental activities of having an agent inspect the horses and taking delivery in Illinois did not amount to the &quot;transaction of any business&quot; within the state of Illinois sufficient to meet the requirement of their statute.</SPAN></P>

Defendant argued that &sect; 76-30-7.4 was unconstitutionally discriminatory and improperly gave the prosecutor a choice of whether to charge automobile homicide, a felony, or involuntary manslaughter, a misdemeanor, on identical facts.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant alleged that &sect; 76-30-7.4 unlawfully discriminated against those who by mere chance while driving a vehicle under the influence of intoxicants happened to fatally injure another. He claimed that felony penalties were placed only on those who were unluckier than other drivers under the influence. He also asserted that the prosecutor should not have been given a choice of whether to proceed under a felony for automobile homicide or under a misdemeanor for involuntary manslaughter under the same facts. On appeal, the court held that the legislature's determination of the class under &sect; 76-30-7.4 was not to be disturbed because it applied equally to all members and there was a valid reason for the classification. There was no constitutional prohibition against legislative substitution of an admittedly unlawful status for the required criminal intent in a felony prosecution. Insofar as &sect; 76-30-7.4, which related to automobile homicide, and &sect; 76-30-5, U.C.A. 1953 (Utah), which related to involuntary manslaughter, were irreconcilable, the legislature's latest pronouncement of law under &sect; 76-30-7.4 was controlling in prosecutions under the appropriate facts.</SPAN></P>

He also dealt directly with the public and not under any authority of a licensed dentist. The technician appealed the issuance of an injunction which prevented him from practicing dentistry under Title 58-7-6, Utah Code Annotated 1953, which provided that person who offered or undertook to supply artificial teeth as substitutes for natural teeth were held to be practicing dentistry. The statute exempted those unlicensed persons who performed merely mechanical work upon inert matter in a dental office under the supervision of a licensed and registered dentist. The court held that the statute represented a reasonable exercise of the state's police power because the public interest demanded assurance that the experience of a licensed practitioner control the use of prosthetics from manufacture to mastication, under familiar principles of agency and the police power.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner taxpayer sought review of a sales tax levy made by defendant, the State Tax Commission of Utah, and paid by the taxpayer under protest, on certain personal property, which was claimed to be exempt as an occasional sale of personal property under Titles 59-15-2(e) and 59-15-5, U.C.A. 1953 (Utah).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The sales tax act applied a tax to all sales of personal property generally, but provided an exemption, Title 59-15-2(e), U.C.A. 1953 (Utah), for occasional sales by persons not regularly engaged in business. The exemption, however, excluded the sales of motor vehicles. Title 59-15-5, U.C.A. 1953 (Utah) provided that the sales tax on motor vehicles applied to any sale, not just sales by dealers. The court rejected the taxpayer's first claim, which was that the tax applied only to sales by dealers. An amendment, Title 59-15-6, U.C.A. 1953 (Utah), had made clear that the tax applied to all sales of motor vehicles. The taxpayer claimed, however, that trailers and semi-trailers were not &quot;motor vehicles&quot; and therefore were not subject to the sales tax when transferred by an occasional sale by a non-dealer. The court agreed and ordered that the sales tax paid on such property be refunded. The court looked to the Motor Vehicle Act, Title 41, U.C.A. 1953 (Utah), and adopted the definition of the term &quot;motor vehicle&quot; as used in that act. That law distinguished between self-propelled vehicles and others, and only self-propelled vehicles were considered to be &quot;motor vehicles.&quot;</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court ordered the Tax Commission to refund all taxes paid by the taxpayer on the transfer of trailers and semi-trailers or other equipment not falling within the definition of &quot;motor vehicle&quot; as construed by the court.</SPAN></P>

The Department appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The applicant declined to take the civil engineering examination and informed the Department that he sought registration under &sect; 58-22-12(1)(c) S.L.U. 1955 (Utah), which allowed licensing without examination, under special circumstances, based upon reputation, training, and experience in practical engineering. Before the district court, the applicant also urged that he qualified under &sect; 58-22-22(2) S.L.U. 1955 (Utah), which allowed registration without an examination of persons actively engaged in the practice of engineering in fields which theretofore had not been required to register. On appeal, the court held that the proper standard of review was whether the Department had acted capriciously, arbitrarily, or outside the scope of its authority. On the merits, the court held that the applicant did not satisfy the requirements of either statute. Under &sect; 58-22-12(1)(c) S.L.U. 1955 (Utah), there was no proof that the applicant had been responsible for important engineering work for five years. Under &sect; 58-22-22(2) S.L.U. 1955 (Utah), the applicant could not have been lawfully practicing in the state for four years without being licensed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The lands were granted to the state by the federal government, subject to certain restrictions. The land was sold, in the manner provided by law. Several transfers of the certificate of purchase were made, but not recorded. Before the purchase price was paid in full, an execution was entered against one of the transferees, and the land was sold by the sheriff. The purchaser at the sheriff's sale held the land for over 25 years, taking possession of the land and paying taxes. In the meantime, the partnership, as subsequent transferees, paid to the state the full purchase price and was entitled to a patent from the state, but the state never issued it. The county foreclosed a tax lien on the land, and plaintiff purchased the property from the county. From the date of said purchase, plaintiff was in exclusive, open, adverse possession of the land and had paid all the taxes on it. Such possession exceeded seven years. The court found that the state had no interest in the land. Plaintiff asserted no interest adverse to the state. Neither defendants' failure to demand a patent nor the state's delay in issuing it could defeat plaintiff's claim to title by adverse possession.</SPAN></P>

In addition, under &sect; 13, Article VII of the Utah Constitution, the Examiners were created with the power to examine all claims against the state, except for salaries of state officers fixed by law. The court held that the powers conferred upon the Examiners were general and sweeping. In addition, the court determined that the Examiners were permitted to exercise discretion in the allowance of claims as long as they did not do so arbitrarily. The court further found that pursuant to &sect; 53-3-9, U.C.A. 1953 (Utah), the state superintendent was required to file with the Examiners an itemized account of expenses, including those assessed against the Education.

The titleholder's heirs and successors had not occupied or been in actual possession of the property during that time. The titleholder's heirs and successors conceded that the possessors provided sufficient evidence to establish title by adverse possession under Chapter 19, Laws of Utah for 1951, but that the possessors failed to show payment of all the taxes that had been levied and assessed on the land for a period of four consecutive years before the taxes became delinquent.

The county clerk determined that under Utah Code Ann. &sect; 20-2-14, the Native American was not a resident of Utah because he lived on a reservation. The Native American filed a petition for a writ to compel the county clerk to issue a ballot and permit him to vote, arguing that section 20-2-14 was unconstitutional under the Fifteenth Amendment, the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, and the privileges and immunities clauses of the United States Constitution. The court declined to issue the writ. The court held that Native Americans living on reservation lands were sovereign, having the power to enact constitutions, impose taxes, and enact tribal laws. For those reasons, the court determined that the Native American had little to do with the functioning of the county government. Thus, the court held that the classification between native Americans living on reservations and residents of the county was not arbitrary. Further, the Native American would not be prevented from voting if he lived as a resident within the county and off of reservation lands.</SPAN></P>

The treasurer failed to use that address, or any address, for the owners in mailing out tax notices. Thus, for five years, the owners did not receive a tax bill. The land was sold at a county tax sale to the purchasers, who successfully brought suit to quiet title. The court reversed on appeal. The court held that the treasurer failed to give the notices to the owners required by &sect;&sect; 59-10-9 and 59-10-10, U.C.A.1953, even though the owners' address was available to him. Without notice to the owners, due process prohibited any forfeiture of the land. The court found that the tax forfeiture statutes had to be strictly construed to protect the owners. Negligence on the part of the treasurer or other county officials could not become the basis for a valid tax deed. The court held that the owners had to reimburse the purchasers for the taxes that the purchasers had paid.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, the State of Utah, the State Engineer of the State of Utah, and a contesting irrigation company, appealed a decision of a district court (Utah), which, following a remand, entered its judgment in favor of plaintiff, an applicant irrigation company, in the applicant's suit for approval of applications to change the place of diversion and the place and manner of use of the waters of a river.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The applicant wished to change a place of diversion and to be able to store some water through efficiency changes for future use. The State Engineer rejected the applications, but his decision was reversed. On further appeal of the district court's approval of the applications, the court found mainly in favor of the applicant, and it remanded the case for entry of judgment. The parties submitted their own preferred wordings for a judgment, and the district court chose to write only that the State Engineer should approve the applications that the court had directed, without specifying any additional water rights. On the second appeal, the court reversed and remanded with specific instructions as to how the judgment below should read. The court held that its own determinations of each of the disputed issues should be reflected in the judgment, and to fail to include them was an abuse of discretion. The contesting irrigation company was entitled to an embodiment of the points it had won on appeal.</SPAN></P>

The fact that the store owner was a cautious witness and could not identify some of the stolen merchandise did not render the owner's testimony regarding other items less positive. The jury was justified in finding that defendant and the other acted in concert in committing the crimes. The larceny statute, U.C.A.1953, 76-38-1, did not unconstitutionally place the burden upon defendant to explain satisfactorily the possession of stolen goods.

The trial court entered a judgment in favor of the university, and the state appealed. The court ruled that the language in the state constitution concerning the university was not so clear that it could be said that it created the university as a constitutional corporation completely freed from legislative control. The court reversed the judgment in favor of the university, finding that long acquiescence by the people in legislative or judicial construction of constitutional provisions was entitled to great weight with the courts and that the university by its counsel had in the past adopted a position which recognized legislative control.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decedent, a single woman of somewhat diminished capacity, executed a will and two codicils, which left the vast majority of her estate to her two confidential advisors and left very little to her older sister and sole heir. The sister contested the will and the codicils. The trial court found in favor of the sister and held that the decedent lacked testamentary capacity and was acting under the fraud and undue influence of her advisors. On appeal, the court affirmed in part and reversed in part. The court held that: (1) although the decedent's mental capacity was below that of the normal adult, she was able to remember the natural objects of her bounty, recall her property, and dispose of it understandingly; (2) the finding of the trial court that the decedent lacked testamentary capacity was unreasonable; (3) the presumption of fraud that arose from a bequest to a confidential advisor shifted the burden onto the adviser of persuading the fact finder, by a preponderance of the evidence, that no fraud or undue influence was exerted; and (4) the finding of the trial court that the bequests to the decedent's advisors were induced by fraud and undue influence was affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court (1) affirmed the decision of the trial court, to the effect that the bequests to the confidential advisors were null and void for fraud and undue influence, and (2) remanded the case with directions that the findings and decree be corrected in accordance with the views expressed by the court.

Defendants were other members of the same redistricting committee, as well as other public officials concerned with the operation of the committee.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Since Utah had achieved statehood, its legislative apportionment had not been done on the basis purely of population. The apportionment created by the 1955 legislature at Laws Utah 1955, c. 61, U.C.A.1953, 36-1-1 through 36-1-4, provided, among other things, that representation in the state senate would be on the basis of one senator for the first 19,000 inhabitants, or major fraction thereof, with an additional senator for each additional 55,000 inhabitants or major fraction thereof residing in the senatorial district. Plaintiffs brought this declaratory judgment action to determine whether the law violated Article IX, &sect; 2, of the Constitution of Utah. The court determined that the law did not violate the constitution and was valid. The court held that the law represented a bona fide attempt to carry out the mandate of Article IX, &sect; 2. The court noted that &sect; 2 said nothing about representation having to be &quot;equal&quot; or &quot;in direct proportion&quot; to the population, or limiting it to a single ratio. The double ratio scheme of the 1955 reapportionment was not so extreme as to be an attempt to avoid the principle of representation based on population. Perfect representation was impossible.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Secretary sent notice of its hearing to revoke the corporation's charter to four of the eight men listed as officers and directors of the corporation. The corporation argued that the Secretary had no jurisdiction to act and was acting under an unconstitutional statute. On appeal, the court determined that tested by the fair play theory of due process, the corporation did receive actual notice, appeared at the hearing, and was afforded the opportunity to defend against the charges brought against it. The corporation chose to argue only the question of the sufficiency of notice. As a result, the corporation could not, on appeal, complain that it was hampered in any of the proceedings by lack of knowledge on its part or fairness on the part of the hearing officer. In addition, it had previously been determined that U.C.A.1953, 16-6-13 (Utah) was not unconstitutional as conferring judicial power upon the Secretary. Finally, the provisions for revocation of the corporation's charter did not amount to special legislation prohibited by art.

The court found that the information met the requirements of Section 77-21-8, U.C.A. 1953, and did not violate the Utah Constitution. The information charged defendants with having committed a crime, known to the law, and it stated the act which defendants did constituting that crime.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff optical company sought a declaratory judgment that an ordinance of defendant city that prohibited price advertising of eyeglasses was unconstitutional. The trial court (Utah) declared that the part of the ordinance that prohibited price advertising was unconstitutional and permanently enjoined the enforcement of that portion of the ordinance. The city appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The optical company sold eyeglasses to its customers based on prescriptions from licensed doctors and eye specialists. The optical company advertised a uniform price for eyeglasses in the local newspapers. The optical company attacked the city ordinance prohibiting any advertising of eyeglasses as ultra vires the powers of the city and an unwarranted infringement of constitutionally guaranteed rights that went beyond the city's proper exercise of its police power. The powers relied on by the city in enacting the ordinance were the expressly delegated powers to license, tax, and regulate the business conducted by merchants to preserve the safety, health, and morals of the city. The court held that the city failed to offer any evidence to show any relationship between advertisements of eyewear and public health. The court found that the ordinance constituted an impermissible limitation upon the optical company's constitutional rights of freedom of speech and a freedom to publish notices of the company's willingness to dispose of its property. The court found no justifiable purpose for the prohibition of advertising of eyewear.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to their religion, the parents encouraged their children to practice polygamy, which some did. The parents claimed that they had a constitutional right to practice their religion. The court affirmed the decision to deprive the parents of control and custody of the children under Utah Code Ann. &sect; 55-10-32 due to neglect because of their encouragement to practice polygamy, which was illegal under Utah Code Ann. &sect; 30-1-2 (1953). The court found that the parents failed to raise the children with the proper moral upbringing given their encouragement to violate state law. There was no violation of the parents' freedom of religion under Utah Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 1, 4, 15 because the parents' actions were not merely beliefs and U.S. Const. amend. I only applied to Congress. Also, because Utah Const. art. III prohibited polygamy, the Utah Constitution could not have protected polygamy as a free exercise of religion. The parents received due process of law through the trial court hearings and the state complied with the dependency law. Because the parents refused not to cohabitate as polygamists, the removal of the children was proper under Utah Code Ann. &sect; 35-10-30.</SPAN></P>

An auditor's deed was issued to the county for a failure to pay delinquent taxes, and the county deeded its interest to plaintiffs' predecessor in interest. Defendants claimed that plaintiffs failed had no valid title, that plaintiffs failed to plead the statute of limitations, chapter 19, &sect; 104-2-5 Laws of Utah 1951, and that the statute of limitations was unconstitutional. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's judgment. Section 104-2-5 generally required that an action brought against the holder of a tax title must be brought within four years after the date of the tax deed. Rule 8(c) Utah Rules of Civil Procedure required statutes of limitation to be pleaded. The only pleading plaintiff could have pleaded the statute of limitations was in a reply, which were generally unauthorized by Rule 7(a) Utah Rules of Civil Procedure. The court found that plaintiff sufficiently asserted the statute of limitations, although it was not raised in a pleading, and that &sect; 104-2-5 was constitutional and that it prohibited defendants from challenging the tax title.</SPAN></P>

The employer claimed that were it not for Test (C) in U.C.A.1953, 35-4-22(j)(5)(C) of the Utah Employment Security Act, the persons giving service in his business would not be covered by the Act and would not be liable for contributions. The employer further argued that Test (C) was unconstitutional by creating an unreasonable classification, resulting in a failure of uniform application of the general law. On appeal, the court held that the purposes of the Act were reasonably served by the distinction between individuals in the same work for the same employer drawn by Test (C). The court reasoned that the primary objective of such an act was to provide protection for employees and that it was not the direct or primary purpose of such legislation to control or regulate the relationship of employer and employee.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The depositor filed an action against the county clerk and the surety for the recovery of a cash bail bond deposited for a criminal defendant.

The trial court granted the motion to dismiss. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded the case. The court held that the depositor's complaint clearly afforded fair notice of the nature and basis of the claim asserted and a general indication of the type of litigation involved. It informed the county clerk and the surety that the depositor was filing an action to recover the money that he deposited with the county clerk, which he alleged that he was entitled to after dismissal of the criminal charge. Also, it did not appear to a certainty from the complaint that the depositor would not be entitled to relief under any state of facts that could be proved in support of the claim.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff landlord sued defendant tenant to recover rent and damages resulting from defendant's abandonment of its lease before it expired. The trial court awarded damages to plaintiff, but plaintiff appealed, claiming that the award was insufficient. Defendant cross-appealed, challenging the propriety of awarding any damages. On appeal, the court affirmed, but modified the portion of the judgment awarding repair damages, since there was no evidence of the value of repairs. The court upheld the trial court's finding that plaintiff surrendered and accepted the property four months after defendant vacated the premises, due to plaintiff's authorization of a company's furniture storage on the premises free of rent for eight months without notice to defendant. The court found that this action constituted a sufficient exercise of dominion over the premises to the exclusion of defendant.

The court held that the city could acquire, develop, own, control and manage such surplus water as was necessary to the present and anticipated future needs of the city. The court found that the city could sell and distribute such surplus beyond its corporate limits and could construct, own and operate such pipelines, equipment and facilities outside of the city limits as were necessary for these purposes. In performing all these functions, the court found that the city was not subject to the jurisdiction or regulation of the Public Service Commission.

The intermediate appellate court remanded, and the case was transferred back to state trial court where a jury rendered a verdict of no cause of action. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that the movie showing was not for &quot;purposes of trade&quot; as denounced by the statute. The court rejected the intermediate appellate court's distinction between informational publications as contrasted with fictional publications, and it interpreted the statute as intending only to prohibit the use of names, portraits, or pictures in connection with advertising or the promotion of the sale of collateral items.

The court recalled the writ and dismissed the petition.

The legislature passed a statute that raised the excise tax on cigarettes and allocated the revenue from the tax to the school fund.

He contended that the statute was not within the purview of the special session and thus was unconstitutional. The Commission filed a petition for a writ to compel the auditor to comply with its requisition request. The court granted the petition. Utah Const. &sect; 6, Art. VII permitted the governor to call a special session of the legislature. Under this provision, the legislature was not permitted to transact any business except that for which it was convened. Here, the governor called a special session to discuss school financing. Although the governor recommended a financing plan, he realized that it was up to the legislature to find a means of providing the money. The legislature adopted the tax to help relieve the financial distress of the school system. Thus, its action was within the purview of the special session.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed the judgment and remanded for a new trial. The trustees were not entitled to interest on the judgment prior to the time when actual possession was taken. Under Utah Code Ann. &sect; 78-34-11 (1953), as to property that is actually taken, interest on the award is allowed only from the date of the actual taking and not from the service of summons.Failure to allow such interest was not unconstitutional. The trial court erred in excluding evidence on direct examination and cross-examination of the purchase price paid in recent sales of property similar to parts of the trustees' property. The trial court also erred in excluding the trustees' opinion evidence on the value of their waterworks system. The trial court did not err in dividing the property into only two parcels instead of six requested by the trustees. The trustees' argument that where land is platted into residential lots each lot constitutes as a matter of law a separate parcel, is meritless because Parcel I, which is the same as their proposed Parcel I, contained all of the platted residential lots.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The principal's brother was a member of the school board. He did not participate when the school board extended the principal's employment contract. After seeking an opinion from the superintendent as to the affect of the anti-nepotism statute, the school board notified the principal that it could not employ him for the sole reason of the alleged statutory prohibition. His action against the superintendent was consolidated with that of a teacher who faced the same situation. The court held that the statute was unreasonable and arbitrary. It violated the principal's constitutionally guaranteed liberty of the right to work, and deprived him of property without due process of law. A property right existed in the agreement for the principal's continued employment and in retirement benefits that he would have lost if his employment was not continued. The statute prohibited employees from continuing their employment solely because of a relationship where the relative did nothing to appoint or retain, nor had any power of supervision or control over the employee. This retroactive effect was an unlawful infringement upon rights guaranteed under the constitution.</SPAN></P>

When the district court denied any recovery, plaintiff appealed, but the court affirmed. First, it affirmed that the bonds were void under article XIV, &sect; 3, concluding that because the city's revenues for the year of issue were insufficient to cover the debt thereby created, the issuance of the bonds had violated article XIV, &sect; 3. Second, because it was inconsistent with current law on the issue, the court reversed Muir v. Murray City, 55 Utah 368 (1919), the case on which plaintiff relied in claiming that the bonds were valid. While declining to determine whether the bonds were also invalid under article XIV, &sect; 4, the court denied recovery on theories of negligence or on the theory of money had and received because the protection afforded to taxpayers by article XIV, &sect; 3 was absolute and could not be circumvented by the use of a different theory of recovery to obtain payment of the bonds.</SPAN></P>

The court denied a peremptory writ of prohibition and recalled an alternative writ, choosing not to extend the &quot;special restricted fund theory&quot; to obligations assumed by state institutions.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowner owned land that was located in a potential commercial or industrial area but the land was established as a residential district. The city refused a request to rezone the land. The complaint alleged that the land was unsuitable for residential property and that the value of the property would have been greatly enhanced if it could have been used for commercial purposes. The landowner argued that, under those circumstances, the zoning ordinance was so oppressive as to be confiscatory and unlawful. The sole issue was whether the landowner stated a claim that entitled him to relief under Utah R. Civ. P. 8 (1950). On review, the court had to affirm. The discretionary power to district and zone cities was granted by stature. The nature and boundaries of the district were matters that lay in the discretion of the city authorities, and the court could have set it aside only if their action was confiscatory, discriminatory, or arbitrary. The fact that the landowner's property had become unsuited for residential purposes or might have been more properly used did not show discrimination or reveal arbitrary action.</SPAN></P>

The court stated that a statute that either forbade or required the doing of an act in terms so vague that men of common intelligence must necessarily guess at its meaning and differ as to its application violated the first essential of due process of law. The court noted that in regard to a vagueness challenge, the test a statute was required to meet to be valid was that it had to be sufficiently definite (a) to inform persons of ordinary intelligence, who would be law abiding, what their conduct had to be to conform to its requirements; (b) to advise a defendant accused of violating it just what constituted the offense with which he was charged; and (c) to be susceptible of uniform interpretation and application by those charged with responsibility of applying and enforcing it.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff appealed a judgment of the Second Judicial District Court, Weber County (Utah), which held valid an ordinance of defendant city that made the registered owner of a car prima facie liable for parking violations committed with that car.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff was held liable for violation of a city ordinance when a car registered in his name was found illegally parked. Plaintiff sought a declaration that the ordinance was invalid, and the trial court granted judgment to the city. Plaintiff appealed. On appeal the court held that the city had no power to pass the ordinance in question, which made the registered owner of a car prima facie responsible for parking violations, because there was no express or implied statutory grant of such power to the city.</SPAN></P>
