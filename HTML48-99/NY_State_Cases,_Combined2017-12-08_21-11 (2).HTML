Civ. Prac. Act &sect; 113 and granted a cross motion for summary judgment dismissing the complaint filed by defendants, a city and its planning commission. The developer filed an action to recover money paid pursuant to allegedly illegal, null, and void Scarsdale, N.Y., Village Code &sect; 179-1.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The developer applied for approval of a subdivision plan. The commission approved the plan, subject to the requirement that the developer deposit with the village a sum for each lot in the subdivision, to be used for park, playground and recreational facilities, in lieu of any land dedication for park, playground and recreational purposes, as provided in &sect; 179-1. The trial court held that even if &sect; 179-1 was illegal the developer was barred from asserting a claim for a refund because of its failure to formally protest the payment or to otherwise indicate that the payment was being made involuntarily. The court held that: (1) &sect; 179-1 was unconstitutional in that it required the payment of a certain sum per lot in a proposed subdivision in lieu of a reservation or dedication of land; (2) the illegal exaction could not be required to be paid by the developer in order to engage in its business of developing land for residential use; and (3) the developer was not estopped from recovering that which was paid under a mistake of law, N.Y.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, the Clerk of the Court of Appeals of the State of New York, sought review of a decision by the Supreme Court at Special Term (New York), which denied a motion by the clerk to dismiss plaintiff attorney's amended complaint and granted summary judgment in favor of the attorney in his action to have &sect; 467-a of the New York Judiciary Law declared constitutionally invalid. The attorney filed a cross appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Section 467-a required all attorneys admitted to practice in the state as of a certain date to register with the clerk and pay a registration fee. On appeal, the court held the statute to be constitutionally valid. The court noted that it was not in a position to weigh the legislature's wisdom for the manner in which it chose to deal with the registration of the attorneys in the state. The court held that the time classification that was the basis of the statute was not unreasonable or arbitrary and, therefore, did violate equal protection or due process. The court also held that the statute did not violate N.Y. Const. art. III, &sect; 22 because that provision only related to general taxes and not to license fees. The court finally held that the statute did not diminish the compensation of judges in violation of art. VI, &sect; 25 because the judges were being treated in their capacities as attorneys.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed and dismissed the attorney's amended complaint to declare the statute requiring a license fee constitutionally invalid.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Attorneys -- registration -- </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">statute</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Judiciary Law, &sect; 467</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">-a</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">) requiring attorneys admitted to practice of law on September 1, 1963 to file certificate of registration and pay $ 15 fee is not </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.  Section 467-a of the Judiciary Law (L. 1963, ch. 204, &sect; 74) provides that: &quot;Every attorney and counsellor-at-law duly licensed and admitted to practice law in this state on the first day of September, nineteen hundred sixty-three, shall, on or before the first day of January, nineteen hundred sixty-four, file with the clerk of the court of appeals a certificate of&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  registration upon a form which shall be furnished by the clerk, upon application therefor.  A fee of fifteen dollars shall accompany the certificate of registration when it is transmitted to the clerk of the court of appeals for filing.&quot; This statute is not in violation of the Constitution of the United States or the Constitution of the State of New York.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The State has the power to impose a license fee on attorneys as a police regulation or as a revenue measure. ( </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Adlerstein </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">v.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11"> City of New York</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 6 N Y 2d 740, distinguished.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The enactment of this statute was a reasonable exercise of the Legislature's power in response to the need for an up-to-date official register of attorneys in order to prevent the unauthorized practice of law.  It is not violative of due process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. That there is no provision in the statute for keeping the list up-to-date may be a legitimate subject for appropriate legislation in the future, but is no ground for invalidating the statute.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. The enactment is entitled to a presumption of constitutionality.  The classification by the Legislature rests upon a reasonable basis and is not violative of the equal protection provision of the Constitution. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Legislature, at this time, chose the simplest means of taking a census or roll call of attorneys presently admitted to practice. The time classification made by the statute is appropriate for that purpose.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. The provision of the State Constitution (N. Y. Const. art. III, &sect; 22) which reads: &quot;Every law which imposes, continues or revives a tax shall distinctly state the tax and the object to which it is to be applied&quot; refers only to general taxes levied for the general purposes of the State, and not to taxes in the nature of license fees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. The statute does not diminish the compensation of Judges in violation of the State Constitution (art. VI, &sect; 25).  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the court held that the N.Y. Decedent Estate Law &sect; 17 was enacted in accordance with the sound public policy in favor of restricting testamentary dispositions to benevolent, charitable, or religious institutions where a testator was survived by a husband, wife, child, descendant, or parent. The court affirmed the trial court's decision that &sect; 17 required that any gifts to respondents exceeding one-half of the testator's gross estate, less debts, must pass under intestate property laws to the daughters. The court held that the alleged failure of the daughters to perform their filial duties toward their father did not constitute an act of waiver. The court also held that the statute in question was not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's judgment that the daughters were entitled to a statutory share of their father's estate.</SPAN></P>

The trial court dismissed their petition. On appeal, the court noted that the education commissioner had acted pursuant to a state master plan for school reorganization, which made certain economic incentives available to those districts that cooperated with the reorganization plan. The plan also allowed the education commissioner to withhold building aid from school districts that did not cooperate with the reorganization plan on the basis that it would impede reorganization. In this case, the taxpayers and board of education members were part of a school district that had rejected reorganization. The court found that the taxpayers and board of education members had failed to show that the education commissioner's decision to deny building aid was arbitrary or capricious or that it amounted to unconstitutional discrimination.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, town and town board acting on behalf of water districts it administered, sought review of a decision of the Supreme Court in Dutchess County (New York), which rejected plaintiffs' claims against defendant city arising out of the city's decision to increase the price for water it sold and delivered to water districts outside the city's territorial boundaries.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">For many years plaintiffs' water districts had purchased water from the city at a fixed rate. Without notice to plaintiffs, the city increased the water rates. Plaintiffs brought suit claiming that the lack of notice deprived them of property without due process in that they lost the opportunity to be heard with respect to the propriety and validity of the increase and because they had not been able incorporate the increase into their budgeting process. The trial court ruled in favor of the city. On appeal the court reached the same conclusion on the merits but reversed due to the trial court's failure to render its judgment in proper form. The court found nothing in the city's charter nor any other statute which imposed a duty on the city to give water purchasers notice or an opportunity to be heard before increasing water rates. The court further found that, with the possible exception of a reduced rate charged to a university and a hospital, it was not unjust for the city to discriminate by charging lower rates to large industrial users and, even if the city had granted improper preferences, this was not relevant to a dispute between plaintiffs and the city.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment and order of the supreme court for the city and directed that judgment be entered declaring that the city's resolution was not unconstitutional and that the town was obligated to pay the city the increased rate for all water purchased and delivered after the effective date of the rate increase.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Waters and watercourses -- water supply -- water rates -- defendant city, which has been selling and delivering water to water districts in surrounding area, was not required to give plaintiff Town Board or water district prior notice of intention to increase rates and opportunity to be heard -- no charter or statutory provisions requiring such notice or opportunity -- not unjust discrimination for city to prescribe lower rates for large quantity industrial consumers outside city -- no adjudication made on question whether city had power to grant preferential rate to college and hospital -- consumer may not refuse to pay water bill because preferential rate given to others -- while plaintiffs not entitled to declaratory judgment, complaint not dismissed, but judgment should declare parties' rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. For many years defendant city has been selling and delivering water to water districts in the surrounding area.  The rates had&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  been fixed in 1919.  In 1961, when defendant city increased the rates, it was not required to give prior notice and an opportunity to be heard to plaintiff Town Board or the water districts it administers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Neither the charter of the defendant city nor the provisions of any statute made it part of the city's rate-fixing procedure that purchasers of water should be given such notice or opportunity to be heard.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The charter provisions enabling the city to establish water rates are not rendered invalid because of the absence of such requirements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. While the arrangements under which the water was furnished to the water districts were not formal, they were contractual.  Purchasers are presumed to know that the rates may lawfully be changed without notice and without an opportunity to be heard.  They contract to purchase water according to the quantity consumed by them and to pay the prevailing rates in existence during the period of consumption.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. It is not unjust discrimination for defendant city to prescribe lower rates for large quantity industrial consumers outside the city.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. While the city was without power to grant a preferential rate to a college and a hospital in the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  absence of statutory authority, no adjudication should be made here on that question, particularly where the institutions are not parties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. A consumer may not refuse to pay a water bill because a preferential rate has been given to other purchasers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. While, in this action for a declaratory judgment, plaintiffs are not entitled to a declaration in their favor, the complaint should not have been dismissed.  The judgment should declare the rights and other legal relationships of the parties.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant council members challenged the decision of the Supreme Court, Nassau County (New York), which sustained the petition of respondent board members. The board members' petition sought to declare invalid a resolution of the council terminating the board members' terms of office and for related injunctive relief. The petition was sustained because the resolution was found to have been in direct conflict with N.Y. Gen. City Law &sect; 81.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that no questions of fact were presented or considered. The court assumed, without deciding, that the trial court was correct in holding that the city's building zone ordinance was inconsistent with &sect; 81. Nevertheless, the court held that the trial court erred in holding that the invalidity of a portion of the ordinance also invalidated the commencement date fixed for the terms of office of the board members. The court held that the question was whether the legislature, if partial invalidity had been foreseen, would have wished the statute to have been enforced with the invalid part rejected altogether. The court reasoned that the inclusion of a separability clause raised a presumption that the legislature intended the act to have been divisible. The court concluded that the portion of the ordinance that established a commencement date for the terms of office of board members was separable from the invalid portion of the ordinance. Therefore, the court held that the commencement portion of the ordinance was valid.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, 17 applicants that took a civil service competitive promotional examination for the post of deputy clerk or assistant deputy clerk of the supreme court, sought review of the decision of the Supreme Court, Albany County (New York), which dismissed their N.Y. C.P.L.R. art. 78 proceeding against respondents, Civil Service Commission members, to obtain credit for an answer given on the examination.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The applicants' answers were marked incorrect on one question involving whether the trial court could direct the jury in a criminal proceeding to be discharged before the case was submitted to them if it appeared from testimony that: (1) The facts proved constituted a crime of a higher nature than that charged in the indictment; (2) The court did not have jurisdiction of the crime charged in the indictment; or (3) The facts as charged in the indictment did not constitute a crime. The applicants marked that all three applied. The dispute centered on whether (1) was correct. The court affirmed, finding that while N.Y. Code Crim. Proc. &sect; 400 supported (1), it had been declared unconstitutional on the ground that it exposed defendants to double jeopardy. The applicants contended that the answers were to be based only on statutory law. The court found that it was implicit from the directions that the questions were not based solely on statutory law. The court found that N.Y. Code Crim. Proc. &sect; 260 was based on a narrow exception to the law and did not apply to the question. Thus, the correct answer was (2) and (3).</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, a village, its mayor, and its trustees, appealed from a judgment of the Supreme Court, Nassau County (New York), which, inter alia, declared a village zoning ordinance unconstitutional and void insofar as it affected plaintiff owner's property, in the owner's action challenging the constitutionality of the zoning ordinance. The owner cross-appealed from so much of the judgment as limited the owner's recovery of damages to $ 50,000.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner filed an action to declare void and unconstitutional the zoning ordinance enacted by the village on February 9, 1926, insofar as it affected the owner's property, and for other relief. The ordinance limited development on the property to detached one-family dwellings. On review of the trial court's decision declaring the ordinance unconstitutional, the court noted that the ordinance at issue had been declared invalid in a 1931 decision with respect to a vacant parcel of comparable property situated near the owner's property. The record in the instant case supported the trial court judge's view that the continued development and utilization of properties in the vicinity for apartment houses and other commercial uses made the sale of residences in this area as economically unfeasible for the instant owner as it was in 1931. Thus, the continued application of the would have destroyed the greater part of the value of the subject property and precluded the owner from other proper uses to which the property was reasonably adapted. Also, the trial court did not err in limiting the village's liability for damages by reason of the appeal to $ 50, 000.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant board appealed an order of the Supreme Court, New York County (New York), which ruled in favor of plaintiff tattoo operators in an action for declaratory judgment declaring New York City, N.Y., Health Code &sect; 181.15 unconstitutional and enjoining the board from enforcing it.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The tattoo operators sought a declaratory judgment declaring New York City, N.Y., Health Code &sect; 181.15 unconstitutional and enjoining the board from enforcing it. The section made it unlawful for any person to tattoo a human being. An exception was made for physicians acting for medical purposes. The operators argued that tattooing was a vocation that could be regulated but not prohibited. The court reversed the trial court and held that the record showed that the prohibition of lay tattooing was an advisable procedure for the security of life and health and that the control of tattooing came well within the field of securing the health of the community. The court determined that it was not the operators who were on trial but the trade they engaged in, and because the practices of the trade endangered the community, they had to suffer the same fate despite their ability to rise above their fellow practitioners.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment that had held in favor of the tattoo operators in their action seeking a declaration that the health code section that barred tattooing was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Health -- tattooing -- regulation forbidding tattooing except by doctors is valid exercise of police power against hepatitis -- immaterial that plaintiffs are willing to meet sanitary standards; health regulation is directed against practices of entire trade -- exception for doctors is valid, and anyway is separable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Section 181.15, as amended, of the New York City Health Code, which makes it unlawful to tattoo a human being except for medical purposes by doctors, is authorized by the New York City Charter (&sect; 558), and is a valid exercise of the police power. The record shows that hepatitis is a serious disease, that there is no known cure, that it is transmitted by injection of the blood products of infected persons, that such transmissions occur&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  seven times more frequently to persons who have been tattooed than to other persons, that tattooing is often associated with a morbid or abnormal personality, and that it is too much to expect that nonmedical personnel will adhere to sanitary practices needed to provide a reasonable assurance against transmitting infection. There is no constitutional prohibition against outright banning of a practice which is harmful to public health.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. It is immaterial that the two plaintiffs in this action are able and willing to meet sanitary standards.  They are not individually on trial.  The health regulation is directed against the practices of the entire trade.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from the order of the Court of General Sessions, County of New York (New York), which denied his motion for a writ of error coram nobis. Defendant filed the motion seeking a remedy under an amendment to N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 1943 (1964). Almost 30 years previously, he was convicted of robbery in the first degree and sentenced as a multiple felony offender.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of robbery in the first degree. He was sentenced as a multiple felony offender based on prior felony convictions in Pennsylvania. He attacked the sentence on the grounds that the Pennsylvania convictions did not constitute felonies under New York law and that they were unconstitutional. The trial court denied a writ of error coram nobis. Affirming, the court found that it was not the proper remedy under the amendment to &sect; 1943. The court concluded that the statute had a retrospective application and a defendant could challenge the unconstitutionality of predicated convictions when he or she was arraigned as a multiple offender. The court concluded that the proper remedy for a sentencing challenge under the amended statute was a motion for resentencing.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court, which denied a writ of error coram nobis, without prejudice to a motion for resentence.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  1. When the present proceeding was instituted, there was no available State remedy to correct a multiple offender sentence predicated upon out-of-State convictions rendered in violation of the constitutional right to counsel. Chapter 446 of the Laws of 1964 amends section 1943 of the Penal Law to provide that, upon arraignment of a defendant as a multiple offender, he may raise the unconstitutionality of any prior conviction relied upon whether rendered in or out of the State.  This statute which now provides a State remedy, on sentence, for challenge of prior convictions on the ground that they were rendered in violation of constitutional limitations, should be given retrospective effect.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.

The order denying the application in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">coram nobis</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is without prejudice to a motion for resentence on the same grounds presented in the petition, but such an application should consist of more than conclusory allegations and should recite the facts, supported by available affidavits and records from Pennsylvania.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State appealed from the order of the Chautauqua County Court (New York) that transferred to the family court defendant's trial on the charge of assault in the second degree.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An indictment was filed against defendant, which charged him with assault in the second degree based upon allegations that he cut his wife's face with a razor blade. Upon arraignment in the county court, defendant filed a motion for an order to transfer the proceeding to the family court. The county court granted the motion, and the case was transferred. The State appealed, urging that the family court had no felony jurisdiction, that the county court had no authority to transfer the proceeding to family court, and that the family court could not divest the grand jury of its constitutional power to indict defendant for the alleged felony. The court dismissed the State's appeal on the ground that the county court's order was not a final, appealable order. The court also held that defendant's indictment was not valid because the procedures contained in the Family Court Act were not followed. The court stated that after defendant's surrender to the police, the case should have been transferred to the family court because N.Y. Const. art. VI, &sect; 13, subd. 13 required that proceedings arising from crimes and offenses between spouses originate in the family court.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court dismissed the State's appeal from the order of the county court that transferred to the family court defendant's trial on the charge of second-degree assault.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Courts -- Family Court -- jurisdiction -- order of County Court granting motion to transfer proceeding to Family Court is not appealable to Appellate Division -- however, County Court had authority to transfer proceeding to Family Court -- proceedings involving crimes between spouses should originate in Family Court but provision has been made for transfer of proceedings commenced in another court -- fact that defendant had purportedly been &quot;indicted&quot; would not exclude right to transfer -- District Attorney was without power to obtain indictment -- procedure authorized by Family Court Act is not in conflict with constitutional powers of Grand Jury to indict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. An order of the County Court granting a motion to transfer a proceeding to Family Court is not appealable to the Appellate Division.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The County Court did have authority to transfer the proceeding to the Family Court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Subdivision b of section 13 of article VI of the New York State Constitution provides that the Family&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Court shall have jurisdiction of crimes between spouses and that they &quot;shall be originated in * * * family court&quot;.  Under article 8 of the Family Court Act, the Family Court is given &quot;exclusive original jurisdiction over any proceeding concerning acts which would constitute disorderly conduct or an assault between spouses&quot; (&sect; 812).  While it is intended that proceedings arising because of such acts be originated by the filing of a petition with the Family Court and that there be resort to the procedures of that court in the first instance (&sect;&sect; 114, 821-827), provision is made in section 813 for the transfer of cases should they be commenced in another court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. In the present case the procedures established by the Family Court Act were not followed.  The matter should have been transferred to Family Court at the time of the arraignment. Nevertheless, defendant was purportedly indicted in Supreme Court.  Thereafter the proceeding was transferred to County Court, and it was not until arraignment in County Court that the transfer to Family Court was ordered.  There is, however, specific authority for the transfer to Family Court at this stage of the proceedings (N. Y. Const., art. VI, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &sect; 19, subd. b).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. The fact that defendant was &quot;indicted&quot; would not exclude the right to transfer.  To prevent a transfer there must be a valid indictment. The Legislature has, as authorized by section 13 (subd. b), determined that an assault between spouses shall not be brought within the category of crimes until and unless a Family Court Judge, having decided that the processes and remedies of his court are inappropriate, has transferred the proceeding to the appropriate court for criminal proceedings.  Then the right to indict may arise for the first time.  The District Attorney's determination to obtain an indictment was beyond his powers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. The procedure authorized by the Family Court Act is not in conflict with the constitutional powers of a Grand Jury to indict. </SPAN></P>

The single act statute does not require the cause of action to arise in New York and so the occurrence of the harm in Connecticut was incidental.

The court held that the city criminal court had jurisdiction over crimes and violations of the law other than those to be prosecuted by indictment. The chief clerk of the court or his designated assistant clerks were authorized to certify the minutes of the city criminal court. N.Y. Code Crim.

The lower court denied them the preliminary injunction, and denied defendants' cross motions for dismissal of the complaint. On appeal, defendants claimed the complaint failed to state a cause of action, and that the court had no jurisdiction of the subject matter. The court concluded that the action was not the proper vehicle. Defendant public officials had no contracts with defendant unions. The contracts were with private firms, none of whom were parties defendant. Defendant unions were also not parties to the contracts in controversy and there was a fatal deficiency of parties defendant. The relief sought by respondents, of judicial supervision of union activities in the manner requested, was not within the scope of judicial competence.

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. In this class action in equity by four Negroes who are citizens of the United States and residents of the State of New York, plaintiffs allege that the defendant unions exercise a practical monopoly of skilled crafts in the construction industry and that said unions maintain discriminatory practices which bar plaintiffs and the class which plaintiffs represent from admittance to their apprentice training programs and memberships and consequently from employment, and that public moneys are being expended on five such construction contracts by the City of New York and on one such contract by the State of New York; wherefore plaintiffs seek (1) a judgment declaring their rights (under N.

I, &sect; 11; Executive Law, &sect; 296; Penal Law, &sect; 700; and other statutes) and (2) to enjoin said unions from requiring applicants for admittance to have sponsors among current or former members, to enjoin said unions from using their present lists of applicants discriminatorily&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  obtained and used, to direct said unions to destroy said lists, and to direct said unions, under the supervision of the court, to adopt and use fair tests for admittance to their apprentice training programs; and (3) to enjoin the Governor, the Comptroller, and the Industrial Commissioner of the State of New York from expending public moneys on said State contract and to direct these defendants to enforce the Civil Rights Law ( &sect;&sect; 43, 45) and the Labor Law ( &sect; 220-e) as to such contract; and (4) to enjoin the Mayor and other officials of the City of New York (under General Municipal Law, &sect; 51) from expending public moneys on said city contracts and on any such new contracts, and to direct said city officials to enforce the provisions of the Administrative Code of the City of New York (&sect; 343-8.0) as to said contracts.

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The unions are not parties to the contracts, and the contractors are not joined as parties defendant.

Plaintiffs' grievances are not within the sole jurisdiction of the State Commission for Human Rights; and particularly not when no proceeding is pending before the commission (Executive Law, &sect; 300).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent board of education appealed from a judgment of the Supreme Court at Special Term, Kings County (New York), which granted judgment in favor of petitioner parents and annulled a new school zone adopted by the board. The parents of white children living in the disputed area who were scheduled to go to the new school had sought review of the board's determination fixing the zone for that new school.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The issue was whether the board had the power to draw the zoning lines in a newly established junior high school so as to prevent segregation within that school at its inception. The lower court held that the board had no such power and that its inclusion of racial balance as a material basis for the board's determination rendered it unlawful under N.Y. Educ. Law &sect; 3201.The court reversed and held that, in drawing attendance lines for a school, it was not only within the power of the board to take into consideration the ethnic composition of the children, but that it was the board's responsibility so to do in order to prevent the creation of a segregated public school. The board had the power to establish school attendance zones; to determine the area that a particular school should serve; and to require the students in that area to attend that school. Moreover, &sect; 3201 was not violated because none of the white children at issue had been excluded from the school because of their race. In addition, the other criteria utilized by the board furnished ample support for the zone, such as easy access from all parts of the zone and the central location of the school within the zone.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment of the lower court annulling the new school zone adopted by the board and dismissed the parents' petition.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Schools -- zoning lines -- integration -- Board of Education of City of New York had power to draw zoning lines with respect to attendance of children in newly established junior high school to prevent segregation in school -- board had right to consider question of race or color as criterion in determining zone and did not violate constitutional or statutory rights of petitioners ( </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Brown v.

Board of Educ., </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">349 U.S. 249;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Education Law, &sect; 3201</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">) -- board also properly considered distance from home to school, utilization of school space, convenience of transportation, topographic barriers and continuity of instruction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The Board of Education of&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the City of New York has the power to draw zoning lines with respect to the attendance of children in a newly established junior high school so as to prevent segregation within that school at its inception.  The zone as fixed by the board for the new J. H.  S. 275 in the Borough of Brooklyn was proper and lawful.  In drawing attendance lines for a school, it is not only within the power of the board to take into consideration the ethnic composition of the children therein but, under the decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States, it is the board's responsibility so to do in order to prevent the creation of a segregated public school.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The Assistant Superintendent of Schools, in charge of the school district involved, in February, 1962 proposed a zone which (a) was geographically irregular, (b) placed the school in the approximate corner of a peculiarly shaped area, remote from the zone's northern area, and (c) would result in a school population consisting of 14% white, 52% Negro, and 34% Puerto Rican.  The board modified the plan by cutting off the northern area and permitting it to remain in the zone for the existing J. H. S. 263 and shifting the easterly and southwesterly&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  boundaries.  The effect of this shift was to transfer and place within the zone for the new J. H. S. 275 a 12-block area which is the subject of this proceeding.  As a result of the change, the children expected to attend J. H. S. 275 as of September, 1963 would initially consist of 35.2% Negro, 33.6% Puerto Rican, and 31.2% others.  In promulgating the zone for the new J. H. S. 275, the board admittedly took into consideration the distance from home to school, utilization of school space, convenience of transportation, racial integration of the school, topographic barriers, and continuity of instruction.  The Board of Education had the right to consider the question of race or color as one of the criteria in determining the zone for the new J. H. S. 275 in order to prevent segregation, and in doing so it did not violate any of the constitutional or statutory rights of petitioners (cf.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Brown </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">v.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11"> Board of Educ</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">., 347 U.S. 483; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Brown </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">v.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11"> Board of Educ</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">., 349 U.S. 294). In addition to the racial criterion, all the other five criteria utilized by the board furnish ample support for the zone fixed by it for the new J. H. S. 275.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The zoning for J. H. S. 275 did not violate&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  section 3201 of the Education Law which provides that &quot;No person shall be refused admission into or be excluded from any public school in the state of New York on account of race, creed, color or national origin.&quot; Each child has the right to attend only the public school in the zone or district in which he resides (Education Law, &sect; 3202, subd. 1).  This means the school nearest to his home.  All of the white children on whose behalf this proceeding was instituted live closer to or no further from J. H. S. 275 than from J. H.  S. 285.  Therefore, J. H. S. 275 is the school in the district of their residence.  Only if these children had been excluded from J. H. S. 275 because of their race or color, would there have been a violation of section 3201 of the Education Law. Section 3201 of the Education Law can mean only that no person on account of race, creed, color or national origin, shall be refused admission to or be excluded from any public school to which he is entitled to go as of right.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. If section 3201 of the Education Law can be utilized to defeat efforts to desegregate schools, then, in the light of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Brown</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> decisions by the Supreme Court, that statute would have to&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  be declared unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. The argument that J. H. S. 275 was zoned to establish a racial quota is untenable.  There was no quota system in this case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. The zone established did not violate section 40 of the Civil Rights Law.  None of the rights or privileges of these white children will be denied them if they attend J. H. S. 275.  They will have the same rights or privileges accorded to all other children in that school.  </SPAN></P>

The court thought it did. The court concluded that the book did come within the proscriptions of N.Y. Crim.

In the court's opinion, the book, as a whole, did treat sex in a manner appealing to prurient interest thus coming within the boundaries of any permissible definition of obscenity under the United States Constitution and did meet the more stringent &quot;hard-core pornography&quot; test essential to a finding of obscenity under the New York State statutes.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant New York State Liquor Authority (state) sought review of an order of the Supreme Court at Special Term, New York County (New York), which granted plaintiff alcohol distributors' motion for summary judgment in an action for a permanent injunction and to declare the rights of the alcohol distributors under the New York Alcoholic Beverage Control Law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The alcohol distributors distributed &quot;order kits&quot; for the purchase abroad of alcoholic beverages. The customers mailed the orders and the payments outside the United States, a foreign agent caused each purchase to be packaged separately and shipped to New York City piers, where the individual packages were removed and delivered to the homes of the purchasers. The trial court granted the alcohol distributors' motion for summary judgment. On appeal the court reversed, holding that: (1) the alcohol distributors shipped and brought and caused to be shipped and brought into the state alcoholic beverages not consigned to licensed traffickers of alcoholic beverages contrary to the provisions of N.Y. Alco. Bev. Cont. Law &sect; 102(1)(c), (d); (2) it was immaterial that the alcohol distributors may have been the agents of the purchasers because the statute proscribed shipment or bringing into the state except to a licensed trafficker of liquor and did not exclude therefrom proscribed acts performed as agents or in behalf of the purchasers; and (3) the alcohol distributors could not rely on State Liquor Authority Bulletin No. 263 because a bulletin may not serve to vary a statute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court's judgment which granted the alcohol distributors' motion for summary judgment. The court modified the trial court's judgment by declaring that the state's Bulletin No. 359 was in conformity with the law and that the alcohol distributors were prohibited from bringing into the state alcoholic beverages unless they were consigned to a person duly licensed to traffic therein. Otherwise, the complaint was dismissed.</SPAN></P>

Such orders are directed to a Swiss bank, which forwards them to various liquor suppliers in Switzerland and Belgium and makes payment therefor.  On receipt of the United States customs forms, a foreign agent of the plaintiffs causes each purchase to be separately packaged and placed with others in large containers. The containers are shipped to New York City piers, whence they are moved to plaintiffs' terminals within New York, and the individual packages are then removed and delivered to the homes of the individual purchasers. The individual purchasers are not licensed to traffic in liquors in the State of New York (Alcoholic Beverage Control Law, &sect; 102, subd. 1, pars.

The charge was a violation of N.Y. Educ. Law &sect; 7210. The Board determined that the surveyor was guilty of fraud and deceit.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The petitioner was a licensed surveyor. His letterhead stated that he was associated with several engineers and architects. The &quot;associates&quot; listed on his letterhead testified that they had never given him permission to use their names in such manner. The surveyor also, under the guise of the &quot;Associates,&quot; rendered a building elevation design for a town hall, which was an engineering job. Based on that evidence, the surveyor's license was suspended for one year for violating &sect; 7210, which prohibited the holder of a license from falsely impersonating a practitioner or practicing under an assumed or fictitious name. The surveyor argued that &sect; 7210 was procedurally unconstitutional because it prescribed, in effect, that the investigation, charge, and trial were all to be directed and heard by the same body, and thus, the Board acted as the accuser and judge, which was a denial of due process. The court rejected the surveyor's argument, holding that it was the Board's responsibility to determine that the motivations for any form of discipline were within the intent of the law. The court did find that the measure of discipline was excessive.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner taxpayer sought review of a determination by made by respondent, the Comptroller of the City of New York, which assessed against the taxpayer a specific sum as privilege taxes due at the general business rate. The Comptroller acted on remand from the Court of Appeals (New York), which held that the Comptroller had incorrectly assessed the taxpayer at the financial business rate.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer was a New Jersey holding company with its principal place of business located in the City of New York. Most of its income, for the privilege years in question, consisted of dividends and interest from some 68 controlled subsidiaries. In 1948, 1949, and 1950, it received dividends and interest in the aggregate amount of $ 421 million. The taxpayer successfully challenged an assessment against it as a financial business, but on remand the Comptroller reimposed the same amount, only changing the label to &quot;general business.&quot; The taxpayer sought review. The court annulled the determination, remanding for recalculation. The court held that the statute of limitations did not bar the assessment because the Comptroller acted on remand. The Comptroller had jurisdiction to conduct a hearing on the subject. But, as the city's practice was always to allocate receipts by determining which were allocable to the city, the taxpayer was entitled to a redetermination which did that.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court annulled the Comptroller's determination, remanding for a recomputation of the tax on an allocation basis and for a reconsideration of the question of penalty.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Taxation -- New York City General Business and Financial Tax -- review of determination imposing general business tax -- Court of Appeals ruling that holding companies are subject to general business tax, not financial business tax, nullified all prior proceedings herein so that it is as if petitioner did not file return -- therefore, respondent not time-barred from imposing tax on general business tax basis -- since protested tax is imposed on subject matter not previously taxed, it is not time-barred as addition to business tax already levied</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> -- identity, on remand, of principal amount and penalty with that found in earlier proceeding indicates mere exchange of labels -- matter remanded for recomputation of tax based on allocation of taxable receipts and, since petitioner had filed timely returns under erroneous classification required by respondent, for reconsideration of question of penalties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Respondent assessed a &quot;Business Tax Deficiency&quot; for the years 1948, 1949 and 1950 against petitioner, a New Jersey holding company with its principal place of business in New York City, basing its assessment in part on a general business basis, determined in relation to pension deficit charges and wire expense charges to subsidiaries, and profit on sale of securities, and in part on a financial business basis, determined by allocating to New York City 12 1/2% of the total dividends and interest received by petitioner from all of its controlled subsidiaries. The business tax deficiency was compromised. The financial business tax deficiency was confirmed at $ 176,767.28, plus interest and penalties.  Petitioner instituted a review proceeding, in which it was ultimately held by the Court of Appeals that holding companies were&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  not intended to be included in the definition of financial business.  Upon remand, respondent scheduled a hearing at which petitioner offered no proof respecting the computation of the general business tax but merely challenged respondent's jurisdiction to hold the hearing.  Thereafter, respondent made a final determination, containing no findings, and in exactly the total amount previously calculated at and for the financial business tax rate.  The present assessment is not time-barred, despite the expiration of more than three years since the filing of the return (Administrative Code of City of New York, ch. 46, &sect; B46-15.0, subd. b).  Although petitioner timely filed its return, the return, through respondent's error, was classified, under protest, as a financial business tax. The Court of Appeals, in determining that such tax rate did not apply to holding companies, nullified all prior proceedings and it was as if no return had been filed.  However, since the error was respondent's, the matter of imposition of penalties might well be reconsidered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The protested tax is not time-barred as an increase, augmentation or accession to the business tax already levied since it is imposed&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  on subject matter not previously taxed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The general business tax is required to be imposed upon receipts received in and/or allocable to the city (Administrative Code, &sect; B46-2.0).  Upon remand, respondent made no independent determination or allocation of taxable receipts, resting, instead, upon a stipulation executed prior to the final determination which preceded the earlier article 78 proceeding and provided for the amount of tax if liability were finally determined to be that imposed by the business tax rates, without allocation.  However, no such determination was made in either review proceeding.  Moreover, the identity, on remand, of the principal amount and penalty with that found in the earlier proceeding, indicates that there was at most an exchange of labels.  Accordingly, the matter is remanded for recomputation of the tax on an allocation basis, and for further consideration of the question of penalty.  </SPAN></P>

The court modified the order dismissing the civil service employee's petition as to all respondents, except the town council, and remitted to the trial court for further proceedings against the town council. The court held that the civil service employee's petition sufficiently alleged a claim against the town counsel on the issue of whether the duties of the abolished position and the newly created position were sufficiently similar.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed an order from the Supreme Court (New York), which denied, without a hearing, defendant's motion for a writ of error coram nobis.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was tried and convicted in New York of attempted murder. A district attorney filed an information that charged defendant with having been previously convicted of murder in Florida. Defendant admitted the truth of the information, and he was sentenced as a second felony offender. Defendant moved to vacate his New York conviction and sentence on the basis that he was not represented by counsel or advised of his right to counsel when he was arraigned on the Florida charge. The trial court denied defendant's motion. On appeal, the court recognized that: (1) defendant should have been advised of his right to counsel; and (2) the availability of the remedy of coram nobis was determined exclusively by state law and not federal law. The court found that coram nobis was not a proper remedy for purposes of discrediting a prior, out-of-state conviction. Because the case involved the lawfulness of defendant's detention, the court conducted a thorough review of whether any other remedies existed for defendant. The court held that the remedies of a motion for resentence or habeas corpus were possibly available.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's order that denied defendant's motion in the nature of a writ of error coram nobis.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Defendant was convicted in New York of attempted murder in the second degree and was sentenced as a second felony offender when he admitted the truth of an information charging him with having previously been convicted in Florida of murder in the first degree.  His application for a writ of error </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">coram nobis</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to vacate the New York conviction and sentence on the ground that at the time of his arraignment in Florida he had not been represented by counsel, and had not been advised&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  that he could retain counsel or have counsel assigned to him, was properly denied without a hearing.  The writ of error </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">coram nobis</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> does not lie to discredit a prior out-of-State conviction, even though the subsequent sentence in this State was measured by the fact of the prior conviction ( </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">People </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">v.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11"> McCullough</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 300 N.

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. It may be that defendant could have moved to dismiss the information on the ground that the prior conviction was void.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of a judgment from the Schenectady County Court (New York), which convicted him of and sentenced him for the crimes of operating a policy business in violation of N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 974-a, possession of policy slips in violation of N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 975, book-making in violation of N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 986, and possession of book-making records in violation of N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 986-b.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's conviction for operating a policy establishment, as well as on the other counts, was based upon his confession, which was not the result of psychological coercion as alleged by defendant, but was voluntarily given. As such the confession was properly admitted and the sole question was whether that confession was sufficiently corroborated by additional proof so as to sustain the convictions. The crime of operating a policy establishment, pursuant to N.Y. Penal Code &sect; 974-a, had a two-part body, the establishment and using the establishment for the purpose of there receiving in any one day written records of over 100 plays. The documentary evidence contained in the envelope established the second part. However, there was absolutely no independent evidence that defendant kept an establishment for the purpose of receiving policy plays or bets. The only proof, other than defendant's own written and oral confessions, of an establishment was the statement made by another man in defendant's presence that defendant had given him the envelopes at the establishment. Because the body of the crime was not independently established, defendant was improperly convicted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's conviction for operating a policy business was reversed and that count in the indictment was dismissed. Defendant's convictions and sentences for the remaining three counts were modified and defendant was sentenced on each count for a period of six months, with the sentences running concurrently.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Defendant was convicted of (a) operating a policy business in violation of section 974-a of the Penal Law, (b) possession of policy slips in violation of section 975, (c) book-making in violation of section 986, and (d) possession of book-making records in violation of section 986-b.  Section 974-a of the Penal Law provides that &quot;Any person who knowingly keeps, occupies or uses a place, building, room or establishment * * * for the purpose of receiving in any one day * * * written records of more than one hundred plays or bets made over any period of time in what&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  is commonly called 'policy' or 'the numbers game' * * * shall be guilty of a felony&quot;.  Defendant was improperly convicted under this section.  His confession was not properly corroborated (Code Crim. Pro., &sect; 395).  There is no independent evidence that defendant kept an establishment for the purpose of receiving policy plays or bets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Although not necessary to the decision, the court determines that the section is not unconstitutional but is sufficiently definite.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Defendant was properly convicted on the other three counts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. In sentencing defendant the County Court was primarily considering the felony conviction and, since that is reversed and dismissed, the sentences as to the other three counts should be modified and defendant sentenced on each count to the Schenectady County Jail for a period of six months, the sentences to run concurrently with credit for any time already served.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant town appealed an order of the Supreme Court in Suffolk County (New York) that granted judgment to plaintiff lessee in lessee's action to compel the town to issue a permit for the installation and use of gas tanks on property it leased from the town. The trial court held that the lessee was entitled to a mandamus order, in part, because the town's amended zoning ordinance deprived the lessee of its contractual rights under the lease.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The town leased property to the lessee for the operation of a marina. Later, the town enacted an ordinance amending the zoning of the property to a classification that did not allow for the sale of gasoline on the property. The lessee filed suit when the town building inspector refused to issue a permit allowing the lessee to install gasoline tanks and other equipment for the sale of gasoline. On appeal, the court affirmed because it held that a town, acting in its government capacity could not impair an existing lease contract. The court found that the U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 10 prohibited the enactment of any law impairing the obligations of contracts except in the event of an emergency in which the public welfare required it, and the town had not shown any emergency to justify its ordinance. Thus, the towns refusal of the permit was beyond its police power. The court also affirmed the decision based on the trial court's reasoning that the zoning amendment was a confiscation of the lessee's interest because the greater part of the lease's value was destroyed when it could no longer be used for the purpose intended by the parties.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court that the lessee was entitled to a mandamus order forcing the town's building inspector to issue a permit for the installation of gasoline tanks and related equipment for the sale of gasoline.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A town owned an island in its proprietary capacity and leased it to a corporation for 30 years to be used by the lessee for a yacht basin, hotel, bar and restaurant, and for the sale of gasoline; and if gasoline were rationed in case of war, the lessee could either cancel the whole lease or reduce the rent by 90%.  Thereafter and during the term of&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the lease, and without any showing of emergency which might justify such an exercise of the police power, the town in its governmental capacity amended its zoning resolution so as to place these premises in a different zone and so as to allow in such a zone only certain uses which uses would preclude any sale of gasoline. As applied to this lessee, such zoning amendment was unconstitutional and void, for either of two reasons: (1) it effected a confiscation and destruction of the value of the leasehold interest; (2) it impaired the obligation of the leasehold contract.  Accordingly, Special Term properly directed the town's Building Inspector to permit the corporation to install gasoline tanks and pumps and related equipment in accordance with plans and specifications filed by the corporation in the office of said Building Inspector.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff board of education, the owner of property that had been conveyed subject to a proviso that it could only be used for school purposes, submitted a controversy to the court. Defendants, the original grantor's heirs, argued that N.Y. Real Prop. Law &sect; 345, which provided for the extinguishment of certain future interests unless they were recorded within a certain period, was unconstitutional in retroactive application.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The original deed conveyed the land to a school and contained a proviso that the land would revert to the grantor or his heirs if the land ceased to be used for school purposes. When the property ceased be used for a school, the original grantor's heirs recorded a declaration of intention to preserve restrictions on the use of the land. The court held that N.Y. Real Prop. Law &sect; 345 was a valid exercise of legislative power. Thus, the heirs' rights were extinguished since the filing of the declaration was over six months after the expiration of the time for recording such an intention fixed by the statute. The language of the deed created either a fee simple subject to a condition subsequent or a fee simple determinable. These future interests had been characterized as bare possibilities. The court found that it was not an impairment of contract or a denial of due process to require a man who owned so tenuous an interest to put it down in a public record within the reasonable time specified in the statute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court entered judgment for the board of education, without costs.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional law -- validity of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">statute</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> extinguishing unrecorded future contingent interests -- provision (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Real Property Law, &sect; 345</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">, added by L. 1958, ch. 865) for extinguishing condition subsequent or special limitation on land use, along with resulting right of entry or possibility of reverter, unless possessor thereof within stated time recorded declaration of intent to preserve such future interest, was valid exercise of legislative power and retroactive application thereof to bar contingent interests of grantor's heirs to lands conveyed to school trustees in 1863 for school use only neither impaired contract nor denied due process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. A grant of land in 1863 to the trustees of an academy, the predecessors of plaintiff Board of Education, contained a provision that it should remain effective while the premises &quot;shall be used for the purpose of an Academy and no other&quot; but &quot;otherwise it shall become Void and the premises herein conveyed shall revert to [the grantor] and to his heirs.&quot; The property was used for school purposes until April&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  1, 1962 when the board discontinued such use.  Defendants, as sole heirs of the grantor, recorded a declaration of intention to preserve restrictions on April 13, more than six months after the expiration of the time allowed for such recording by section 345 of the Real Property Law.  Section 345 (added by L. 1958, ch. 865) provided for the extinguishment of a previously existing, as well as a future, condition subsequent or special limitation on the use of land, along with the resulting right of entry or possibility of reverter, unless the party possessing such future interest recorded a declaration of intention to preserve it, within a stated time, which for such interests created before September 1, 1931 ended September 1, 1961, three years after the effective date of the statute.  Such recording requirement was a valid exercise of legislative power and defendants' failure to record timely extinguished their contingent interest in the land.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Although such future interests have been characterized as bare possibilities and their transferability had been in doubt, the statute (Real Property Law, &sect; 59, as amd. by L. 1962, ch. 146, eff. Sept. 1, 1962) settled that question by making&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  such interests descendible, devisable and alienable.  However such alienability did not necessarily conclude the question of these rights' being constitutionally protected which must be tested out on the rationality of the need for public regulation of such interests in the general welfare.  The right so to regulate and, under certain reasonable conditions, to extinguish depends in turn upon the nature of the thing regulated and extinguished. The loose-end nature of these contingent, future interests, allowing the owners thereof to sit by for generations without showing any interest whatever in them, while the grantor's heirs or distributees spread out to evolve a multitudinous ownership, left titles doubtful, uncertain and confused and has been a source of marked difficulty in administering New York law.  Regulation of this kind of title by requiring that any intent to rely thereon be recorded was in the public interest and was a reasonable and salutory public control of the use of a peculiar form of property which, if unregulated, could adversely affect the free alienability and development of land.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. It was neither the impairment of contract nor a denial of due process to require&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the owner of so tenuous and troublesome an interest to put it down in a public record.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The recording provisions of section 345, including its retroactive application, are constitutionally valid.  So far as anything in the case of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Varick's Executors </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">v.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11"> Briggs</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (22 Wend. 543), decided by the Court of Errors in 1839, is to the contrary, the doctrine of that case is opposed by the great weight of authority; has been ignored by the State's lower courts; has never been followed by the Court of Appeals, and has been expressly questioned by Judges thereof.  (The historical development of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Varick's Executors</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> case doctrine traced and its treatment in subsequent State and Federal decisions reviewed.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. That defendants' rights did not mature until the condition occurred -- when the use for school purposes ceased on April 1, 1962 -- is not controlling.  The right was created before September 1, 1931 and the statute required recording in such case by September 1, 1961.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, a driver and the city, challenged an order of the Supreme Court, Sullivan County (New York), which entered judgment for plaintiff victim in the victim's action for damages for injuries suffered as a result of an automobile accident.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A sharp factual difference existed between the versions of the accident as related by the driver and the victim. The victim testified that she attempted to make a left-hand turn, turned partially, and waited for another car passing in the opposite direction. As she waited, she saw headlights approaching from the rear. The driver testified that she did not see the victim's car until a few seconds before the impact, and that the victim's car was moving from the right to the left. The trial court entered judgement for the victim. On appeal, defendants claimed that it was error for the trial court to charge the jury on the doctrine of last clear chance, which required the victim to be in a perilous situation of which the driver had actual knowledge. However, even if the charge were erroneous, reversal was not required. Indeed, immediately after discussing the general doctrine of last clear chance and its very limited general operation, the trial court in effect substantially swept it out of consideration by saying that if the victim were guilty of negligence, which contributed in the slightest degree, the verdict &quot;must be&quot; for defendants.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's judgment entered in favor of the victim.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Negligence -- last clear chance -- in action to recover for injuries sustained by plaintiff as result of collision of automobiles, Trial Judge submitted doctrine of last clear chance as one alternative open to jury -- drawing that inference from conflicting proof as to how accident occurred which is most favorable to such charge, it would be possible for jury to find that plaintiff's automobile was stopped under perilous conditions of location and traffic, that such act of standing and waiting was negligent, and that plaintiff's automobile was in such location long enough to be seen and was in fact seen by defendant operator in time to avoid collision -- even if charge was error, it was not so substantial as to require reversal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Plaintiff's automobile was struck on the left side by an automobile operated by one of defendants.  Both automobiles had been proceeding northerly on a street wide enough for two lanes of traffic in each direction.  In this action to&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  recover for the personal injuries sustained by plaintiff as a result of this accident, there was a sharp factual difference between the versions of the accident given by the parties.  In his charge the Trial Judge submitted the doctrine of last clear chance as one alternative open to the jury.  Drawing that inference from the proof as to how the accident occurred which is most favorable to the charge as to the doctrine of last clear chance, it would be possible for the jury to find that plaintiff's automobile was stopped at an angle partly away from the curb, in the lane of traffic, waiting under perilous conditions of location and traffic; that such act of standing and waiting was so perilous as to be negligent, and that plaintiff's automobile was in such a location long enough to be seen and was in fact seen by defendant operator in time to avoid the collision.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Even if the charge as to the doctrine of last clear chance was error, it was not so substantial as to require a reversal.  The Trial Judge submitted the doctrine and its limited operation in general terms, without specifically tying it into the facts of this case and, immediately after this submission, substantially swept&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  it out of consideration by charging that the verdict must be one of no cause of action if the jury found that plaintiff, at the time and place in question, was guilty of negligence contributing in the slightest degree to the injuries allegedly sustained by her.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant landowners sought review of two decisions of the Supreme Court at Special Term in New York County (New York), which denied the landowners' motion for a temporary injunction restraining respondents, a port authority and others, from proceeding under Chapter 209 of the Laws of 1963 with the condemnation of property in lower Manhattan and granted condemnation and put the port authority into possession of the property.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Chapter 209 of the Laws of 1962 authorized the port authority to acquire, through condemnation, the Hudson Tubes and to condemn 13 blocks in lower Manhattan for the purpose of developing a project known as the &quot;world trade center.&quot; The landowners brought suit in which they claimed that the statute was unconstitutional and sought an injunction prohibiting condemnation. The trial court denied the injunction and, in a second action brought by a subsidiary of the port authority, granted condemnation. The landowners appealed and the court reversed. The court found that the condemnation of the tubes and the creation of the world trade center was a unified project, and thus if one part of the statute were declared unconstitutional, then the entire statute was unconstitutional. The court recognized that the port authority had the power to condemn for a public purpose. But the court found that the creation of the world trade center was not for a public purpose because the statute authorized the world trade center to have been used primarily to generate revenue to cover the expenses of the remainder of the project. Thus, the court held the statute unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

That portion of a statute (L. 1962, ch. 209), authorizing the Port of New York Authority to condemn a 13 city block area in lower Manhattan for the purpose of developing a &quot;world trade center&quot;, permitted the use of such areas therein that may &quot;not be devoted to purposes of the port development project other than the production of incidental revenue available for the expenses&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of all or part of the port development project&quot;.  Although creation of a world trade center in concept is a public purpose, such portion of the statute not only authorized condemnation of private property for public purposes, but also permitted condemnation for improperly exercised nonpublic purposes -- the use of the property &quot;primarily for revenue&quot; -- and, accordingly, must be declared unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Moreover, the Legislature, in authorizing the Port Authority to construct customs houses and stores, foreign trade zones and other facilities with clearly public purposes, not only failed to limit such authorization to such type of building, but expressly permitted the Authority to erect and use warehouses for functions incident to the exchange, buying and selling of commodities and other property in world trade and commerce. Exercising such a broad power would make this project in reality a real estate development inasmuch as scarcely any enterprise or business in the city would be excluded from the area although devoted exclusively to private purposes.  Such powers granted by the statute are so broad as to mandate a finding of unconstitutionality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Furthermore, because of&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  such invalidity of that portion of the statute authorizing the world trade center, the entire statute must likewise fall, including that part authorizing the Port Authority to acquire by condemnation the Hudson Tubes and appurtenant properties.  The operation of the tubes undoubtedly would constitute a public purpose and buildings presently erected over the existing terminal could properly be condemned in order to improve existing facilities or to construct a new terminal, including buildings that might yield incidental revenues.  However the severability clause (&sect; 18) of the statute, providing that the invalidity of any portion thereof should not affect the validity of the remainder, also contained the limiting provision: &quot;so long as the * * * remainder of the act shall nonetheless permit the effectuation, as a unified project, of the Hudson tubes, Hudson tube extensions and the world trade center&quot;.  The Legislature of New York and that of New Jersey (which enacted concurrent legislation) clearly intended thereby that the Hudson Tubes project and the world trade center project be considered as a unit and stand or fall together, and the courts would be invading the legislative function&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  if they allowed the residue of the statute to remain.  Accordingly, the trade center phase of the statute being invalid, the Port Authority may not be permitted to take over the tubes, and may not go forward with a condemnation proceeding in connection with the tubes project.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. It was error for the court to refuse to consider and pass on the constitutionality of the world trade center authorization before granting the petition for an order of condemnation of the tube properties.  Likewise, in an action for a declaratory judgment of the statute's unconstitutionality and invalidity for other reasons, it was error for the court to fail to decide that constitutional question before denying a motion by persons interested in the tube properties for a temporary injunction restraining the condemnation of such properties.  The severability clause, making the tubes and the trade center a nondivisible project, in effect required that decision as to the validity of the trade center be made at the time when the first step effectuating the statutory purpose was taken.  Otherwise a subsequent finding of the trade center's invalidity might leave the Port Authority with an advanced or completed tubes&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  project without the possibility of effectuating the trade center -- a result expressly prohibited by the Legislature.  Moreover, the parties whose properties might be condemned might not have sufficient opportunity, before an actual takeover, to present the question as to whether a public use was contemplated.  Such contingency may be avoided by present consideration of the validity of the trade center project as written.  </SPAN></P>

The airport filed a motion to strike those portions of the first cause of action that sought compensation for claims that accrued prior one year before the commencement of the action. The trial court granted the motion to the extent of striking out those allegations relating to claims in nuisance and trespass, but denied the motion as to the allegations relating to the taking. The trial court held that the airport was not immune to an action pursuant to the constitutional guarantee of due compensation for the taking of property, and that the suability statute was inapplicable. The court affirmed and held that based upon the alleged unlawful taking, the homeowners were free to seek relief against the airport by any other appropriate proceeding or action wherein their rights might be enforced, including a proceeding to compel the airport to condemn the subject property rights, or an action for damages. The court held that there was no immunity because of the constitutional requirement of just compensation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff State filed suit to recover from defendants the costs of an audit and examination of defendants' interstate union-employer welfare fund. Defendants claimed that the fund, with its sole and principal office located out of state, was exempt from state regulation and examination under federal law.

On appeal, the court reversed the judgment entered in favor of defendants and granted judgment on the pleadings in favor of plaintiff.

Approximately 3% of the covered employees are residents of New York.  The State of New York, through its Insurance Department, audits the books, records and affairs of the fund which, pursuant to State statute (Insurance Law, art. III-A, &sect; 37 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">et seq</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.) is registered with the Superintendent of Insurance.  In this action in which the State seeks to recover the costs of such audit made in 1958, the motion by the state judgment on the pleadings should be granted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. While section 466 of the Insurance Law exempts certain labor union organizations and operations from the application of the Insurance Law, article III-A of the Insurance Law provides for supervision of such welfare funds and that expenses of such examinations shall be borne by the examined funds.  The State legislation does not exempt from, but, on the contrary, includes welfare funds under State supervision.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3.

The Federal statute, (U. S.

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Whether welfare plans fit within the category of insurance is not essential to the determination because, in the Federal statute, continued power in the State to regulate welfare plans is recognized expressly.

The court opined that no grounds for the resulting restriction of free expression could be found in the statute or otherwise established.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent Civil Service Commission of the City of New York appealed from the order of the Supreme Court at Special Term (New York), which granted, to the extent of directing a trial on the issue, petitioner policewoman's application, under N.Y.

The policewoman filed the petition for judicial review, which the trial court granted to the extent of directing a trial. On appeal, the court modified and affirmed. The court found that under N.Y. Civ. Serv. Law art. 4, the Commission could have limited eligibility to take an examination to one sex when the duties of the position related to the care or custody of persons of the same sex or the work required sex selection. The court found that promotions were to based on seniority, merit, and superior capacity under New York City, N.Y., Admin. Code &sect; 434a-13.0. The court interpreted &sect; 434a-2.0(d), stating that there was only one rank and grade of women police officers who would have been known as policewomen, as abolishing the distinctions between classes of female officers rather than as prohibiting promotions for policewomen.

The court modified the order by striking out the provision declaring that no submission was made and dismissed the proceeding because the disapproval of the village zoning amendment was a valid determination made in conformity with the Nassau County Charter. Specifically, because there was one vacancy, the disapproval was accomplished by four members of the five-member commission.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, chiropractic association and others, sought review of a judgment of the Supreme Court, Albany County (New York) in favor of respondent, health commissioner, in an action seeking to have N.Y. Sanitary Code ch. XVI, reg. 19 declared unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">N.Y. Sanitary Code ch. XVI, reg. 19 provided that only certain licensed medical professionals could administer radiation or X-rays to humans. The chiropractic association, desirous to have its members be allowed to perform X-rays on its patients, commenced the instant action to have the statute declared unconstitutional. They argued that the regulation was discriminatory against chiropractors and denied them equal protection of the laws. They also argued that the regulation deprived chiropractors of their right to pursue their calling and deprived them of the use of their lawfully acquired X-ray equipment without due process of law. The trial court entered a judgment for the health commissioner. On appeal, the court found that the promulgators of the regulation were clearly entitled to find that medical knowledge and diagnostic skill were essential to evaluate the necessity of X-ray procedures in any particular case and to weigh the attendant risk as against the possible benefit to be derived. The technical education, training and skill of chiropractors were, in general, substantially deficient in these vital areas of knowledge and judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's judgment in favor of the health commissioner in an action brought by the chiropractic association and others seeking to have a state statute that limited the class of persons who could administer radiation to humans declared unconstitutional. The court held that the statute was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Physicians and surgeons -- chiropractors -- X rays -- New York State Sanitary Code (ch. XVI, reg. 19) prohibits application of radiation to human being by those not licensed to practice medicine, dentistry, podiatry or osteopathy but does not prohibit use of radiation by technician, nurse or other person under direction or order of persons so licensed -- complaint in action by members of chiropractic association for judgment declaring said regulation </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">unconstitutional</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> and restraining its enforcement, properly dismissed -- record indicates chiropractors deficient in necessary technical education, training and skill -- responsibility properly delegated to those whose necessary technical education, knowledge and skill had been determined and certified.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Regulation 19 of chapter XVI of the New York State Sanitary Code provides that: &quot;No person shall apply radiation to a human being unless such person is licensed&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  or otherwise authorized to practice medicine, dentistry, podiatry or osteopathy&quot;, and that &quot;This regulation shall not prohibit the use of radiation by a technician, nurse or other person, if such use is directed or ordered by a person licensed or authorized to practice medicine, dentistry, podiatry or osteopathy&quot;.  The complaint in an action brought to have this regulation declared unconstitutional and to restrain its enforcement was properly dismissed.  The promulgators of the regulation were entitled to find that medical knowledge and diagnostic skill are essential to evaluate the necessity of X-ray procedures and to weigh the risk as against the possible benefit to be derived.  The record indicates that the technical education, training and skill of chiropractors are, in general, substantially deficient in these areas of knowledge and judgment.  Further, it is doubtful whether technical knowledge in the requisite degree, if possessed by a particular chiropractor, could be applied to the problem posed by spinal X ray without thereby constituting an unlawful invasion of the field of medical practice.  Such relevant issues as arose with respect to the knowledge, competence and skill&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of chiropractors, as such, in the particular areas of judgment and decision involved were properly resolved against appellants -- members of the Chiropractic Association of New York.  These findings serve to negate any suggestion that chiropractors, as such, are possessed of such knowledge and skill as to render arbitrary their exclusion from the class of practitioners of named professions authorized to apply radiation to human beings or to direct or order its application.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Plaintiffs state that they &quot;do not contend that a proper regulation may not be promulgated dealing with the taking of X-rays of human beings, nor that, if improperly taken, such an operation is not attended by a certain amount of danger to the subject of the operation.&quot; In seeking to combat that danger, the Public Health Council could and did recognize the initial necessity of technical knowledge and skill to determine, in each case, the advisability of X-ray procedure, in the light of the clinical evidence at hand, the attendant risk and possible effects, and thereupon, in the event X ray should be indicated, to direct the method, nature and number of exposures, and thus, in effect, prescribe the quantity of&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  radiation to be applied.  The promulgators of the regulation committed an effective degree of responsibility and control to those most competent to exercise it by providing that only those licensed to practice medicine or one of the other professions named, and whose highly technical education, knowledge and skill had thus been determined and certified, should apply radiation, or direct its application, to a human being.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the claimants argued that the notice provisions of the Water Supply Act, New York City, N.Y., R. tit.

The court also ruled that the claimants' failure to file a claim for damages for condemnation within three years barred their right to compensation. Additionally, the court determined that there was no basis for finding that the board was estopped from pleading the three-year statute of limitations as a defense to the claims. In reaching this conclusion, the court emphasized that the notices, the taking map, the posting, and the condemnation petition were not defective.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, a discount house, appealed from a judgment of the Oneida County Court (New York), which convicted defendant of making unlawful sales on Sunday in violation of N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 2147.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant maintained a drugstore that operated under a policy of selling at reduced prices, generally characteristic of stores known as discount houses. Defendant was convicted under the Sunday statute on the ground that it unlawfully sold and exposed for sale certain property in violation of N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 2147. Defendant maintained that public authorities intentionally discriminated against it and other discount houses and allowed others outside the class to continue to sell forbidden items in violation of the Sunday law without molestation. The court reversed the conviction and granted a new trial. It was defendant's burden to establish conscious, intentional discrimination, and if it succeeded in sustaining that burden, defendant was entitled to a dismissal of the prosecution as a matter of law. While the trial court recognized the validity of the defense, it prevented defendant from introducing material evidence that would have tended to support the defense. Further, the court stated that the claim of discriminatory enforcement should not have been treated as a defense, but as an application to dismiss or quash the prosecution on constitutional grounds.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed defendant's conviction for violation of the Sunday statute and granted defendant a new trial. The court directed that the court below, prior to the commencement of the new trial, entertain an application by defendant to dismiss or quash the prosecution upon the grounds set forth by it in its offers of proof during the first trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- sale on Sunday -- discriminatory enforcement -- judgment convicting defendant, operator of drugstore, of violation of section 2147 of Penal Law on charge that it unlawfully sold property on Sunday reversed where trial court prevented defendant from introducing material evidence supporting its defense that public authorities discriminated against its &quot;cut-rate&quot; type of operation in enforcement of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">statute</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> -- on new trial, matter of discriminatory enforcement should not be submitted to jury but should be decided by court on application to dismiss or quash prosecution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Defendant, operator of a drugstore, was convicted of violating section 2147 of the Penal Law upon a charge that it unlawfully sold certain property on a Sunday.  Defendant did not contest the charge but contended that the prosecution was part of a discriminatory design aimed at defendant and others engaged in the &quot;cut-rate&quot; &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  type of operation in which defendant was engaged, and that the public authorities intentionally discriminated against that class and allowed others outside that class to continue to sell the forbidden items in violation of the law without molestation.  The trial court, with the acquiescence of the District Attorney, held that defendant's contention, if established, would constitute a good defense and it submitted the case to the jury, leaving the question to the jury to decide whether defendant's proof established a clear and intentional discrimination against defendant and those in the same class.  Upon the theory upon which the case was tried and submitted, the judgment of conviction must be reversed since the trial court prevented defendant from introducing material evidence which would have tended to support the defense.  The court held that the evidence was irrelevant since nonenforcement of itself is not sufficient to establish discrimination.  While it is true that nonenforcement is insufficient of itself to establish discrimination, proof of nonenforcement is admissible in evidence where defendant alleges that there has been intentional discrimination.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. However, the claim&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of discriminatory enforcement should not be treated as a defense to the criminal charge, to be tried before the jury and submitted to it for decision, but should be treated as an application to the court for a dismissal or quashing of the prosecution upon constitutional grounds.  Insofar as a question of fact may be involved, the court should take the evidence in the absence of the jury and should decide the question itself.  If the court finds that there was an intentional discrimination, it should quash the prosecution, not because defendant is not guilty of the crime charged, but because the court, as an agency of government, should not lend itself to a prosecution, the maintenance of which would violate the constitutional rights of the defendant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. A new trial is granted.  The court should, prior to the commencement of the new trial, entertain an application by defendant to dismiss or quash the prosecution upon the grounds set forth by it in its offers of proof on the first trial.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Under N.Y. R.R.

R.R. Law ch. 386 (1958) declared unconstitutional because it impaired the obligation of their contracts with the state. The trial court declared that ch. 386 was constitutional and valid. The court affirmed. The court held that N.Y. R.R. Law ch. 824 (1954) was a general law that was not open to contract with the corporations. Chapter 824 did not bind the state, did not suggest any contractual obligations on the part of the state, and did not waive the state's powers to alter any corporate privileges.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's decision in favor of the state in the corporations' action to declare that a state statute unconstitutionally impaired the obligation of their contracts with the state.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional law -- impairment of contracts -- chapter 824 of Laws of 1954 provided that railroad redevelopment corporations might make emergency changes in passenger fares without prior approval by Public Service Commission but subject to later review by Public Service Commission -- chapter 386 of Laws of 1958 requiring advance approval by Public Service Commission of changes in fares does not </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">unconstitutionally</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> impair obligation of contract between railroads and State.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Article 7 ( &sect;&sect; 300-313) of the Railroad Law, enacted in 1954 (L. 1954, ch. 824), provided that certain domestic railroad corporations which could meet the conditions set forth in the act might qualify as a railroad redevelopment corporation.

Under section 307 of the law, a railroad redevelopment corporation was authorized to make emergency changes in its passenger fares without prior approval by the Public Service Commission whenever it determined that its revenues would be inadequate during the following 12-month period to meet the expenditures authorized by section 306.  Such changes were, nevertheless, subject to review by the Public Service Commission.  Section 307 was amended by chapter 386 of the Laws of 1958 to require advance approval of the Public Service Commission before changes in existing fares could become effective.  Chapter 386 of the Laws of 1958 does not unconstitutionally impair the obligation of a contract between plaintiffs and the State.  There is nothing in the act itself (L. 1954, ch 824) which binds the State, or suggests any contractual obligations on the part of the State, or that the State waived its powers to alter any corporate privileges therein granted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Moreover, assuming a contractual plan for the 1954 legislation, the State reserved the power to alter it under the &quot;reserved power&quot; found in section 1 of article X of the New York State Constitution.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant cemetery challenged the judgment of the Supreme Court of Westchester County (New York), which granted a motion by plaintiff plot owner for judgment on the pleadings in the plot owner's action for a declaratory judgment to bind the agreement between the parties in regard to services rendered by the cemetery. Intervenor cemetery board also challenged the order.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The plot owner purchased certain burial rights and sought to bind the parties' agreement in regard to the maintenance of the cemetery grounds. Specifically, the plot owner argued that the cemetery refused to perform the specified services at the agreed prices and increased the agreed upon prices. The court reversed the judgment because the plot owner merely had the right of interment and the right to erect suitable monuments and to care for the plot. The plot owner was no different than any other large organization granting similar burial and funeral benefits to its members. The court noted that the cemetery could not charge either too little or too much for services to be rendered and it could not discriminate between lot owners by imposing burdens upon one that others should properly bear. However, because the plot owner did not contend that the increased charges were unreasonable, their imposition did not represent an abuse of power.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment in favor of the plot was reversed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Plaintiff, a religious corporation owning burial rights in a plot located in defendant's cemetery, entered into an agreement with defendant, a&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  membership corporation, in 1939.  This agreement established fixed charges for grave openings and special care to be rendered by defendant.  Intervening defendant, the Cemetery Board, pursuant to 1949 amendments to the Membership Corporations Law (L. 1949, ch. 533, as amd.), subsequently granted defendant the right to increase charges for these services, the increases becoming effective when approved by intervenor (&sect; 82).  Plaintiff's allegation that its organization under the Religious Corporations Law makes it expressly exempt from the provisions of the Membership Corporations Law, section 71 thereof providing that such law does not apply to a religious corporation, cannot be sustained in the light of the intent of the statute as gleaned from other provisions therein and from its history, which make it clear that the exemption is inapplicable to religious corporations which merely hold plots in a cemetery owned by an unrelated cemetery corporation, as distinct from owning them.  Accordingly, plaintiff's contract with defendant is subject to regulation under the Membership Corporations Law and to the changes in charges approved by intervenor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The stated purpose of article IX&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of the Membership Corporations Law, authorizing the Cemetery Board to regulate cemeteries, is to prevent them from falling into disrepair and becoming a burden on the community.  Accordingly, the law is not unconstitutional in authorizing approval of charges in excess of those fixed by earlier agreement where such increases are reasonable and related to the actual cost incurred by the cemetery in rendering its services.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant publisher challenged an order from the Supreme Court, Franklin County (New York), which denying the publisher's motion to dismiss the complaint filed by respondent district attorney alleging defamation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The publisher printed an article describing the circumstances surrounding a pretrial hearing of a criminal defendant accused of killing a New York police officer. The press and the public were excluded in accordance with N.Y. Code Crim. Proc. 203. The publisher used the expression &quot;Star Chamber,&quot; alleged police brutality, and used the phrase &quot;iron curtain&quot; in the article. The attorney argued that the article falsely insinuated that he violated the criminal defendant's constitutional rights, causing injury to the attorney's professional reputation. On appeal, the court found that the trial court properly denied the publisher's motion to dismiss. The court determined that whether the article contained defamatory statements was a question for the jury and not for the trial court because the application or meaning of the words in the article was ambiguous and the sense in which they were used was uncertain. The court concluded, however, that the article was capable of a construction upon which the publisher could have been found liable in defamation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Libel and slander -- libel -- owner and publisher of newspaper published article about plaintiff District Attorney captioned &quot;D A Pulls 'Star Chamber' Hearing in Slaying&quot; and mentioned police brutality and &quot;iron curtain&quot; -- no special damages alleged -- publication susceptible of defamatory meaning -- motion to dismiss complaint properly denied.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Respondent is the District Attorney of Franklin County and a member of the New York Bar.  Appellant, the owner and publisher of a newspaper, published an article captioned &quot;D A Pulls 'Star Chamber' Hearing in Slaying&quot;.  The article described the circumstances surrounding the pretrial hearing of a St. Regis Indian accused of killing a State Trooper from which the press and public were legally excluded in accordance with section 203 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.  In addition to the expression &quot;Star Chamber&quot;, police brutality was charged and the phrase &quot;iron curtain&quot; was also used in describing the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  exclusion of the press and public from the hearing.  Respondent alleges that the article falsely insinuates that he violated the accused's constitutional rights and by so doing injured his professional reputation.  The public's understanding of the meaning of the term &quot;Star Chamber&quot; is something quite different than merely a secret or closed meeting.  A charge that respondent deprived the accused of his constitutional rights would clearly be actionable. The expressions &quot;Star Chamber&quot;, police brutality and &quot;iron curtain&quot; conveying the same meaning would be no less libelous. Since no special damages are alleged, the test to be applied is whether the article, as a matter of law, can be found to be without defamatory import. It cannot be said, that, as used in the instant article, a reasonable man could not conceive that a &quot;Star Chamber&quot; hearing imported an oppressive affair in derogation of the accused's rights.  This publication is susceptible of defamatory meaning. </SPAN></P>

Relator's challenge to the court's jurisdiction on the ground that this complaint was not sworn to by the complainant was overruled during the trial.  Upon his conviction he was sentenced to pay a fine of $ 500, in default thereof, to 30 days' imprisonment. A violation of the Multiple Dwelling Code is an offense only (&sect; D26-8.0) and one over which the Magistrate's Court has jurisdiction ( N.  Y. City Crim. Cts. Act, &sect; 100).  The complaint as drawn was adequate to apprise relator of the charge against him and he participated fully in the trial.  The penalty imposed upon him coincided with the maximum penalty imposable for a first offense under the Multiple Dwelling Code.  Accordingly, the Magistrate had jurisdiction of the subject matter and of the relator and did not exceed it in rendering his judgment.</SPAN></P>

The taxpayer sought to have &sect; 20 declared unconstitutional and to prevent the public officials from incurring any liabilities or using any municipal funds for the purposes of the statute. The trial court found that the statute was constitutional but that certain sections were unconstitutional, but, because the unconstitutional sections were separable, they did not destroy the valid provisions of the statute. The court agreed with the trial court that defendants could validly collect taxes but it found that the provisions in question were constitutional. Section 20 did not violate the state constitution because it was not a local law and, as a general law, it did not have to be passed in accord with the provisions for enactment of local laws by the state legislature.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, members of the board of assessors of a village, appealed from orders of the Supreme Court, Delaware County (New York), which struck certain defenses as a sham, frivolous, and insufficient in law, and which granted respondent city's application thereby reducing the assessment upon the city's sewage disposal system within the village.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city owned real property in the village that it used for sewage disposal purposes. The city and the village entered into a contract that provided that the disposal plant would be exempt from taxation for a period of 10 years, and that the lands upon which the plant was situated could not be assessed in excess of $ 25,000 for that period. The board of assessors of the village assessed a tax on the sewage disposal system of $ 378,651. The city brought an action to review the assessment. The board of assessors argued that the agreement was not binding, that it was ultra vires and unconstitutional, and that the city's breach of other agreements justified rescission of the tax exemption. The court held that: (1) N.Y. Tax Law &sect;4, subd. 16-a provided for the tax exemption of a sewage disposal plant or system if the municipal corporation in which it was located agreed to the exemption in writing; (2) a tax exemption authorized by statute was not revocable; it was binding; (3) once the village consented to the tax exemption, the legislation took effect; (4) the village could not revoke the tax exemption; and (5) the trial court properly struck certain defenses raised by the village.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the orders of the trial court, with costs.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Taxation -- exemption -- contract between City of New York and Village of Margaretville, executed pursuant to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">section 406 (subd. 3) of Real Property Tax Law</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> and granting exemption to City of New York's sewage disposal system in village, is valid and binding and is not revocable by village.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The City of New York constructed a sewage disposal system in the Village of Margaretville, and on September 23, 1958 the city and the Village Board executed a contract whereby the village agreed that the disposal plant and system would be exempt from taxation for a period of 10 years.  The agreement provided also that the lands upon which the plant was situated would not be assessed in excess of $ 25,000 for such period.  The sewage disposal plant would ordinarily be taxable&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  property (Real Property Tax Law, &sect; 300).  However, section 406 (subd. 3) of the Real Property Tax Law provided that: &quot;Real property owned by a municipal corporation not within its corporate limits while used as a sewage disposal plant or system, including necessary connections and appurtenances, shall be wholly or partially exempt from taxation and exempt from special </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">ad valorem</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> levies and special assessments to the extent provided in section four hundred ninety of this chapter, by any municipal corporation in which located, provided the governing board thereof shall so agree in writing.&quot; Pursuant to the intention of the statute, the contract is binding on the village. The period of 10 years is within the bounds of propriety where the enabling statute contained no limitations of the term.  There appears to be a mutuality of consideration but, since the agreement was executed pursuant to expressed legislative intent, it is not important whether the village received a consideration.  The agreement was a legislative act by the Village Board which carried into effect a tax exemption authorized by the Legislature by virtue of a constitutional statute.  The exemption is not revocable&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  -- it is binding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The contention of the village that the agreement was integrated with two other agreements so that a breach of those agreements affects this one is without merit.  There is no reference to these agreements in the subject agreement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Accordingly, the court properly gave effect to the exemption agreement and reduced the assessment on the sewage disposal system.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Board contended that the trial court erred in overturning their denial of the applicant's request for a license and ordering that the license be issued, arguing that N.Y.

The court overturned the trial court's ruling. In so holding, the court found that: (1) N.Y. Town Law &sect; 137 provided guidance to the licensor, and therein contained an implied delegation of power to withhold a license for good cause; (2) a finding having been made that the applicant was a person unfit to be granted a license the scope of judicial inquiry was limited to the question of whether there was substantial evidence in the record to support the determination, or whether, on the other hand, the action was tantamount to an arbitrary or capricious abuse of discretion; and (3) there was substantial evidence to support the determination that petitioner was an unfit person to possess a license and the denial of the application was neither arbitrary nor capricious.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.  Section 137 of the Town Law sets forth procedures for the issuance of licenses for the junk business, and provides that the Town Clerk &quot;may also refuse a license to any person who in his judgment shall be an undesirable person or incapable of properly conducting the trade or business&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  desired.&quot; In a proceeding to compel issuance of a license, Special Term should not have declared this provision unconstitutional upon the ground that the phrase &quot;undesirable person&quot; is too &quot;vague, uncertain, ambiguous and illusory to furnish any proper standard.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The provision in section 137 of the Town Law that a license may be denied an undesirable person or one incapable of properly conducting the business furnishes some guidance to the licensor. If, however, there is an implied delegation of power to withhold a license for good cause in the absence of any standards in the statute defining good cause (cf.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Matter of Barton Trucking Corp. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">v.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11"> O'Connell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 7 N Y 2d 299), the enactment may not be struck down because the standards expressly stated are vague. In other words, if &quot;fitness&quot; may be passed upon by implication, vague or indefinite standards are better than none, and, in any event, none is required.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The finding that petitioner was a person unfit to be granted a license is supported by substantial evidence. The licensing body found that the applicant had made a false statement under oath in a prior court proceeding involving this license and in addition had refused&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to testify and offer any exculpatory proof with regard to the alleged perjurious statements.  </SPAN></P>

Petitioner, a self-styled American Nazi and, reputedly, a rabid racist, applied to the Commissioner of Parks for a permit to use Union Square Park to make a public political speech on July 4, 1960.  In August, 1960, after respondent Commissioner had denied the application without offering an alternative time or place, petitioner instituted a proceeding under article 78 of the Civil Practice Act to review the determination.  Since the Commissioner had before him only the application of petitioner, there was no competent record upon which to conclude that petitioner's speech was likely to create serious disorders.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of the judgment by the Supreme Court (New York) in favor of plaintiff, New York State Thruway Authority (authority), in an action to prohibit defendant from maintaining a sign within 500 feet of the nearest edge of the thruway pavement unless a written permit had been granted by the authority pursuant to N.Y. Pub. Auth. Law &sect; 361-a.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended &sect; 361-a violated the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the Federal Constitution and N.Y. Const. art. I, &sect; 6 by arbitrarily prohibiting some but not all advertising and retroactively deprived defendant of a vested right. In affirming, the court held the authority had the power to regulate advertising to provide maximum visibility, to prevent confusion with regard to traffic lights, signs, or signals, to preserve and enhance the thruway's natural scenic beauty, and to promote safety, comfort, and well-being of the users of the thruway. The court found the sign was originally placed on defendant's property, then relocated on the request of the Department of Public Works. Relocation was the same as erecting and the sign was within 500 feet of the thruway pavement, and defendant did not have a permit. The court held the rules were not arbitrary because if a permit was refused the authority had to state specifically the reasons for its refusal and defendant never made an application. The court finally held the restriction was in the interest of the welfare of the general public and was not considered a taking of property.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment in favor of the authority in its action to prohibit defendant from maintaining a sign within 500 feet of the nearest edge of the thruway pavement without a permit.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional law -- billboards near Thruway -- </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">statute</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Public Authorities Law, &sect; 361-a</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">) prohibiting erection or maintenance of any advertising devices within 500 feet of Thruway without permit from Thruway Authority was valid exercise of State's police power and did not violate equal protection or due process clauses of Federal or State Constitutions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.  Section 361-a of the Public Authorities Law prohibited the erection or maintenance of any advertising device within 500 feet of the pavement of the New York State Thruway without a written permit therefor from the Thruway Authority.  Enactment of the statute was justified as an exercise of the State's police power by the necessity of providing reasonable precautions to insure the safety and comfort of travelers on this high-speed, controlled access, express highway specially designed and constructed for the greatest possible visibility. Moreover, the statute did not arbitrarily prohibit&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  some but not all advertising and, therefore, did not violate the equal protection clause of the Federal Constitution (14th Amdt.) or the State Constitution (art. I, &sect; 6).  Accordingly, defendants were properly restrained from maintaining an advertising sign on their premises within 500 feet of the Thruway pavement without the permit required by the statute.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The statute did not retroactively deprive defendants of a vested right without due process of law inasmuch as their sign was erected after the effective date of the statute.  Relocating is the same as erecting, and defendants' sign, although originally erected on the same premises in 1937, was then in another location and was relocated in 1958 when the State acquired title to the original location for highway purposes, and the wording of the sign had been changed from its original form.  Accordingly it was properly determined to be a new and different sign.  In any event, subdivision 1 of section 361-a applied not only to the erection but to the maintenance of advertising devices, and defendants were enjoined from maintaining their sign without obtaining the permit required by the section.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Due process demands that laws&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  enacted pursuant to the police power be reasonable and not arbitrary, but section 361-a was not arbitrary on the claimed ground that subdivision 7 thereof gave the Thruway Authority the right to make exceptions excluding from coverage under the section advertising devices which it found do not interefere with Thruway safety or contravene enumerated standards, or on the claimed ground that article 5 of the Thruway Authority's rules and regulations defined certain exempt areas where advertising signs may be erected. The intent and purpose of the statute and the regulations was not to deny the right to have signs within the prescribed area, but to require the obtaining of a permit so as to regulate the use and maintenance of signs erected thereon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The determination as to the right to erect and maintain any sign within 500 feet of the Thruway is not made until after a permit has been applied for, and if the Authority denied an application for such permit, it would be required to state specifically its reasons for such denial.  Defendants, who have made no such application for a permit, and who have offered no proof of signs in exempt areas or as to other claimed discrimination to&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  sustain the burden of proof that they have in attacking the constitutionality of a statute, have no reason to claim discrimination.  </SPAN></P>

On appeal, the State argued that the trial court erred in dismissing the indictment. Upon review, the court found the State's argument without merit. The order dismissing the indictment required affirmance not because of the unconstitutionality of N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 1141, but because of the insufficiency of the indictment. The indictment was insufficient in that it failed to allege knowledge on the part of defendants. The various counts of the indictment stated that defendants sold obscene magazines.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, the New York State Board of Pharmacy and others, sought review of a judgment from the Supreme Court at Special Term, Erie County (New York), which granted a motion by plaintiff corporation for summary judgment and determined that the corporation had the right to sell Bayer Aspirin Tablets through unlicensed employees in its retail stores, for which the corporation did not have registration certificates.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The corporation sold the tablets in its retail stores without complying with certain provisions of the New York Education Law regulating the sale of drugs. The corporation claimed, and the trial court found, that such tablets were &quot;proprietary medicines&quot; and, as such, were exempt from the application of N.Y. Educ. Law art. 137. The corporation also contended that any attempt to interfere with the free and unlicensed sale of the tablets was unreasonable, arbitrary, discriminatory, and unconstitutional. The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of the corporation, and defendants appealed. The court reversed, holding that Bayer Aspirin Tablets were not so distinctively or exclusively attributable to their producers as to be regarded as specially the maker's own kind of medicine, and thus were not &quot;proprietary medicines&quot; excepted from N.Y. Educ. Law art. 137 by N.Y. Educ. Law &sect; 6816(2)(c). The court concluded that restricting the sale of such tablets, even though they may have been harmless, to registered pharmacists, was a valid exercise of the State's police power, under which all pharmacists were treated alike and all general retailers were treated alike.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants appealed their convictions in the Bronx County Court (New York) for the crimes of robbery in the first degree, grand larceny in the second degree, and assault in the second degree.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A victim was robbed by three individuals, including defendants. One of the robbers was apprehended immediately following the crime. He implicated defendants in the crime but the indictment against the apprehended individual listed his codefendant under fictitious designations. A detective questioned one defendant while he was incarcerated and again while he was at the courthouse. The detective testified that he gave a full confession each time but there were no notes of the confession. The detective never informed defendant of his right to counsel or asked if defendant had retained counsel. The court held that the questioning of defendant while he was in custody, was a suspect in the crime, and was without counsel was a violation of his constitutional rights. The court held that the admission of defendant's confession at trial required the reversal of the remaining defendant's conviction because the admission of such confession redounded to the prejudice of this defendant.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgments of conviction and ordered a new trial.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- confessions -- testimony of detective that after defendants were indicted one defendant made complete oral confessions to him when questioned without counsel was improperly admitted at defendants' trial; principles of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">People v. Di Biasi (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">7 N Y 2d 544)</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> held to control and require reversal of convictions of both defendants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Defendants were convicted of robbery, first degree, grand larceny, second degree, and assault, second degree, upon an indictment returned February 24, 1959, which originally denoted defendants by fictitious names.  Upon their trial a detective testified that he had questioned defendant Waterman on June 17, 1959, while he was incarcerated in the Tombs, and on June 29, 1959 at the county courthouse, and that defendant had made a complete confession on each occasion.  Such testimony&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  was improperly admitted into evidence.  Although it is not clear when defendants' real names were substituted in the indictment, there is no doubt that the defendant Waterman was in fact an accused at the time he was questioned. At that time he was without counsel and was not asked by the detective if he had retained or had been assigned counsel. However, the fact that he was without counsel when questioned by one who knew that he was an accused should not deprive him of the benefit of the principle of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">People </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">v.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11"> Di Biasi</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (7 N Y 2d 544) which applies to require reversal of defendant's conviction.  Although this limits section 395 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, and appears to be contrary to the general principle governing admissibility of confessions -- that no one will voluntarily make an admission against interest -- the circumstances under which the alleged confession was obtained may, upon further evidence, show it to have been involuntary, inasmuch as the detective stated that the defendant Waterman did not solicit his visit or declare any intent or wish to make a statement prior thereto.  The mere fact that he was in custody at the time of the alleged confession would&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  not prevent its admission, but the fact that he was then known by his interrogator to be an accused, together with other circumstances existing, required reversal of his conviction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The error committed by receiving such confession into evidence redounded to the prejudice of the codefendant Devine as well and required reversal of his conviction also.  Moreover, the limiting effect of Waterman's confession was not sufficiently delineated by the court as to Devine in view of the prosecutor's continued references thereto.  </SPAN></P>

Such rebottling and resale, with complete disclosure of the facts of rebottling and of no connection between the rebottler and plaintiff or the manufacturer, and with no misstatement of any fact to the deception of a purchaser, did not constitute a violation of subdivision 6 of section 2354 of the Penal Law, although the literal language of the statute made it a misdemeanor to sell trade-marked goods except &quot;in the original package, box or bottle and under the labels, marks or names placed thereon by the manufacturer who is entitled to use such marks&quot; and the statute contained no qualification expressly related to the element of fraud or deception. Statutes are not to be read so literally as to kill their meaning, intent, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  purpose or the beneficial ends for which they were designed, and it has been uniformly held that this is a fraud statute requiring misrepresentation, tacit or expressed, before there could be a violation.

Indeed, such a literal interpretation of the statute, which refers only to the &quot;manufacturer&quot; who is entitled to use the trade names, would cause difficulty to plaintiff which itself is not the manufacturer, but an importer and rebottler.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. If the statute were interpreted as condemning activity in the absence of fraud, there would be a serious question of its constitutional validity.  However, the constitutional issues may be avoided and the constitutional limits of the legislation need not be explored in view of the controlling interpretations of the statute.  Although the mere potentiality for fraud, as distinguished from the actuality of fraud, may allow exercise of the police power to restrict commercial activity, the power to legislate is less in an area of mere potentiality for fraud as compared with actual fraud. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Moreover, requiring statutes to be literally construed as long as such construction does not violate a constitution is a primitive literalism which does not necessarily yield intention.  The fact is that intent is not discovered by literal reading of abstracted words, but by interpretation in context and circumstances.  In any event there is a positive obligation to avoid stretching the statutory language in unnecessary violation of precedents and to the disruption of commerce.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Injunction will not lie merely to prevent a crime, although it is available if the criminal act causes damage or impairs a property right.  But inasmuch as the application of this criminal statute to defendants would involve an extension of protectible interests in trade-marks not even recognized under Federal law, such trade-mark rights do not extend to resale in the absence of deception, and plaintiff, therefore, has no property or equivalent right to protect, and consequently was not entitled to the injunction it sought to restrain defendants' rebottling and resale.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The complaint was defective as to the individual defendants.  Merely to say that an individual is the owner of stock of a corporation&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and controls its activities does not imply that he is responsible for every act of the corporation.  Accordingly, the complaint, which fails to allege any cause of action against any of the defendants, should have been dismissed for legal insufficiency.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner of housing accommodations styled as a hotel sought a declaratory judgment that the Temporary State Housing Rent Commission was without power to regulate the rents charged by it. It asserted that the 1959 amendments to the controlling statute (L. 1959, ch. 695), under which the Rent Commission acted, were not applicable, and that, in any event, the amendments were unconstitutional. On cross motions for summary judgment, the lower court granted judgment in favor of the owner, holding that the amendments were limited to revesting rent control in the Rent Commission only regarding purported hotels whose rents had been regulated by the Rent Commission at some prior time. The appellate court reversed, holding that the 1959 amendments were applicable to the premises and there was no constitutional infirmity. The amendments were applicable to housing accommodations styled as hotels that did not satisfy the definition of hotels in the statute, even though such housing accommodations had not been subject to rent control since 1950. Also, the 1959 amendments in conferring power upon the Rent Commission to fix rents contained sufficient legislative standards and were valid.</SPAN></P>

[b]) applied to authorize fixing maximum rents for premises theretofore exempt or decontrolled as &quot;hotel&quot;; amendment (&sect; 4, subd. 2-b), when read together with following subdivision 3, contained sufficient legislative standards for commission in fixing maximum rents and was, therefore, valid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Both the language of the 1959 amendments to the State Residential Rent Law (L. 1946, ch. 274, as amd. by L. 1959, ch. 695) and the report to the Legislature by the Temporary State Commission to Study Rents and Rental Conditions preceding enactment of the amendments make it evident that they had the intent and effect of vesting in the Temporary State Housing Rent Commission control of rents in purported hotels which no longer qualify as such, whether or not they had at some prior time been properly classified as hotels and, therefore, exempt or decontrolled under the statute and not subject to rent control since 1950.  In order to be excluded from regulation (State Residential Rent Law, &sect; 2, subd. 2, par. [b]) a hotel must have been within the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  statutory definition of such not only on March 1, 1950, but also at the present time.  Accordingly, the 1959 amendments apply to housing accommodations called hotels which no longer satisfy the statutory definition thereof even though they once were properly so classified and, therefore, have not been subject to rent control since 1950.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Subdivision 2-b of section 4 of the statute (added by L. 1959, ch.  695) provided for regulations by the commission for the establishment, adjustment and modification of maximum rents in rooming houses, including the erstwhile &quot;hotels&quot; which, as stated in the legislative report, have deteriorated &quot;into rooming houses or worse&quot;.  The subdivision provided that such regulations were to be promulgated by the commission &quot;having regard for any factors bearing on the equities involved, consistent with the purposes of this act&quot;.  If read in isolation, this would give the commission power to fix maximum rents based only on equitable factors and might well be invalid as containing insufficient legislative standards.  However, the subdivision was made part of section 4 of the act which also contains, immediately thereafter, subdivision 3 providing that the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  commission should fix minimum rents &quot;having regard to the maximum rents for comparable housing accommodations&quot; as well as equitable factors consistent with the purposes of the act.  If these subdivisions are read together, there are sufficient legislative standards to guide the commission, and the statutes are entitled to a presumption of validity and to that construction, if available, which will support constitutionality.  Accordingly, if the subdivision is read to require the commission to consider maximum rents for comparable housing accommodations and only then to adjust by equitable factors, it is invulnerable to attack.  Such construction of the statute has, in fact, been continuously followed by the Rent Commission (State Rent and Eviction Regulations, &sect; 36), whose administrative interpretation of the statute was entitled to the greatest weight.  </SPAN></P>

The stockholder alleged that the foreign corporation had been nationalized by the Cuban government and had ceased doing business. The court found that the stockholder sought the appointment of a receiver asserting that service of the summons could not be effected with due diligence. The trial court denied the foreign corporation's motion for alternative relief from the trial court's order appointing a receiver finding that the issues presented could only be decided after a trial. On appeal, the court affirmed finding that although the appointment of a receiver was not mandatory, it was not an abuse of discretion for the trial court to appoint a receiver.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A town superintendent advertised for bids for the town to buy a snowplow. The town officials agreed that the superintendent should buy the equipment. The indictment concerned three bids for the snowplow. The superintendent of the town when testifying before the grand jury stated that he had requested three bids although the specifications were drafted so that only the exclusive distributor's equipment could qualify for the bid. Defendant, the exclusive distributor of the equipment in the county, asked two of the other defendants, the manufacturer of the equipment and the distributor in an adjacent territory, to submit bids. The State did not present any evidence that the lowest bid was improper or that it failed to meet specifications. The court dismissed the indictment.

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendants were indicted for conspiracy (Penal Law &sect; 580).  The Town Board of the Town of Woodstock adopted a resolution for the standardization of equipment, materials and supplies, pursuant to subdivision 5 of section 103 of the General Municipal Law, and authorized the Superintendent of Highways to advertise for bids for &quot;one Walter four-wheel positive drive snow plow&quot;.  The Superintendent requested three bids although the specifications were so drafted that Walter equipment alone could qualify. Defendant Bareika was the exclusive distributor&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  for Walter equipment in the county, and requested defendant Walter Motor Truck Company, manufacturer of the equipment, and defendant Rand-MacMurray, Inc., distributor in an adjacent territory, to submit bids. Admittedly, the two bids, other than that of Bareika, were at the request of and for the accommodation of defendant Bareika but that does not imply there was any criminal rigging or collusion or effort on the part of defendants to conceal what they were doing.  Such conduct cannot be considered as evidence of criminal intent by those two bidders to commit unlawful, willful and corrupt acts constituting a conspiracy between them and Bareika.  As to Bareika, his intent and purpose was solely to satisfy the requirements of the Town Superintendent.  The acts of defendants did not obstruct justice or the due administration of the law -- section 103 of the General Municipal Law. That statute did not require three bids. The indictment should be dismissed.  </SPAN></P>

The court at Special Term therefore construed the law correctly in that regard in granting an application for an order directing that petitioner's construction account be credited with the amount constituting the tax paid to the United States on the sum previously transferred to petitioner's general funds and directing future similar Federal income tax payments.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, who were all attorneys, sought review of an order from the County Court, Kings County (New York), which adjudged each defendant guilty of criminal contempt of court pursuant to N.Y. Jud. Law &sect; 750, subd. A, para. 5. Defendants had been adjudged guilty for their failure to answer questions before a certain grand jury.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The subjects of the grand jury's investigation were whether there had been any unlawful solicitation of legal business in violation of N.Y. Penal Law art. 24 and the existence of a conspiracy to violate that statute. When subpoenaed and sworn before the grand jury, defendants were advised of the purpose and scope of the investigation, and were additionally advised that the grand jury was prepared to issue them immunity permitted by N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 2447. Each defendant refused to answer the propounded questions and was subsequently adjudged guilty of criminal contempt. In affirming, the court noted that defendants were not prospective defendants or targets of the grand jury's investigation. Statutory immunity having been granted them as witnesses, with such immunity being as broad as that guaranteed by N.Y Const. art. I, &sect; 6, defendants were compelled to testify. Furthermore, there was no constitutional deficiency in the application of N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 2447 in the instant case. Therefore, because defendants were compelled to testify on matters relevant to the grand jury's inquiry, their refusal to do so, in the face of being advised of their immunity, constituted contempt.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Witnesses -- immunity and contempt -- two attorneys properly adjudged in contempt for refusal, after immunity, to answer question relevant to Grand Jury inquiry into conspiracies to solicit law business.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Two attorneys who had received from a Grand Jury full statutory immunity from prosecution (Penal Law, &sect;&sect; 584, 2447) and who had been advised that such immunity had been conferred upon them, and who still refused to answer a proper question (Judiciary Law, &sect; 750, subd. A, par.  5) in the Grand Jury's inquiry into unlawful solicitation of legal business (Penal Law, art. 24) and into criminal conspiracies among attorneys and others to violate said article (Penal Law, art. 54), were properly adjudged in criminal contempt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Though possibly conspirators with others, the immune witnesses themselves cannot be said to&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  be prospective defendants (N. Y. Const., art.  I, &sect; 6).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Whether or not immunity can be conferred (under Penal Law, &sect; 2447) against prosecution for unlawful solicitation of legal business (Penal Law, art. 24) is an academic question at this time; at this time the witnesses have refused to answer a question which is relevant to the inquiry into conspiracy (Penal Law, art. 54, &sect; 584) to violate article 24 of the Penal Law. So long as questions put to witnesses are relevant to inquiry into criminal conspiracy, immunity has been conferred, and the witnesses have been so advised, and they must answer.  </SPAN></P>

Defendant was again indicted, and his motion to dismiss the indictment on the ground that he had been denied his constitutional right to a speedy trial was denied. He was again convicted. The court determined that an accused could be prosecuted for a felony even though an indictment may have been dismissed for want of, or delay in, prosecution. The court explained that the right to a dismissal, if an indictment was not promptly found, and the right to a speedy trial after indictment, were provided by statute, so they were only guaranteed to defendants against whom criminal prosecutions were pending and did not restrict the right of the State to commence criminal prosecutions within the time limited by law. The court noted that defendant's reindictment and subsequent prosecution were expressly authorized by law and there was nothing unconstitutional in the statutes, which authorized them. The court concluded that the U.S. Const. amend. VI right to a speedy trial applied to the United States courts alone and did not restrict the powers of the State governments.</SPAN></P>

The trial court denied a request for a temporary injunction as to the requirement that an annually renewable permit had to be obtained in order to lawfully operate any premises for a &quot;private school&quot; and that such premises were subject to setback restrictions and restrictions limiting the number of students proportionately to square feet of &quot;classroom area&quot; and &quot;cleared outdoor activity area.&quot; The court held that there were serious questions regarding the constitutionality of the municipal legislation and the interpretation given them.

The special term held that the village failed to file a timely appeal. The court affirmed, finding that (1) the Board had jurisdiction to grant the variance, its determination was reviewable by a proceeding pursuant to N.Y. C.P.L.R. art. 78, the village failed to appeal, and the time to appeal had long since passed; (2) there was ample proof in the record to sustain the determination of the special term that the rezoned property was unfit for one-family residential use; and (3) the owners' proof of that fact met their burden of showing that the amendment, as it pertained to their property, was so unreasonable and arbitrary as to constitute an invasion of property rights contrary to constitutional due process and, as such, was invalid, illegal, and void.</SPAN></P>

Respondent attorney general filed a motion to dismiss the appeals.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The hospital filed a certificate about 16 days after the commitment order was made.

The patient appealed the trial court's order denying her motion to vacate the commitment order. The court of appeals dismissed. The hospital was entitled to the full period of 60 days to observe and treat the patient. The court held that the period of 30 days within which a judicial review may be sought did not commence until the expiration of the 60 days from the date of the making of the commitment order. The application for a jury trial as to the issue of mental illness was timely because it was commenced within the period of 90 days after the making of the commitment order. The court held that the patient's request for a jury trial should have been granted. The court held that the constitutionality challenge to N.Y. Mental Hyg.

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Insane and other incompetent persons -- jury trial of insanity -- time limitation -- Mental Hygiene Law ( &sect; 74, subd. 7; &sect; 76) provides that, where alleged mentally ill person has been certified to and confined in mental institution, certificate</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> may be filed within 60 days from date of commitment order whereupon order shall become final, and that review may be had within 30 days after making of order -- certificate filed 16 days after making of order but no notice of such filing was given -- application for hearing and jury trial timely made, in absence of notice, where made approximately 60 days after order -- under circumstances, 30-day period does not commence to run until expiration of 60 days from date of making of commitment order -- issues presented such as to require decision although moot or academic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.  Section 74 of the Mental Hygiene Law provides that an alleged mentally ill person may be certified to and confined in an institution upon an order made by certain named judicial officers upon a certificate of two examining physicians, accompanied by a petition therefor.  In the absence of a preliminary hearing, the judge, upon finding that the person requires care and treatment, may order his commitment for a period not exceeding 60 days for the purpose of observation and treatment.  Subdivision 7 of section 74 authorizes certain named officials of the institution, upon a finding that continued care and treatment&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  is required, to file a certificate to that effect in the office of the County Clerk at any time prior to the expiration of 60 days from the date of the commitment order and, upon the filing of such certificate, the order shall become final.  Section 76 of the Mental Hygiene Law provides that a rehearing and review of the proceedings may be had &quot;within thirty days after the making of such order&quot;.  On April 17, 1957 petitioner was committed to the Rochester State Hospital by an order of a County Judge.  Sixteen days after the order was made, the certificate was filed but no notice of such filing was given.  Approximately 60 days after the order was made, petitioner sought a rehearing and jury trial as provided in section 76 of the Mental Hygiene Law. The application was timely.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. It is not necessary to hold in this case that the hospital must give notice of the determination that the temporary confinement of an alleged mentally ill person has become final.  It is sufficient to hold that, in the absence of such notice, the period of 30 days within which a judicial review may be sought does not commence to run until the expiration of 60 days from the date of the making of the commitment&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  order. The application herein for a jury trial as to the issue of mental illness was timely inasmuch as it was commenced within the period of 90 days after the making of the commitment order, and the request for a jury trial should have been granted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The right to a jury trial to decide the question of insanity is a constitutional right.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Petitioner is entitled to the remedy in the present action even though the remedy of habeas corpus is available to one in custody (Mental Hygiene Law, &sect; 204).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. It is alleged in the moving papers that petitioner was discharged from custody on May 21, 1958.  An appellate court usually declines to decide questions which have become moot or academic but the courts will entertain moot or academic questions where the question is of major importance and will arise again and again and invites immediate decision.  The issues presented in these appeals are such as to require decision.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Intervenor neighbors challenged the Supreme Court at Special Term in Oswego County (New York) order directing respondents, city and zoning board, to issue a building permit to petitioner substation owner for construction of a substation. The neighbors asserted that there was insufficient evidence that it was reasonably necessary to build the substation at the chosen site.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The substation owner initiated a proceeding under art. 78 of the New York Civil Practice Act seeking a zoning variance and an order to compel respondents to issue a permit for construction of a substation at a proposed site. The neighbors of the proposed site intervened. The trial court upheld the zoning board's denial of the variance, but granted an order in the nature of mandamus directing respondents to issue a building permit. This was done without any hearing on the permit issue, but based on the testimony before the board in the variance proceeding. The neighbors appealed the issuance of the permit, asserting there was insufficient evidence to support it. The court reversed, ruling that while the proof before the board was sufficient to establish the necessity for the substation to be built, it was not adequate to show necessity for its construction at the specific site selected. Proof that the chosen site was &quot;ideal&quot; was not enough. There was no evidence that any consideration had been given to the availability of other sites and to their relative degree of detriment to neighboring properties compared to their advantages from the standpoints of safety and efficiency.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed, with costs, the order directing respondents to issue a building permit to the substation owner, and remitted for further proceedings to determine the reasonable necessity for the site selected.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The petitioner brought an article 78 proceeding to annul the denial by the Board of Zoning Appeals of the City of Fulton of an application for a variance to enable it to build an electrical substation in a residential&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  district or, in the alternative, for an order directing the city to issue a permit authorizing petitioner to build the substation without regard to the provisions of the zoning ordinance. The court at Special Term confirmed the determination of the Zoning Board of Appeals denying the variance but granted an order in the nature of mandamus directing the issuance of a building permit without holding any hearing but upon the basis of testimony given at the hearing before the board in the variance proceeding.  The evidence before the board in the variance proceeding was not properly before the court in connection with the proceeding in the nature of mandamus. The court should have required petitioner to present proof before the court in support of its contention, and should have given intervenors an opportunity to cross-examine the witnesses for the petitioner and to offer countervailing proof.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.

Even&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  if it could be said that the intervenors had impliedly agreed to have the mandamus aspect of the proceeding decided upon the basis of the evidence produced in the variance proceeding, the evidence was not sufficient to warrant the granting of the relief sought by petitioner.  The proof was not sufficient to demonstrate that it was necessary for petitioner to build its substation upon the particular site which it had selected.  No proof was offered by petitioner of the unavailability of other sites which might cause less disruption of the community zoning plan or less detriment to neighboring property.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner taxpayer sought a refund for city sales taxes paid. Respondent, Comptroller of the City of New York (comptroller), denied the claim for a refund and the New York Supreme Court at Special Term, New York County, affirmed the comptroller's judgment. The taxpayer appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer operated vending machines and did not collect sales taxes on its sales. The taxpayer argued that New York City, N.Y., Admin. Code &sect; N41, precluded the imposition of responsibility for taxes it could not collect, and equated its liability with the purchaser's obligation to pay the tax levied. The court disagreed, holding that the vendor was under a duty to pay the tax whether collected from the purchaser or not. The court held that it would have been a distortion of the purpose of the below minimum provision of the tax law to conclude that it eliminated the payment of all sales taxes by the vendor, not collected from vendees. Because the comptroller was given the power to permit the vendor to waive the collection of the tax from purchasers on below minimum sales, and thus absorb it, it did not follow that included was the power to grant complete exemption to a vendor from liability for the tax. The comptroller's regulation enacted under &sect; N41, was in all respects, reasonable and valid, especially since any attempt to collect a tax of less than one penny on individual sales presented manifold problems.</SPAN></P>

Petitioner did not charge or collect sales taxes on the merchandise. Pursuant to authority granted by statute (Administrative Code of City of New York, &sect; N41-3.0), the Comptroller of the City of New York adopted a regulation requiring the collection of 1 cent for purchases of 17 cents to 66 cents, and 2 cents on purchases from 67 cents to $ 1.16, but also providing that no vendor was exempt from the payment of the tax on sales of 16 cents or less, that every vendor must pay the total tax due and in no event might the tax be less than 2% of the amount of the vendor's taxable sales, including sales of 16 cents or less (cf.

Dismissing the proceeding, the court held that the board had the power to vary the provisions of the zoning ordinance by granting an extension of time within which to complete the construction and that its power was properly exercised.

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. On July 6, 1953 the owners of a parcel of land in the City of Yonkers filed plans for the erection of an apartment building.  The zoning ordinance then in effect placed this property in an &quot;A-2&quot; district, wherein high density apartment houses were a permitted use.  A new zoning ordinance, effective November 15, 1953, changed the district in which the property is located to &quot;MG&quot;, wherein the proposed use is not permissible.  However, the new ordinance provided that nothing contained therein should require any change in the plans, construction or designated use of a building for which the completed plans had theretofore been filed, if (a) construction was commenced within 210 days of the date of the permit, (b) the ground-story framework, including the second tier of beams, was completed within one year of the date of the permit, and (c) the entire building was completed within two years from the date of permit.  On November&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  30, 1953 a permit for the erection of the building was issued by the Superintendent of Buildings of the City of Yonkers.  In April, 1954 construction was begun.  On June 7, 1954 four of the present petitioners and others, owners of nearby property, instituted an action against the City of Yonkers and others to restrain construction on the grounds that (a) construction contravened the applicable provisions of the 1953 zoning ordinance, and (b) 1954 amendments extending the time for commencement of construction were unconstitutional.  A judgment enjoining further construction of the building was reversed by the Appellate Division and that reversal was affirmed by the Court of Appeals on June 14, 1957.  ( </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Seltzer </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">v.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11"> City of Yonkers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 1 N Y 2d 782.) On September 12, 1957 the time to make application to the United States Supreme Court for review expired. Accordingly, a final judicial determination had been made that the building permit of November 30, 1953 was legally issued and that construction thereunder was legally commenced within the time limited by the zoning ordinance. On October 17, 1957 the Superintendent of Buildings indorsed on the original permit a renewal thereof. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Petitioners appealed to the Zoning Board of Appeals of the City of Yonkers from this decision and the board held that the action of the Superintendent was proper.  The present proceeding to annul the determination of the board should be dismissed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The Building Code of the City of Yonkers provides that a building permit expires by limitation if no work is commenced thereunder within one year from the time of issuance. Here construction was commenced in April, 1954, which was within one year from the time of issuance of the permit on November 30, 1953.  Therefore, the permit did not expire by reason of the limitation contained in the building code and there was no necessity for its renewal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Assuming that, as petitioners argue, there was no necessity for renewal, the proceeding should be dismissed because petitioners' appeal to the board fails.  There was nothing from which they could appeal.  Assuming, on the other hand, that the renewal amounted to no more than a determination that the original permit had not expired, the proceeding should be dismissed because concededly the renewal on that ground would be proper.  If, again, the original permit had expired by reason of the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  limitation contained in the zoning ordinance and there is no power to vary those time limitations, this proceeding must be dismissed because the question may not be determined by the Superintendent nor by the board nor by the court in an article 78 proceeding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. However, the proceeding should be dismissed because the board had the power to vary the provisions of the zoning ordinance by granting an extension of time within which to complete the construction and its power was properly exercised under the circumstances here disclosed.  Subdivision 4 of section 81 of the General City Law grants a board of appeals power, in passing on appeals, to vary or modify the application of any of the regulations or provisions of a zoning ordinance relating to the construction of buildings where there are practical difficulties or unnecessary hardship in the way of carrying out the strict letter of any such ordinance. The board had the power to modify not only under that statute but also under the ordinance in question.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. The owners demonstrated practical difficulties and unnecessary hardship in the way of carrying out the time conditions imposed by the ordinance. The time limitations were not&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  complied with solely because of the prior litigation instituted by four of the present petitioners and by petitioners' appeal to the board here under review.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. Insofar as </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Matter of Glass </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">v.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11"> Zoning Bd. of Appeals of City of Yonkers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (5 A D 2d 991) held that there was no power to extend the time limits contained in the zoning ordinance, it is overruled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. It has been held that requirements where a use variance is involved do not apply to an area variance ( </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Matter of Village of Bronxville </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">v.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11"> Francis</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 1 A D 2d 236, affd.  1 N Y 2d 839). Neither do these requirements apply to a time variance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. To fail to dismiss the petition under the circumstances of this case would be harsh, inequitable and unjust.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to 1903 N.Y.

Laws 559, which enacted a new charter for the city, 1903 N.Y. Laws 485, &sect; 6 was repealed. Despite the 1910 repeal, the tax moneys were paid to the association until 1957, when the taxes were paid to the city for the first time. The association filed an action seeking, among other things, to recover the tax moneys for 1957. The trial court granted summary judgment for respondents dismissing the action. The court reversed the judgment and granted summary judgment for the association. The title of the 1910 act expressed as its only purpose the enactment of the new charter, whereas the substance of the act embraced not only the new charter, but also repealed 1903 N.Y. Laws 485, &sect; 6. Thus, the 1910 act violated N.Y. Const. art. III, &sect; 15 because it embraced more than one subject and the second subject was not expressed in the title. Hence, the 1910 act was unconstitutional insofar as it attempted to repeal the association's right to receive the tax moneys.</SPAN></P>

So far as it appeared from the record, the corporation was engaged in New York in the business of leasing shipping containers and derived its income therefrom.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner milk dealer appealed the order of the Supreme Court in Ontario County (New York), which dismissed the dealer's request that respondent city health officer be required to issue a permit to the dealer.

(Sept. 18, 1929) required that all pasteurized milk offered for sale in the city be pasteurized in the city. The dealer's milk was pasteurized outside of the city. The lower court dismissed the dealer's petition that sought to require the city to issue the dealer a permit to sell milk and the other relief sought by the dealer, and the court reversed. The court held that N.Y. State Sanit. Code ch. III, reg. 4 prohibited supplementary regulations by municipalities pertaining to milk processing and handling. The court further ruled that the city's resolution was unreasonable, discriminatory, and unconstitutional because the state strictly inspected milk plants, and there was no health justification requiring that the pasteurization of the milk occur within the city. Thus, the dealer was entitled to have his request for a milk permit processed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the lower court's order and remitted the matter to the city health officer to process the dealer's request for a permit and to disregard the city's resolution dealing with the pasteurization of milk.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The Board of Health and Public Safety of the City of Canandaigua on September 18, 1929, adopted a resolution reading as follows: &quot;Resolved, that commencing at the present date, all pasteurized milk offered for sale in the city of Canandaigua, must be pasteurized in the city of Canandaigua&quot;.  Respondent, Health Officer of the City of Canandaigua, refused to issue a permit to petitioner to sell milk in Canandaigua which had been pasteurized outside of Canandaigua.  An order of the court at Special Term dismissing the petition for an order directing that a permit be issued is reversed and the matter is remitted to respondent Health Officer of the City of Canandaigua with directions to take such proceedings as she may be authorized or required to take under the Agriculture and Markets Law and the Sanitary Code in passing upon the petitioner's application, disregarding, however, the provisions of the 1929 resolution of the Board of Health and Public Safety of the City of Canandaigua ( </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Lang's Creamery </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">v.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11"> City of Niagara Falls</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 224 App. Div. 483, 251 N.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner transferee sought review from an order of the Supreme Court of Albany County (New York), which confirmed orders of respondent commission and dismissed a petition to review, correct or modify said orders in an action regarding a condition imposed by the commission on the transferee's ability to engage in interstate commerce.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A holder of a certificate of convenience and necessity desired to transfer the certificate to the transferee. The commission imposed a condition upon its approval of the transfer for a motor freight route entirely within the State of New York. The condition imposed, in effect, was that the transferee as the new holder of the certificate of convenience and necessity would not engage under the authority of that certificate in interstate commerce within the state. The commission sought to prevent the transferor from making two transportation operations open up where one existed before unless there was a further consideration of the basic questions of convenience and necessity. A supreme court confirmed the order of the commission, and the transferee appealed. The court affirmed because it was not demonstrated that the commission's decision was either arbitrary or unreasonable. The court ruled that in undertaking to exercise its constitutional power over interstate commerce in this field Congress delegated to the commission jurisdiction to pass on the certification of convenience and necessity for the motor transportation of goods in interstate commerce entirely within New York.</SPAN></P>

[a]; U. S. Code, tit. 49, &sect; 306, subd. [a]).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The predecessor of petitioner's transferor had obtained an Interstate Commerce Commission certificate of convenience and necessity for a route within the State of New York in 1935, when such certificate first was needed because of the Congressional enactment that year of the Motor Carrier Act. The certificate was issued by the Interstate Commerce Commission for an interstate operation entirely within New York rather than by the Public Service Commission because New York had not yet established any authority over this kind of operation within the State.  In 1938 article 3-B of the Public Service Law was enacted, and the Public Service Commission issued a certificate for the route in 1938 after the enactment of the New York statute, but the 1935 Interstate Commerce Commission certificate continued in effect and the operator had possession of two official papers based on convenience and necessity for the same route. After the enactment of the 1938 statute, the Public Service Commission certificate would have contemplated both interstate&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and intrastate operation.  In 1948 both certificates were transferred to petitioner's transferor. He sold the two certificates to different parties.  The Interstate Commerce Commission conditioned its approval of the transfer of the Federal certificate by providing that the transferor should not conduct operations in interstate commerce &quot;by virtue of the possession of any intrastate certificate now held by him&quot;.  Nevertheless, he contracted to sell the Public Service Commission certificate to petitioner.  In approving the transfer, the Public Service Commission had the power to impose a condition that petitioner shall not engage, under the authority of that certificate, in interstate commerce within New York.  The effect is that the certificates cannot be used to create two operations in interstate commerce by the device of separate transfers where there has been a single operation authorized and contemplated by both public agencies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Congress has delegated to the New York Public Service Commission jurisdiction to pass on the certification of convenience and necessity for the motor transportation of goods in interstate commerce entirely within New York (Motor Carrier Act, &sect; 206, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  subd. [a]; U. S. Code, tit. 49, &sect; 306, subd. [a]).  The Public Service Commission has the power to consider the consequences to interstate commerce of its certificates of convenience and necessity. </SPAN></P>

On review the court found no reversible error. There was a water cooler next to the railing and there was testimony to the effect that employees occasionally sat on the railing. Medical opinion was divided as to whether decedent committed suicide. The rationale of the Board's decision was that nothing in the record contradicted the possibility that the decedent leaned over the railing, or sat on it, and accidentally fell to his death. Moreover, there was no evidence of a strong motive for suicide, and any inference to be drawn from a possible recurrence of the decedent's mental illness was negated by the fact that his fellow employees failed to notice anything unusual in his behavior.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant witnesses sought review of two orders of the Supreme Court at Special Term (New York), which granted applications by respondent investigative commission (commission) for warrants which committed each witness to jail for their refusal to answer certain questions at hearings that were conducted by the commission.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The commission subpoenaed the witnesses and commanded them to appear at a public hearing. The commission conferred immunity from prosecution by state authorities upon each witness in accordance with N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 2447. The witnesses refused to answer the questions. Upon the application of the commission, the witnesses were jailed for their refusal to respond to the questions. The witnesses appealed. Upon review, the court affirmed the orders, holding that immunity was properly conferred upon each witness. The court held that (1) pursuant to its legislative power, as provided in N.Y. Const. art. III, &sect; 1, the legislature was vested with the power to enact the statute which created the commission, (2) the grant of immunity was absolute and was coextensive with their privilege against self incrimination, (3) the fact that the witnesses might have been potentially exposed to federal prosecution did not render the immunity invalid, (4) the commission did not pursue the wrong remedy in bringing the proceedings pursuant to the N.Y.

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Subpoenas were issued by Commission of Investigation of the State of New York commanding appellants to appear at a public hearing being conducted by the commission.  At the first hearing, the chairman announced that it was being held in connection with a certain meeting in November, 1957, at the residence of one Joseph Barbara in Tioga County.  The purposes of the hearing were stated to be &quot;Whether the crimes of conspiracy, violation of section 340 of the General Business Law which pertains to monopoly or restraint of trade statutes, bribery of public officials or any other crimes were committed or planned at this meeting.&quot; &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Each appellant appeared before the commission and was asked a series of questions, each of which would have been relevant to one of the subjects of the investigation as stated in each subpoena to be &quot;the organization, purposes and participants of, and discussions had and decisions made at&quot; the meeting in Tioga County.  Each appellant refused to answer all questions, basing such refusal on the privilege against self incrimation and other grounds.  Following such refusal, the members of the commission, according to statutory authority (L. 1958, ch. 989, &sect; 7), conferred immunity upon each appellant in accord with section 2447 of the Penal Law. Each witness was then informed that he had immunity &quot;from prosecution by the New York State authorities on account of any transaction, matter or thing of a criminal nature which may be revealed by your truthful and responsive answers to the particular questions which this Commission * * * may now direct you to answer.&quot; Again each witness refused to answer the questions.  All of the appellants were properly committed to jail for refusal to answer the questions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Chapter 989 of the Laws of 1958 creating the commission is not unconstitutional.&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Section 2 of article V of the State Constitution provides for 19 civil departments in the State Government.  Section 3 provides that &quot;No new departments shall be created hereafter, but this shall not prevent the legislature from creating temporary commissions for special purposes&quot;.  The commission is a temporary one and the functions, powers and duties thereunder are &quot;special purposes&quot; within the meaning of section 3 of article V of the State Constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Section 7 of the statute (L. 1958, ch. 989) provides that, in any investigation or hearing conducted by the commission relating to any claim with respect to which, by express statutory provision, a competent authority is authorized to confer immunity, immunity may be conferred by the commission in accord with the provisions of section 2447 of the Penal Law &quot;but only after affording the attorney-general and the appropriate district attorney the opportunity to be heard in respect to any objections which they may have to the granting of such immunity.&quot; Immunity was properly conferred upon each appellant.  Each was informed of the grant and extent of the immunity flowing therefrom (cf.  Penal Law, &sect; 2447, subd. 2).  The immunity&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  conferred was not limited to the crimes the commission stated it was investigating. It was a complete immunity, coextensive with their privilege against self incrimination (N. Y. Const., art. I, &sect; 6).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The commission was not required to disclose communications had with the Attorney-General and the various District Attorneys in accord with section 7 of chapter 989 of the Laws of 1958 with respect to any objections they might have to the granting of such immunity. Regardless of such communications, the grant of immunity was absolute.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. The immunity was not invalid because it does not protect appellants from subsequent prosecutions by Federal authorities and the fact that one of the functions of the commission is to &quot;cooperate with departments and officers of the United States government in the investigation of violations of the federal laws within this state&quot; (L. 1958, ch. 989, &sect; 2, par. 5), does not require a different result.  The test is whether the immunity gives protection against State prosecution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. The commission did not pursue the wrong remedy in bringing these proceedings pursuant to section 406 of the Civil Practice Act. That statute provides that, when a witness&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  attending before a body such as petitioner herein &quot;refuses without reasonable cause * * * to answer a legal and pertinent question * * * the person issuing the subpoena, if he is a judge of a court of record, or not of record, may forthwith, or if he is not, then any judge of such court may upon proof by affidavit of the facts, by warrant commit the offender to jail, there to remain until he submits to do the act which he was so required to do or is discharged according to law.&quot; The distinction between this statute and the provisions of the Judiciary Law (art. 19) is that the latter are punitive in nature whereas the proceeding under section 406 is coercive only.  The commission was not required to invoke the punitive provisions as distinguished from the proceeding for coercive relief to compel the witnesses to testify.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. As to five of the appellants, their summary conviction violated no right.  Notice was given to them; a transcript of the testimony in each proceeding was made available to the court and counsel for the witness; a hearing was held.  However, the haste with which the proceedings were conducted is not approved.  Nevertheless, no prejudice amounting to a denial of due&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  process is shown because they were denied adjournments so their counsel could examine the law and submit briefs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. The other two appellants were also accorded due process.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, bus line and driver, challenged a judgment of the Supreme Court in New York County (New York), in a consolidated action of respondent passengers to recover for injuries sustained by them while they were passengers on a bus owned by the bus line and operated by the driver.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The bus in which the passengers were riding collided with a truck. Several actions were instituted by the passengers to recover for the injuries they sustained and those actions were consolidated, resulting in a judgment in favor of the passengers. The court reversed the judgment. It held that the trial court's jury charge, which imposed upon the driver of the bus a higher degree of care than that charged in respect of the operator of the truck, conveyed to the jury that appellants' obligation to the passengers was that of an insurer. Further, it was improper to exclude testimony of an experiment tending to establish the angle of vision of a witness, one of the passengers, whose testimony indicated the northbound bus had entered the southbound lane. The evidence was offered to show, by physical circumstances, the incapacity of the witness to see the centerline of the road from his seat on the bus and it was relevant because, other than the truck driver, the witness was the only one to testify that the bus had deviated from its proper lane and appellants' theory was that the truck entered the bus's lane and collided with the bus.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment entered against appellants in the passengers' suit to recover for personal injuries they sustained while passengers on a bus and granted a new trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Carriers -- negligence -- standard of care -- plaintiffs were passengers in bus which, traveling in northerly direction on concrete two-lane highway, collided with truck which was proceeding southerly -- charge to jury concerning obligation of owner and operator of bus to passengers tended to convey impression that obligation was that of insurer -- degree of care required is reasonable care -- new trial directed -- verdict legally untenable if based upon Vehicle and Traffic Law ( &sect; 56, subd. 1) which has been declared unconstitutional -- evidence of experiment</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> conducted to show that passenger could not have seen line in road as he stated was relevant and admissible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Plaintiffs were passengers in a bus, owned by one of the defendants and operated by another, and were injured as a result of a collision between the bus and a truck operated by another defendant.  The bus, proceeding northerly on a concrete two-lane highway, collided with the truck, proceeding southerly, at about 6:00 a.m., the weather being misty and the road wet.  The court charged that there was a different standard of duty between the operator of the truck and the bus, that the operator of the truck was under a duty to use reasonable care, but that &quot;the bus, as a public conveyance for hire and operated in the business of transporting paying passenger fares, is required to exercise a high degree of care in the operation of the bus for the safety of the passengers. * * * The Greyhound bus driver is bound, therefore, to use more than the ordinary usual caution, but is bound to use a high degree of care, taking into consideration all the conditions prevailing immediately preceding and at the time of the accident.&quot; The imposition upon the operator of the bus of a higher&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  degree of care than that charged with respect to the operator of the truck tended to convey to the jury that the owner's and operator's obligation to the passengers of the bus was that of insurer. The degree of care is always the same and that is ordinary care, reasonable care, or the care which a reasonably prudent person should exercise.  Attempts to characterize the degree of reasonable care required, depending on the circumstances, tend to confuse, particularly when more than one vehicle is involved and one of them is a common carrier of passengers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Under the charge, it cannot be determined whether the verdict against the owner and operator of the bus was predicated on subdivision 1 of section 56 of the Vehicle and Traffic Law, which provides: &quot;No person shall operate a motor vehicle or a motor cycle upon a public highway at such a speed as to endanger the life, limb or property of any person, nor at a rate of speed greater than will permit such person to bring the vehicle to a stop without injury to another or his property.&quot; That subdivision has been declared unconstitutional. ( </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">People </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">v.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11"> Firth</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 3 N Y 2d 472.) Where a general verdict is rendered in a liability case&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  submitted on multiple theories of liability, the verdict may not stand if one of them is legally untenable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. One of the plaintiffs, seated near a window on the left side of the bus, testified that immediately prior to the accident he observed the center line of the highway 6 to 12 inches left of the left side of the bus, and that he lost sight of the center line immediately prior to the collision, implying that at, or immediately prior to the accident, the bus had entered the southbound lane. It was improper to exclude testimony of an experiment tending to establish the angle of vision of that plaintiff, to establish his incapacity, by reason of physical circumstances, to see a line 6 to 12 inches from and parallel with the left side of the bus. The evidence was relevant, and relevant facts derived from experiments are admissible. That the circumstances at the time of the accident may have varied in some respects from those at the time the experiment was made affects the weight, but is not a basis for its exclusion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. A new trial is directed.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant county appealed a decision by the Supreme Court at Special Term, Chemung County (New York), which denied the county's motion to dismiss the first of two causes of action filed by plaintiff complainant, who assisted an officer of defendant town in making an arrest and was injured in the process. The complainant sought damages. The officer was also the sheriff of the county. The town was not a party to the county's motion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 1848 declared that it was a misdemeanor to refuse to aid an officer in making an arrest and that, if such aid was given and the person obeying the command was injured, the person could obtain damages from the municipal corporation by which the officer was employed at the time that the command was obeyed. The county contended that &sect; 1848 was unconstitutional as applied to the county because &sect; 1848 allegedly violated that portion of N.Y. Const. art. IX, &sect; 5 that read that the county could never be made responsible for the acts of the sheriff. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's refusal to dismiss the first cause of action. The court found that the New York Legislature intended to include the sheriff, as well as other police officers, within the coverage of N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 1848 because the county was a municipal corporation and the Legislature had knowledge of N.Y. Const. art. IX, &sect; 5 when the statute was written. To extend art. IX, &sect; 5 to prohibit a beneficial statute that could not have conceivably been in the minds of those who passed the New York Constitution would have been to adopt a narrow and unwarranted view of the New York Constitution.</SPAN></P>

IX, &sect; 5), which provides that &quot;County shall never be made responsible for the acts of the sheriff&quot; -- motion to dismiss cause of action against county in action by one who was allegedly injured in course of obeying command of Deputy Sheriff properly denied.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plaintiff was ordered by one who was an officer of defendant town and a Deputy Sheriff of defendant county to assist in making an arrest and, according to the complaint, was injured in the course of obeying the command of the officer.

The statute is remedial in character and should be upheld, if possible, without doing violence to the Constitution.  The origin and meaning of the constitutional provision are obscure.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner contractor appealed an order from the Supreme Court, Albany County (New York) which denied the contractor's request for a refund of a mortgage recording tax the contractor paid.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The contractor was awarded a bid to construct housing from the United States Military. The subsequent contract was a complicated agreement which provided that the contractor was to lease the property from the United States. Upon completion of the structures, the contractor was ordered to pay a mortgage recording tax. The contractor asserted that he was exempt from paying the tax and that the tax imposed was unconstitutional because it imposed a tax on the United States government. The lower court denied the contractor's request. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment. First, the court held that the mortgage recording tax was not a property tax. The court held that this was significant because the exemption provided in the Housing Act of 1956, 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1594, which exempted from taxation leased property from the United States government, was inapplicable to the mortgage recording act. Next, the court stated that mortgage recording tax was not unconstitutional because the tax did not impose any obligations on the United States government.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Taxation -- mortgage recording tax -- mortgage recording tax ( </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Tax Law, &sect; 253</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">) applicable to recording of mortgages procured for construction of family housing units at Plattsburgh Air Force Base by corporations which were formed by petitioner and which leased site of project from United States and entered into housing contract with United States -- mortgage recording tax is not property tax and exemption (Housing Act of 1956, &sect; 511) not applicable -- mortgages and indebtedness secured thereby not direct obligations of United States nor instrumentalities of Government employed to perform governmental functions of borrowing money and providing for common defense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Petitioner became the contractor for the construction of family housing units at Plattsburgh Air Force Base.  In accordance with the statute&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  (U. S. Code, tit. 42, &sect; 1594 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">et seq</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.) and pursuant to a letter issued by the Department of the Air Force, petitioner formed five Delaware corporations, each with a paid-in capital of $ 1,000, petitioner being the sole stockholder. Each of the corporations then leased from the United States certain lands within the base which together constituted the site of the project.  The rental provided by each lease was a lump sum of $ 1,000, and the term in each case was 55 years, terminable by the United States on 60 days' notice at any time after completion and acceptance of the project.  Petitioner and the five corporations entered into a housing contract with the United States.  The five corporations entered into building loan agreements with a bank and executed and delivered to the bank their several notes secured by mortgages of the leased premises.  A commitment for insurance of each of the mortgage notes was indorsed thereon by the Federal Housing Commissioner and payment was guaranteed by the United States.  All of the capital stock of the five corporations was assigned in blank and deposited with the mortgage bank in escrow for delivery to the Department of the Air Force upon&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  completion of the project and final indorsement of the mortgage notes by the Federal Housing Commissioner.  The construction period provided by the contract was two years and the first principal payments became due on the notes after the termination of that period.  Upon presentation of the mortgages for recording, payment of the mortgage tax under section 253 of the Tax Law was properly demanded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The objection that petitioner is not a proper party petitioner because it is not a party to the mortgages was not raised by way of defense (cf.  Civ. Prac. Act, &sect;&sect; 1291, 242).  In any event, the objection is of doubtful validity and, in view of the determination on the merits, the objection is academic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The exemption provided in section 511 of the Housing Act of 1956 refers to property taxes upon the leasehold interests.  The New York mortgage recording tax is not a property tax and the exemption is therefore inapplicable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The mortgages and the indebtedness secured thereby did not constitute direct obligations of the United States within the provisions of statute exempting from State or local taxation stocks, bonds, treasury notes and other obligations of the United States (U. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  S. Code, tit. 31, &sect; 742).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. These obligations are not instrumentalities of the Government, employed to perform the governmental functions of borrowing money and providing for the common defense, such as would put them beyond the taxing power of the State under the doctrine of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">McCulloch </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">v.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11"> Maryland</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (4 Wheat.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The corporation's principal contention was that it was entitled to a building permit for the particular plot mentioned, 10,000 square feet in area, because an amendment to a zoning ordinance, which rezoned the district from one permitting a minimum plot of 10,000 square feet to one requiring a minimum of one acre, either had not become effective at the time the application for the permit was made or was illegal and unconstitutional. On appeal, the court assumed, without deciding, that the amendment to the ordinance did not become effective until four days after the corporation filed its application for the building permit, as the corporation contended. The court was of the opinion that the trial court properly refused to direct the issuance of the permit because its issuance would have been a futility in view of the change in the ordinance forbidding the use sought by the corporation, and in view of the absence of the acquisition by the corporation of any vested rights prior to such change.</SPAN></P>

The court held that one who failed to exercise his right to register at the previous general election, thereby preserving his privilege to sign a petition for an independent nomination during the following year, had no right to complain that he did not take advantage of the opportunity.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The commissioner issued an order for the creation of one central school district, which would effectively combine three existing school districts. The board and taxpayers filed a N.Y. C.P.L.R. art. 78 proceeding in which they sought to annul the order. The trial court denied their application, but it annulled an election and the petition and notice to organize the school district. The commissioner, board, and taxpayers appealed. On appeal, the board and taxpayers argued that as it had no substantial need for high school facilities because most of its students went to private school, their tax burden would have been unduly increased without substantial benefit to them or the needs of their children. However, the court held that a local inequity was not necessarily a general injustice and, further, that the board and taxpayers did not make out a case of constitutional discrimination for which a law court was able to afford redress. The board and taxpayer further argued that the law was unconstitutional. However, the court held that the statute was not invalid for a failure of prescription of more detailed standards for the guidance of the administrative action of the commissioner.</SPAN></P>

He was subsequently convicted for his noncompliance and sentenced to pay a fine or serve a 5-day and a 30-day sentence, with execution of the 30-day sentence suspended upon compliance with the order by a certain time. Defendant paid the fine and then appealed the Commissioner's order. The court held that the appeal mandated dismissal because the court had no power to review the propriety of the Commissioner's administrative order within the context of the criminal prosecution; defendant had to seek review of the order from the city's board of standards and appeals. However, the court found that the sentence imposed was excessive in light of defendant's dilemma by reason of conflicting municipal zoning laws; the court thus reduced the fine, eliminated the jail sentences, and held that defendant should be given a chance to remove the trailers or take such action as was needed to validate their use.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant city appealed from an order of the Supreme Court, New York County (New York), which granted summary judgment for plaintiff corporation in the corporation's action for a declaratory judgment for a refund of the tax assessments, paid under protest, and held that the corporation was exclusively engaged in interstate commerce and that its local activity was de minimis.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city imposed a gross receipts tax for the privilege of doing business in the city. The corporation was incorporated in Massachusetts and sold textiles, the manufacturing of which was provided outside of the city. However, the corporation maintained two separate offices in city. The corporation filed a protest for a refund and the trial court granted its motion for summary judgment. The court reversed, holding that the corporation's local business operations extended substantially beyond the sale and promotion of its products. Its designs were prepared in the city, after study of the local market. The directions for the manufacturing of goods for future sales and delivery, the checking of credits, the approval or withholding of shipments after sales were made, and the maintenance of records occurred in the city. The corporation's business was a local activity that went beyond the solicitation of business exclusively in interstate commerce because it included services rendered to its customers before and after shipment of the goods. Thus, the corporation's local activities were substantial and separable from those in interstate commerce and it was subject to the tax.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Taxation -- New York City General Business and Financial Tax -- local functions of foreign corporation which sold textiles manufactured by it in out-of-State plants through two offices in New York City not merely incidental to corporation's activities in interstate commerce but were, as matter of law, of such character as to enable corporation to establish itself in and hold community market, thereby subjecting corporation to gross receipts tax imposed for privilege of doing business in New York City; in action by corporation for judgment declaring tax </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">unconstitutional</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> as applied to its activities</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> in New York City and for money judgment in refund of taxes paid, motion for dismissal of complaint should have been granted -- local activities, though merely incidents in transacting of interstate business, could not properly be isolated from total, where all local activities were either necessitated by or designedly planned for purpose of vying with local competitors -- burden to establish invalidity of tax rested on taxpayer -- even if allocation formula applied to corporation arbitrary and discriminatory, court could not in plenary action afford corporation relief; appropriate remedy by protest to comptroller and proceeding under article 78 of Civil Practice Act.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The local functions of a Massachusetts corporation, authorized to do business in New York, which sold textiles consisting of greige goods, finished fabrics, curtain materials and curtains, all of which it manufactured in plants located in Rhode Island, Massachusetts and Vermont, were not merely incidental to the corporation's activities in interstate commerce but were, as a matter of law, of such character as to enable the corporation to establish itself in and hold the community market, thereby subjecting the corporation&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to the gross receipts tax imposed for the privilege of doing business in New York City (Administrative Code of City of New York, &sect; B46-2.0, subd. a).  The corporation maintained two offices in New York City, one catering to the curtain trade, and the other dealing with cotton goods, supervised by three vice-presidents. The local activities included acceptance, modification or rejection of orders; checking and determination of credit; maintenance of records concerning sales and processing of perpetual inventory records, including all data of goods in process of manufacture and in transit, and record control of shipments, in part comprising directions to the plants as to the time and place of shipments to customers; billing of finished goods, comprising the bulk of the corporation's business; maintenance of bank accounts wherein payments for merchandise sold were deposited and upon which employees of the local office were authorized to draw; exercise of substantial control over production in the out-of-State plants, including purchase and development of designs for printed textiles and the making of decisions with respect to dyeing, printing and other methods of finishing goods and&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  estimating and determining future production requirements, all of which were influenced by a study of the local market; handling of customer complaints and claims of merchandise defects or nonconformance with samples; and advertising and promotional activities.  Upon appeal by defendants, the City of New York and others, in an action by the corporation for a judgment declaring that the New York City General Business and Financial Tax was unconstitutional and void as applied to the corporation's activities in New York City and for a money judgment in refund of taxes paid under protest, a judgment granting summary judgment in favor of plaintiff and an order denying defendants' motion for summary judgment dismissing the complaint were reversed on the law, the motion of plaintiff for summary judgment denied and the cross motion of defendants for a dismissal of the complaint granted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. While it might reasonably be argued that some of the corporation's local activities were merely incidents in the transacting of interstate business, they could not properly be isolated from the total.  It was a fair inference that all of the local activities were either necessitated by or designedly planned&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  for the express purpose of vying advantageously with local competitors.  Where the local activities of a vendor are merely incidental to conduct or transactions essentially in interstate commerce and forming an unbroken process of interstate commerce, then the imposition of the local tax is tainted with illegality; conversely, however, if the vendor, as in the case at bar, engages in activities designed essentially and exclusively for the local buyer then an apportioned tax is permissible.  A consideration of the corporation's operations made it clear that its local activities rendered integrated services of which the manufacturing of textiles was merely a part.  By channeling business through its New York office, the corporation gained the advantage of a local business. That was a local activity which went beyond the solicitation of business exclusively in interstate commerce for it included services rendered to its customers before and after shipment of the goods.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The burden to establish the invalidity of the tax rested on the taxpayer.  That requirement is reasonable, since the taxpayer is in better position than the agency empowered to impose the tax to establish the factual&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  proof with respect to the operative factors involved in the conduct of the business.  Moreover, the Administrative Code of the City of New York (&sect; B46-3.0) places the burden of proof on the taxpayer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Assuming, as contended by the corporation, that the allocation formula applied to it was arbitrary and discriminatory and for that reason invalid, the court could not, in the plenary action at bar for declaratory judgment, afford it any relief.  The appropriate remedy for relief from an allocation formula promulgated by the city comptroller in levying the New York City General Business and Financial Tax is by protest to the comptroller, and upon his refusal to give relief, by the commencement of a proceeding under article 78 of the Civil Practice Act.  That the abbreviated time limitation for the commencement of an article 78 proceeding barred plaintiff from relief, furnished no justifiable reason for the courts to sanction a plenary action in the absence of express legislation.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The former professors sought to recover salaries accrued from the time of their dismissals to the commencement of the action. The dismissals occurred following the pleading by the former professors of their privilege against self incrimination in hearings before a United States Senate Subcommittee. The dismissals were pursuant to the provisions of New York, N.Y., City Charter &sect; 903. The trial court dismissed their complaint. On appeal, the court reversed the order and judgment and denied the motion to dismiss. The dismissals were automatic, involving neither an act of discretion nor a quasi-judicial determination and the complaint was not time-barred. At the time of the motion to dismiss, the allegations were taken as true and the complaint should not have been dismissed on the basis that the former professors did not seek reinstatement before seeking accrued salaries. The former professors would have eventually had to establish the facts asserted in their pleading and sustain their right.

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. According to the complaint, plaintiffs were unlawfully dismissed from their positions in the New York City colleges under the Board of Higher Education of the City&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of New York pursuant to the provisions of section 903 of the New York City Charter. The dismissals occurred in 1953, following the pleading by plaintiffs of their privilege against self incrimination in hearings before a United States Senate Subcommittee.  Since then the United States Supreme Court, in the case of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Slochower </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">v.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11"> board of ' </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Educ</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. (350 U.S. 551), has held that the statute in its application to another person, similarly situated, constituted a violation of due process and was, therefore, unconstitutional.  Section 903 of the New York City Charter provides that a city employee's employment shall, in the event he claims the privilege against self incrimination, terminate and the employment shall be vacant. The dismissals of plaintiffs did not involve any act of discretion or quasi-judicial determination.  The statute provides for a self-executing forfeiture.  No further action is required.  No further action was taken by defendant except to dismiss in response to the clear and unqualified mandate of the statute.  No hearings were required and none were held; no charges were placed; nor any findings made.  Accordingly, the complaint should not have been dismissed. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  2. Plaintiffs need not first have obtained reinstatement to their positions from which they had been illegally dismissed before they seek to recover accrued salary. A proceeding in the nature of mandamus is not the exclusive remedy for one illegally removed.  An action at law may lie to recover accrued salary so long as only a clear legal right was involved, uncomplicated by an act of administration discretion or quasi-judicial determination.  </SPAN></P>

The Commission upheld the assessment, and the court confirmed the Commission's decision. The court rejected the corporation's contention that only a dollar increase was taxable under &sect; 181, as it was clear from the language of &sect; 181 that a change in the corporation's capital share structure included the increase in the number of shares which resulted from the stock split-up. Since the basis of the tax imposed when a corporation first entered the state had been approved, there was no ground for constitutional inhibition of the recomputed tax applied according to the same measure. The fact that the corporation had been authorized to do business in the state for more than five years but was not permitted the credit allowed by N.Y. Tax Law &sect; 180 to New York corporations did not render N.Y. Tax Law &sect; 181 discriminatory because the provision of N.Y.

The claims court awarded the landowners compensation, with interest from June 1, 1953 to the date of the entry of its judgment. The State's motion to amend the judgment to limit the interest awarded thereon was denied. The court reversed the order denying the motion and modified the judgment accordingly. Section 19(1) of the Court of Claims Act suspended interest from a period beginning six months after a claim accrued and ending when the claim was filed. Although the landowners were not personally served with the description and map, the filing thereof in the county clerk's office was constructive notice of the taking, and the landowners could have filed a claim immediately.

Under that law, title to and right to possession of the premises vested in the State on June 1, 1953.  A copy of the description and a map were not served upon claimants until April 22 and April 26, 1955.  The claim was verified February 15, 1955 and was filed on April 7, 1955.  Claimants were awarded compensation, with interest from June 1, 1953 to the date of entry of judgment without interruption. The Court of Claims Act ( &sect; 19, subd. 1) provides that &quot;If a claim which bears interest, is not filed until more than six months after the accrual of said claim, no interest shall be allowed between the expiration of six months from the time of such accrual and the time of the filing of such claim.&quot; A motion to amend the decision to allow interest only from June 1, 1953 to December 1, 1953 and from April 7, 1955 to the date of entry of the judgment should be granted.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The manufacturer filed an action against the retailer to enjoin the retailer's discount sales and advertising of the manufacturer's shirts in violation of a fair-trade contract between the manufacturer and another retailer. The trial court granted an injunction enjoining the retailer from selling such merchandise below the prices fixed in the manufacturer's fair-trade contract, except that it allowed the retailer to offer the shirts to the manufacturer at cost, and if the manufacturer declined the offer, the retailer was at liberty to sell the shirts without regard to the agreement. The manufacturer appealed the provision of the offer of sale, and the retailer appealed the entire judgment. The court reversed the issuance of the injunction, holding that the retailer's advertising and sale of the shirts in question, without knowledge of the resale restrictions contained in the manufacturer's fair-trade agreement, did not amount to unfair competition within the meaning of &sect; 369 of the General Business Law.

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trade-marks, trade names and unfair competition -- violation of fair-trade agreement -- </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">General Business Law ( &sect; 369-b</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">), declaring that willfully and knowingly advertising, offering for sale or selling commodity at less than prices in fair-trade agreement is unfair competition, is not violated where merchandise so sold was acquired without knowledge that it was subject to fair-trade agreement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  1. Plaintiff entered into a fair-trade agreement with a New York City department store retailer, other than defendant, providing for minimum prices for the sale in New York State at retail of some of its varieties of men's shirts. More than two years after the execution of the fair-trade agreement, defendant purchased approximately 147 dozen of men's shirts manufactured by plaintiff, of the varieties covered by plaintiff's fair-trade agreement, and put them on sale and advertised them at prices less than the minimum price stipulated in plaintiff's agreement.  The trial court found that, at the time of its purchase of the shirts, defendant did not know that they were subject to a fair-trade agreement.  It had such knowledge when it sold them.  Section 369-b of the General Business Law provides: &quot;Wilfully and knowingly advertising, offering for sale or selling any commodity at less than the price stipulated in any contract entered into pursuant to the provision of section three hundred sixty-nine-a, whether the person so advertising, offering for sale or selling is or is not a party to such contract, is unfair competition and is actionable at the suit of any person damaged thereby.&quot; &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Referee improperly ruled that defendant could sell the shirts in question at any price if plaintiff refused to buy them back at the cost to defendant.  If in fact the law is violated by the sale of fair-traded merchandise, with knowledge at the time of sale that it is so price-fixed, such a decision would frustrate the statutory purpose.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The statute is not violated where defendant acquired the merchandise without knowledge that it was subject to a fair-trade agreement although it had such knowledge at the time the goods were offered for sale.  Section 369-b does not prohibit the mere advertising, offering for sale or selling of a commodity at less than the price stipulated in a fair-trade agreement.  It is the doing of these things knowingly and willfully which is declared to be unfair competition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. It must be presumed that the Legislature intended no unjust or unreasonable result in the enactment of a statute.  Moreover, the statute must be construed, if possible, not only to avoid the conclusion that it is unconstitutional, but also to avoid grave doubts that it may be so.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff published and distributed magazines claimed to be official publications of nudist organizations. The commissioner sent notices to the publisher's customers ordering them to discontinue selling plaintiff's publications and to remove the publications. The publisher filed a declaratory judgment and injunctive relief action arguing that the commissioner's actions violated its constitutional right of freedom of speech and of press, and that the commissioner's actions constituted a prior restraint on publications, which set up censorship of the press. The trial court dismissed the publisher's complaint, and it appealed. The court affirmed but modified the judgment finding that the commissioner's letters constituted a prior restraint against future publications and violated the publisher's constitutional rights. The court held that the trial court should have directed the commissioner to recall the letter and to instruct the customers to whom it was sent to disregard it. The court found that the real impact of the letter was to compel obedience by the customers, and to some extent was effective in curtailing and preventing the sale of future copies of the publisher's magazines.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant mortgagee challenged an order from the Sullivan County Supreme Court at Special Term (New York), which denied his motion for an order vacating an order permitting respondent owner substituted service of summons on him and a default judgment. The trial court held, in effect, that because of the long period during which the mortgagee knew of the existence of the judgment against him he was barred by laches from the relief he sought.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mortgagee asked the court to determine the judgment's validity, requesting as alternative relief that the judgment be set aside and the matter litigated in a New York City Municipal Court. The court explained that the usual practice would indicate that the affirmative relief the mortgagee sought addressed to the judgment or the action's underlying merits might be severed and sent to the Third Judicial District, but the trial court was not required to do this unless a party requested it, and the mortgagee made no such request and was bound by the procedure he adopted. The court held that the mortgagee should have asserted within a reasonable time a lack of jurisdiction based on showing his purported nonresidence, but he did nothing, and the claim was waived, so the adverse decision was binding on the mortgagee against the present motion to vacate it and became conclusive. To the extent that the mortgagee sought affirmative relief directing a trial on the merits in municipal court, in which admission of personal jurisdiction was implicit in the relief sought, he was deemed estopped from asserting that there was no jurisdiction over him. The order was affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's order authorizing substituted service of summons on the mortgagee and establishing personal jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Courts -- jurisdiction -- objection to jurisdiction of person -- waiver and estoppel -- default judgment entered on substituted service; objection that no jurisdiction of person acquired waived by subsequent acts of defendant; defendant estopped from asserting objection.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. In an action in the Supreme Court, Sullivan County, an order authorizing substituted service of the summons was granted, defendant defaulted and judgment was entered by the clerk in August, 1953.  Defendant had personal knowledge of the judgment against him within four months after its entry.  Plaintiff moved at the New York County Special Term, in March, 1956, for an order directing certain third-party corporations to turn over on account of the judgment assets owned by defendant.  Defendant appeared generally upon that application by an attorney and raised objections going beyond the narrow merits of the application&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  in supplementary proceedings and asked as affirmative relief that the court order a reference for the purpose of determining the validity of the judgment or that the judgment be set aside and the matter litigated in the Municipal Court of the City of New York.  Defendant's application for such affirmative relief was denied and defendant thereafter moved, in April, 1956, at the Sullivan County Special Term to vacate the judgment, asserting that he was not a resident of New York when the substituted service was made.  The Sullivan County Special Term properly denied defendant's motion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The New York State Supreme Court is a single judicial entity, and while the judgment was entered in Sullivan County, the New York County Special Term having entertained a proceeding supplementary to execution would have power to deal with the judgment itself upon application of a party in interest.  The New York County Special Term was not required to follow the usual practice of severing and sending to the Third Judicial District that part of the affirmative relief sought by defendant addressed to the judgment or the underlying merits of the action unless a party requested that that be done.  Defendant&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  was bound by the procedure he adopted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. An objection that no jurisdiction of the person has been acquired may be waived by subsequent acts of the party affected or he may be estopped from asserting the objection.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Assuming that the service of process followed due form of law and that the court had before it in proper form proof which would support personal jurisdiction of defendant by substituted service, the objection that no such jurisdiction had been acquired or, otherwise stated, that the facts as proved before the court were not true facts, could be waived. The prior course of conduct or of procedural policy of the party asserting absence of personal jurisdiction may estop its assertion.  Both elements existed in the case at bar.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. If the jurisdictional objection was not deemed to have been waived by resting on knowledge of the entry of judgment, defendant would be deemed to have waived it or to have been estopped from its assertion by the course of proceeding followed by him at the New York County Special Term.  To the extent that the application in that court might be deemed to have been made by defendant upon jurisdictional grounds to vacate the judgment, the adverse&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  decision was binding on defendant against the later motion to vacate it and, in the absence of appeal, had become conclusive against him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. To the extent that defendant sought affirmative relief by an order of the Supreme Court directing a trial on the merits in Municipal Court, or by favor of the court in relieving him of default in pleading, in both of which situations admission of jurisdiction of the person lay implicit in the relief sought, defendant would be deemed estopped from asserting that there had not been obtained jurisdiction over his person.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. Decision did not rest upon a retroactive vesting of personal jurisdiction on the basis of waiver or estoppel, but on the fact there was sufficient valid proof of essential jurisdictional facts presented to the court before the summons went out to justify its taking jurisdiction, and that the course of policy and procedure elected to be followed by defendant foreclosed him from litigating those facts.  The facts accepted by the court in taking jurisdiction were no longer left open to dispute.  The objections to procedural steps in the entry of judgment were likewise waived by defendant or were without substance.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondents, the Director of the Budget of the State of New York and associated individuals, appealed an order from the Supreme Court at Special Term, Albany County (New York), which granted a motion by petitioner, a State Employee, for an order pursuant to N.Y. Civ. Prac. Act. art. 78 directing respondents to restore the employee to the position of principal statistics clerk following a downward reclassification.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee's job was reclassified downward from principal statistics clerk, with a civil service grade of G-11, to senior statistics clerk, with a pay grade of G-8. The downward classification was made retroactive to April 1 pursuant to 1954 N.Y. Laws 307. As a result, the employee sought an order directing respondents to restore her to her former position. The trial court found in favor of the employee and held that the reclassification of the employee's position was arbitrary and unlawful. On appeal, the court reversed. The court held that the merits of the administrative decision to classify the employee's position in a lower grade could not be challenged because it was required to accept the reclassification as justified. The employee failed to pursue her administrative remedy by obtaining a review of the Director's decision to reclassify her position. Also, because downgrading was proper and justified, it was not arbitrary simply because similar downgrading did not occur for other civil service positions. Further, the retroactive reclassification was not unconstitutional. The employee had a right to an earned salary, but she did not have a right to hold a public job.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The failure of the administrative officers charged with the duty of classification to effect a similar downgrading in other departments or bureaus where intervening seniority rights had accrued under the Civil Service Law, was not, as a matter of law, such arbitrary action as would warrant judicial interference.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3.

Two offices of vestrymen were vacant. At the meeting at which it was resolved that Mr.  Melish's services were terminated, there were in attendance the 2 wardens and the same 4 vestrymen who had attended the two earlier meetings, Dr.  Sidener as rector, and two other persons who were purportedly elected to the vacant positions of vestrymen early in the meeting.  Since 6 of the 11 members of the vestry were present at the meetings in question, that is, 2 churchwardens and 4 vestrymen, a majority was present and there was compliance with the governing requirement for a quorum. All 6 voted for Dr. Sidener's&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  election as rector. Accordingly, judgment should be entered in favor of plaintiffs and adjudging that he had been lawfully elected as rector.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Section 2 of Canon 11 of the Canons of the General Church provides: &quot;In all cases in which a Canon of the General Convention directs a duty to be performed, or a power to be exercised, by a Standing Committee, or by the Clerical members thereof, or by any other body consisting of several members, a majority of said members, the whole having been duly cited to meet, shall be a quorum; and a majority of the quorum so convened shall be competent to act, unless the contrary is expressly required by the Canon.&quot; This section governs as to the matter of a quorum at the meetings of the vestry with regard to the election of a rector. A vestry is included in the expression &quot;by any other body consisting of several members&quot;.  The fact that General Canon 11 is entitled &quot;Of Standing Committees&quot; and that much of it is concerned with such committees in every diocese, does not require a contrary construction of section 2.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. This view finds support in section 25 of the Religious Corporations Law.  It provides that &quot;No provision of this chapter [The Religious&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Corporations Law] authorizes the calling, settlement * * * of a minister, or the fixing or changing of his salary, and a meeting of a church corporation for any such purpose shall be called, held, moderated, conducted, governed * * * not as required by any provision of this chapter but only according to the aforesaid laws and regulations, practice, discipline, rules and usages of the religious denomination or ecclesiastical governing body, if any, with which the church corporation is connected.&quot; The quorum provisions of section 42 of the Religious Corporations Law which defendants contend governs as to what constitutes a quorum for a meeting of church vestry, and which would require at least a majority of the vestrymen in addition to the 2 churchwardens, is not applicable to meetings held for the election of a rector.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. This does not mean that the provisions of section 42 have no useful purpose.  They are applicable to all meetings of the vestry insofar as they do not deal with purely ecclesiastical matters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. When there is before a civil court for determination a dispute between factions of a religious congregation concerning an ecclesiastical matter, and the congregation in&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  question is a subordinate member or part of a general church organization in which there are superior ecclesiastical tribunals with a general and ultimate power of control over the whole membership of that general organization, and the questions of discipline, or of faith, or ecclesiastical rule, custom, or law have been decided by the highest of these church judicatories to which the matter has been carried, the legal tribunals must accept such decisions as final and as binding on them, in their application to the case before them.  The pronouncement by the Bishop at the institution of Dr. Sidener that there is no valid objection, either ecclesiastical or otherwise to his institution, constituted an ecclesiastical decision which could have been asserted successfully by plaintiffs in this action as having binding effect upon the court.  However, the fact of the decision was not pleaded in the supplemental complaint and therefore, even though it was proved at the trial, it may not be considered as determinative of the issue of Dr.  Sidener's election. It was never indicated at any time during the trial that plaintiffs relied on the Bishop's pronouncement as binding on the court.  No&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  motion to conform the pleadings to the proof was made, and it does not appear that the Official Referee gave any consideration to that theory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. Although the court's decision may not be grounded on the Bishop's pronouncement that Dr. Sidener was properly elected, it may regard the pronouncement as evidence of what the church law is in a situation such as this in the same manner that evidence of the law of another jurisdiction is accepted.  As evidence it fortifies the court's independent conclusion that the church law required a quorum of only a majority of the vestry. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state sought review of the decision of the Court of Special Sessions of the City of New York (New York), which sustained defendant's demurrer and dismissed the information charging defendant with failing to comply with the lawful orders and directions given by the bridge and tunnel authority (authority).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with a willful violation of &sect; 3 of article 4 of the rules adopted and promulgated by the authority. Defendant filed a motion to dismiss the information against him on the ground that it failed to state a prima facie case of the commission of a crime by him. The court reversed the trial court's decision granting the defendant's motion to dismiss. The court held that the rule was not an unconstitutional delegation of legislative authority in violation of N.Y. Const. art. III, &sect; 1. Provisions of title 3 of article 3 of the Public Authorities Law clearly indicated that the agreements with the bondholders referred to in N.Y. Pub. Auth. Law &sect; 553 had nothing to do with the regulation of traffic on the project under the authority's control. Although a traffic infraction was not a crime, the rule that defendant allegedly violated was not a provision of the Vehicle and Traffic Law, nor was it a provision of a local law or ordinance. Although the legislature could not delegate to the authority the power to define crimes and to prescribe the punishment therefor, there was no such delegation, however, by &sect; 553.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court's order sustaining defendant's demurrer and dismissing the information charging defendant with failing to comply with the lawful orders and directions given by the authority. The court further directed that defendant be required to plead to the information.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- violation of rule of Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority -- motion to dismiss information charging that defendant violated rule of Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority in that he failed to comply with directions given by officer directing traffic at Brooklyn Plaza of Brooklyn Battery Tunnel and refused to proceed into proper traffic lane, improperly granted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Defendant was charged with a willful violation of section 3 of article 4 of the rules adopted and promulgated by the Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority for the regulation of the use of its project at the Brooklyn Plaza of&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the Brooklyn Battery Tunnel, in that he failed to comply with the directions given by a bridge and tunnel officer, then directing traffic at said place, and refused to proceed into the proper traffic lane when directed to do so by the officer.  The rule alleged to have been violated requires all persons upon vehicular crossings controlled by the Authority to comply with lawful orders and directions given by employees of the Authority, and was promulgated pursuant to subdivision 5 of section 553 of the Public Authorities Law, which empowers the Authority &quot;To make by-laws for the management and regulation of its affairs, and subject to agreements with bondholders, rules for the regulation of the use of the project and the establishment and collection of tolls thereon&quot;, and provides that &quot;Violation of such rules shall be a misdemeanor punishable by a fine of not exceeding fifty dollars or by imprisonment for not longer than thirty days, or both&quot;.  A motion to dismiss the information was improperly granted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The statutory provision does not constitute an unconstitutional delegation of legislative authority (N. Y. Const., art. III, &sect; 1) in that it authorizes the making of rules having&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the force of law by the bondholders and the Authority and not in accordance with the independent judgment of the Authority.  The statute gives the Authority alone the power to adopt rules and does not require that they shall be approved by the bondholders. The agreements with the bondholders referred to in the statute are those made for the protection of the financial security of the holders of bonds and have nothing to do with the regulation of traffic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3.  Section 553 of the Public Authorities Law is not invalid for the failure of the Legislature to give the Authority standards for its guidance in the exercise of the delegated power to adopt rules.  It is that statute enacted by the Legislature and not a rule adopted by the Authority which defines the substantive criminal offense and makes a violation of the Authority's rules a misdemeanor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The Authority has been given the power to adopt rules and regulations reasonably adapted to carry out the purposes and objects for which it was created, and such a grant of power is not an improper delegation of legislative authority.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. The information, which concededly purports to accuse defendant of the commission of a misdemeanor, was&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  not properly dismissed on the ground that the violation would constitute, at most, a traffic violation.  The rule alleged to have been violated is not a provision of the Vehicle and Traffic Law, nor is it a provision of the local law or ordinance (cf.  Vehicle and Traffic Law, &sect; 2, subd. 29).  It is a rule promulgated by the Authority acting pursuant to a State statute which provides that a violation of the rule shall be a misdemeanor and which, in any event, prevails over any inconsistent provision of the Vehicle and Traffic Law ( Public Authorities Law, &sect; 571).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. The Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority is not a local authority as defined in the Vehicle and Traffic Law ( &sect; 2, subd. 19), and, consequently, section 54 thereof, which prohibits the passage by local authorities of any ordinance, rule or regulation excluding the operator of a motor vehicle from the free use of the public highways, and provides that any such ordinance, rule or regulation contrary to or inconsistent with the provisions of the Vehicle and Traffic Law shall have no effect, is not applicable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. Moreover, section 54 of the Vehicle and Traffic Law provides that nothing therein contained shall impair the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  validity or effect of traffic regulations adopted pursuant to law in a city of the first class.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. The order appealed from is an order of the court dismissing an information on a ground other than the insufficiency of evidence adduced at a trial and is consequently appealable pursuant to the provisions of subdivision 3 of section 518 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, union, union members, and hourly paid employees, challenged the order from the Supreme Court at Special Term of Kings County (New York), which dismissed appellant's complaint against respondents, transit authority and union, for a declaratory judgment that a certain collective bargaining agreement entered between respondents was valid.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants' complaint alleged that the collective bargaining agreement entered into between respondents was illegal and void because it granted exclusive collective bargaining rights to certain unions. Upon respondents' motion, the trial court dismissed the complaint finding it was insufficient on its face. This appeal followed. The court reversed the order dismissing the complaint but directed a judgment for respondents declaring that the agreement was valid. Under the broad powers granted to the transit authority by N.Y. Pub. Auth. &sect; 1804, the transit authority had the power to enter into the agreement. Thus, the agreement was valid and constituted no abridgement of the statutory or constitutional rights of the hourly paid employees who were not members of certain unions. The agreement did not grant exclusive collective bargaining rights to one union. The agreement preserved the right of all employees to present their grievances, and all employees were treated alike. Based on respondents' implied request, this was a proper case for directing a judgment in accordance with the views expressed herein.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the order dismissing appellants' complaint. However, the court directed a judgment for respondents declaring that the collective bargaining agreement at issue herein was valid.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Labor unions -- power of Transit Authority to contract for collective bargaining rights -- New York City Transit Authority had power to enter into agreement with Transport Workers Union and Amalgamated Association of Street, Electric Railway &amp; Motor Coach Employees of America, AF of L, concerning wages, hours, working conditions and grievance procedures, and providing for representation of employees by such unions, following election held for selection of labor union by hourly paid employees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The complaint alleged that, pursuant to resolutions of the New York&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  City Transit Authority, an election was held for the selection by its hourly paid employees of a labor union in each of several groups to be the employees' exclusive representative for presentation and processing of grievances. Transport Workers Union was elected such representative in all the groups except two, in which Amalgamated Association of Street, Electric Railway &amp; Motor Coach Employees of America, AF of L was successful.  Effective as of July 1, 1954, the Authority entered into a written agreement with TWU and Amalgamated concerning, among other things, wages, hours, working conditions and grievance procedures, and providing for the exclusive representation of employees by such unions.  It is also alleged that, since July 1, 1954, the Authority has implemented and given effect to the resolutions, election and agreements by refusing to permit other unions to represent employees in grievance matters, has refused to discuss wages, hours and working conditions with appellants, and has otherwise discriminated against them and exceeded its statutory authority.  The agreement of July 1, 1954, names various unions, including TWU, Amalgamated and appellant Civil Service Forum and&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  any other union representing hourly paid employees, as parties to the agreement, but provides that the agreement shall inure to the benefit of only such of the named unions or organizations as affix their signatures to and become parties to the agreement.  Article VIII regarding grievance procedure recites that TWU and Amalgamated are designated as the exclusive union representatives for presenting and processing employee grievances for hourly paid employees in the named divisions and that &quot;nothing herein shall deprive any individual employee or employees from presenting and processing his or their own grievances through the procedures provided in this Article.&quot; Detailed provisions are then made for the processing and settling of grievances which may be presented by any employee personally or through the union elected as the exclusive union representative of employees in that group.  It is also provided that nothing contained therein &quot;shall be construed to deny to any employee his rights under &sect; 15 of the New York Civil Rights Law or under applicable Civil Service laws and regulations.&quot; The court at Special Term granted motions to dismiss the complaint under subdivision 4 of rule&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  106 of the Rules of Civil Practice and stated that there was nothing in the statute creating the Authority, in the Constitution or in any other applicable statute which interdicts the execution of a collective bargaining agreement by the Authority with unions and that, under the broad powers granted the Transit Authority, it could properly enter into the agreement in question.  The order is reversed, the motion to dismiss the complaint denied, and judgment should be directed declaring that the resolutions, election, agreements and policy statement attacked by appellants are valid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. A proper case of declaratory judgment is presented and it may be that orderly procedure should require the service of answers, and a determination of merits of the controversy thereafter upon appropriate motions.  However, the conceded facts are before the court as fully and as completely as though answers had been served and appropriate motions for affirmative judgments had been made.  There being no issue of fact, a declaratory judgment may appropriately be directed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The powers conferred upon the Authority by section 1804 of the Public Authorities Law are sufficient to include the power to enter&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  into the agreement of July 1, 1954.  The agreement could be entered into validly under the Authority's power to maintain and operate the transit system, to enter into contracts, and to do all things necessary or convenient for the exercise of the express powers granted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. It is unnecessary to determine whether the Authority may legally enter into an </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">exclusive</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> collective bargaining agreement with a union since the agreement here involved is not of that character.  The contract could have been signed by any and all the employees' labor organizations which were willing to fulfill its covenants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. In matters affecting employees' grievances, the exclusive rights to represent employees is given to those unions which prevailed in the election held for that purpose as is the right to discuss the method of picking jobs within a classification and proposed new work schedules.  However, those provisions, or the provision giving such unions the right to be informed of grievances affecting other employees or a basic provision of the contract do not constitute the agreement an </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">exclusive</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> collective bargaining contract for one which the Authority has no power to make.  The employee in&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  every case has the right to present grievances personally, and his rights as a civil service employee are further expressly reserved by the provision that nothing contained therein &quot;shall be construed to deny [him] his rights under &sect; 15 of the New York Civil Rights Law or under applicable Civil Service laws and regulations.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. The agreement does not violate the employees' constitutional and statutory right to petition for the redress of grievances.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. There is no statute in this State applicable to government employees supporting the argument that an employee may not be deprived of his right to designate a representative or a minority union to prosecute his grievances.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. The factual allegations of the complaint, which indicate that the agreement made may have been breached, do not establish the invalidity of the agreement itself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. Appellants, who are not parties to the agreement, have no right to attack it for want of consideration or the unilateral right of the Authority to terminate it.  </SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court affirmed the Board's decision and awarded costs to the Fund. The court determined the date of disability was fixed at April 1947. Therefore, the court reasoned that the claim for reimbursement was not filed within 104 weeks of the date of disability as required by &sect; 15(8). The court reasoned that there was substantial evidence to support the finding of the Board that the date of disability was April 1947, and that the claim for reimbursement was made more than 104 weeks thereafter and consequently was not timely under &sect; 15(8)(f).

Settle order on notice.  <BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Through a proceeding under N.Y. Civ. Prac. Act &sect; 78, petitioner taxpayer challenged the final determination of respondent Comptroller of the City of New York (New York), which assessed against the taxpayer a New York City business tax deficiency for a certain period, together with penalties and interest. The final determination was made on a remand from the court that prescribed the appropriate allocation formula for the imposition of the tax.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer was assessed a business tax deficiency. After a remand from the court as to the proper allocation formula, the assessment was reduced. The comptroller's final determination not only assessed the deficiency but also imposed penalties at the maximum rate of five percent, plus one percent for each month of delay. The taxpayer challenged the determination, and the court annulled that part of it as to the imposition of the penalties and remitted the matter to the comptroller. The court held that the penalties totalled more than 60 percent of the entire assessment, yet the final determination contained no statement on the basis for the imposition of the penalties. The court concluded that it could evaluate the propriety of the comptroller's determination only from the reasons that he gave. However, on the record, the court could not determine what consideration, if any, was given to the taxpayer's protest with respect to the comptroller's refusal to remit any part of the penalties. If an appropriate protest was duly made, the taxpayer was entitled to be heard and the comptroller should state the reason for his decision that the delay in payment was not excusable.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court annulled that part of the comptroller's final determination that imposed penalties on the tax assessment against the taxpayer. The court remitted the matter to the comptroller for the exercise of his discretion in hearing the taxpayer's protest of the imposition of the penalties, and directed the comptroller to state the basis or reason for the imposition of any penalties.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Taxation -- New York City general business tax -- remission of penalties -- judicial review of administrative discretion -- there was express statutory provision for review by courts of final determination by comptroller of City of New York assessing general business tax deficiency; where comptroller's final determination stated no</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> reason for imposing penalties on taxpayer at statutory maximum rate despite taxpayer's due protest thereto, and for not exercising his statutory discretion to remit such penalties &quot;if satisfied that the delay was excusable&quot;, that portion of final determination which imposed such penalties was annulled and matter remitted to comptroller for exercise of his discretion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The final determination by the comptroller of the City of New York, assessing an alleged deficiency in the city's general business and financial tax, imposed penalties at the statutory maximum rates of 5% plus 1% for each month of delay, and totalling more than 60% of the entire sum assessed against the taxpayer.  The final determination contained no statement or reason for the imposition of such penalties, although the comptroller, &quot;if satisfied that the delay was excusable&quot; was empowered to &quot;remit all or any part of such penalty&quot; (General City Law, art. 2-B, &sect; 24-a [&sect; 13, subd. a]; Administrative Code of City of New York, &sect;&sect; R41-14.0, RR41-14.0), and &quot;in his discretion, to remit penalties&quot; (Administrative Code, &sect; RR41-11.0), and although the taxpayer had sought remission of the penalties and protested with&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  respect thereto.  In a proceeding to review the comptroller's determination, so much of said determination as imposed such penalties was annulled and the matter remitted to the comptroller for the exercise of his discretion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. There was express statutory provision (General City Law, art. 2-B, &sect; 24-a&nbsp;[&sect;&sect; 6, 7]) for refund of any &quot;penalty erroneously, illegally or unconstitutionally collected&quot; by the comptroller, and the statute further provided that the comptroller's determinations &quot;shall be reviewable for error, illegality, unconstitutionality or any other reason whatsoever&quot; by proceedings under article 78 of the Civil Practice Act.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Failure to state the basis for the rejection of the taxpayer's protest prevented the taxpayer from deciding whether there was merit to his grievance, and impeded the court in its review.  The court was not required to speculate as to the reason for the administrative ruling and although it did not hold that the comptroller abused his discretion in refusing to remit part or all of the penalties imposed, it could not determine upon the record what consideration, if any, was given to the protests. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant city register sought review of three orders by the Supreme Court at Special Term, Kings County (New York), in an N.Y. C.P.L.R. art. 78 proceeding. Order No. 1 granted leave to intervene. Order No. 2 directed the city register to record an instrument upon payment of a mortgage tax and denied its motion to dismiss. Order No. 3 granted the city register's motion for a rehearing, adhered to an original decision, and denied reargument.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The petition sought a determination that the correct amount of tax on a certain instrument which respondent had presented to the city register for recording was a certain amount. The city register had refused to record the instrument unless a higher amount was paid as mortgage tax. The instrument in question had reference to a mortgage on certain real property. An individual was the mortgagor and the intervenor was the mortgagee. When the principal debt had been reduced, the intervenor advanced to the mortgagor, upon her request, an additional sum of money. The court found that there was an intention to amend the mortgage so as to increase the amount of the secured indebtedness and to render the mortgage an open-end mortgage under which all loans by the mortgagee to the mortgagor or subsequent owner of the mortgaged premises would be secured by the mortgage. The court found that the proper interpretation of relevant statutory law required a tax on the difference between the amount of the unpaid balance of the original indebtedness and the stated possible maximum amount.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court modified trial court order No. 3 by granting respondent's motion to dismiss the petition. As modified, trial court order No. 3 was affirmed. The court dismissed the appeal from trial court order No. 2. The court affirmed trial court order No. 1.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Taxation -- recording of mortgage -- review -- proceeding to determine correct amount of tax on mortgage presented for recording must be brought first before State Tax Commission -- if court had present jurisdiction to determine amount of tax, it would determine that mortgage recording tax must be paid on difference between unpaid balance of original indebtedness and stated possible maximum under readvance agreement, even though total amount readvanced did not reach maximum.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. A proceeding to determine the correct amount of tax on a mortgage presented for recording must be first brought before the State Tax Commission (Tax Law, &sect; 251; Civ. Prac. Act, &sect; 1285, subd. 4).  The review procedure provided in the Tax Law ( &sect; 251) is not inadequate.  Accordingly, the parties are relegated to the proceeding under the Tax Law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. A mortgage to secure the principal indebtedness of $ &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  7,000 was made and recorded in 1944.  At a time when the principal debt had been reduced to $ 3,298.71, the mortgagee advanced to the mortgagor an additional $ 2,701.29 and at the same time they entered into an agreement providing that the maximum amount for which the mortgage could stand as security by virtue of the readvance instrument was $ 7,000.  The provisions of sections 250, 253, 255 and 256 of the Tax Law, when read together, require a tax on the difference between the amount of the unpaid balance of the original indebtedness ($ 3,298.71) and the stated possible maximum ($ 7,000) or $ 3,701.29.  Accordingly, if the court had present jurisdiction to determine the controversy on its merits, it would determine that the correct tax base would be $ 3,701.29, and the tax, accordingly, would be $ 18.50.  With the $ 6 recording fee, the correct amount which the city register of the City of New York would be entitled to require for recording the instrument would be $ 24.50.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Relator challenged an order of the County Court of Jefferson County (New York) that dismissed a writ of habeas corpus and directed that relator be turned over to the duly authorized officer of the State of Minnesota on a warrant of extradition under N.Y. Code Crim. Proc. &sect; 829. The opposing party was respondent, county sheriff.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In the underlying extradition papers, no claim was made that relator had committed a crime in Minnesota and fled. Instead, the request plainly stated that relator had committed acts in New York that intentionally resulted in the crime of abandonment of his minor child in Minnesota. There were two kinds of extradition. N.Y. Code Crim. Proc. &sect; 829 provided for extradition of persons who were charged with crimes in another state and who fled from justice and the governor and courts had limited review. N.Y. Code Crim. Proc. &sect; 834 provided for extradition of persons of persons who had not fled from justice and were not in the demanding state at the time of the commission of the alleged crime. The governor was given permissive power to grant the request. Here, the extradition request was made under N.Y. Code Crim. Proc. &sect; 829 and the Governor of New York mistakenly issued a fugitive warrant under that section. There was no evidence that the Governor exercised any discretion in reviewing the request. The court held that relator could not be transported to Minnesota as a person who committed a crime in Minnesota and fled from justice. The court reversed the order.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the order and sustained the writ without prejudice to the rights of the officials of the demanding state, Minnesota, to renew the application for extradition to the Governor of New York.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Extradition -- mandatory and permissive extradition -- abandonment of children -- request from Minnesota for extradition of relator showed, not that he had fled from justice, but that he had committed acts in New York which resulted in abandonment of his minor children in Minnesota; warrant of arrest issued thereon by New York Governor showed that he had deemed warrant mandatory and had not considered discretion; writ of habeas corpus sustained, without prejudice to renewal of extradition application by Minnesota.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The Uniform Criminal Extradition Act (Code Crim. Pro., &sect;&sect; 827-860) provides (a) for mandatory extradition of a fugitive from justice (&sect; 829), &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  pursuant to the requirements of the United States Constitution (art. IV, &sect; 2, 2d par.) and the United States Code (tit. 18, &sect;&sect; 3182, 3194), and (b) for permissive extradition of a person who has not fled from justice and who was not, at the time of the commission of the alleged crime, in the State which demands his surrender, but who is charged with committing an act, in this State or in a third State, intentionally resulting in a crime in the demanding State, when the act &quot;would be punishable by the laws of this state&quot; (Code Crim. Pro., &sect; 834).  In the case of permissive extradition, the warrant issued by the Governor of New York State &quot;must substantially recite the facts necessary to the validity of its issuance&quot; (Code Crim. Pro., &sect; 835).  Also, in such case, the Governor of New York State has discretionary power to make surrender conditional on an agreement by the executive authority of the demanding State that the person so surrendered will be accorded certain rights as set forth in said section 834.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. In this case, the request from the Governor of Minnesota and the underlying papers made no claim that relator had committed a crime in Minnesota and fled therefrom; in fact, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the request stated that he had committed acts in New York State which intentionally resulted in the crime of abandonment of his minor child in Minnesota.  Extradition was therefore merely permissive and discretionary; but the warrant of arrest issued by the Governor of New York State failed to recite the facts necessary to its validity and failed to show that he had considered the request or had exercised any discretion, and on the contrary showed that he had treated the request as one upon which he was mandated to issue a warrant of arrest. Accordingly, a writ of habeas corpus should be sustained, without prejudice to the right of the demanding State to renew its application to the Governor of New York State.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landlord asserted in its application that it was entitled to a net 6 percent return of the assessed valuation of its rental property. The local rent administrator held that the ratio which such assessed valuation bore to the full valuation as determined by the State Board of Equalization and Assessment to be applied was 100%. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that if the statute and regulation were unconstitutional, substantial injustice would be inflicted upon a landlord if he were required to obtain a judgment declaring them unconstitutional in an action instituted solely for that purpose before he would be entitled to an order of the administrator adjusting the maximum rents on a basis that the statute and regulation were unconstitutional. With the issue of unconstitutionality squarely raised in the protest and in the petition, the court considered the proceeding as one in the nature of mandamus.</SPAN></P>

Laws ch. 233.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee worked as a conductor in the New York subway system and was subject to the provisions of the state civil service law. When asked questions regarding his political affiliations, the employee asserted his rights under the Fifth Amendment. After his suspension for failure to answer the questions, the employee was given a chance to show why he should have been reinstated. The employee failed to give any evidence and he was terminated. The employee's action seeking reinstatement was dismissed and the court affirmed that decision. The court held that the law was constitutional because it bore a substantial relation to the permitted objective without unreasonably interfering with personal rights. The court found that the law provided the employee with an opportunity to present evidence and a procedure for review of his termination. The court noted that the employee did not have an unqualified right to work for the state on his own terms. The employee was not discharged without evidence because court was required to accept the employee's claim that the answers to the questions propounded might have incriminated him.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Civil Service -- removal -- subway conductor who invoked constitutional privilege against self incrimination and refused to answer questions as to whether he was Communist party member was properly discharged as security risk by New York City Transit Authority pursuant to State Security Risk Law (L. 1951, ch. 233).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Appellant, employed by respondent New York City Transit Authority as a conductor on the city subway system, upon three separate occasions declined, in reliance upon his constitutional privilege against self incrimination, to answer under oath questions by a deputy commissioner of investigation of the city concerning his political affiliations, particularly whether he was a member of&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the Communist party.  Thereafter, pursuant to the State Security Risk Law (L. 1951, ch. 233), the Transit Authority suspended him by resolution reciting that reasonable grounds existed for the belief that, because of his doubtful trust and reliability, his employment as a conductor would endanger the security and defense of the nation and State.  Subsequently the Transit Authority discharged appellant by a similar resolution further reciting that he had not within 30 days after his suspension submitted statements, as provided by the Security Risk Law, to show why he should be restored to duty. In a proceeding brought by him under article 78 of the Civil Practice Act to secure his reinstatement, the petition was properly dismissed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The Transit Authority, an agency created by the State and performing a governmental function, was subject to the provisions of the Security Risk Law. The Civil Service Commission was required by the statute to make a determination, reviewable by the courts, that an agency or position affected the security of the State or nation.  Such security agency, charged with the duty of determining whether an employee was of doubtful trust and reliability from&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  a security standpoint, properly inquired into such matters, and was empowered to find that the employee's refusal to answer such inquiries, in and of itself, furnished reasonable grounds for the belief that he was not a good security risk, although the statute (&sect; 5) made no specific reference to a refusal to answer. Appellant's membership in the Communist party may not be inferred from his assertion of privilege against self incrimination, but his statement that answers to the questions propounded might have tended to incriminate him must be accepted as truthful.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. It cannot be said that there is no presumption of constitutionality of a statute duly enacted by a State, although where rights protected by the First Amendment to the Federal Constitution are involved, the evil which the Legislature sought to remedy will be more closely scrutinized before the courts sustain the validity of legislation impinging on those rights than in a case involving property rights protected only by the Fourteenth Amendment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The subject of the legislation here involved was one on which the Legislature was permitted to act.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. The Security Risk Law bore a real and substantial relation to the permitted&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  objective without unreasonably interfering with personal rights.  There was no arbitrary exclusion of an employee irrespective of his guilty knowledge or intent, remoteness in time, or mistake or inadvertence, but a finding, after an opportunity had been given him to submit statements or affidavits giving reasons for reinstatement, that reasonable grounds existed for believing him to be a security risk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. Provisions of the Civil Service Law ( &sect; 22) governing the procedure to be followed in removals for misconduct or incompetency, were inapplicable (Civil Service Law, &sect; 22, subd. 3).  </SPAN></P>

The statute in question required the division to license a film unless it fell into several categories, including being indecent or obscene. Under recent United States Supreme Court case law, the court reasoned that the film was not indecent and the refusal of the license was a prior restraint. While the court would not go as far as to say that the denial of a license under similar circumstances was always a prior restraint, the division had a heavy burden of justifying the denial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff corporation sought review of an order from the Supreme Court at Special Term in New York County (New York), which granted defendant city's motion to dismiss plaintiff's plenary action to recover from defendant the money that plaintiff had erroneously paid defendant in taxes.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The corporation had erroneously paid the city certain taxes because of its accountant unawareness that transactions in foreign commerce were not subject to a city tax. The comptroller had denied the corporation's application for a refund. The corporation, instead of appealing the comptroller's denial, had filed a plenary action to recover the money that it had erroneously paid in taxes. The lower court had granted the city's motion to dismiss the corporation's plenary action, and the corporation appealed. The court issued a decision that denied the city's motion to dismiss. The fact that the corporation chose not to seek a review of the comptroller's decision pursuant to N.Y. Civ. Prac. Act &sect; 78 did not bar the corporation from seeking its claim against the city. Also, the city had no greater right than an individual to retain moneys to which it was not rightfully entitled. Further, the comptroller's decision did not constitute as a bar to the plenary action because there was no determination on the merits. Finally, the court held that in a plenary lawsuit for mistake a distinction between a mistake of law and mistake of fact was wholly immaterial.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Taxation -- plenary action against municipality for tax refund -- corporation which was not subject to municipal business tax paid such tax by mistake of law, and was denied refund by city comptroller who had no statutory authority to make refund of tax not paid under protest; taxpayer is not limited to &quot;exclusive&quot; remedy of fruitless proceeding under article 78 of Civil Practice Act to review comptroller's denial within thirty days (Administrative Code of City of New York, &sect;&sect; B46-7.0, B46-9.0), but may maintain plenary action against city for unjust enrichment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. A corporation which imported machines in foreign commerce, paid the New York City&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  general business tax on gross receipts (Administrative Code of City of New York, &sect; B46-1.0 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">et seq</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.) through a mistake of law, since its accountant was unaware that its transactions were not subject to the tax.  Upon application made a year later, the comptroller refused to make a refund. He had no authority to make a refund, since the statute authorized refunds of taxes paid &quot;under protest&quot; (Administrative Code, &sect; B46-7.0) and his regulations (art. 122) dispensed with the necessity for a protest in cases of &quot;pure mistake of fact&quot; only.  A review proceeding under article 78 of the Civil Practice Act (Administrative Code, &sect; B46-7.0) would have been ineffectual, since an official cannot be directed to perform an act beyond the powers delegated to him.  Prescribed procedures for review are not exclusive when the jurisdiction of the taxing officer is challenged or where the statute by its own terms does not apply in a given case.  Accordingly, the taxpayer may maintain this plenary action against the City of New York to recover the money, on the ground of unjust enrichment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. A governmental unit has no greater right than an individual to retain moneys to which it is not entitled. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  3. The lack of a protest at the time of the mistaken payment was not a waiver.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. If, as the comptroller asserts, the court should rule that protests are necessary in all cases in order to give the comptroller sufficient notice for making budgetary adjustments, then taxpayers would file protests as a matter of course in all cases and thus throw the budget into greater, rather than less, confusion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. The taxpayer's initial choice of the administrative remedy -- an application to the comptroller for a refund -- does not bar him from a plenary action where the comptroller had no power to consider the refund application on the merits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. The comptroller's denial of the application for a refund for want of jurisdiction or for mistake in the form of remedy chosen does not constitute </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">res judicata</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> of this plenary action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. Relief may not be denied in a plenary action merely because the mistake is one of law rather than one of fact.  (Civ. Prac. Act, &sect; 112-f.) </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. A school teacher whose compensation as such &quot;public employee of a political subdivision&quot; was more than $ 5,000 per annum, and whose governing board or local legislative body had not passed any resolution or ordinance authorizing him to accept employment from a corporation or association or firm licensed by the State Harness Racing Commission to conduct pari-mutuel racing, was properly refused a license by the commission to serve as a mutuel clerk (Pari-Mutuel Revenue Law, &sect; 41-a; &sect; 63, subd. 1, par. [c]; &sect; 63, subd. 6 [L. 1940, ch. 254; L. 1953, ch. 391, &sect; 8; L. 1954, chs. 514, 515]).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.

The bar of that paragraph was removed as to local public employees whose compensation was less than $ 5,000 per annum and who had authorization from their governing board or legislative body (subd. 6, added by L. 1954, ch. 515).  The school teacher urges that the latter enactment (subd. 6) unconstitutionally fails to provide equal protection of the laws; but, if so, the prior enactment (subd. 1, par. [c]) stands and prohibits his employment.  Thus he is not a person aggrieved by subdivision 6 and therefore he lacks the standing to challenge its constitutionality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Section 63 of the Pari-Mutuel Revenue Law, in another paragraph (subd.  1, par. [a]; L. 1954, ch. 514), originally completely prohibited any &quot;public officer, public employee or party officer&quot; from holding any license from the State Racing Commission or from the State Harness Racing Commission; and the bar of said paragraph was subsequently removed as to any such persons who were qualified to hold such a license on or prior to April 6, 1954 (&sect; 63, subd. 7; L. 1955, ch. 815).  A reading of section 41-a and all of section 63, and a consideration of the legislative history of horse&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  racing and of harness racing, shows that subdivision 7 was intended to have two effects: one, to remove the bar as to such owners and drivers and other &quot;participants&quot; who were qualified on or before April 6, 1954, as distinguished from &quot;employees&quot;; and two, to make sure that any &quot;employees&quot; as to whom the commission had not theretofore exercised its power to require a license should not be prohibited from getting a license if they were qualified to receive one before April 6, 1954.  The school teacher, although he had actually been employed prior to 1954 as a mutuel clerk by a licensed harness racing corporation or association, was not qualified to receive such an employee's license (under &sect; 63, subd. 1, par. [c]; subd. 6); hence he was not benefited by the enactment in 1955 of subdivision 7 of section 63.  </SPAN></P>

The Special Term dismissed the petition. The mayor and the supervisor, being dissatisfied with the rates, filed complaints with the State Board, pursuant to N.Y. Tax Law &sect; 176-a, claiming that the equalization rates were unjust and inequitable and requesting that they be annulled and new rates be fixed. Neither the mayor nor supervisor obtained the consent of any other public official to the filing of the complaints. The county board argued that a review pursuant to &sect; 176-a was not available to the mayor and the supervisor and that the appeal provision contained in the special act creating the county board was the only method available. The court disagreed and affirmed the decision, finding that the legislature intended to have &sect; 176-a apply to rates of equalization fixed by the county board.</SPAN></P>

Y.  Const., art. VIII, &sect; 10)</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> inapplicable; it refers to State, not county, equalization rates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The Tax Law ( &sect; 176-a, added by L. 1915, ch. 317) empowered the State Tax Commission -- which power has been temporarily transferred&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to the State Board of Equalization and Assessment -- &quot;on complaint to review the equalization fixed by the board of supervisors of any county or other lawfully constituted authority.&quot; The words &quot;on complaint&quot; and &quot;or other lawfully constituted authority&quot; were much broader than the existing language of section 175 of the Tax Law which provided for appeals by certain officials only and from equalizations fixed by boards of supervisors only.  The Legislature did not intend to repeal such broadening when it specially created an Erie County Board of Equalization and provided that its decisions might be appealed to the State Tax Commission by a Mayor with the consent of a majority of the city councilmen or by a town supervisor with the consent of a majority of the town board (L. 1919, ch.  304, &sect; 6).  Such appeal provisions in such special act did not repeal by implication the additional procedure for review provided by section 176-a of the Tax Law. Under section 176-a, any aggrieved taxpayer or the chief executive officer of any affected tax district may seek review.  Accordingly, the State Board of Equalization and Assessment has jurisdiction of a complaint by the Mayor of Buffalo and&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  by the supervisor of the Town of Tonawanda for review of equalization rates established for Erie County for 1955 by the Erie County Board of Equalization.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The Tax Law ( &sect; 176-a), as it read at the time, provided that a complaint for review shall be filed with the State Tax Commission &quot;within ten days after the delivery of the tax-roll to the collector.&quot; In this case the Erie County Board of Equalization fixed its rates for 1955 on October 29, 1954, and the County Board of Supervisors then adopted its budget on November 23, 1954, but, owing to clerical work, the tax roll for 1955 was not delivered until January 1, 1955.  Meantime, the Mayor and supervisor had filed their complaint for review on November 26, 1954.  As a practical matter, such filing was timely.  The statute merely fixed a time limitation beyond which a complaint might not be filed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The State equalization provisions of the State Constitution (art.  VIII, &sect; 10) are meant for the purpose of determining average full real estate valuation for the operations of constitutional tax limitations, and not for county equalization rates; hence a provision in that section that &quot;The legislature shall prescribe the manner by&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  which such ratio shall be determined&quot; does not apply to the review in this case.  </SPAN></P>

Prac. Act, &sect; 237-a) -- (13) allowances for maintenance and counsel fees adequate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. In a wife's action for a separation, relief was denied under section 1161 of the Civil Practice Act because of the existence of a valid prior decree of divorce in favor of defendant husband, obtained in Nevada without personal jurisdiction over the wife, and alternative relief was granted under section 1170-b of the Civil Practice Act which authorizes a court in a matrimonial action to direct maintenance for a wife &quot;as justice may require&quot; where the court is barred from granting a divorce, separation or annulment by reason of the prior granting of a judgment or decree for divorce or annulment in an action in which personal jurisdiction was not obtained over the wife.  The judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. By virtue of section 1170-b, a wife, who has never before obtained judicial provision for her support, may maintain an action resulting in a direction for maintenance, following a divorce in an action brought by the husband and in which she was not served&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  personally within the jurisdiction and in which she did not appear or defend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3.  Section 1170-b of the Civil Practice Act is constitutional.  That statute is a legislative extension of the judicial concept that a divorce based on constructive service alone is divisible; that the marital status between the parties may be severed, but that, despite such severance, the husband's economic marital obligation may survive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The wife became a resident of New York before the husband obtained the Nevada decree of divorce in his favor.  As a wronged wife, still undivorced, the wife brought the marital domicile with her, even if it were only a constructive matrimonial domicile.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Where the wife was divorced in Nevada by virtue of constructive service alone while she was a wife resident in New York, New York law would determine her marital status, whether &quot;unitary&quot; or &quot;divisible&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6.  Section 1170-b of the Civil Practice Act does not, by necessary implication, require a matrimonial domicile in New York as a condition to relief under it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. Defendant husband contended that the statute was designed to assist only a &quot;New York wife&quot;. But, given the concept of &quot;divisible divorce&quot;, plaintiff was&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  still a wife for the purpose of obtaining enforcement of the husband's in personam financial obligations.  The wife was in New York and had been there for the required one year (Civ. Prac. Act, &sect; 1165-a, subd.  3).  The statutory requirements to sue were satisfied.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. However, New York remedies are not to be considered indiscriminately available to migrant spouses for the purposes of lawsuits.  The phrase &quot;as justice may require&quot; was designed not to create a right as of course.  Rather, those words confer power and obligation upon a court of jurisdiction to render directions that serve the public policy of the State and protect its residents in proper cases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. In applying the statutory standard, a distinction will be made between an actual matrimonial domicile and a constructive marital domicile. If there be no actual matrimonial domicile in New York, it will be incumbent upon the wife to establish other equally significant circumstances before she merits relief under the statute.  In the case at bar there was no actual matrimonial domicile in New York, but there were other circumstances which suggested that discretion might be exercised in the wife's behalf.  The husband was&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  a man of many residences, temporary and permanent, and his family and economic ties with New York were great.  The parties frequently sojourned at the husband's maternal home in New York, the bulk of the husband's sources of income, while the parties lived in marriage, had a situs in New York, and the wife was receiving welfare assistance through the City of New York.  Thus the wife, in addition to having established residence in New York before the divorce, and the constructive marital domicile, also sufficiently established contacts with New York to merit relief under section 1170-b of the Civil Practice Act.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">10. Before maintenance may be ordered under section 1170-b, the wife must establish all the elements of the standard matrimonial causes of action.  The wife's testimony sufficiently established acts of cruelty and failure to support.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">11. Defendant husband established that he had resumed an earlier domicile in Nevada and the court properly found that the Nevada divorce was valid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">12. By virtue of section 237-a of the Civil Practice Act, once Special Term had overruled defendant's objection, made on special appearance, to the jurisdiction of the court, with leave to raise the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  defense in his answer, defendant had the opportunity to defend on the merits without jeopardizing his right to raise on appeal the jurisdictional issues tendered, and even though he failed to sustain, on appeal, his attack on the court's jurisdiction over his person, he was not subject to an in personam judgment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">13. Allowances for maintenance and counsel fees were adequate and justified by the record.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner taxpayer challenged the decision of respondent New York State Tax Commission (commission), which affirmed the assessment of additional personal income taxes under subdivision 11 of &sect; 360 of the Tax Law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer, a non-resident, took deductions for real estate taxes, mortgage interest, and other expenses that were not associated with his business in state. The commission disallowed the taxpayer's claimed deductions and assessed additional taxes. The taxpayer filed suit on grounds that New York's distinction between residents and non-residents for purposes of these deductions violated U.S. Const. art. IV, &sect; 2. The court held that the taxes were properly assessed because the distinction between residents and nonresidents was a reasonable one based upon valid independent reasons. The court found that the factor of residence had an obvious connection with the allowance of the deductions of a personal character and that the claimed deductions were properly associated with the place where the taxpayer resided.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court confirmed the decision of the commission, which had denied certain personal deductions of the taxpayer and had assessed additional taxes.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Taxation - personal income tax - deductions by nonresidents - constitutionality of disallowance of nonresident's nonbusiness deductions - (1) lawyer, all of whose income was earned in New York, but who lived in New Jersey was properly disallowed deductions on his New York personal income tax return for taxes and mortgage interest on his New Jersey home, and for medical expenses and life insurance premiums - (2) Tax Law ( &sect; 360, subd. 11) constitutionally disallows nonresident's deductions which are not connected with income derived from sources within State (U.S. Const., art. IV, &sect; 2). </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.A lawyer who resided in New Jersey but all of whose income was earned in New York was allowed deductions on his New York personal income tax return for expenses connected with the production of his income, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  such as bar association dues, legal periodicals, car expense and entertainment connected with production of such income, and also certain charitable contributions, but was properly disallowed the following nonbusiness deductions: real estate taxes on his home in New Jersey, interest on the mortgage on said home, medical expenses, and life insurance premiums. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.  The Tax Law ( &sect; 360, subd. 11) validly provides that &quot;In the case of a taxpayer other than a resident of the state the deductions allowed in this section * * * shall be allowed only if, and to the extent that, they are connected with income arising from sources within the state and taxable under this article to a nonresident taxpayer&quot;.  This does not offend the provision of the Federal Constitution (art. IV, &sect; 2) that &quot;The Citizens of each State shall be entitled to all Privileges and Immunities of Citizens in the several States.&quot; Just as a State has no jurisdiction to tax the income of a nonresident except to the extent that such income is derived from sources within the State, so a State need not accord a nonresident a deduction, in computing his net income, for expenses not connected with income derived from sources within&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the State.  Moreover, in allowing personal, nonbusiness deductions, a State may validly and constitutionally distinguish between its residents and nonresidents. The nonresidents' personal activities must be deemed to take place in the State of his residence.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of an order of the Supreme Court at Special Term in Albany County (New York), which dismissed his motion for an order pursuant to N.Y. C.P.L.R. art. 78 that would have declared 1950 N.Y. Laws 526 unconstitutional, and that would have directed respondent, the New York Civil Service Commission, to classify the position of workmen's compensation referee in the competitive class of classified civil service.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The amendments of 1950 N.Y. Laws 526 provided that workmen's compensation referees were included in the exempt class of the classified civil service. Appellant claimed that provision violated N.Y. Const. art. V, &sect; 6, which indicated that appointments and promotions in the state civil service shall be made according to merit and fitness to be ascertained, as far as practicable, by competitive examination. The legislation did not alter any long-standing or well-recognized policy of the Commission. When the title of referee was first used in 1921, the Commission placed the referees in the exempt class. However, a competitive examination was held in 1932 and appointments were made from that list. Three of the 51 referees were in the competitive class at the time that 1950 N.Y. Laws 526 was enacted. Hence, the policy lacked consistency and needed legislative direction. The personal qualities of fairness, patience, common sense, and judgment required of referees could not be determined by any objective test. N.Y. Const. art. V, &sect; 6 contemplated that civil service positions existed for which examinations were not practicable. Clearly, the position of referee was of such a nature.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Civil service - exempt class - workmen's compensation referees - (1) Workmen's Compensation Law ( &sect; 150), providing that position of workmen's compensation referee shall be in exempt class of classified civil service, does not violate direction of State Constitution (art. V, &sect; 6) that appointments in civil service shall be made as far as practicable upon competitive examination; petition in proceeding (art. 78) for order directing respondents to classify such position in competitive class properly dismissed - (2) Legislature did not act arbitrarily in placing position in exempt class and in impliedly determining that no examination supplies practicable test of fitness therefor - (3) where nature and character of duties of position had been defined by Legislature, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  not essential that Legislature hold hearings as to whether it was practicable to hold competitive examination - (4) other enumerated positions for which Civil Service Commission determined it practicable to hold competitive examinations not, in functions and importance, essentially same as workmen's compensation referees; at least Legislature and Civil Service Commission had right to so determine. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.  Section 150 of the Workmen's Compensation Law (as amd. by L. 1950, ch 526), which provides that the position of workmen's compensation referee shall be in the exempt class of the classified civil service, does not violate the direction of the State Constitution (art. V, &sect; 6) that &quot;Appointments and promotions in the civil service of the state * * * shall be made according to merit and fitness to be ascertained, as far as practicable, by examination which, as far as practicable, shall be competitive&quot;.  The petition in a proceeding under article 78 of the Civil Practice Act for an order directing respondents, the State Civil Service Commission and others, to classify such position in the competitive class, was properly dismissed. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.  It has been cemented into our law by legislative&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  enactment that workmen's compensation referees are quasi-judicial officers, with power to hear and determine compensation claims and with the concomitant authority to preside over proceedings, arrange calendars, sift and evaluate evidence and render decisions on controverted claims.  In view of the well-established nature and character of the duties of workmen's compensation referees, the Appellate Division is unable to conclude that the Legislature acted arbitrarily in placing them in the exempt class and in impliedly determining that no examination supplies a practicable test of fitness for the position.  No objective test would be practicable to determine such personal qualities essential to the position as fairness, patience, common sense and judgment. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3.  Where the nature and character of the duties of the position were themselves defined by the Legislature, it was not essential that the Legislature hold hearings as to whether it was practicable to hold a competitive examination. The finding of impracticability was necessarily implied in the exemption and was not required to be expressly stated. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4.  While the Civil Service Commission had determined it practicable to hold&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  competitive examinations for unemployment insurance referees, motor carrier referees, motor vehicle referees and hearing officers, those positions are not in their functions and importance essentially the same as workmen's compensation referees, or at least the Legislature and Civil Service Commission had the right to so determine. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant developers sought review of an order of the Supreme Court in Westchester County (New York), which entered judgment in favor of plaintiff city. The city's action sought to enjoin the developers from building an apartment house on grounds that the city had adopted a zoning ordinance, after the developer's plans were filed, changing the district where the land was located to one where the planned use was not permitted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city's zoning ordinance, City of Yonkers, N.Y. Zoning Ordinance 24-1953, provided that it would not require any change in the plans, construction or designated use of a building for which completed plans had been filed, or for which a building permit had been issued, provided that the construction of the building began within 90 days after the building permit was issued. This exception was twice amended to extend the time within which construction had to begin. The developer's building permit was not issued until after the ordinance became effective. Construction did not begin until more than 90 days later but within the extended period. On appeal, the court held that the clear intention of the exception was to exempt structures for which the plans had been filed prior to the effective date of the ordinance, even if the building permit was not granted until after the ordinance, as long as construction was started in a timely fashion. Even if the time limit was construed to apply only to building permits issued before the ordinance, that reading created a conflict within the ordinance that would be resolved by adopting the construction that was clearly intended.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.  After plans had been legally filed to erect&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  a six-story apartment house in a district wherein the city's zoning ordinance permitted such a structure, a new zoning ordinance was adopted in which the district was designated as one wherein such a structure was not permitted.  However, a section of the new zoning ordinance provided that nothing in the ordinance should require any change in plans theretofore legally filed &quot;or&quot; for which a building permit had been theretofore issued, provided that in either case, the construction of such building should have been actually begun within 90 days of the date of issue of such permit.  The permit was issued about two weeks after the effective date of the amendment.  Construction was not begun until about five months after the effective date of the amendment.  But, about four months after such effective date, the &quot;90 days&quot; was amended to &quot;150 days&quot;; and, about six months after such original effective date, it was further amended to &quot;210 days of the date of issue of such permit, heretofore legally issued&quot;.  Under such amendments, the proposed six-story apartment house was legal, since the plans were filed before the effective date of the new zoning ordinance and construction was begun within&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  210 days after the issuance of the building permit. A complaint seeking to restrain the construction should be dismissed. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.  The intention of the saving provision was clarified, if it needed any clarification, by the last amendment to the section, in which the words &quot;heretofore legally issued&quot; should be construed to mean permits legally issued before the date of such last amendment.  It would defeat the general purpose of the legislation, and would lead to unreasonable consequences, to construe the amendment so literally as to restrict it to permits issued before the originally effective date of the section. </SPAN></P>

Law &sect; 51, appellant property owner sought to enjoin the condemnation of his property on the ground that the applicable provisions of the Nassau County Administrative Code were unconstitutional and void and the condemnation proceedings were illegal. He appealed from an order dismissing the complaint for failure to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owner's contentions, in substance, were that the statute was illegal because of its failure to provide for personal service of the notice to condemn or the condemnation petition on a property owner, and that the proposed taking of his land was unnecessary and was not for a public purpose. The court found that the statute was not invalid merely because no provision was made for personal service of notice of the proceedings on the property owner. The absence of any provision in the Nassau County Administrative Code bringing the factor of necessity of the taking within judicial consideration showed that the legislature had delegated its power to the town board to determine necessity. The determination of that question, therefore, was a legislative function and not a judicial one. While the question of whether or not a proposed condemnation was for a public purpose was a judicial question, the court held that the complaint failed to plead facts indicating that the asserted use was not a public one. The purpose of the acquisition was to obtain access to property which the town had previously purchased.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The claimant filed suit against the state with the court of claims to recover for injuries that he sustained at a state worksite.

The court of claims denied the motion, and the state sought review. The court affirmed the denial of the state's motion, holding that N.Y. Ct. Cl. Act &sect; 9(6) did not authorize the state to implead or bring in a third party against whom it may have asserted a claim over. In the practice of impleader there were no adverse claims against a party under an alleged obligation. Pursuant to N.Y. Civ. Prac. Act. &sect; 193-a, impleader was the means by which the primary liability of the original defendant and the alleged &quot;liability over&quot; of a third party were to be settled in one action.

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.  Upon the application of the New York Telephone Company for an increase in telephone rates, the Public Service Commission should have received evidence of the alleged present value of the property actually used in the public service. The Public Service Law ( &sect; 97, subd. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  1) provides that a determination of the rates should be made &quot;with due regard, among other things, to a reasonable average return upon the value of the property actually used in the public service&quot;.  The words &quot;value of the property actually used in the public service&quot; were used with deliberate intention and design when the statute was enacted in 1910 and re-enacted in 1921.  Under </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Smyth </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">v.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11"> Ames</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (169 U.S. 466) a public utility was entitled to have its rates based on present fair value.

Those words continued with the same force and effect after the United States Supreme Court abandoned the concept of present fair value as a constitutional requirement for a rate base ( </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Federal Power Comm. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">v.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11"> Hope Natural Gas Co.,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 320 U.S. 591 [1944]) and left the Legislature free to disregard it, but did not bar its use.  The failure of the Legislature to act after the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Hope</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> case was decided in 1944 is of decisive importance.  Fairly construed, the words &quot;value of the property actually used in the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  public service&quot; can only mean present value. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.  Accordingly, reproduction cost less depreciation is an indispensable ingredient to be considered in fixing the present value of property actually used in the public service. Reproduction cost can only be shown by opinion evidence. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3.  The language of section 97 is mandatory.  The commission undoubtedly has rather wide discretionary power, but it could not give &quot;due regard&quot; to the value of property actually used in the public service if some proof of that measure were not before it. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The horse owner was previously licensed to race but his license application was later denied through a ruling of a joint board which the New York Supreme Court later deemed null and ineffective.

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.  In section 9-b of the act pertaining to the State Racing Commission (L. 1926, ch. 440, as amd. by L. 1934, ch. 310), the Legislature purported to empower the Jockey Club, a private corporation, to license owners of horses at races.  The club denied petitioner a license for the years 1949 and 1950.  Petitioner, while protesting the unconstitutionality of such delegation of licensing power, demanded a hearing before a joint board consisting of the State Racing Commission and two stewards of the club (&sect; 9-b, as amd. by L. 1947, ch. 196).  The joint board sustained the denial, in &quot;the best interest of racing&quot;, a standard set by the rules of the club.  The statute itself set no standards.  The Court of Appeals annulled the determination, on the grounds that&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  section 9-b was an unconstitutional relinquishment of legislative power and that, even if the licensing power had been delegated to a governmental agency, such delegation would be void for lack of proper standards ( </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Matter of Fink </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">v.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11"> Cole,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 302 N.Y. 216). The Legislature thereupon enacted a new section 9-b (L. 1951, ch. 324) empowering the State Racing Commission to grant licenses and to deny licenses if it &quot;shall find&quot; that any of a number of stated standards is or is not met by the applicant (&sect; 9-b, subd. 2).  Subsequently, petitioner applied for a license for the year commencing April 1, 1954.  The commission, without a hearing, denied this application for &quot;failure to meet the standards set&quot; by the new section 9-b, but did not specify which standard.In this review proceeding under article 78 of the Civil Practice Act, the commission stated that it &quot;considered anew the proof in the [prior] proceeding * * * and reaffirmed the said decision&quot;.  This was an arbitrary and capricious disregard of the constitutional principle enunciated by the Court of Appeals.  This proceeding was properly remanded to the commission for further consideration. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.  It would amount to nullification&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of a constitutional principle to say that, although the prior proceeding and decision were ruled out of legitimate consideration, the evidence could be lifted out and, without more, become the entire basis of a like decision five years later. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3.  Although the new section 9-b (subd. 2) does not expressly provide for a hearing, there must be some enunciation by the commission of its finding and the basis for its finding, and it must be based on something resembling proof, and must be made upon such a record as can be reviewed by a court in order to decide whether the determination was arbitrary. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4.  Since the determination made in this case was not made &quot;as the result of a hearing held, and at which evidence was taken, pursuant to statutory direction&quot; (Civ. Prac. Act, art. 78, &sect; 1296), the reviewing court in this proceeding under article 78 of the Civil Practice Act cannot use the so-called &quot;substantial evidence&quot; rule.  But petitioner seeks an order not only annulling the determination but also directing the issuance of a license; hence the court may inquire whether there is clear and convincing proof that the commission exercised its discretion arbitrarily or capriciously. </SPAN></P>

The owners alleged the Commissioner illegally created the enlarged, consolidated school district. The owners sought judgments that would enjoin the consolidated district and its board of education from assessing the owners' real property. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that: (1) &sect; 1526 did not offend the Constitution either because the voters of a certain school district were not permitted to vote or because there was an unconstitutional delegation of legislative powers to the Commissioner; (2) the area meeting, which was neither a city school district meeting nor a district meeting, was not subject as to time, place, or methods of voting to any provisions of the Education Law except as set forth in &sect; 1526; and (3) where all provisions of &sect; 1526 were fully complied with, the meeting and vote taken thereat were legal and valid.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.  Section 1526 of the Education Law, pursuant to which the State Commissioner of Education created an enlarged city school district by consolidating with it sixty-one school districts in the contiguous area, which in this case lay in three counties, sets limitations and standards on the powers delegated to the commissioner, and therefore the statute is not an unconstitutional delegation of legislative powers. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.  Section 1526 of the Education Law provides for a vote by the qualified voters of the contiguous school district areas&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to be consolidated with the city school district and for a consenting resolution by the board of education of the city school district (subd. 4).  This is valid.  There is no constitutional right inthe voters of the city school district to vote on such consolidation. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3.  The State Commissioner of Education duly called a &quot;special meeting of the qualified voters within each such area&quot; (Education Law, &sect; 1526, subd. 5).  The time, place and method of voting provided in section 1526 were complied with.  Section 1526 (subd. 6) further provides that &quot;Any person qualified to vote in any school district wholly or partly within the area laid out by the commissioner and who resides whthin such area shall be qualified to vote at such meeting.&quot; Section 2012 of article 41 states the qualifications of voters at district meetings.  Section 2603 of article 53 states the qualifications of voters in a city school district in a city of less than 125,000 inhabitants. These were complied with.  Since this was an area meeting (art. 31, &sect; 1526), the provisions as to time, place and method of voting in articles 41 and 53 governing &quot;district meetings&quot; and elections in &quot;city school districts&quot; respectively, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  were not applicable.  Hence it is unnecessary to determine whether one of the districts in the area was a city school district, and if so, whether section 2037 of article 41 applies to it. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant Public Service Commission (commission) sought review of the final order of the County Court of Onondaga County (New York), which confirmed the report of commissioners of appraisal appointed in a proceeding to condemn properties of respondent New York Water Service Corporation (water service), and denied a motion made by the commission pursuant to N.Y. Condemn. Law &sect; 18 for abandonment and discontinuance of the proceeding.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent Water Authority authorized the acquisition of the water service's plant. The commissioners of appraisal made their report and after entry of the final order by the state court, the commission filed a motion to abandon and discontinue the order, which was denied. The other parties challenged the commission's right to bring the action. The court reversed the final order and held that the commission was a proper party to the proceeding. The commission argued that the award was grossly excessive and was not supported by the evidence upon any theory of valuation, that the appraisers did not give adequate consideration to the result attained by capitalization of the earnings of the corporation as a regulated public utility, and that an erroneous principle was adopted by the appraisers in that the award was made on the basis of condemnor's ability to pay rather than the value of condemnee's properties being condemned. The court agreed and held that regardless of the principle of valuation adopted, the question of just compensation was not to have been determined by the value to the government which takes, but the value to the individual from which the property was taken.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the final order and remanded to the commissioners of appraisal for a new appraisal.

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eminent domain - award - public utilities - public authorities - (1) in proceeding by public authority to condemn property of public utility, commissioners of appraisal shall give &quot;due regard&quot; to Public Service Commission's certification of rate base and rate of return and anticipated annual net earnings; and if final award does not capitalize such earnings or is so excessive as to be not in public interest, commission shall ask court to discontinue proceeding; commission is party for all purposes (Condemnation Law, &sect;&sect; 5-a, 14, 15, 18, as amd.); commission needs no order to intervene, and also may appeal from award and from&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  court's refusal to direct that proceeding be abandoned - (2) Legislature stated it was not &quot;attempting to mandate the basis of valuation&quot;; amendments constitutional (N.Y.

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.  The Condemnation Law (as amd. by L. 1952, chs. 508, 515) provides that a copy of a petition to condemn the property of a person or corporation subject to the jurisdiction of the Public Service Commission must be served on the Public Service Commission, which must then, after a hearing, certify to the court and to the commissioners of appraisal (1) the annual net earnings which the utility system involved might reasonably be expected to continue to produce in the hands of the condemnee, and (2) the rate base and rate of return from which that estimate is derived (Condemnation Law, &sect; 5-a); that the commissioners of appraisal shall determine the compensation with &quot;due regard * * * to the anticipated earnings of&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  such company as certified&quot; (&sect; 14); that the Public Service Commission &quot;shall be a party to such proceedings for all purposes&quot; (&sect; 15); and finally, that if the final order of confirmation directs payment of an amount which is (1) not a capitalization of the certified earnings of the system, or (2), in the opinion of the Public Service Commission, is so excessive or insufficient as to be not in the public interest, the commission shall ask the court to exercise its discretionary power to order that the proceeding be abandoned and discontinued (&sect; 18).  Under the above-quoted section 15, the Public Service Commission needs no order permitting it to intervene (Civ. Prac. Act, &sect; 193-b).  It is a party &quot;for all purposes&quot;, including the right of appeal (Condemnation Law, &sect; 19). </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.  Such 1952 amendments to the Condemnation Law do not usurp the jurisdiction of the courts and the commissioners of appraisal to determine the just compensation (N.Y. Const., art. I, &sect; 7).  The Legislature pointed out (L. 1952, ch. 508, &sect; 1) that it was not &quot;attempting to mandate the basis of valuation to be followed&quot;. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3.  In this proceeding by the Onondaga County Water Authority (Public Authorities Law, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  art. 5, tit. 6; L. 1951, ch. 675) to acquire the Syracuse water-distributing plant of respondent public utility, the Public Service Commission certified, after a hearing, that the anticipated annual net earnings were $ 237,000, being a 6% return upon a rate base of capital actually expended of $ 3,950,000.  This was placed in the record by the commissioners of appraisal, without comment.  Their report formally stated that they had considered it.  The utility's principal witness testified that the reproduction cost new less depreciation was $ 12,700,000; but $ 4,700,000 of this was his valuation of intangible water rights, which was a double valuation based on duplicating and expanding the existing supply structures and should not have been considered.  The value to be appraised is the present system, and not that which the condemnee expects to build.  Similarly, the Authority's principal witness fixed $ 8,650,000, not as the value of the present system, but as what the Authority &quot;can afford to pay&quot;.  Furthermore, he based this on the Authority's prospective earnings on an expanded system; also, he improperly gave to the condemnee the capitalized benefit of tax-free operation by the Authority. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Authority, too, presented no evidence of the present economic value to the owner.  Its petition had alleged that the value was $ 8,500,000; and the commissioners of appraisal found that - plus additions and betterments and work in progress which they found precisely in the form stated in the Authority's estimate - the total value was $ 8,650,000.  On this appeal by the Public Service Commission, the condemnee appeared merely as a respondent, joining with the Authority in arguing in favor of the award and against appellant Public Service Commission.  The record does not contain evidence from which the fair value of the property could be correctly determined, and the award was apparently based on what the condemnor could afford to pay. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4.  The Legislature had found that condemnation awards to privately owned public utilities often were &quot;not based upon the damage to the private owner but upon the benefit to the condemnor&quot; (L. 1952, ch. 508, &sect; 1), and it directed that &quot;due regard&quot; be given to the anticipated annual net earnings. This was only an expression of what had long been decisional law.  There is no evidence in this case that the commissioners gave any real consideration&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to the expressed will of the Legislature. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5.  Therefore, the final order confirming the award should be reversed and the matter remitted to the same commissioners for a new appraisal. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parking corporation maintained an open parking lot. The parking lot was immediately adjacent to the structure occupied by the religious school. The parking corporation applied, pursuant to New York City, N.Y., Zoning Resolution &sect; 21-F, for approval of the erection of a garage designed to hold 450 cars. New York City, N.Y., Zoning Resolution &sect; 21-A prohibited the operation of garages having a vehicular entrance within 200 feet from an entrance or exit of a school maintained by an established religious group. Defendant city planning commission unanimously passed a resolution approving the application. Defendant board of estimate confirmed the approval even though the religious school was within the proscribed distance from the projected garage. However, at the time application was approved, it had no pupils or teachers. The school filed an action seeking to restrain the parking corporation from proceeding on the garage.

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.  The New York City Zoning Resolution (&sect; 21-F) provides that an application for approval of a public garage to be erected on a site which is within a restricted zone - in this case it was a retail use district - may be approved by resolution of the city planning commission, subject to appropriate conditions, and that such approval takes effect when further approved by the board of estimate, and that nothing in this section divests the board of standards and appeals of its jurisdiction to permit variances of&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the zoning resolution.  Defendant owner of a parking lot on a busy mid-town street was granted such approval for a 450-car garage, on condition that no facilities should be provided for gasoline service or oil selling or repairing of vehicles.  Section 21-A of the zoning resolution at that time prohibited a gagage with a vehicular entrance within 200 feet of a school maintained by an established religious group - such as plaintiff.  However, plaintiff's school had recently had only ten pupils, and more recently it was in what plaintiff called a temporary suspension of operation.  The planning commission and the board of estimate found that plaintiff was not operating a school within the contemplation of section 21-A.  The parking garage was approved after public hearings at which plaintiff appeared.  Meantime, the city planning commission had been conducting a six-month study and public hearings, from which it found that, throughout the city as well as in this neighborhood, there was insufficient provision for off-street accommodation of motor vehicles, and, as a result of which, the board of estimate approved and enacted a resolution of the planning commission which amended section&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  21-A generally, by narrowing the restriction against garages so as to exclude only garages selling gasoline and oil. This general amendment to section 21-A was enacted about three months after defendant had been given such special permission.  Plaintiff, asserting that the special permission and the subsequent zoning amendment were &quot;spot zoning&quot; and &quot;tailor-made&quot; for defendant, sued to enjoin the authorized garage and to have the amendment declared unconstitutional.  Plaintiff also joined the board of estimate and the planning commission as defendants.  Summary judgment should be granted dismissing the complaint. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.  Section 21-A as amended, and section 21-F, are valid and constitutional. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3.  The burden of showing that an ordinance is not justified under governmental police power by any reasonable interpretation of the facts is on those who assail it.  There is no proof to support any claim that the approval of defendant's projected garage was based on incorrect motives or was special legislation for the benefit of defendant alone.  The hearings before the planning commission and the board of estimate show that the city-wide amendment to section 21-A was enacted after careful&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  study of its effect upon thousands of schools and hospitals as contrasted with its effect upon a critical city-wide off-street parking problem.  Such balancing of relative harm, benefit and convenience is peculiarly a legislative function. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4.  Section 21-A must be applied as it now reads, not as it read when defendant's application was first approved. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5.  Section 21-F does not conflict with the discretion of the board of standards and appeals to grant individual variances in hardship and other cases authorized by the zoning resolution (New York City Charter, &sect; 666, subd. 5).  A zoning regulation, such as section 21-F, which provides that the board of standards and appeals may grant a variance from it, may be amended or repealed (New York City Charter, &sect; 200).  The variance-granting power of the board of standards and appeals stems in the first instance from the powers granted to the board of estimate (L. 1917, ch. 601).  The fact that defendant might have been granted substantially the same result by the board of standards and appeals does not mean that the legislative zoning scheme could not be amended.  The courts have sustained, as a valid exercise of the legislative zoning&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  power rather than a grant of a variance, zoning provisions such as section 21-F, whereby a general enactment withholds blanket approval beforehand and requires subsequent separate authorizations for specific uses. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6.  Special Term erred in refusing to adjudge summarily the constitutionality of section 21-F and section 21-A as amended, on the stated ground that there were preliminary questions of fact as to whether the school existed and as to whether the board of estimate acted for the benefit of defendant only.  The substance or counterparts of this type of zoning legislation had previously been held to be constitutional in analogous situations.  Since sections 21-A and 21-F of the zoning resolution are valid and constitutional both as enacted and as they bear upon the facts in this case, and since such holding leaves no issue of fact to be determined, summary judgment should be granted dismissing the complaint.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant state commissioner of agriculture and markets (commissioner) sought review of an order from the Supreme Court, Albany County (New York), which declared that N.Y. Agric. &amp; Mkts. Law &sect; 64(2), prohibiting the sale of evaporated skimmed milk in containers of less than 10 pounds avoirdupois net weight, was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent Ohio dairy products manufacturer challenged the constitutionality of &sect; 64(2). The commissioner alleged that the statute was necessary to prevent fraud and deception in the sale of evaporated skimmed milk in containers similar to those used in the sale of evaporated milk. The trial court granted summary judgment for the dairy products manufacturer, and the commissioner appealed. The court held that although the legislature had the authority to protect the public from fraudulent substitutes, there was no evidence that evaporated skimmed milk could be considered a fraudulent substitute for anything else and that there was no other reason justifying the legislation. The court held that even if the statute had been valid at its enactment in 1922, conditions had changed greatly, making the enforcement of the statute unreasonable and arbitrary. The court noted that the product sold by the dairy products manufacturer was not adulterated milk, as defined in N.Y. Agric. &amp; Mkts. Law &sect; 46.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's judgment declaring that the New York statute prohibiting the sale of evaporated skimmed milk in containers of less than 10 pounds of avoirdupois weight was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional law - milk control - (1) judgment declaring unconstitutional that part of 1922 statute which prohibited sale of evaporated skimmed milk unless in ten-pound containers and which thus in effect barred such product from retail sales, affirmed; continued exercise of police power against milk product now widely recognized as nutritive, unreasonable - (2) evaporated skimmed milk with vitamins added is not &quot;adulterated&quot;. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.  Subdivision 2 of section 64 of the Agriculture and Markets Law of this State provides that &quot;No person shall sell * * * any condensed or evaporated skimmed milk, except it be in containers or packages containing ten pounds avoirdupois net weight or more * * * distinctly labeled * * * in block letters not&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  less than one-half inch in height * * * 'Condensed Skimmed Milk' or 'Evaporated Skimmed Milk'&quot;.  This statute was originally enacted thirty-two years ago.  Today, the nutritional values and uses of skimmed milk and condensed or evaporated skimmed milk are widely recognized by experts and by the retail buying public.  Where the milk is labeled as provided in the above subdivision, there is no reason to fear that the public will be confused and deceived.  The ten-pound-container requirement is, today, a disservice to those who wish to buy this product in the same conveniently small containers as those in which they usually buy evaported whole milk or skimmed fluid milk. Whether or not the ten-pound requirement was a reasonable police regulation thirty-two years ago, in present times it is arbitrary, discriminatory, unreasonable, unconstitutional and void.  The judgment, in an action by a manufacturer and distributor of evaporated skimmed milk, declaring that that part of the subdivision which prohibits the sale of evaporated skimmed milk except in containers holding ten pounds or more is void, should be affirmed. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.  Skimmed milk is milk &quot;from which part or all of the cream has been&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  removed&quot;, and, if &quot;sold for and as skimmed milk&quot;, it cannot be classified as &quot;adulterated milk&quot; (Agriculture and Markets Law, &sect; 46, par. 7 and also unnumbered paragraph; &sect; 50; &sect; 64, subd. 1).  Nor has plaintiff's product been &quot;diluted with water or any other fluid&quot; (&sect; 46, par. 8).  Vitamin A has been added in the form of a concentrated oil, and vitamin D[3] in the form of a concentrate already mixed with milk. These do not constitute such a &quot;foreign substance&quot; (&sect; 46, par. 8) as renders the milk corrupt or debased or &quot;adulterated&quot;.

The Commissioner had sustained a contract made by respondent board of education to sell the real property of a discontinued school to a church rather than to the bidder.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The board called a special meeting of qualified voters of to consider a vote upon a proposition to close the school and to sell the school property. In the notice of the meeting, the propositions included: (1) should the school be closed; and (2) should the school property be sold to the church for a certain amount. At the meeting, these two proposals were carried by a majority vote. The bidder made an oral offer in an amount higher than any other bid, but a majority of the qualified voters present at the meeting decided to accept the offer made by the church. Thereafter, the board entered into a contract to sell the property to the church. The Commissioner upheld the board's decision. The trial court annulled and set aside the Commissioner's determination. On appeal, the court reversed and dismissed the bidder's petition, holding that: (1) under N.Y. Educ. Law &sect; 310, Commissioner's decision was final and binding unless it was arbitrary, which it was not; (2) under N.Y. Educ. Law &sect;&sect; 1520, 1804, the board had normal discretionary power to deal with the matter of the sale of school property; and (3) the board's action did not violate N.Y. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 1.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Schools - sale of property and site of discontinued school - (1) voters of common school district which had been included in central school district voted to close their school and to sell such real property to church for $2,000, as against offer by grange of $3,000 proposed and offer by one of petitioners, private individuals, of $4,000; Commissioner of Education sustained contract; commissioner's determination is conclusive (Education Law, &sect; 310), unless purely arbitrary or unconstitutional - (2) property of pre-existing common school district may be dold by board of education on majority vote of qualified voters of district (&sect; 1804, subd. 6); further provision that net proceeds shall be distributed among taxpayers&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  was not intended to deprive voters of normal discretion; voters may authorize sale of former site and building at price and terms they deem proper (Education Law, &sect; 402, subd. 1) - (3) commissioner's interpretation of statute not contrary to State Constitution (art. VIII, &sect; 1), since sale for substantial price is not gift - (4) no violation of due process of law as to those taxpanyers who are not voters; they had no vested right in the property - (5) commissioner's action not arbitrary or wholly lacking in rationality; petition dismissed. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.  At a duly called meeting of the qualified voters of a common school district which had been included in a central school district, it was decided by a majority vote to close heir schoolhouse and to sell such real property to a neighborhood church for $2,000, as against an offer by the local grange of $3,000, and as against a proposed offer of $4,000 by one of the petitioners in this proceeding, who are private individuals.  Pursuant to such a vote, the board of education of the central school district entered into a contract to sell the property to the church. Petitioners chose to appeal to the State Commissioner of Education instead of to&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the courts, and the commissioner sustained the making of the contract.  In such case the commissioner's determination is conclusive (Education Law, &sect; 310), unless it is so arbitrary that no reasonable man could reach such result, or unless the commissioner's interpretation of a statute would produce an unconstitutional result. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.  The property of a pre-existing common school district may be sold by the board of education upon a majority vote of the qualified voters of the district (&sect; 1804, subd. 6).  The further provision in said subdivision 6 that the net proceeds of the sale shall be distributed among the taxpayers of such district was not intended to deprive the voters of normal discretionary power. In the absence of a specific statutory provision, the board of a municipal or other public corporation is not required to use competitive bidding in selling its property.  Furthermore, &quot;Whenever the site of a schoolhouse shall have been changed * * * the inhabitants of a district entitled to vote, lawfully assembled at any district meeting, shall have power, by a majority of the votes of those present and voting, to direct the sale of the former site or lot, and the buildings thereon&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and appurtenances or any part thereof, at such price and upon such terms as they shall deem proper&quot; (&sect; 402, subd. 1). </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3.  A bona fide sale for a substantial price is not a gift prohibited by the State Constitution (art. VIII, &sect; 1). </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4.  The commissioner's decision and interpretation of the statutes does not result in depriving the minority of the voters, and the taxpayers who are not residents of the district and who are therefore not entitled to vote, of any interest in property without due process of law. The taxpayers have no vested interest in the property.  The Legislature could, if it wished, have directed that the proceeds of the sale be turned over to the central school district instead of being distributed among the taxpayers of the common school district.  As a matter of fact, the Legislature has provided for that disposition of the proceeds of sales under subdivision 6 of section 1804, upon approval by a majority of the voters of the district, in the case of sales taking place after March 31, 1954 (L. 1954, ch. 362); and under the present statute, too, the taxpayers had no right to the proceeds, except to the extent that the Legislature gave it to them. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5.  The commissioner's&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  action was not arbitrary or wholly lacking in rationality. Accordingly, an order of Special Term annulling the commissioner's determination should be reversed and the petition dismissed. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff vendor filed an action against defendant New York Tax Commission and challenged the validity of the Commission's assessment of highway use tax against vehicles that the vendor had repossessed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The vendor sold three tractors to a carrier, which was subject to the highway use tax pursuant to N.Y. Tax Law art. 21. The carrier defaulted on its payments and the vendor repossessed the tractors. The Commission then asserted a lien against the tractors for unpaid taxes. The vendor filed an action against the Commission and challenged the validity of the lien. The court found that the Commission had lien priority regarding the unpaid taxes. The court reasoned that the tax was imposed on the carrier for its use of the State's highways. Furthermore, if the tax went unpaid then the Commission was entitled to seek recourse against the property. Therefore, the court found that the Commission's lien had priority.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found in favor of the Tax Commission.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Taxation - highway use tax - priority of lien - constitutional law - (1) tax on carriers using highways attaches at &quot;time of operation of any motor vehicle&quot; and is &quot;paramount to all prior liens * * * and to the rights of any holder of the legal title in or to any such motor vehicle&quot; (Tax Law, art. 21, &sect; 506); such sovereign priority of lien is constitutional - (2) title of assignee of conditional vendor, which repossessed vehicles, is subject to lien of such taxes incurred by conditional vendee - (3) such lien includes taxes incurred by vendee in its operation of other vehicles both before and after it bought vehicles which were eventually repossessed; also included are taxes assessed after such repossession for periods prior to such repossession - (4) but statute does not impose lien on vehicle for taxes of vendee accruing after repossession by vendor - (5) statute constitutional despite provisions for seizure and sale without notice of tax deficiencies and secrecy of tax returns and failure to provide for notice of assessment of tax deficiencies. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.  The highway use tax on carriers using&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  motor vehicles on the highways (Tax Law, art. 21) has been declared constitutional (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Mid-States Frgt. Lines </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">v.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11"> Bates,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 304 N.Y. 700, certiorari denied 345 U.S. 908). Likewise constitutional and within the sovereign prerogative is the provision of section 506 (in art. 21) that the tax &quot;shall constitute a lien upon all motor vehicles * * * of such carrier&quot; and that such &quot;lien shall attach at the time of operation of any motor vehicle * * * of such carrier within this state and * * * shall be paramount to all prior liens or encumbrances * * * and to the rights of any holder of the legal title in or to any such motor vehicle&quot;. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.  Thus, the title of the assignee of a conditional vendor, which, after the conditional vendee defaulted in payments under such sales contracts, repossessed such motor vehicles, is subject to the lien of the State for unpaid taxes, penalties and interest due from the conditional vendee. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3.  Such lien includes (1) taxes incurred by the vendee as a result of its operation of the repossessed vehicles, (2) taxes incurred by the vendee as a result of its operation of other vehicles purchased from the same vendors or from other vendors, (3) taxes incurred by&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the vendee both prior and subsequent to its purchase of the trucks which were eventually repossessed, and (4) taxes for periods prior to such repossession, including any taxes assessed therefor after such repossession. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4.  But the statute does not impose a lien on a motor vehicle for taxes accruing against the conditional vendee after the conditional vendor has repossessed the vehicle. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5.  The statute is not to be adjudged unconstitutional on the ground that some hardship may result from its failure to provide for notice of assessment of tax deficiencies, its provisions for seizure and sale of vehicles without notice, and its provisions for secrecy of tax returns.  It is not reasonable to assume that the tax authorities will administer the law in such manner as to produce unnecessary inequities.  </SPAN></P>

A certain percentage of the company's products were procured in the city and sold in the city where the company had its establishment. The trial court found that &sect; 140a conflicted with the Meat Packing Act, 21 U.S.C.S. &sect; 87, which permitted 20 percent of water, and infringed on a federal policy so far as interstate commerce was concerned. The trial court declared New York City, N.Y., Sanitary Code &sect; 140a unconstitutional and enjoined the city from enforcing it against the company. On appeal, the court held that the city had in its police power the right to regulate the quantity of water in corned beef briskets insofar as its regulation affected solely intrastate commerce. The court noted that Congress did not intend completely to occupy the field involved, but that the Meat Packing Act expressly made an exception with regard to persons who transported or sold meat in a state in which the establishment was located.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The insurance company proposed to use part of certain real property they had acquired for its own use, which required the superintendent's approval under N.Y.

The insurance company sought judicial review of the determination, pursuant to N.Y. Civ. Prac. Act &sect; 78, but the trial court denied their motion. The court affirmed on appeal. The court ruled that when the right to judicial review under &sect; 78 was not specifically granted, it was not available. The court held that the only instance in which a determination of the superintendent would have been annulled was where he had misconceived or exceeded his grant of authority under &sect; 81(7). The court held that the fact that the superintendent had not misconceived nor exceeded its statutory grant of authority in combination with the fact that the legislature was silent on whether the court had the power to review the superintendent's determination, led to the court's decision that the superintendent's decision could not be annulled in these circumstances.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Petitioner insurance company applied to respondent Superintendent of Insurance, pursuant to the Insurance Law ( &sect; 81, subd. 7, par.

Petitioner&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  owned a twenty-story building in New York County in which it occupied thirteen floors and rented the remaining seven floors. The seven rented floors contain sufficient space for petitioner's expansion purposes.  Since 1946, petitioner has spent $400,000 in modernizing this building and, in addition, respondent, some years ago, approved the acquisition of an adjoining building to provide room for expansion.  Petitioner's contemplated move to the city of White Plains, where it intends to erect a two-story office building and to occupy it in whole or in part, was planned as a temporary expedient.  The superintendent, in denying petitioner's application, held that the proposed White Plains building was not &quot;requisite&quot; for the convenient accommodation of petitioner's business, and found that petitioner failed to demonstrate that its present quarters were inadequate for the convenient transaction of its business or that economies in the best interests of policyholders would flow from such acquisition. The superintendent further found that the proposed building was purely an interim measure, that the cost of the project would be upwards of $1,300,000, that plans for the actual use of the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  proposed building by petitioner had not been crystallized, and that petitioner was still endeavoring to find a proper location for a new home office building. Even if the court had power to review the decision of the Superintendent of Insurance, on such review it would be determined that his decision was neither arbitrary nor capricious, and that it had a reasonable basis and was amply supported by the evidence adduced on the hearing, and, accordingly, Special Term properly denied petitioner's application under article 78 of the Civil Practice Act to annul the superintendent's determination.  </SPAN></P>

Pro., &sect; 8; Civil Rights Law, &sect; 12; Judiciary Law, &sect; 4) - (5) Federal decisions construing Sixth Amendment to Federal Constitution do not apply to such New York statutes - &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  (6) error of totally excluding press and public during People's case was compounded by letting them in during defendant's case; effect was to shield People's witnesses from publicity and to expose defendant's witnesses. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.  Judgment on a verdict convicting defendant of compulsory prostitution of two women (Penal Law, &sect; 2460) was sustained by sufficient evidence; but defendant did not have a fair trial and a new trial should be granted, because (a) after the jury had been accepted (Code Crim. Pro., &sect;&sect; 371, 374) and during the evidence-taking part of the trial, the court examined two jurors several times as to their impartiality, and (b) the court excluded the general public and the press during the presentation of the People's case, contrary to Judiciary Law ( &sect; 4), Code of Criminal Procedure (&sect; 8) and Civil Rights Law ( &sect; 12), and then compounded the error by admitting the public and the press to the presentation of the defendant's case.  Although the trial court deemed these actions to be in the interests of justice and morals and against the dissemination of obscenity, the effect on the trial was to intimidate jurors and witnesses who might honestly have been for the defendant&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and to protect any possibly dishonest witnesses for the People. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.  After a jury has been accepted and sworn and testimony has begun, there is generally no place in our procedure for renewed questioning of a juror as to his qualifications based on matters preceding his acceptance.  there was no showing that either juror had concealed any facts or made any untruthful statement upon his </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">voir dire</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> examination.  Furthermore, although the two jurors were questioned separately and not in the presence of the other jurymen, the latter knew that the others were being retained in court from time to time after they had departed. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3.  Also, a private conversation, not in the presence of counsel for all parties, between the Trial Judge and a juror in whose mind doubts had arisen as to his ability to be impartial, was improper. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4.  The traditional Anglo-American distrust of secret trials was reflected in the adoption of the Sixth Amendment to the Federal Constitution.  When the courts decided that the amendment did not apply to State courts, and it was realized that out State Constitution contained no similar sefeguard, our Legislature provided in the Revised Statutes of 1829 that &quot;the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  accused has a right to a * * * public trial&quot; and that &quot;The sittings of every court within this state, shall be public, and every citizen may freely attend the same&quot;.  The firstquoted provision is now found in the Code of Criminal Procedure (&sect; 8) and also in the Civil Rights Law ( &sect; 12).  The second-quoted provision is now in the Judiciary Law ( &sect; 4), to which has been added: &quot;except that in all proceedings and trials in cases for divorce, seduction, abortion, rape, assault with intent to commit rape, sodomy, bastardy or filiation, the court may, in its discretion, exclude therefrom all persons who are not directly interested therein&quot; - which amendment does not apply to this case. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5.  Federal decisions construing the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution do not control our courts' interpretation of these broad, New York statutes, except as the determination may be violative of the due process clause of the Federal Constitution. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6.  A trial court has inherent power to exclude particular individuals if good order requires it or to clear the courtroom of spectators for a limited time to preserve order, or to exclude children, or to limit the number of spectators in an&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  overcrowded courtroom. But it may not exclude the press and the general public during the People's case and then compound that error by admitting them to the defendant's case.  A witness who testifies glibly and falsely in the secrecy of a grand jury room will often refuse or be reluctant to give the same untrue testimony upon the trial in open court, where he knows that there may be persons who can and will come forward to testify to the true facts.  The ruling of the trial court in this case was, in effect, that a witness for the People would be shielded from publicity but a witness for the defense would have to testify in the pitiless glare of press and public.  In such circumstances, it must be presumed that the defendant's rights to a fair trial were prejudiced.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city agreed to pay to the parking authority the amount of the authority's estimated yearly deficit from the net revenues of city parking meters, so long as bonds of the parking authority remained outstanding.

The bonds were the liability of the parking authority, and did not become the obligation of the city because of the city's promise of money.

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Public authorities - city parking authority - municipal corporations - traffic regulation - (1) to provide parking areas to decrease traffic congestion, City of Elmira Parking Authority Act empowered city to give real or personal property to Authority, and latter to accept loans or contributions from city and to issue bonds on which Authority alone would be liable; city charter was amended by local law to authorize contract whereby city agreed to pay any deficits of Authority up to $25,000 annually out of net revenues of existing city parking meters, total number of which should not be substantially reduced during life of agreement; agreement valid and taxpayer's action dismissed - (2) municipality cannot give its credit but it can give or lend its own money to public corporation (N.Y. Const., art. VIII, &sect; 1) - (3) city could use its own parking meter revenues for city parking project under General Municipal Law ( &sect; 72-j), and should be able&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to do so even when it uses Authority - (4) police power to use parking meters was continued, not surrendered, by agreement. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.  The City of Elmira Parking Authority is a public benefit corporation whose purpose is to provide parking areas so as to decrease traffic congestion in the city.  (Public Authorities Law, art. 7, tit. 9, &sect; 1482 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">et seq.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">) The statute provides that the city may give real to personal property to the Authority; the latter may accept grants, loans or contributions from the city; bonds or other obligations of the Authority are to be payable out of the Authority's own funds or revenues; and the Authority is to continue for five years and thereafter until all its bonds and liabilities have been paid.  The Elmira City Charter (&sect; 73), as amended by Elmira Local Law No. 5 of 1949, permits the city council to authorize a contract whereby the city pledges to the Authority the net revenues from the city's street parking meters for as long as the bonds of the Authority might remain outstanding but in no event for longer than thirty years.  Such a contract was executed when the Authority authorized issuance of its bonds in the amount of $500,000.  The contract provided, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  in part, that the city should pay to the Authority the amount of the latter's estimated deficit, if any, not exceeding $25,000 in any year, such payments to be made from the net revenues of existing city parking meters but not from meters later installed except as substitutes.  The city further agreed that it would not substantially reduce the number of meters during the existence of the agreement, but that it nevertheless could abandon or change their sites.  The agreement was valid.  The complaint in this taxpayer's action to void the agreement should be dismissed. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.  The State Constitution (art. VIII, &sect; 1) provides that a municipality shall not give or loan its </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">money</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> or property to or in aid of any individual or </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">private corporation,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and shall not give or loan its </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">credit</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to or in aid of any individual or </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">public or private corporation.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It does not prohibit a gift or loan of moneys to a public corporation where the municipality does not borrow the money.  Pledges of net meter revenues would not be gifts or loans of credit.  The city is not liable on the Authority's bonds.  The contract provisions are valid under title 9 of article 7 of the Public Authorities Law, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the Elmira local law, and the constitutional power of cities to regulate their property (N.Y. Const., art. IX, &sect; 12).True, the pledge would benefit bondholders, but the city would benefit from its pledge by reason of the assurance to it of clear title to the parking project when the bonds were paid in full. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3.  If the identical project had been undertaken by the city itself under section 72-j of the General Municipal Law, there would be no doubt of the city's power to use its parking meter revenues.  It should not be assumed that the Legislature intended to prohibit the same thing if done through an Authority. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4.  The police power of the city to regulate automotive traffic, insofar as parking meters are concerned, was not surrendered but was continued by the agreement.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner taxpayer sought review, under N.Y. Civ. Prac. Act art. 78, of a final determination of respondent, Comptroller of the City of New York, which denied the taxpayer's application for refund of gross receipts taxes.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer had an extensive interstate and intrastate business and sought a refund of the amount of gross receipts taxes imposed by the Comptroller for certain years for the privilege of doing business in the city. The taxpayer argued that the allocation ratios employed to determine the appropriate percentage of interstate sales subject to the tax were unconstitutional because they required a minimum of 33 1/3 percent. The court confirmed the Comptroller's denial of a refund. The court noted that the apportionment ratios did not have to be mathematically perfect, but only needed to be a rough approximation to satisfy constitutional requirements. Because the taxpayer's percentages were close to the minimum, the court concluded that the taxpayer could not claim that the ratios worked a hardship. In addition, the court determined that taxpayer could have applied for the use of a different method under the regulations of the Comptroller, but did not do so.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional law - taxation - New York City gross receipts tax - (1) petitioner engaged in interstate oil business not entitled to refund of New York City gross receipts taxes for privilege of doing business in New York City - (2) allocation formula established, pursuant to Administrative Code, by city comptroller to allocate percentage of interstate sales subject to tax resulted in computations of 32.2%, 30.85% and 31.9%; under formulae, average of percentages then raised to 33 1/3% which is not arbitrary - (3) since petitioner did not avail itself of opportunity to apply for different method of allocation, pursuant to comptroller's regulations, it may not now have such relief. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.  Petitioner, a Pennsylvania corporation doing an extensive interstate and intrastate oil business, is not entitled to&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  a refund of gross receipts taxes paid during certain years for the privilege of doing business in New York City (Administrative Code, ch. 41, tit. RR).  The statute provides that where receipts cannot be taxed in their entirety by reason of the Federal Constitution, the city comptroller shall establish rules and methods of allocation so that only such part of the receipts which are attributable and allocable to the doing of business in the city shall be taxed. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.  The allocation three-factor formula, established by the city comptroller pursuant to the statute, seeks to allocate the appropriate percentage of interstate sales subject to tax by striking ratios between, first, the value of the taxpayer's property in the city and the value of the property elsewhere in the United States, and, second, between the wages paid locally and elsewhere in the country.  For the third factor the comptroller has devised a purported basis for computing a proper percentage of gross receipts. The three percentages thus obtained are then averaged. If the result exceeds 66 2/3%, it is reduced to that figure; if it is less than 33 1/3%, it is increased to that amount.  The resultant computation becomes&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the percentage of interstate commerce allocated to the gross receipts tax. The computations under the three-factor formula in this case were 32.2%, 30.85% and 31.9% in the three years that the minimum requirement was used, scarcely a shocking margin in the application of formula that at best is calculated to produce approximate figures. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3.  Since the petitioner did not avail itself of the opportunity to make application for a different and more appropriate method of allocation which it had the right to request under the comptroller's regulations if &quot;any of the prescribed allocation formulae works unfairly or inequitably&quot; to a taxpayer, it may not now have such relief.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employer's contract with the union required compensation according to time and one-half for hours in excess of eight in any one day and forty in any one week. The employer had also contracted to comply with the requirements of the New York State Election Law in allowing time off with pay to vote. Section 226 provided that on Election Day any voter could be absent for two hours while the polls were open and that no deduction could be made from the usual salary or wages of the voter. The two hours the employee spent voting in addition to the seven hours worked that day equaled nine hours, and the employee sought overtime for the ninth hour. The court reversed the trial court's order, which dismissed the employee's complaint. The court held that &sect; 226 required that the employee be paid on Election Day precisely what he would have earned had he remained on the job for nine hours.

The physician also claimed that N.Y. Educ. Law &sect; 6514(2), which authorized the proceeding, was unconstitutional. The court affirmed the order denying relief. Noting that prohibition was an extraordinary remedy which should only be utilized when there was no other appropriate remedy, the court held that N.Y. Educ.

As for the constitutional challenge, however, the court held that N.Y. Educ.

Civ. Prac. Act art. 78 proceeding the determination of respondents, the Board of Regents of the University of the State of New York and Commissioner of Education of the State of New York, refusing to license petitioner applicant's film about a teenage drug addict upon the ground that the public exhibition would corrupt morals and incite crime.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The applicant sought to license a motion picture entitled &quot;Teenage Menace&quot; that depicted the brief life span of a teenage drug addict from his first marijuana cigarette to his death from a poisoned heroin fix. Finding that the film was viciously immoral and that its public showing would tend to corrupt morals and incite crime, the Regents affirmed a determination of respondent state official and refused to license the film for public exhibition pursuant to N.Y. Educ. Law &sect; 122. Upon review, the court annulled the Regents' determination against the applicant by finding that, although &sect; 122 validly delegated the power of licensing motion pictures to the Regents as a proper exercise of the state's power to deem motion pictures offensive to public morals, the findings that the immoral film would tend to corrupt morals and incite crime were not sustained by the evidence. Although the film was a sordid and dismaying picture of mental and physical misery, despair, degradation, and health, the film portrayed nothing visually or orally having to do with sex or sexual immorality, and the Regents' predictions that viewers would possess and use illegal drugs were purely speculative.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff company sought review of an order of a supreme court of Albany County (New York) that denied the company's motion under N.Y. C.P.L.R. 113 to strike out the answer of defendant Commissioner of Agriculture and Markets of the State of New York and for summary judgment, in the company's action to declare N.Y.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The company manufactures and sells evaporated skimmed milk. When the company was advised that its sale of such milk in small containers in New York violated &sect; 64(2), which restricted such sales to containers of 10 pounds or more, it brought the present action. The court ruled that the lower court properly declined to resolve the constitutionality of &sect; 64(2) by affidavits. While the constitutionality of a statute could have been tested in a declaratory judgment action, such an issue often could not have been resolved by affidavits. In the present case, the answer contained substantial denials, and the answering affidavits raised the issue that the statute was a reasonable exercise of police power. Specifically, the court noted that a fair inference of legislative intent was that the statute was passed to protect consumers from mistakenly believing that they were purchasing evaporated whole milk, rather than evaporated skimmed milk. The court observed that evaporated whole milk commonly was marketed in small containers. Because the reasonableness of a statute arguably involving an exercise of the State's police power was raised, the action was properly not decided on affidavits.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, a non-profit society, appealed an order from the Supreme Court of New York County (New York), which denied the society's motion to dismiss for failure to state a cause of action, or in the alternative for summary judgment, plaintiff members' action for a judgment declaring certain by-laws of the society void and for a judicial determination of the rights of the parties.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The members claimed that there was an unlawful usurpation of power by the board of managers of the society in various respects to the injury and deprivation of the members' rights and that that the bylaws were adopted unlawfully. On appeal, the court ruled that: (1) the members' claim that the bylaws were in conflict with the Membership Corporation law was meritless because N.Y. Membership Corp. Law &sect; 2 excluded the Society from its provisions; (2) there was no present justiciable issue as to whether the bylaws were illegally or improperly adopted because the bylaws were ratified by members of the Society almost 50 years before the members' action; (3) the claims that the board unlawfully usurped too much power to itself with respect to acceptance of new members and expulsion of present members and in respect to self-perpetuation of control by selection of successors to the board were meritless because there was no allegation that particular applicants or members were rejected or expelled, and the board's election of successors did not infringe the members' rights; and (4) the issue regarding the size of a quorum provided for in the bylaws was not ripe for adjudication.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court dismissed the members' complaint.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Corporations - membership corporations - (1) complaint of minority of members of American Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, that by-laws were illegally adopted and that board of managers had usurped excessive power to accept or expel members and to select their own successors in office, dismissed - (2) procedural irregularities in adoption of by-laws in 1900 and 1907 were waived by members' ratification; no allegation that anyone excluded or expelled; after fifty years, no justiciable issue - (3) by-laws giving board of nonprofit corporation control of election of successors do not infringe enforcible rights of members - (4) Membership Corporations Law (&sect; 2) excludes corporations created by special act, such as defendant - (5) no present need for judicial declaration as to whether quorum of five is sufficient in board of managers, under General Corporation Law (&sect; 27). </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.  The&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals was incorporated by special act (L. 1866, ch. 469), which authorized the society to adopt by-laws not inconsistent with the laws of the State.  Plaintiffs, a small minority of the society, complain that amendments to the by-laws were illegally adopted in 1900 and 1907 and that the board of managers had usurped excessive powers with respect to acceptance and expulsion of members of the society and self-perpetuation of the board by control of selection of its successors. The complaint should be dismissed. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.  The amendments appear to have been adopted or ratified at meetings of the members of the society and apparently the members waived any procedural irregularities in the steps preliminary to the introduction of amendments.  It is not alleged that any persons have been improperly excluded or expelled. After approximately fifty years, and at least as to members who joined the society after 1907, there is no justiciable issue; but even if there were, defendant would be entitled to summary judgment. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3.  Provisions in the by-laws of charitable or nonprofit corporations under which the board controls the election of its successors&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  do not infringe on any enforcible rights of ordinary members. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4.  The Membership Corporations Law (&sect; 2) excludes from its requirements corporations such as this, created by special act. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5.  The by-laws were lawful when adopted.  Perhaps the provision that five members of the board constitute a quorum runs counter to the present requirements of the General Corporation Law (&sect; 27); but there is no present need for a judicial declaration as to that point, since there is no allegation that defendant has adopted any resolutions by a vote of only five.  </SPAN></P>

The court held that the board had the authority to question the teachers as to their Communist party membership. The court noted that N.Y. Civ. Serv. Law &sect; 26-a prohibited asking any employees in the civil service their political affiliations as a test of their fitness to hold office. The court stated, however, that &sect; 26-a did not prohibit questioning concerning Communist party membership because the statute did not envision a condition in which a group dedicated to the doctrine of the overthrow of democratic government, by force and violence if necessary, would assume the form of a political party. The court determined that the power to question the teachers as their affiliations was vested not solely in the state, but in the various boards of education as well.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.  The New York City Board of Education adopted a declaration of policy which stated that a member of the Communist party is not qualified to continue as a teacher or employee in the school system, that past membership in the party may establish present membership, and that, on inquiry by the superintendent of schools, the failure of any teacher to make full disclosure as to past and present participation should be regarded as an insubordinate act.  Five teachers employed by the board refused to answer questions as to past and present membership in the Communist party, and another, who denied present membership, refused to answer as to past membership. The teachers, who were thereupon suspended, appealed from such disciplinary action to the Commissioner of Education who dismissed their appeals.  The decisions of the commissioner were not contrary to law and were neither arbitrary nor capricious.  A proceeding to review the commissioner's decisions was properly dismissed. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3.

It is not exclusive in its application to an inquiry of the nature here considered.  The rule of evidence fixed by the law as to a rebuttable presumption of disqualification for public school employment because of membership in a certain type of organization related to the power of dismissal which is not at issue here.  The function of the law was that of implementation and no legislative intent to limit the local school authorities' &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  right and performance of a duty to examine into the very matters of which the Legislature was complaining may be read into the law. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4.  The board's declaration of policy stated a policy but purported to add nothing to the power of inquiry and investigation already resident in local school authorities.  Moreover, after taking official notice of applicable Federal and State statutes, including the Feinberg Law, the declaration explicitly reserved all safeguards to any teacher accused of subversive activity and allowed such teacher to controvert any evidence of Communist party membership. The declaration is not invalid as inconsistent or incompatible with the Feinberg Law. </SPAN></P>

The association contended that the reservoir was to be built with excess capacity intended for the sole benefit of the parent company. The court confirmed the commission's decision to approve the application, holding that the commission based its decision upon sufficient evidence. The requirements of N.Y. Conserv.

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.  The State Water Power and Control Commission approved an application by a water supply company to construct an impounding reservoir on the Hackensack River. The commission found that, in view of the steady growth of communities served by the company and the expanding needs of its industrial consumers, the acquisition of additional sources of supply was necessary inasmuch as the company was meeting current demands by overpumping its wells, its only source of supply. The commission also found on the basis of substantial evidence that, although the reservoir would provide a supply in excess of the company's current requirements, an additional source of such magnitude was essential to assure an&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  adequate supply for present and future needs.  It further found that although the reservoir, by regulating water flow in the river, would benefit downstream owners, including the water company's parent company which supplies water to northern New Jersey communities from its New Jersey reservoirs on the river, such benefit was a necessary and incidental effect of the reservoir project.  Objections to the sufficiency of the commission's findings are without merit and its determination is confirmed. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.  The commission's findings, based on substantial evidence, were adequate to comply with the requirement (Conservation Law, &sect; 523) that it make findings as to whether the plans &quot;make fair and equitable provisions for the determination and payment of any and all legal damages to persons and property&quot; affected by the project.  In addition to making such statutory finding in the language of the statute, the commission found that an intercompany plan between the water supply company and its parent company provided for sufficient funds to pay all costs of the project including acquisition of necessary lands.  Inasmuch as such financing plan requires approval of the Public Service Commission&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and the New Jersey Board of Public Utility Commissioners, the Water Power and Control Commission's decision, providing that its approval of the reservoir construction would not become effective until the regulatory commissions had approved the financial plan, was a sensible, if not the only possible, method of dealing with the problem.  Objections that this solution does not afford adequate assurance of payment of all legal damages to owners of lands to be taken are without substance since no lands will be taken until the financing plan is approved. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3.  The commission's findings as to the public necessity for the project were adequate.  Inasmuch as it had found, on substantial evidence, that drilling additional wells was not an acceptable method of supplying the water company's needs, no findings as to the comparative costs of such wells and of the reservoir were necessary to enable the commission to reach a fair determination as to the public necessity for the reservoir. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4.  There was no need for the commission to make any findings as to the effect of the reservoir upon the water rates payable by the company's consumers. The commission had no power to determine what portions&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of the cost should be reflected in the rate bases of the water supply company and of its parent company.  Such determinations may be made only by the regulatory commissions. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5.  Section 396 of the Conservation Law provides that the regular members of the Water Power and Control Commission (the Conservation Commissioner, the Superintendent of Public Works and the Attorney-General) may designate deputies to act as members of the commission in place of their principals.  The further provision in the section that, in case both a regular member and his alternate are unavailable on any occasion, the member may designate any suitable employee of his department to act for him involves no unconstitutional delegation of legislative authority.  The Legislature may constitutionally vest the power of decision in the first instance in holders of designated offices, and then authorize them to redelegate or subdelegate such power to other officers or employees selected by them.  Section 396 is valid and constitutional.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, river regulating district and others (district), sought review of the order and judgment of the Supreme Court at Special Term (New York), which granted defendant club's motion for summary judgment and dismissed the district's declaratory judgment action pursuant to N.Y. R. Civ. Prac. 113.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The district's plan for constructing a reservoir was disposed of by the Stokes Act, 1950 N.Y. Laws 803, which amended N.Y. Conserv. Law &sect; 445. The Stokes Act prohibited reservoirs in the area where the district had planned such construction. The district filed an action, seeking a declaration that Stokes Act was void as impairing the obligation of the bonds that were issued to finance the construction, and a declaration that it was entitled to condemn the club's property and complete the reservoir project. On appeal, the court reversed the trial court's order and judgment that granted the club's motion for summary judgment and dismissed the district's action. The court ordered that bondholders within the jurisdiction were conditionally necessary parties, which should have been brought in as parties to the action. The court held that removal of the district power to issue bonds and levy taxes to retire the bonds gave the district an independent interest separate and apart from their status as agents of the state. Thus, the district was to test the validity of the Stokes Act. The state was not an indispensable party, thus the trial court did not lack subject matter jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court's judgment that dismissed the district's declaratory judgment action by granting the club's motion for summary judgment. The court ordered that persons in the jurisdiction who held bonds for the district's planned reservoir construction project were to be brought into the declaratory judgment action, as they were conditionally necessary parties.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Declaratory judgments - constitutionality of law prohibiting river regulating district from constructing reservoir - conditionally necessary parties - State forest preserve - effect of Court of Appeals decision - (1) river regulating district sold bonds to public to pay for work done preliminarily to condemning defendant's lands, contructing reservoir, and then levying taxes on benefited areas to pay bonds; Legislature amended Conservation Law (&sect; 445) to prohibit reservoir in that area; district asserts it cannot pay bonds; district may maintain action against defendant for judgment declaring amendment unconstitutional - (2) Court of Appeals, in dismissing petition of defendant to review determination of district board to build reservoir, did not pass on constitutionality of amendment - (3) if amendment now be declared invalid, defendant may apply to Court of Appeals for reargument - (4) although district is&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  public corporation, it may question validity of statute - (5) State cannot be made party, but it is only conditionally necessary (Civ. Prac. Act, &sect; 193) - (6) owners of bonds are conditionally necessary parties; those within jurisdiction should be joined. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.  The Black River Regulating District, a public corporation (Conservation Law, art. VII), determined after a public hearing to construct a Panther Mountain Reservoir to regulate the flow of the Moose River. The plan, approved by the State Conservation Commission, required the use of approximately 1,500 acres of the Adirondack Forest Preserve owned by the State and about 3,500 acres of land owned by a corporation called the Adirondack League Club. On the club's petition to review the determination (Conservation Law, &sect; 454), the Appellate Division confirmed the determination.  Then the Legislature declared (L. 1950, ch. 803, amdg. Conservation Law, &sect; 445) that &quot;No reservoirs for the regulation of the flow of streams * * * shall be hereafter constructed * * * on * * * the Moose River by any river regulating board.&quot; The Court of Appeals thereupon decided (301 N.Y. 219) that the issues had become moot and directed that the review&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  petition of the club be dismissed.  The district may now maintain this action against the club, in which the complaint alleges that the district and incurred an indebtedness of $203,000 for work preliminary to the construction of the reservoir and had sold its bonds in that amount to the public, that it now has no means of paying the bonds except through condemning the club's property, completing the reservoir, and then levying taxes on the properties benefited, and that judgment should be rendered declaring the amendment to section 445 void as impairing the obligation of the district's bonds. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.  The Court of Appeals did not pass upon the constitutionality of the amendment. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3.  If that amendment should be declared invalid in this action, the issues would no longer be moot, and then the club, if it still wished to have a further judicial review of the board's determination, could apply to the Court of Appeals for reargument of the dismissal of its review proceeding. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4.  Although in general a public corporation or State agency cannot question the validity of an act of the Legislature, this district has an independent interest sufficient to entitle it to do so, since its bonds&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  were apparently not guaranteed by the State. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5.  The State, because of its immunity, cannot be made a party to this action for a declaratory judgment. However, it is only a conditionally necessary party and not an indispensable party (Civ. Prac. Act, &sect; 193).  The Attorney-General, pursuant to section 71 of the Executive Law, has filed a brief in support of the constitutionality of the act and has orally argued every conceivable interest of the State.  Although, nevertheless, the judgment will not bind the State, it appears unlikely that the State will litigate further.  The district should not be left without a remedy.  The court should exercise its discretion to assume jurisdiction of this action for a declaratory judgment. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6.  The owners of the bonds issued by the district are conditionally necessary parties. Such of them as are within the jurisdiction of the court should be brought in as parties. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer was an airline based in Illinois that did business in New York City as part of its interstate transportation of passengers. The court annulled the comptroller's decision to assess a gross receipts tax pursuant to New York City, N.Y. Admin.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court annulled the comptroller's decision, and ordered a refund of the gross receipts taxes paid by the taxpayer for a period of three years.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Taxation - gross receipts tax - interstate commerce - (1) New York City gross receipts tax for privilege of doing business in city not applicable to allocated receipts of air line corporation's revenues from air transport in and out of city; activities of corporation in city constitute necessary extension of its interstate air transportation; tax is local tax on interstate commerce forbidden by Federal Constitution; assessment of tax annulled and refund of taxes paid directed - (2) principle of de minimis applied to air line's revenues from sales of tickets for intrastate passage in other air lines and from sales of airplane parts and service in city; fair apportionment of corporation's traffic revenues between intracity and interstate receipts impossible&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  as corporation not engaged in intrastate or intracity air transportation. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.  An air line corporation, chartered in Delaware and having its principal offices in Illinois and its chief maintenance base in Wyoming, operates in many States, from coast to coast and also beyond the continent.  It carries no intrastate traffic in this State and, of its authorized route mileage of about 3,000 miles, only about nineteen miles are in New York City.  The corporation maintains one of its chief terminals, including three traffic offices, a hangar, a parts and supplies stockroom and a repair and maintenance shop, and employs about 300 persons including a district traffic manager, in New York City.  Its annual sales of passenger tickets in the city averaged over $2,000,000 and an equal amount is sold outside the city for transportation thereto.  Such activities in New York City are a logical, continuous and necessary extension of the corporation's interstate transportation. Therefore, the gross receipts tax for the privilege of doing business within the city (Administrative Code, ch. 41, tit. RR) imposed by the city on a portion of the allocated receipts of the corporation derived from passenger, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  mail and freight carriage between the city and out-of-State points, regardless of where contracted, is a local tax on interstate commerce forbidden by the Federal Constitution.  The determination of the city comptroller assessing such tax on a minimum of one eight of the corporation's allocable receipts from air transportation is annulled and a refund directed of taxes paid for three years. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.  The corporation's sales of airplane parts and service for other air lines in the city, producing an average annual return of $12,000, and its sales, as a member of an air lines clearing house, of tickets of other air lines for passage between points in New York State are activities which are perhaps intrastate in form and therefore separable and distinct from the large principal interstate operations of the corporation.  However, these matters are </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">de minimis</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and not a sufficient justification to subject millions of dollars of interstate receipts to taxation and apportionment by the city.  Moreover, the corporation pays a city gross receipts tax on the $12,000 average income received for parts and service.  In any event, the corporation does not engage in intrastate and intracity commerce&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  or activity so far as air transportation is concerned and accordingly there is no possible ratio between intracity and interstate receipts from air transportation and no formula of apportionment of traffic revenues can be fair.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The City imposed the gross receipts tax on an apportioned basis of the revenue of the company. The company resisted the payment on the ground that its revenues were derived exclusively from interstate activity. The court annulled the Comptroller's determination. The court determined that the activities of the company were exclusively in interstate commerce, and that the incidental services rendered in the City were insubstantial insofar as they did not directly relate to the company's interstate operations. The court explained that almost entirely the services rendered in the City were directly promotional or otherwise incidental to the company's interstate operations. The court noted that at the Lodi, New Jersey plant, the company employed over 1,100 persons, occupied 507,000 square feet of floor space, did the processing, and made the contracts. The court concluded that the New York office, employing 13 persons, was devoted to soliciting and to promoting the company's services. The court determined that where one was in one state, the mere selling of merchandise or services in another state did not subject one to tax jurisdiction in the other state.</SPAN></P>

Section 59-a of the Insurance Law, pursuant to which the service was made, provides that &quot;delivery&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of contracts of insurance to residents of this state&quot;, &quot;collection of premiums * * * for such contracts&quot; or &quot;any other transaction of business&quot; in this State &quot;effectuated by mail or otherwise&quot; by an unauthorized or foreign insurer operates to appoint the Superintendent of Insurance as its &quot;true and lawful attorney&quot; for the service of process upon it in this State.  The carrier, by mailing the insurance contract to a New York resident addressed to a New York broker, by collecting the premium sent from New York and by corresponding in and out of New York as to the terms and conditions of the policy, came literally within the statute.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3.  Although the statute uses plural terms in referring to delivery of &quot;contracts&quot; to &quot;residents&quot; and collection of &quot;premiums&quot; for &quot;such contracts&quot; the singular transaction also is brought within the effect of the plural words by other portions of the statute.  Moreover, practical difficulties stand in the way of any construction which would make the statute never operative unless the acts were plural and the general rule of construction is that &quot;words * * * in the plural number include the singular&quot; (General Construction Law, &sect; 35).  Consequently the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  legislative plural words are read to include the singular and the carrier's issuance of a single policy of insurance falls within the terms of the statute.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4.The statute accords due process to the insurance carrier. The validity of constructive designation of a public officer to receive process has long been accepted in the case of an operator of a motor vehicle whose operation on the highways of a State results, by statute, in such designation. There is little perceptible difference between designation in the case of motor vehicle operators and designation occasioned by mailing a contract of insurance into the State, by receiving therefrom a premium for the policy, or by corresponding across the State line in relation to its issuance. The insurance carrier is not compelled to send its policy into, or collect its premiums from, the other State and it is not unreasonable that if these acts are engaged in they should result in the designation which the statute imposes.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The bank admitted it violated &sect; 258(1), which prohibited all but state mutual savings banks from using the terms &quot;saving&quot; or &quot;savings&quot; in a banks name. On appeal, the court held that the trial court erred when it found the statute was unconstitutional because (1) the statute was a valid exercise of police power aimed a preventing public deception, (2) the terms at issue had become synonymous with mutual savings banks, (3) the presumption of constitutionality was not overcome, and (4) the establishment of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation did not vitiate &sect; 258(1), as it did not eliminate the need upon which the law was based. Further, the court held that &sect; 258(1) did not conflict with Federal law because it did not unduly interfere with the operation of national banks. Section 258(1) applied equally to all commercial banks in similar circumstances and operating under the same conditions, so it was not constitutionally impermissible class legislation.&nbsp;Section 258(1) did not forbid the use of the expressions that were formerly permitted by the State Banking Department.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff executrix appealed from an order of the Special Term of the Supreme Court, Montgomery County (New York), which order entered in St. Lawrence County (New York), granting defendant New York State Tax Commission's motion to dismiss the executrix's complaint for a declaratory judgment restraining the Commission from collecting an additional tax that was assessed against the deceased after his death.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The facts showed that the deceased paid income taxes for the year before he died. Shortly after the deceased paid the tax, he died. The Commission later assessed an additional income tax for that same tax year against the deceased's estate. The executrix argued that the additional assessment was illegal, erroneous, and contrary to law on the grounds that the Commission had to comply with the provisions of the N.Y. Surr. Ct. Act art. 12, which required that claims for debts against an estate had to be made to the executors. On appeal, the court held that the trial court properly dismissed the executrix's complaint for failure to state a cause of action. The court ruled that art. 12 did not apply to assessments of taxes imposed by the State. The court determined that the executrix had an adequate remedy in the supreme court for review of the assessment under N.Y. Tax Law &sect;&sect; 199, 375. The court concluded that the executrix was entitled to an administrative hearing and review in the first instance without paying the tax or filing a bond, however, penalties and interest on the contested assessment might accrue unless the assessment was declared void.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's order, with costs.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Taxation - personal income tax - additional assessment against estate of deceased taxpayer - review - (1) decedent filed income tax return and paid tax; after decedent's death State Tax Commission assessed additional tax, with interest and penalties if tax not paid within thirty days; complaint in action for judgment restraining collection of tax and declaring commission's sole remedy against estate was under Surrogate's Court Act properly dismissed - (2) statute (Surrogate's Ct. Act, art. 12) requiring claim against estate to be made to executor not applicable to taxes imposed by State - (3) estate not deprived of property without due process of law by enforcement of tax laws; statute (Tax Law, &sect;&sect; 199, 375) provides for administrative and judicial review of tax assessments - (4) requirement (Tax Law, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &sect; 373) that notice of additional assessment be mailed to taxpayer's last address inapplicable when taxpayer dead - (5) where judgment entered, improper to appeal from order. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.  Decedent had filed a State income tax return for a specified year and had paid the tax.  Subsequently, the State Tax Commission assessed an additional tax for that year against decedent's estate, together with interest and penalties to be imposed if the tax were not paid within thirty days.  In an action for judgment restraining the commission from collecting the assessment and declaring that its sole remedy at law is that provided to creditors of an estate by article 12 of the Surrogate's Court Act, the complaint was properly dismissed for failure to state a cause of action. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.  The provisions in article 12 of the Surrogate's Court Act which require claims for debts against an estate to be made to the executor, who is given the power to reject the claims and put claimants to their proof, apply only to claims which must be established, if contested, by action and not to assessments of taxes imposed by a sovereign State. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3.  Enforcement of the tax laws will not deprive decedent's estate of property without&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  due process of law in violation of the State and Federal Constitutions.  The Tax Law (&sect;&sect; 199, 375) provides for review of any tax assessment both on the law and facts by the administrative agency and in the Supreme Court.  Moreover, under section 374 of the Tax Law the penalties and interest which may accrue if the tax is ultimately paid will not be imposed if the additional assessment is declared void. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4.  The requirement in section 373 of the Tax Law that the notice of additional assessment be mailed to the taxpayer at the address given in his last return does not apply inasmuch as the taxpayer was dead. In any event, mailing the notice to another address was such technical lapse as cannot invalidate the additional assessment. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5.  The court calls attention to the fact that it is not good practice to appeal from an order granting a motion to dismiss the complaint when a judgment has been duly entered.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were a truck driver and his employees. The prosecution alleged that all defendants were driving trucks loaded with crushed stone. Police officers stopped the trucks and attempted to weight them on a portable scale.

On appeal, the court found that the refusal to drive the trucks on the scales, together with the shutting off of the motors, the removal and retention of the ignition keys, and the locking of some of the cab doors, in their totality presented a factual pattern of events upon which a jury might be warranted in finding resistance and obstruction to the performance of public duty. However, the trial court erred in instructing the jury. The trial court in its jury charge gave an instruction on traffic law. There was an indissoluble merger of the two offenses in the instructions to the jury and one had no application at all to the case. In other parts of the instructions this merger was reiterated.

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.  Pursuant to section 69 of the Vehicle Traffic Law, which provides that the superintendent of State police shall cause inspection to be made of the motor vehicles operating on the public highways to detect inadequacy of equipment, overloading and other violations of law governing the use of the public highways, State police stopped five trucks and told the drivers to drive the trucks on a portable scale.  Each truck was heaped high with crushed stone.  Two weeks before this occurred, they had been similarly loaded and found overweight. Defendants refused, took the keys out of the ignition switches, locked some of the doors of the cabs, and refused to deliver the keys to the police.  The owners, who had been summoned by telephone, also refused to deliver the keys or direct the drivers to drive the trucks on the scales.  On this evidence it was proper to submit to the jury the question whether the drivers and owner were guilty of resisting a public officer in the discharge of his duty ( Penal Law, &sect; 1851). </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.  On these facts, section 69 of the Vehicle and Traffic Law has not unconstitutionally authorized an unreasonable search. </SPAN></P>

Section 69 does not say that motor vehicle operators must drive onto weighing scales; rather, it requires the police to inspect the vehicles.  Defendants could be convicted of resistance under section 1851 of the Penal Law only if their disobedience, plus their affirmative acts of taking the keys out of the ignition and retaining them and locking the cab doors, were factually found by the jury to be such resistance and obstruction. Judgments of conviction should be reversed and a new trial ordered. </SPAN></P>

Civ. Prac. Act art. 78 to review an order made by respondent, the State Rent Administrator (New York). The Administrator granted the landlord an increase in rent, but the Administrator did not use the assessed valuation alleged by the landlord.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landlord contended that it was entitled to a percentage of return based upon a particular assessed value of the apartment house. The Administrator refused to accept that valuation and instead relied on his statutory authority to make a valuation different from the assessed valuation under N.Y.

The landlord complained that it was not permitted by the Administrator to submit evidence of the many facts bearing upon the actual value of the building. The landlord challenged the constitutionality of the statute under which the Administrator acted, asserting that the statute lacked adequate standards for guiding the Administrator's action. The court found that, although the statute was in order, there was no warrant in the Administrator's refusal to consider the facts in the individual case and in choosing to rely entirely upon a formula drawn from a statistical study of other cases.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trust company applied for the issuance of letters of administration on the estate of the deceased. The surrogate's court denied its application and issued letters of administration to the Public Administrator instead. Upon the trust company's appeal, the court reversed the decree.

Laws 221, any trust company could be appointed guardian, trustee or administrator, with or without the will annexed, on the application or consent of any person acting as such or as an executor or entitled to such appointment irrespective of whether such person would himself be disqualified from acting by reason of his being an alien or non-resident of the State of New York, and in the place and stead of such person, or such trust company could be joined with any person so acting or entitled to such appointment.</SPAN></P>

[a]). </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1948 the Banking Law (&sect; 100-a, subd. 2, par.

Prior thereto one who was disqualified as an alien nonresident could not appoint a trust company to act as administrator. An application&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  be one who would be entitled to act as administrator, except for the fact that he is an alien nonresident, for the appointment of a trust company to act as administrator, should be granted.  Since neither the fact that a person was an alien alone nor that he was a nonresident alone would disqualify him from acting as administrator or appointing a trust company (Surrogate's Ct. Act, &sect; 94), the intent of the 1948 amendment was to extend the power to designate trust companies to persons who are both alien and nonresident. Any other interpretation would render the amendment meaningless. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant Commissioner of Agriculture and Markets (New York) challenged an order of the Supreme Court, Monroe County Special Term (New York), which denied the Commissioner's motion to dismiss the petition in a proceeding under N.Y. Civ. Prac. Act art. 78 to review his denial of petitioner corporation's application for a milk dealer's license.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Commissioner appealed from the trial court's order, which denied his objections to the jurisdiction of the trial court to hear the petition of the corporation to review, under art. 78, a determination of the Commissioner. The Commissioner's objection to the jurisdiction of the trial court was founded upon his interpretation of N.Y. Civ. Prac. Act &sect; 1287, which, it was urged, by its requirement that the application for review be made to in the third judicial district, left the trial court without jurisdiction of either the person or the subject matter. The court determined that &sect; 1287, insofar as it referred to proceedings against the Department of Agriculture and Markets, was intended to refer also to the Commissioner. The court explained that the requirement of &sect; 1287 that the proceeding be brought in the third judicial district, was a matter of venue, not jurisdiction. The court noted that matters of venue could have been waived, but jurisdictional matters could not have been waived. The court concluded that the proceeding under N.Y. Civ. Prac. Act art. 78 should not have been dismissed, but the Commissioner could have applied for a change of venue, if so advised.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant taxpayers sough review of an order made at a Special Term of the Supreme Court, Ulster County (New York), which denied the taxpayers' motion for a temporary injunction restraining appellee state tax commission from enforcing article 21 of the Tax Law, which dismissed the taxpayers' petition, granted the commission's motion for judgment on the pleadings, and which declared that the statute was constitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayers, freight trucking lines, first argued that they should have received a trial on their claims that the statute under which they were being taxed was unconstitutional. The court disagreed and held that the taxpayers' pleadings alleged no facts except the nature of their business operations and the territorial descriptions of their shipping zones. The rest of the pleading was a description of the statute on its face, accompanied by a conclusion that it was constitutionally invalid. The challenged statute exempted some types of vehicles from taxation and left the tax to be shared by the rest of the inter- and intra-state traffic. The court held that when the state legislature fixed the beginning point of the special use tax on heavy trucks at a certain poundage, its judgment was reasonable and the classification was not discriminatory in the sense that the equal protection of the law was thereby withdrawn from he owners of the heavy vehicles affected by the tax. The court held that the correlation between the weight, speed, and the greatly growing incidence of the heavy truck and deterioration of the roads were subjects well within the range of legislative regulation.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional law - weight-distance tax on highway motor carriers - (1) judgment which declared valid weight-distance tax on trucks (Tax Law, art. 21) affirmed - (2) on pleadings, Special Term had no issues of fact to decide; properly granted judgment on pleadings on questions of law - (3) statute imposes tax on operation of vehicles of gross weight of over 18,000 pounds on roads of State; tax is based on &quot;gross weight&quot; of truck and is fixed on graduated scale at rates, beginning at six mills for lowest group of weights of trucks, multiplied by miles traveled; tax is not undue burden on interstate commerce - (4) State not required to devote proceeds of highway&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  use tax entirely to road maintenance - (5) exemptions of enumerated vehicles do not make statute invalid - (6) provision (&sect; 503, subd. 2) that tax not imposed where vehicle is used exclusively in zone established by Public Service Commission or in city or village, not invalid delegation of legislative power - (7) nor does subdivision 2 of section 503 incorporate another statute by reference. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.  A judgment of the Supreme Court, Special Term, which declared valid the weight-distance tax on trucks as provided by article 21 of the Tax Law (added by L. 1951, ch. 74), and an order denying injunctive relief to restrain the enforcement of article 21, should be affirmed. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.  On the face of the pleadings, Special Term had no issues of fact to decide and therefore properly granted judgment on the pleadings on the problems of law presented. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3.  The statute (Tax Law, &sect; 503) imposes a &quot;highway use tax&quot; on the operation of vehicles having a gross wight of over 18,000 pounds on the roads of the State.  It exempts from the tax omnibuses and other enumerated classes of vehicles (&sect; 501, subd. 2; &sect; 503, subd. 2; 504).  The tax is based on the &quot;gross weight&quot; of the truck (&sect; 501, subd. 4; &sect;&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  503) and is fixed on a graduated scale at a rate beginning at six mills for the lowest group of gross weights of vehicles (the rate increasing up to the group having the legal maximum weight), multiplied by the number of miles traveled (&sect; 503).  Such tax is not an undue burden on interstate commerce, inasmuch as it falls equally on intrastate vehicles of the same weight and following the same routes as interstate vehicles, and inasmuch as the tax, based on the quantum of highway use, is a reasonable charge. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4.  The State is not required to devote the proceeds of a tax for highway use, such as here, entirely to the maintenance of roads. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5.  The examption by the statute of some vehicles from its operation, thus leaving the tax to be shared by the residuum of interstate as well as intrastate traffic, does not make the statute invalid if the exemptions are reasonable.  The placing by the Legislature of the beginning point of the special use tax on trucks at 18,000 pounds is reasonable and not discriminatory. The question of a tax standard here is legislative and not a judicial question.  The exclusion of omnibuses from the tax (&sect; 501, subd. 2) on the ground of other special taxation, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and of zonal and local city and village traffic (&sect; 503, subd. 2) on the ground that their effect on the State highways as a whole is relatively small, is also within the legislative competence and is not unreasonable.  Likewise the exemption made in favor of vehicles used by farmers to transport farm products or needed supplies (&sect; 504, subd. 3) is within the power of the Legislature. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6.  A provision (&sect; 503, subd. 2) that the tax is not imposed where the vehicle is used exclusively within a zone established by the Public Service Commission or used exclusively within a city or village, is not an invalid delegation of legislative power. The statute must be construed as an adoption by the Legislature of an existing territorial arrangement. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7.  Nor is there any substance to the contention that subdivision 2 of section 503 incorporates another statute by reference. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff shareholders sought review of a judgment from the Supreme Court in Erie County (New York), which dismissed their complaint against defendant corporation on the merits. The shareholders sought the dissolution and liquidation of the corporation and the distribution of its assets because the corporation had not extended its existence prior to the expiration of its term.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The articles of the corporation provided for a term of existence of 50 years. The term expired before the corporation extended its term, but the corporation continued to do business until it filed a certificate of revival, pursuant to N.Y. Gen. Corp. Law &sect; 49. The shareholders brought an action against the corporation for its dissolution and liquidation, and sought their pro rata share of the assets. The trial court dismissed the complaint and the shareholders sought review. The court held that: (1) after the expiration of the corporate term, there was no statutory authority for the corporation to revive its corporate existence until 1944; (2) the reserved power of the legislature to alter, suspend and repeal a corporate charter was provided under N.Y. Const. art. X, &sect; 1; (3) the legislature had the power to ratify and confirm, by retroactive statutes, any act which it might lawfully have authorized in the first instance, where the defect arose out of the neglect of some legal formality; and there was no evidence of fraud or bad faith by the corporation that provided a basis for equitable relief.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment that dismissed the shareholder's action against the corporation to compel the corporation's dissolution and liquidation.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Corporations - expiration of charter - revival - (1) complaint in action to dissolve corporation which filed certificate of revival after original charter had expired properly dismissed - (2) statute permitting corporation to file certificate of revival (General Corporation Law, &sect; 49) applies to corporations whose existence expired prior to passage of statute - (3) Legislature, under its reserve power (N.Y. Const., art, X, &sect; 1), had power to enact statute and make it retroactive - (4) minority stockholders had no implied statutory right to appraisal of stock - (5) minority stockholders have shown no equitable right to appraisal of stock. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.  A corporation, incorporated in 1892 for fifty years, failed, before&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the fifty-year term expired, to file a certificate extending its term of existence.  It continued to do business to 1947, when it filed a certificate of revival (General Corporation Law, &sect; 49, eff. April 6, 1944).  In an action to procure a dissolution of the corporation upon the assumption that its existence had terminated, the complaint was properly dismissed. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.  The statute (General Corporation Law, &sect; 49) permitting a corporation to file a certificate of revival was intended to apply to corporations whose existence had expired prior to the passage of the statute.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3.  The Legislature, under its reserve power, had the power to enact the statute and to make it retroactive (N.Y. Const., art.

That power to enact the statute is superior to the right of stockholders to require a dissolution of the corporation. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4.  The fact that the statute was given retroactive effect did not give the minority stockholders an implied statutory right to have their&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  stock appraised. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5.  Nor have the minority stockholders shown an equitable right to such appraisal. There is in the record no evidence of fraud or bad faith on the part of the majority stockholders. Dividends have been declared and paid regularly on all the stock and it has not been shown that any valuable rights have been lost.  Prior to the time when the corporation filed a certificate of revival, the minority stockholders accepted their dividends and participated as stockholders in the affairs of the corporation.  They did not become aware that the corporate charter had expired until the revival proceedings had been instituted.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, police pension trustees and retirees, appealed a judgment of the Supreme Court Special Term (New York), which ordered the trustees to annul pensions awarded to the retirees and restrained the trustees from giving effect to New York City, N.Y., Admin.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The retirees, two police officers, were appointed police commissioners after more than 20 years of service. The day the retirees were appointed they applied for retirement at the annual rate of a police commissioner. Their applications were made pursuant to New York City, N.Y., Admin. Code &sect; B18-4.0(f), which provided that an officer appointed as a police commissioner could retire without any prerequisite length of service in that position. The citizens union brought an action against the retirees and the police pension trustees challenging the pensions awarded. The trial court held that the statute was unconstitutional as authorizing a gift of public funds. The police pension trustees and retirees appealed. The court found that the statute was constitutional because its terms created a valid pension. The pension was a prospective award or deferred compensation for services not fully recompensed as rendered. The statute was intended to entice qualified officers to accept a high-ranking, exempt position. However, the court found that the pension awards were illegal and invalid because the retirees never actually served or performed tasks in the role of commissioner.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional law - municipal corporations - police - validity of pension provisions covering deputy police commissioners - (1) awards of pensions as deputy police commissioners to members of police pension fund who serve on force for twenty years and then serve as deputy police commissioners (Administrative Code of City&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of New York, &sect; B18-4.0, subd. f) are constitutional and not gifts of public funds (N.Y. Const., art. VIII, &sect; 1) - (2) but, where detectives who had served as Mayor's bodyguard and who would have received $3,000 pensions were briefly appointed deputy police commissioners and did not actually serve as such and were thereafter retired on pensions of $6,000, trustees of police pension fund directed to rescind such fraudulent pensions and to retire them on their lawful pensions. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.  The provision of the Administrative Code of the City of New York (&sect; B18-4.0, subd. f, enacted March 29, 1940), that a member of the police pension fund who shall have performed duty on the force for a period of twenty years &quot;and who subsequently shall serve as police commissioner or deputy police commissioner, shall be retired and placed upon the pension roll of such pension fund and granted the pension allowed to a chief inspector in such department&quot;, is valid and does not violate the constitutional prohibition against gifts of public funds (N.Y. Const., art. VIII, &sect; 1).  Pensions are not gratuities but are deferred compensation.  The legislative intent in enacting subdivision f in 1940 was to offer members&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of the police force an incentive to qualify for promotion to the exempt position of chief or deputy commissioner since police officers who had tenure might be unwilling to seek promotion to an exempt position without an increased inducement. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.  In this case, however, pensions were fraudulently awarded to favored appointees and such pensions should be annulled.  In 1950, two patrolmen who had served for over twenty years and who had acted as bodyguard and chauffeur for the Mayor, resigned from their positions of first grade detective (at a salary of $5,175 annually, under which they would have received pensions of about $3,000 annually), accepted appointments as deputy police commissioners, and immediately applied for retirement. After forty-four days and sixty-seven days, respectively, their applications were granted and they were retired as deputy commissioners at annual pensions of $6,000.  Upon the trial of this action at Special Term, it was established that they did not perform the duties of deputy police commissioner as defined in the police manual of procedure, during their short and nominal term of office.  The board of trustees of the police pension fund should be directed&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to rescind their $6,000 pensions and to retire them on such pensions as they may be lawfully entitled to receive as retired patrolmen. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a proceeding under N.Y. Civ. Prac. Act art. 78, appellant licensees challenged a determination of respondents, the members of the Board of Regents of the University of the State of New York, which rescinded the licensees' licenses for the public exhibition of a motion picture on the ground that the motion picture was sacrilegious. The application of N.Y. Educ. Law &sect; 132 was dispositive of one of the issues raised on appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Board rescinded licenses for the public exhibition of the motion picture in question on the ground that it was sacrilegious. The licensees contended that censorship of motion pictures constituted an unconstitutional previous restraint on freedom of speech and freedom of the press, that N.Y. Educ. Law &sect; 122, which barred the licensing of a motion picture deemed sacrilegious, was unconstitutional, and that the Board was without power to rescind the licenses. The court stated that motion pictures had been judicially declared to be entertainment spectacles and not part of the press or organs of public opinion, and hence subject to State censorship. Section 122 was not an unconstitutional exercise of legislative power. The State had the power to exercise a previous restraint as to motion pictures that could be fairly deemed sacrilegious to the adherents of any religious group. The exercise of such power was directly related to the public peace and order, and unless clearly in conflict with a constitutional prohibition it should not be denied. The Board clearly had the power under N.Y. Educ. Law &sect; 132 to correct or rescind any illegal action taken by its motion picture division.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court confirmed the Board's determination.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Theatres and shows - revocation of license of motion picture film - constitutional law - (1) determination by Board of Regents rescinding license granted by motion picture division for picture &quot;The Miracle&quot; after finding by board that picture was sacrilegious, confirmed - (2) motion pictures deemed entertainment spectacles and State censorship thereof no restraint on freedom of speech or press - (3) board found picture sacrilegious to Christians but State may bar picture though profanation not common to all sects - (4) exercise by State of restraint as to motion pictures deemed sacrilegious to any group directly related to public peace and order - (5) right to full inquiry and free discussion&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  as to any religious doctrine not affected since motion pictures for entertainment alone not within category of inquiry and discussion - (6) while statute authorizes review in case of denial of license but makes no provision for review of license once issued, Board of Regents has power to rescind illegal action taken by its subordinate body, motion picture division - (7) Legislature did not intend to leave authorities helpless where film illegally licensed by motion picture division; power to correct inherent in statute - (8) court cannot say that determination made by board was one no reasonable mind could reach. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.  A motion picture entitled &quot;The Miracle&quot;, which was produced in Italy, depicts a demented peasant girl who was seduced by a bearded stranger whom she imagined to be St. Joseph.  She referred to her pregnancy as &quot;the grace of God&quot; and, subsequently, gave birth to a child in the basement of a church.  The motion picture division of the State Education Department issued two different licenses for the picture, but on receipt of many protests against its exhibition on the ground that it was sacrilegious, an order was issued requiring the licensees to show cause why the license&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  should not be revoked.  At the hearing a committee of the Board of Regents recommended that the board, as a committee of the whole, view the picture and, after due consideration, the board found it to be sacrilegious and voted to rescind the licenses therefor.  The determination should be confirmed. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.  Motion pictures have been judicially declared to be entertainment spectacles and not a part of the press or public opinion and, hence, subject to State censorship. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3.  The Board of Regents based its revocation solely on the ground that the picture was sacrilegious, that it parodied in effect the Immaculate Conception and the divine birth of Christ as set forth in the New Testament.  By millions of Christians these doctrines are held sacred and any profanation thereof held as a sacrilege, although there are other groups which do not accept these beliefs.  The State may bar such a picture (Education Law, &sect; 122) even though the profanation is not common and universal to all groups. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4.  The term &quot;sacrilege&quot; means the violation or profanation of sacred things.  The Legislature used the term in its widest sense and it was intended to apply to all recognized religions, not merely one&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  sect alone.  The exercise by the State of a previous restraint as to motion pictures that may fairly be deemed sacrilegious to the adherents of any religious group is directly related to public peace and order and, unless clearly in conflict with a constitutional prohibition, it should not be denied. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5.  While full inquiry and free discussion, even to the point of attack, may be had with regard to the doctrines of any religion, including Christianity, by nonbelievers, motion pictures staged for entertainment purposes alone are not within the category of inquiry and discussion.  The statute does not muzzle either free speech or a free press.  All it purports to do is to bar a visual caricature of religious beliefs held sacred by one sect or another and such a bar is not a denial of religious freedom. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6.  The Education Law ( &sect;&sect; 120-132) indicates that the motion picture division is a subordinate body of the Education Department under the control of the Board of Regents and that the latter has the power to correct or rescind any illegal action taken by its motion picture division (Education Law, &sect; 132).  If the motion picture division was an independent body, the grant of an express&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  power to review where a license was denied would negative a power by implication to review in a case not specified but the subordinate position of the motion picture division and the supreme responsibility of the regents to enforce the statute preclude such result. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7.  Furthermore, it seems most unlikely from a practical viewpoint that the Legislature intended to leave the authorities helpless in a case where, through some misconception or inadvertence on the part of the motion picture division, a film was illegally licensed. The regents could not then correct the situation nor would a criminal prosecution be possible because the film had been licensed. Such a situation raises the belief that the Legislature gave no specific grant of power to the regents for a review when a license was granted because none was considered necessary.  The power to correct was inherent in the statute.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8.  As to whether the regents acted arbitrarily and capriciously, the issue becomes one of judgment to be resolved by the administrative body which has it in charge.  The text and content of the picture, together with the complaints received, constituted substantial evidence upon which the regents&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  could act.  The court cannot say that the determination made was one that no reasonable mind could reach.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment from the Court of Special Sessions of the City of New York of New York County (New York) that convicted him of unlawfully possessing a firearm in violation of N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 1897.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant claimed that there was insufficient evidence to support the determination that he was in possession of the pistol in his automobile and that the presumption created by N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 1898-a (as amended by 1936 N.Y. Laws 390) violated U.S. Const. amend. XIV and N.Y. Const. art. I, &sect; 6, and was unconstitutional. The court determined that defendant had admitted that he knew the pistol was in the car and that he knew how it got into the car. The court held that defendant's admissions and the fact that officers found the pistol in the car were sufficient in the absence of an explanation by defendant to support his conviction. The court also held that the presumption created by N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 1898-a was rebuttable and defendant failed to offer in evidence to rebut the presumption, which was not a violation of due process and did not shift the burden of proof to defendant.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional law - crimes - firearms - validity of statute creating presumption of possession from finding of pistol in automobile in which accused is found - (1) appellant's guilt of unlawfully possessing firearm in violation of Penal Law (&sect; 1897) proven beyond reasonable doubt - (2) presumption in Penal Law (&sect; 1898-a) of illegal possession by all persons in car of gun also found in same car, rebuttable; evidence that appellant knew gun was in car and that it lay on ledge of automobile within his immediate reach and therefore in his &quot;possession&quot; disclosed appellant's constructive possession thereof - (3) section 1898-a of Penal Law is constitutional - (4) statutory presumption of section 1898-a merely assumes that, in absence of some explanation, occupants of automobile in which pistol is found are in illegal possession thereof. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.  Where, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  immediately prior to appellant's arrest, he and his codefendants were together in an automobile, in which a pistol was also found, appellant's guilt of unlawfully possessing a firearm in violation of section 1897 of the Penal Law was proven beyond a reasonable doubt. The testimony of police officers sustained this view and appellant admitted it as did his codefendants. Even an incompetent statement of a fourth man upon which appellant relied placed appellant and the weapon in the automobile at the same time. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.  Subdivision 4 of section 1897 of the Penal Law prohibits the unlicensed possession of a pistol, and section 1898-a provides that the presence in an automobile of a pistol &quot;shall be presumptive evidence&quot; of its illegal possession by all persons found in such automobile at the time the pistol is found.  The statutory presumption of illegal possession of a gun by all persons found in the automobile is a rebuttable one, and the evidence here, far from rebutting the presumption, served to confirm it.  The evidence that appellant knew the gun was in the car and that it lay on the back ledge of the automobile within the immediate reach and control of appellant and therefore in&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  his &quot;possession&quot; as that word is used in connection with penal provisions relating to weapons, disclosed a constructive possession of a loaded revolver by appellant. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3.  Section 1898-a of the Penal Law is constitutional.  It does not conflict with the Fourteenth Amendment of the Federal Constitution and section 6 of article I of the State Constitution which provide that no person shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself, nor deprived of life, liberty or property without due process of law. Statutes such as 1898-a which provide that certain facts are presumptive evidence of one or more of ultimate facts in issue are not unconstitutional, as here, there is a rational connection with the facts proved and the conclusion presumed and where the presumptions themselves are neither conclusive nor arbitrary. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4.  All presumptions arising from the facts cast upon the defendant the burden of overcoming them.  Here the statutory presumption merely assumes that in the absence of some explanation the occupants of an automobile in which a pistol is found are in illegal possession of the pistol. If the persons in the automobile have no actual knowledge of its presence, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  there cannot be a conviction and the burden of establishing beyond a reasonable doubt their possession of the gun is nevertheless with the People.  </SPAN></P>

The trial court granted intervenor's motion to dismiss the proceeding on the ground that the petition failed to state facts that were sufficient to constitute a cause of action. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's order. The court concluded that N.Y. Educ. Law &sect; 3210(1)(b) was not unconstitutional. The statute merely provided that absence from attendance on required instruction should be permitted for specified religious purposes under rules that were to be established.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner, a railway corporation, commenced a proceeding under N.Y. Civ. Prac. Act art. 78 to review a determination of respondents, members of the Public Service Commission of the State of New York, which required the corporation to extend bus service from a village to a college campus.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Commission directed the corporation to extend one of its bus lines to include service to a college campus one and one half miles from its terminus. On review, the court confirmed the Commission's determination. The court found that the corporation's claim that there was no necessity for service and that the route was too hazardous involved issues of fact. The court found no reason to conclude that the Commission's conclusions on those issues were not supported by substantial evidence. The court determined that the extension directed was not a new venture beyond the corporation's commitments because the Commission's determination indicated that the extension was not a new venture, but rather an extension of service within an area the corporation was already committed to serve. The court noted that from a geographic and economic perspective, the entire area involved should have been treated as one community. The court concluded that the fact that the corporation had no local franchise to go beyond the center of the village was irrelevant because the only franchise required for the extension ordered was the Commission's certificate of public convenience and necessity.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court confirmed the Commission's determination.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Carriers - extension of bus line - (1) carrier ordered by Public Service Commission to extend bus line from center of village to campus of college, 1.5 miles distant; order confirmed - (2) charge that order unreasonable because service unnecessary and route hazardous involves issues of fact; since findings of commission are supported by evidence, judicial interference unwarranted - (3) carrier not ordered to undertake new venture, which would be unconstitutional, but only to extend service in area already served by carrier - (4) commission has statutory authority to extend termini of omnibus corporation - (5) local franchise for extended service not needed - (6) charge that order confiscatory premature. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.  A street railway&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  corporation furnishing transportation wholly by omnibuses in substitution for street cars pursuant to section 50-a of the Public Service Law was ordered by the Public Service Commission to extend a bus line running from a railroad station in a large city to the center of a small village (a distance of 9.35 miles) to the campus of a college (a distance of 1.5 miles from the present terminus) except during the summer months.  Such order should be confirmed. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.  The carrier charges that the order is unreasonable in that there is no necessity for service on the extension and in that the route is too hazardous for safe operation.  These charges involve issues of fact concerning which the record reveals conflicting evidence. There is no basis for judicial interference where the determination of the commission is supported by substantial evidence. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3.  A State Public Service Commission may not require the extension of existing lines beyond the scope of a carrier's commitment to the public service because such a requirement would constitute the taking of property in violation of the due process clause of the Federal Constitution.  There is no specific finding to the effect that the extension&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  here directed was not a new venture, but rather an extension of service within an area which the carrier was already committed to serve.  Since it is the carrier's obligation to serve this area, there is no constitutional inhibition against the commission's order for the extension of service therein. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4.  The commission is authorized by subdivision 13 of section 61 and sections 63-a and 63-b of the Public Service Law to modify the routes or stated termini of an omnibus corporation. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5.  That the carrier has no local franchise to go beyond the center of the village is not decisive for neither the town nor the villege requires the consent of local authorities for the operation of an omnibus line and hence the only franchise required is the commission's certificate of public convenience and necessity. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6.  An argument that the order is confiscatory is prematurely raised.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found that New York State required that every minor from seven to 16 years of age should attend full time day instruction and that N.Y.

The court further found that there was no provision in the Education Law which prohibited instruction of children at home, nor was there any provision requiring certification of a parent by the Commissioner of Education before she could teach her children at home. The court also found that the object of a compulsory education law was to see that children were not left in ignorance, that from some source they would receive instruction that would fit them for their place in society, and that, provided the instruction given was adequate and the sole purpose of nonattendance at school was not to evade the statute, instruction given to a child at home by its parent, who was competent to teach, should satisfy the requirements of the compulsory education law.

Law &sect; 5001, appealed an order of the Supreme Court at Special Term in Albany County (New York) dismissing on the merits a proceeding under N.Y. Civ. Prac. Act art. 78 for an order directing respondent Board of Regents of the University of the State of New York to renew the school owner's license to conduct a trade school.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Commissioner of Education had disapproved of the school owner's practice of charging students for lockers, notebooks, and certificates in addition to regular tuition. The school owner contended on appeal that N.Y. Educ. Law &sect; 5001 was unconstitutional insofar as it made approval by the Commissioner of the tuition to be charged a requisite for the issuance of a license. The court reversed the order. The court noted that it might well be that the power to regulate certain phases of private school operation was a necessary and indispensable corollary to the State's supervisory jurisdiction over education in general. The court observed that what the embryo technician, be he hair stylist or masseur, dentist or doctor, might have paid for his education was purely a personal matter between himself and the school of his choice. The court stated that in the absence of any showing whatsoever that tuition in trade schools was a matter of great public concern or affected with a public interest, any attempt on the part of the legislature to fix the rates thereof was an unnecessary and unwarranted interference with individual liberty and hence unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.  With respect to private trade schools, section 5001 of the Education Law provides that no license shall be issued until the Commissioner of Education has approved &quot;the tuition to be paid and the method of collecting tuition&quot;.

The questions on review were the constitutionality of ch. 346 and the validity of the designation of the comptroller as a member of the board. The court affirmed. The court found that the duties, powers, or functions to be performed by the state department of taxation were left entirely in the discretion of the legislature and ch. 346 did not provide for the creation of a new department of the state government, either in terms or in effect. The court determined that ch. 346 did create a temporary commission for special purposes and simultaneously, and incidentally it did modify or diminish powers and functions formerly performed by the department of taxation. The court determined that N.Y. Const. art.

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.  Section 3 of article V of the State Constitution provides that, other than the State departments therein provided for, no new State departments shall be created.  The section specifically states, however, that this provision shall not prevent the Legislature from creating &quot;temporary commissions for special purposes&quot;.  Chapter 346 does not provide for the creation of a &quot;new department&quot; of the State Government, either in terms or in effect.  It does create a &quot;temporary commission for special purposes&quot; which expires on April 1, 1952, and simultaneously it does, as authorized by section 3, &quot;modify or diminish * * * powers and functions&quot; formerly performed by the Department of Taxation and Finance. The two purposes to be accomplished by the commission - review and revision of the equalization rate and publication and submission of recommendations to the Legislature for the permanent assignment of the jurisdiction, powers and duties which it temporarily controls - are &quot;special purposes&quot; (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Matter of People</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> [</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Westchester Tit. &amp; T.

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3.  The statute is not vague and indefinite in its specification of the jurisdiction, functions, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  powers and duties delegated to the board.

The matters transferred are itemized in the act. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4.  Chapter 346 does not constitute a prohibited delegation of legislative power and does not incorporate other statutes contrary to section 16 of article III of the State Constitution.  It provides for the devolution upon said Board of Equalization and Assessment of carefully itemized and specified functions, powers and duties of three existing administrative agencies of the State Government pertaining to assessment and taxation of real estate and it does require reference to previously enacted statutory provisions which conferred that jurisdiction upon those predecessor agencies in order to determine the method of exercising the powers conferred, the procedure involved and the precise limitation upon the scope thereof.  In that there is no violation of the letter, intent or spirit of the Constitution. </SPAN></P>

The section provides that the Legislature &quot;shall assign to him no administrative duties, excepting such as may be incidental to the performance of these functions.&quot; The appointment of the State Comptroller as a member of the Board of Equalization and Assessment did not violate the terms or purposes of this provision of the Constitution.  Nothing in the Constitution disqualifies the incumbent of said office from performing other public functions not incompatible with that of Comptroller. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landlords leased commercial space to tenants. The landlords instituted a proceeding pursuant to the additional alternative method provided in N.Y. Comm. Rental Law &sect; 4 to fix the fair rental value per square foot of commercial space. The trial court enforced the language of the statute relating to the alternate method strictly and literally. The court held that the income from the entire premises was in excess of the amount permissible by application of the statutory formula and therefore, the landlords were receiving a fair and reasonable return. The trial court, thus, deemed it unnecessary to apply the optional square foot rule. The court rejected literal interpretation of the statute and held that the square footage of the respective rental spaces had to be weighted or adjusted in proportion to their relative rental value.

In a proceeding to fix a reasonable rent pursuant to the additional alternative method provided by a portion of section 4 of the Commercial Rent Law (added by chapter 534 of the Laws of 1949), the square footage of the respective rental spaces in the building must be weighted or adjusted in proportion to their relative rental value and the landlord is entitled to recover from each statutory tenant the amount of rent apportioned to him regardless of how much income is received from the rest of the building.

The 15% limitation was expressly made applicable to &quot;pending&quot; proceedings.  The Legislature did not adopt a recommendation of the Temporary Commission to Study Rents and Rental Conditions that the amendment should not include cases on appeal. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant estate administrator challenged the decision of the Supreme Court, New York County (New York), which held in favor of respondent trust and beneficiaries that Florida's tax apportionment statute was unconstitutional as applied to a decedent's inter vivos revocable trust, and held that the trustee was to make no payments on federal and Florida estate taxes until assets of the estate in Florida were depleted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trustee for an inter vivos revocable trust established in New York by the decedent, and the trust's beneficiaries through a guardian ad litem, contended that the retroactive application of 1949 Fla. Laws ch. 25435 to the trust was unconstitutional. Decedent had perished prior to the statute's enactment. The estate administrator argued that the trust was liable for its pro rata share of federal and Florida estate taxes. The court modified the trial court's decision because the trustee and beneficiaries failed to prove the unconstitutionality of the Florida statute, holding that the statute was constitutional because the statute was merely a declaration of the existing public policy of the state, retroactivity did not make it unconstitutional, and the policy was in line with the law and policy of other states, including N.Y. Decedent Est. Law &sect; 124. Given the Florida statute's constitutionality, the court ordered the trustee to pay its pro rata share of federal and Florida estate taxes.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court modified the decision of the trial court in favor of the trustee and beneficiaries, and against the estate administrator, and instructed the trustee to pay its pro rata share of both the federal and Florida estate taxes, together with interest.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Taxation - estate taxes - apportionment - constitutionality of retroactive Florida statute - (1) decedent established, with funds and trustees in New York, revocable inter vivos trusts in 1923 and 1929 and died intestate in 1948, resident of Florida; Federal and Florida estate taxes, imposed on total of intestate estate plus trust estates, will exceed intestate estate; Florida statute providing for apportionment&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of Federal and Florida estate taxes in manner similar to section 124 of New York Decedent Estate Law, was enacted in 1949 retroactive to 1948; retroactivity constitutional - (2) New York Supreme Court has jurisdiction of accounting proceedings brought by trustees under article 79 of Civil Practice Act - (3) Florida Legislature properly determined that Florida statute was declaratory of existing public policy - (4) those attacking statute must show that it changed existing law - (5) retroactive succession taxes constitutional - (6) as long as estate is in process of administration, revocable inter vivos trust is constitutionally treated for tax purposes as part of decedent's estate - (7) statute requiring estate beneficiaries to share estate tax proportionately prevents unjust enrichment - (8) inter vivos trustees required to pay their prorata share of Florida and Federal estate taxes as determined by Florida court - (9) trustees also instructed as to extent to which interest on taxes should be paid from income or principal of trust funds. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.  A resident of Florida died intestate in 1948, leaving his five children as distributees.  The administrator, appointed in Florida, filed a&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Federal estate tax return on June 6, 1949, showing a gross estate of $782,623.  Such gross estate included an amount of $528,973 constituting the corpus of two </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">inter vivos</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> trusts established by decedent in 1923 and 1929, which were revocable by decedent, and under which the income was payable to decedent for his life and then to his five children for their lives, with remainders over to their issue.  The trust funds are in New York and the trustees are three banking institutions located in New York.  In the course of current administration of the estate in Florida the net estate distributable by the administrator before estate taxes was shown at $180,571.  The total Federal estate tax, including the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">inter vivos</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> trusts, amounted to $190,532, and the Florida estate tax amounted to $20,198.  The administrator paid the Florida estate tax in full and made a payment on account of Federal estate tax. Then, on June 13, 1949, a Florida statute (Laws of Florida of 1949, ch. 25435 [No. 439]) became law and provided for the equitable apportionment of both Federal and State estate taxes among the persons interested in the estate in a manner substantially identical with section 124 of&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the New York Decedent Estate Law. However, while the New York statute applies only to estates of persons who died after the statute became effective, the Florida act by its terms applies to estates of persons dying after January 1, 1948, or to payments of estate taxes or death taxes made, or required to be made, after June 13, 1949.  In this situation the Florida statute is validly and constitutionally retroactive. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.  The New York Supreme Court has jurisdiction to grant the relief sought (accounting and instructions) by the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">inter vivos</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> trustees in this proceeding under article 79 of the Civil Practice Act.  The trust fund is in New York, the proceeding is basically in rem, and the Florida court could not exercise jurisdiction over the trustees in the absence of the latter's consent. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3.  The apportionment statute involved no retroactive change in Florida law, but was simply declaratory of the law of that State as it existed at the time of the death of decedent. In section 5 the Florida Legislature declared that it &quot;considers the equitable principles of this Act as merely declaratory of the existing public policy of this State&quot;.  Such a legislative declaration should be given&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  full effect in the courts of a foreign jurisdiction, especially since that declaration is in no way inconsistent with court decisions in Florida. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4.  Those attacking the statute have failed to show - and that burden was upon them - that the apportionment statute changed the existing law of Florida. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5.  The statute does not violate an obligation of contract merely because it operates on an </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">inter vivos</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> trust created prior to its enactment.  Retroactive succession taxes, or retroactive increases, modifications or redistributions thereof enacted after a decedent's death, are constitutional. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6.  So long as a decedent's estate is in process of administration, the rights of the beneficiaries thereof, including beneficiaries of property constituting part of the gross taxable estate, although not in the probate estate, are not completely fixed and ascertained; during such period the property constituting the gross taxable estate remains within the State's taxing power and within the State's power to control the ultimate impact of the tax burdens thereon.  For all tax purposes, property in an </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">inter vivos</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> trust, revocable by the settlor up to the date of his death, is treated as&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the settlor's own property - no gift tax is payable upon the transfer, the income is taxed to the settlor, and on his death the property is included in his gross estate for estate taxes. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7.  The purpose of an apportionment statute is to correct unjust enrichment of one beneficiary at the expense of another.  Otherwise, in the absence of a specific direction by the decedent, the residue would have to bear the entire tax burden on property received by another.  Such a result would be particularly inequitable where, as in the present case, includible </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">inter vivos</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> transfers give rise to estate taxes in excess of the value of the distributable estate.  To require such proportional sharing of the burden of estate taxes with respect to an estate in process of administration is not so arbitrary or unreasonable as to violate constitutional prohibitions. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8.  Accordingly, the trustees of each of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">inter vivos</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> trusts should pay from principal its prorata share of both the Florida and Federal estates taxes as such share is determined by the county court in Florida according to the laws of Florida. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9.  Any interest on the estate taxes payable from each trust fund should be paid by&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  said trustees from income to the extent that income was earned on that part of the trust fund used to pay estate taxes from the respective dates such taxes were due, the balance of such interest to be charged to the principal of the trust fund. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner landlord challenged a judgment of the Supreme Court at Special Term in New York County (New York), which fixed rental from respondent tenant at the date of judgment rather than the date of commencement of the proceeding. The tenant cross-appealed the judgment granting a motion by the landlord to fix the rent of space occupied by tenant at a reasonable rate in excess of the emergency rent pursuant to N.Y. Commercial Law &sect; 4 (1949).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The tenant alleged that &sect; 4 was unconstitutional in that it required all tenants in a building to pay the same amount of rent per square foot regardless of the actual value of the portion leased by them. The court reversed and held as follows: (1) the statute was not unconstitutional because the legislative intent was not to require all tenants to pay the same rent in excess of the emergency rent regardless of the actual value of the rental property; (2) providing for all of the floor space in the same building as of equal value was a fortuitous and unintended consequence of the wording of &sect; 4; (3) inasmuch as evidence was not taken on the trial of relative values of floor space within the building, a new trial was necessary; and (4) the reasonable rent was to be determined as of the date of the landlord's application to the trial court.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the order of the trial court and ordered a new trial.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Landlord and tenant - emergency rent law - reasonable rental - (1) in &quot;alternative proceeding&quot; under chapter 534 of Laws of 1949 (amdg. L. 1945, ch. 3) involving single tenant occupying loft space in building in New York City, order reversed and new trial ordered - (2) amendment adopted to require payment by statutory tenants of reasonable rental values of floor space occupied regardless of return from building as whole - (3) language used, if literally construed, might require valuation of all floor space at same figure regardless of value or position in building - (4) draftsman of law failed to consider operation thereof where floor space is of unequal value but mistake must not be permitted to defeat object of amendment - (5) proper manner stated of ascertaining rental of several rental spaces&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  in building - (6) reasonable rent in such proceeding to be determined as of date of application therefor to Supreme Court. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.  In this &quot;alternative proceeding&quot; instituted under section 4 of the Commercial Rent Law (L. 1945, ch. 3), added by chapter 534 of the Laws of 1949, wherein only one tenant who occupies loft space on the eighth floor of the landlord's building in New York City is a party, the order appealed from directed payment of a reasonable rent in excess of the emergency rent and further fixed the rent as of the date of decision instead of the date of the commencement of the proceeding.  The order is reversed and a new trial ordered. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.  The amendment was apparently adopted to require statutory tenants to pay the reasonable rental values of floor space occupied by them (computed under the statutory formula), aside from whether or not the landlord receives a reasonable return from the building as a whole.  This purpose is disclosed not only by the amendment itself but by a report of the temporary commission which recommended its enactment. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3.  The Legislature, however, used language which, if construed literally, might be deemed to require the evaluation of all of the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  floor space at the same figure per square foot, regardless of whether it be a choice showroom area on the ground floor or much less desirable loft space. Such a result is not necessary to the accomplishment of the purpose intended by the Legislature. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4.  In the hypothetical case of a building in which all of the rentable space is of equal value, the literal terms of the amendment would correctly require each tenant to pay a fair return fo the space occupied. The draftsman of the statute did not consider how it would operate in cases where the floor space in a building is of unequal value.  This obvious mistake should not be permitted to defeat the object of the amendment. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5.  The total basic return for the building should be divided by the total of the weighted net rental space and the quantity of square footage in the respective rental spaces in the building should be weighted or adjusted in proportion to their relative rental values.  After that has been done, the landlord is entitled to recover from each statutory tenant the amount of rent so apportioned to him regardless of how much income is received from the rest of the building. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6.  The reasonable rent should be determined&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;as of the date of the application to the supreme court&quot;. (&sect; 4.) </SPAN></P>

Section 3022 of the Education Law (L. 1949. ch. 360), the so-called &quot;Feinberg Law&quot;, implements said section 12-a as to enforcement and, among other things, provides for the removal of superintendents, teachers and employees in the educational system who&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  continue as members of subversive organizations.

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3.  The offenses defined in section 12-a are crimes under section 161 of the Penal Law and section 2385 of title 18 of the United States Code, both of which have been held constitutional, and hence subdivision (c) of said section 12-a is valid.  A constitutional right of free speech may be abridged as a condition of public employment.

In reversing the judgment and order, the court held that the officers had unsuccessfully challenged the constitutionality of the statute as to its effect upon them, the association, or anyone else. First, the fact that the legislature used the expression &quot;the communist party&quot; in the statute's preamble did not mean any penalties were inflicted, and even if branded as subversive, the officers and the association could carry on as they chose. Further, the preamble did not form a part of the statute and enacted nothing. Thus, the statute could not be stricken down as a bill of attainder. Second, the statute did not transgress constitutional safeguards of due process because whatever action was taken was subject to notice, a hearing, and judicial review.

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional law - public schools - teachers and other school employees - subversive activities - (1) in action by Communist party, judgment declaring unconstitutional, and enjoining execution of provisions of, section 3022 of Education Law, known as Feinberg Law (relating to removal of disloyal persons), reversed and complaint dismissed - (2) constitutionality of statute subject to attack only by one whose rights are affected thereby; since Board of Regents has noticed plaintiffs' organization for inquiry and board does not question their right to sue and since plaintiffs charge statute is bill of attainder, court may take jurisdiction - (3) charge that statute is bill of attainder dependent on preamble of statute where Communist party alone is mentioned, but preamble forms no part of statute - (4) charge that statute violates safeguards of due process unavailable since it accords right to&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  association to be heard and to judicial review of determination - (5) no denial to plaintiffs of freedoms of assembly, speech and press since listing of organization as subversive obtains only as incident in maintenance of qualifications of public school personnel - (6) State's exercise of police power in field of education not within operative effect of Federal guarantees of said freedoms - (7) statute may not be held invalid because of envisioned unconstitutional procedures unless prescribed; none such found - (8) rule that membership in listed organization is prima facie evidence of disqualification mere rule of evidence; no vested right exists as to absence thereof. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.  A judgment in favor of plaintiffs (Communist party of the State of New York) declaring unconstitutional and enjoining the Board of Regents from executing any of the provisions of chapter 360 of the Laws of 1949 (Education Law, &sect; 3022) - known as the Feinberg Law - which provides for the removal of subversive persons from employment in public schools should be reversed and the complaint dismissed. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.  One may attack the constitutionality of a statute only if and to the extent that his rights are affected by&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  it and may not be heard to champion any right but his own.  However, the association of which plaintiffs are officers has been noticed for and was under inquiry by the Board of Regents for findings as to whether it was subversive under the act.  The Regents do not press the point that plaintiffs have no standing to sue.  In view thereof and the further fact that plaintiffs charge that the statute attaints their association, the court will take jurisdiction. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3.  In attacking the statute as a bill of attainder, plaintiffs rely on its preamble where the Legislature used the expression &quot;the communist party&quot; as descriptive of one of the &quot;subversive groups&quot; teaching seditious doctrines.  However, the references in the preamble are expressly based on hearsay and adjudicate nothing as to the organizations therein mentioned and, even if found and listed as subversive, the statute provides no punishment and prescribes no forfeiture.  The association is named only in the preamble which forms no part of the statute and carries no sanctions.  Moreover, advocacy of the overthrow of organized government by force is not an essential of the basic doctrine of communism.  Accordingly, since as to these&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  plaintiffs the statute exercises no judicial power and imposes no punishment or penalties, it may not be stricken down as a bill of attainder. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4.  Plaintiffs' contention that, in subjecting their organization to inquiry and possible listing, the statute transgresses constitutional safeguards as to due process, fails because appropriate notice and a right to be heard is afforded and judicial review of any determination may be had as regards any justiciable question (Civ. Prac. Act, art. 78).  The provision for listing of subversive organizations after &quot;appropriate&quot; notice and hearing as provided in the act demands a full compliance with all the applicable requirements of due process. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5.  As to the claim that the statute encroaches on plaintiffs' basic freedoms as to assembly, speech and press, it is to be noted that, after due notice and hearing, the association shall, if the facts warrant, be listed as subversive but that result can obtain only as an incident to the primary aim of the statute in the maintenance of the qualifications of public school personnel. Insofar as the statute can operate, the basic freedoms of the association remain unmolested. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6.  It is not contended&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  that the State may not exclude those who advocate or adhere to the doctrine of criminal anarchy and all relevant criticism is as to the means provided to achieve the statutory aim.  Those means are the method of the State's exercise of its police power in a proper field, that of education.  They are employed in a matter which is not within the operative effect of the Federal guarantees as originally laid down nor as extended by the Fourteenth Amendment. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7.  Assuming that plaintiffs have a standing which permits them to attack the statute, it is doubtful that they may be heard to assail it because of its impact on others.  Even if granted full voice in the matter, they are limited to the face of the statute.  The statute may not be held invalid because of envisioned unconstitutional procedures unless it prescribes them.  None such are to be found. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8.  In testing as to qualification for employment in the public school system, all the cardinal elements of due process are provided.  The provision that membership in a listed organization is prima facie evidence of disqualification is a rule of evidence and no vested right is deprived by the existence of that rule.  The statute is equally&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  applicable to all employees and all who may seek such employment in a matter which is purely a State concern and which allows the exercise of its police powers. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellees, current and retired teachers, sought a determination that N.Y. Educ. Law &sect; 3022 (1949) (chapter 360) was unconstitutional. The Supreme Court at Special Term (New York) granted the teachers' petition and held that chapter 360 was unconstitutional as a bill of attainder and as violative of the due process clause of the United States Constitution. Appellants, school officials, sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found that under chapter 360, the school officials could, after notice and a hearing, determine if an organization advocated the overthrow of the government by force, violence, or other unlawful means. Chapter 360 also provided that membership in such an organization was prima facie evidence of disqualification for teachers. The school officials contended that chapter 360 was not a bill of attainder and that it did not violate due process because it provided notice and a hearing. The court agreed with the school officials and reversed the lower court's order. The court held that chapter 360 was not a bill of attainder because it did not impose any penalty without a hearing. Because hearings were provided and there were several channels of review from the results of these hearings, the court also held that chapter 360 did not violate the guarantees of due process. In addition, the court held that the state legislature could prescribe the qualifications of state employees, including requiring loyalty to the government, and that such loyalty was especially relevant to the qualifications of teachers, who were entrusted with the education of the state's children.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.  In a proceeding under article 78 of the Civil Practice Act for a determination directing the Board of Regents to disregard chapter 360 of the Laws of 1949 (known as the Feinberg Law) and to refrain from taking any action for its enforcement, an order declaring the statute unconstitutional is reversed on the law and the petition dismissed. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.  A prior statute (Education Law, &sect; 3021) provides that a person employed in the public schools shall be removed from such position for the utterance of any treasonable or seditious words or the doing of any treasonable or seditious acts and, under section 12-a of the Civil Service Law which applies to all public employees, appointment or retention of any person in public employ is prohibited&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  if the person by word of mouth or writing willfully teaches the doctrine that the Government of the United States or of any State should be overthrown by force or if he becomes a member of any society so teaching. By the new law (Education Law, &sect; 3022) the Board of Regents is directed to adopt rules and regulations for the disqualification or removal of teachers and others who violate section 3021 or who are ineligible for appointment or retention under section 12-a of the Civil Service Law. The Board of Regents is directed, after inquiry and after such notice and hearing as may be appropriate, to make a listing of organizations found to be subversive in that they teach the doctrine that the Government of the United States or of any State should be overthrown by force or advise or teach propriety of adopting any such doctrine as set forth in section 12-a.  The board is further directed to provide in its regulations that membership in any organization listed by it shall constitute prima facie evidence of disqualification for appointment to or retention in any position in the public schools. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3.  Full and complete court review of any determination of the Board of Regents' listing&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of an organization and of any determination of a board of education finding a teacher disqualified under the Feinberg Law is available.  An organization so listed has the remedy provided by article 78 of the Civil Practice Act while a teacher found disqualified pursuant to the Feinberg Law by a board of education has an election of remedies.  He may petition for a review under subdivision d of section 12-a of the Civil Service Law and obtain a stay until final judgment on the hearing or he may have a right of appeal or petition to the Commissioner of Education under section 310 of the Education Law and is given an alternative right of review under the provisions of article 78 (Education Law, &sect; 2523, subi. 5).  In addition, where constitutional rights of liberty or property are involved, due process entitles one whose rights are invaded to independent judicial determination of the constitutional question involved, the act of the Board of Regents, the delegate here of the Legislature, being reviewable as an act of the Legislature itself. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4.  The sole issue in this case is that which makes one activity - membership in an organization advocating the overthrow of Government by force&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  - prima facie, a disqualification to teach in the public schools. There is no constitutional right to be a teacher any more than there is to be a public official.Nor has one a constitutional right to advocate the overthrow of the Government by force and violence. The standards for qualification as teachers in the public schools are fixed by the Legislature.  It may constitutionally require as qualification and declare as disqualification factors other than scholastic, including as a qualification adherence to the form of Government of the United States and, as a disqualification, advocacy of the overthrow thereof by force.  The most important qualification of a teacher is loyalty to the Government.  This is not an unconstitutional qualification. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5.  In holding that the statute in question is a bill of attainder, Special Term based its decision solely on section 1 of chapter 360 of the Laws of 1949 which is no part of the Education Law ( &sect; 3022) to be administered by the Board of Regents or any officer.  It is merely a preamble to the law and cannot be read into the operative provisions of section 3022 nor can it be strained to find in it a directive to the regents to list the Communist&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  party or to find in it the imposition of punishment upon that party without a hearing.  It does not impose (a) any penalty (b) without a hearing and these are the two elements of a bill of attainder. A bill of attainder is a legislative judgment of conviction, an exercise of judicial power by the legislative body, the imposition of punishment by a legislative act and there is no one of these elements in the law.  In the body of the act which the Board of Regents must enforce there is no mention of any organization at all by name and a hearing is provided with respoect to any such organization.  No penalty is imposed on any organization which, after a hearing, the board shall find advocates the overthrow of the Government by force and the organization has the remedy of review by the courts, while a teacher found to be a member of such organization also has the protection that the Education Law provides, as noted.

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6.  An argument that, by the provision making membership in a listed organization prima facie evidence of disqualification, the statute is vitiated because&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  it makes a new rule of evidence whereby less or different proof is required to convict, is without merit because that rule is one applicable to an ex post facto law as regards a criminal or penal statute.  Moreover, there is no vested right in a public school employee's retention of position conditioned as it is on the continued possession of prescribed qualifications and there is no vested right in an existing law of evidence. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7.  The law in question is not an ex post facto law within the condemnation of the Constitution since that phrase is one that relates exclusively to criminal or penal statutes. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8.  Where the validity of a statute is assailed and there are two possible interpretations, the court should adopt the construction which would uphold the statute.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9.  The Feinberg Law does not violate the due process guarantee of the State or Federal Constitutions.  Neither does it infringe upon the freedoms guaranteed thereby for it is not a criminal statute and the effect of its application is not criminal punishment. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">10.  The court below improperly found that there is a denial of procedural due process because every member of an organization as to which the Regents hold a&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***9]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  hearing to determine whether it is to be listed is not required to be given notice of the hearing or opportunity to participate. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">11.  The constitutional guarantees of freedom of speech and freedom of the press may not be deemed absolute and those who imperil the very existence of Government cannot take shelter therein and make those guarantees the very means of self-destruction.  It is a matter of common knowledge that organizations which advocate the overthrow of the Government by force endanger the existence of the country and that, to have members of such organizations as teachers of our children in whose hands will soon rest the fate and existence of the Government, is a peril to its life.  The Legislature needed no public hearings to learn that. </SPAN></P>

When the board of regents filed an appeal, respondents filed motions to strike from the calendar or adjourn the appeal to another term, to render a pro forma decision, to direct that the appeal be heard in the Court of Appeals, and to make certain corrections in the record before the special term. The court denied the motions, holding that the adjournment of the matter would unduly delay the matter, and that the delay should be avoided in the interest of an early and ultimate determination of an important constitutional question.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner pilot brought a proceeding pursuant to N.Y. Civ. Prac. Act art. 78 to review a determination by respondent, the Comptroller of the City of New York, which assessed a tax on the gross receipts of the pilot for the fiscal years 1941-1943 pursuant to the New York City Business Tax Laws, New York City, N.Y., Local Laws No. 47 (1941), New York City, N.Y., Local Laws No. 27 (1942), New York City, N.Y., Local Laws No. 21 (1943).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The receipts held to be taxable by the Comptroller represented pilotage fees for the pilot's services in navigating ships in and out of the port of New York. The ships piloted by the pilot were navigated to or from points on the high seas beyond the territorial limits of the United States. The pilot argued that the tax as applied to him was unconstitutional in several respects. The court held that the tax was in conflict with the Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution. The court reasoned that the United States Supreme Court had invalidated taxes imposed under the New York City Business Tax Laws upon gross receipts of stevedores operating in New York harbor. The loading and unloading of a vessel was so essentially a part of commerce as to prohibit a tax on gross receipts derived from the business of stevedoring in connection with vessels engaged in foreign and interstate trade. The piloting of vessels in foreign and interstate commerce was as much a part of commerce as the work of a stevedore. If the imposition of an unapportioned gross receipts tax on the business of stevedoring was repugnant to the Commerce Clause, a like tax on pilotage was open to the same objection.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional law - taxation - local tax on gross receipts of pilot - (1) imposition of tax by City of New York on gross receipts of pilot engaged in navigating, in and out of Port of New York, ships in foreign and interstate commerce conflicts with commerce clause of Federal Constitution - (2) grant of power by Federal Government to States to regulate business of piloting does not empower city to impose tax for general revenue purposes. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.  The City of New York may not - under Local Laws (Local Law No. 47, 1941; Local Law No. 27, 1942; Local Law No. 21, 1943) which provide for a tax payable by persons carrying on any trade, business, profession or commercial activity in the city of New York - impose a tax upon the gross receipts of a pilot for his services in piloting, in and out of the Port&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of New York, ships in foreign and interstate commerce. The piloting of vessels in foreign and interstate commerce is a part of such commerce and the imposition of the tax conflicts with the commerce clause of the Federal Constitution. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.  In granting to the States the power of regulation over pilots and piloting (U.S. Code, tit. 46, &sect; 211) Congress did not intend to empower the city to impose this tax.  The Local Laws do not attempt to regulate pilots in the Port of New York nor has any such power been conferred on the city by the State.  The taxes have been imposed as part of a general revenue system, and not as an incident to exercise of police power. This revenue taxation has no relation to regulation or police power. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner taxpayer brought a proceeding under N.Y. Civ. Prac. Act art. 78 to review and annul a determination of respondents, the Tax Commission of the State of New York, which held the taxpayer subject to assessments of unincorporated business tax under N.Y. Tax Law art. 16-A.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer was a consultant in matters of corporate finance and reorganization. The Tax Commissioner held that he was conducting a business rather than practicing a profession and was subject to the unincorporated business tax under N.Y. Tax Law &sect; 386. The taxpayer contended that N.Y. Tax Law art. 16-A, imposing such tax, was unconstitutional, in that it violated the due process and equal protection clauses of the federal and state constitutions. The court did not agree. The power of taxation was coextensive with sovereignty and could be directed against the exercise of personal rights and privileges. The State retained wide discretion in selecting subjects of taxation. The equal protection clause was not offended because no business was exempt. It was not discriminatory to exempt professions. All those conducting unincorporated businesses were in the same taxable category, and the taxpayer was taxed on the same basis as other unincorporated businesses. The taxpayer was not engaged in a profession because his knowledge was not acquired through formal education or special instruction and study.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court confirmed the decision of the Tax Commission.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Taxation - unincorporated business tax - (1) Tax Law (art. 16-A) which imposes tax on income of &quot;any unincorporated business&quot; but exempts professions, is constitutional - (2) petitioner is consultant in corporate finance and reorganization; he is not engaged in profession and his income from such business is subject to tax - (3) record supports further finding of tax commission that petitioner's compensation as director and officer of certain corporations which retained him as consultant was taxable as income in his business as consultant. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.  Article 16-A of the Tax Law, which imposes a tax on the net income of &quot;any unincorporated business&quot;, does not violate the due process clause of the United States Constitution (14th Amendt., &sect; 1) or the equal protection&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  clause of the therefrom, whatever business classifications it deems proper, and so long as all persons similarly situated are treated equally there can be no valid complaint or unconstitutionality. The exemption which the statute, the tax commission and the courts have granted, with qualifications, to professions as distinguished from businesses, is not a denial of &quot;equal protection&quot; of the laws.  Furthermore, only those affected by alleged unconstitutionality are in a position to complain.  Petitioner is neither a corporation whose unincorporated competitor has been granted exemption, nor is his occupation a profession. Nor is the question of interpretation as to what constitutes a profession so uncertain as to result in a denial of due process. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.  Petitioner is a consultant in matters of corporate finance and reorganization, rendering services to various clients for which he is paid fees.  The tax commission properly held that he is conducting a business rather than practicing a profession and is subject to the unincorporated business tax. His preparation and his work are closely akin to those of an investment counselor, a market consultant, and a specialist in office management, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  all of whom have been held to be engaged in businesses rather than in professions. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3.  During the tax period involved, petitioner also served as a director and officer of corporations by which he was retained as consultant. The record supports the finding of the tax commission that petitioner's compensation from such employment was in furtherance of and constituted receipts from his regular business as consultant. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, on behalf of themselves and other taxpayers of the county, appealed a decision from the Supreme Court of Broome County (New York), which dismissed their complaint against defendant Town of Union. The taxpayers sought to restrain the Town from withdrawing from the county welfare unit and from constituting itself as a separate welfare district.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayers contended that the statutes authorizing the Town to withdraw from the county welfare unit violated the county home rule provisions of N.Y. Const. art. IX (1939). The court found that 1930 N.Y. Laws 197 and 1936 N.Y. Laws 1936 properly authorized any town in Broome County having a population of 30,000 or more to elect to assume the responsibilities of a city in a county public welfare district. At the date the statutes were enacted, the home rule provision had not yet been enacted, and there was no constitutional prohibition for the legislation. Although 1940 N.Y. Laws 619 was enacted without complying with the constitutional conditions, it merely consolidated existing law and was not a new law in violation of the constitutional ban. The taxpayers directed their argument against 1946 N.Y. Laws 200, &sect; 75-a. However, the court found that the statute had nothing to do with counties and only applied to towns and welfare districts. Finally, the court held that a general statute relating to a matter of state concern, that applied to all localities having a given population, was not rendered local by the fact that only a single locality was eligible when it was enacted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the decision dismissing the complaint.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional law - special or &quot;local&quot; laws - town welfare districts - (1) section 75-a of Social Welfare Law which provides that town might constitute itself town welfare district is not violative of article IX of State Constitution prohibiting enactment of special or local law or law relating to one county only; constitutional provision does not relate to towns or welfare districts - (2) moreover, constitutional prohibition does not relate to matters of health and welfare - (3) statute not rendered &quot;local&quot; law by fact that only single locality eligible to qualify thereunder. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.  A town having assumed, pursuant to statutory authority (L. 1930, ch. 197; L. 1936, ch. 595; L. 1940, ch. 619; Social Welfare Law, &sect; 55), the responsibilities of a city in a county public welfare district, elected to function as a separate district under&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the provisions of section 75-a of the Social Welfare Law (L. 1946, ch. 200), which provides that a town having a population of 50,000 or more and which has already assumed the responsibilities of a city in a county public welfare district, might elect to constitute itself a town welfare district.  This provision of the Social Welfare Law does not violate the provisions of article IX of the State Constitution prohibiting the enactment of special or local laws or laws relating to one county only without either the approval of the board of supervisors or a certificate of the Governor and two-thirds vote of the members of the Legislature.  The constitutional provision relates to counties and not to towns or welfare districts.  Accordingly, the complaint in a taxpayer's action seeking to restrain the Town of Union in Broome County from operating as a separate welfare district was properly dismissed. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.  The constitutional prohibition relates to &quot;the organization and government of counties&quot; and legislation which is concerned with matters of health and welfare is not within the category of special or local laws affecting the organization and government of any county.  Accordingly, even&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  if the statute allowing the town to elect to constitute itself a town welfare district did relate to counties it would not be unconstitutional.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3.  Furthermore, a general statute relating to a matter of State concern and applying to all localities having a given population is not rendered a &quot;local&quot; law by the fact that only a single locality is eligible at the time of its enactment to qualify under it.  The classification based on population is not unreasonable or arbitrary. </SPAN></P>

The court reasoned that respondents were not deprived of land without due process. There was substantial compliance with the provisions of the Conservation Law and that all required steps have been taken. The court found that the state could create an agency for the purpose of carrying out a state duty or function.

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.  In proceedings under article 78 of the Civil Practice Act a determination of respondents to construct a dam and operate a reservoir for the purpose of regulating the Moose and Black Rivers - a project which requires the taking of approximately 3,500 acres of private lands and the use of 1,500 acres of the State Forest Preserve - is confirmed. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.With respect to contentions that the capacity of the proposed reservoir is excessive and that the construction of the dam and reservoir is not in the public interest, there is sufficient proof from which respondents could make the findings they have made and, although on all the evidence the court might differ with such findings, it may not be said that they were not based upon substantial&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  evidence. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3.  An objection that petitioner, a private corporation, will be deprived of property without due process of law, is overruled.  ( </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Hudson River Regulating District </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">v.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11"> Fonda, J. &amp; G.R.R. Co.,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 249 N.Y. 445, followed). </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4.  There has been a substantial compliance with the applicable provisions of article VII of the Conservation Law governing river regulation and all the steps have been taken which are required at this stage of the proceedings.  Before actual construction of the reservoir is commenced, additional surveys and contract plans will have to be made but such work was not necessary until the determination of respondents was reviewed by the court. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5.It is also contended that the provisions of article VII, authorizing the board of a river regulating district to construct dams and reservoirs on the State forest preserve, are unconstitutional in that article XIV of the Constitution requires such reservoirs to be constructed, owned, controlled and operated by the State and that the board is not &quot;the state&quot;.  The predecessor of article VII was enacted shortly after the amendment to the Constitution authorizing the use of not exceeding 3% of State forest preserve&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  lands for the maintenance of reservoirs to regulate the flow of streams under the control of the State and a reading of the statute shows that the Legislature had the constitutional limitations in mind.  The districts were to be created by a commission of the State (presently the Water Power and Control Commission).  After appointment by the Governor, each member of the board is required to take and file a constitutional oath of office in the Secretary of State's office, a requirement indicating the Legislature's intent to make them State officers ( Public Officers Law, &sect; 10).  Title to all real estate acquired by respondent is in the name of the State, the Comptroller is given control over the funds of the district and the acts of the board must have the approval of the commission.  It is clear that the legislative intent was to give the commission the power in proper cases to create State agencies to take over State functions to regulate rivers under the supervision of the commission and, although the statute names such agencies public corporations, the board members were to be and are State officers. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6.  To justify a court in declaring a statute invalid, the conflict between the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  act and the Constitution must be clear and certain.  Every presumption favors the validity of the statute.  If there is a reasonable doubt, the act should be upheld. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7.  The Legislature acted within constitutional limitations in enacting the statute.  Respondent is a State agency and the acts of its members are the acts of &quot;the state&quot; and comply with the statute.  </SPAN></P>

Act. art. 78 for an order to annul a determination of respondent Commissioner of Taxation and Finance of the State of New York and directed him to pay a veterans' bonus to the executor. The Commissioner appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">1947 N.Y. Laws ch. 547 provided for payment of a bonus to the next of kin of a member of the armed forces who died on active duty between certain dates during World War II. The deceased's father applied for the bonus but died before the claim was approved. The father's executor argued that the bonus should be paid to the estate because the father had acquired a vested right to the payment. The lower court ordered the Commissioner of Taxation to pay the bonus to the executor. The court reversed and confirmed the Commissioner's determination that the executor was not entitled to payment of the bonus. The court found that the bonus was a pure gratuity which the legislature was at liberty to repeal at any time. Thus no vested right existed in favor of any person until the payment had actually been made. The court also held that it could not overlook the interpretation placed on the statute by the Commissioner of Taxation because that interpretation was warranted by the record and had a reasonable basis in the law.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Army and navy - veterans' bonus - (1) veterans' bonus, payable under chapter 547 of Laws of 1947, is gratuity and not property right passing to executor of applicant who died prior to payment - (2) estate of adoptive father of member of armed forces who died while on active duty, who applied as next of kin for payment of bonus but died before payment made, not entitled to payment of bonus - (3) statute indicates intent that surviving next of kin, in order named in statute, should receive payment if person eligible dies - (4) interpretation of statute by Veterans' Bonus Bureau, having warrant in record and basis in law, should not be disturbed. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.The veterans' bonus provided for by chapter 547 of the Laws of 1947 is a gratuity and not a property right which passes to an executor of an applicant who died prior to payment. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  2.  The adoptive father of a member of the armed forces who died while on active duty made claim for the bonus as next of kin, but, before the claim had been finally passed upon and before all the necessary date showing that he was next of kin had been submitted, the adoptive father died. The bonus is not payable to the executor of the father's estate.  Since the next of kin mentioned in the statute must be alive to receive payment of the bonus, such next of kin could obtain no rights by the filing of an application. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3.  The statute provides that in the event an eligible veteran himself makes application for a bonus but dies prior to receiving payment, the proceeds of such bonus go, not to the estate of the applicant, but to the surviving eligible next of kin (L. 1947, ch. 547, &sect; 1, subd. [b]).  This and other provisions of the statute indicate that, if the person eligible for payment of the bonus should die before actual payment is made, the surviving next of kin next in line in the order named in the statute would be entitled to receive payment thereof. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4.  The Veterans' Bonus Bureau has always taken a corresponding position and its interpretation has warrant in the record, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  a reasonable basis in law, and is not arbitrary or capricious. The courts should not interfere with an interpretation so placed upon the statute by an administrative body. </SPAN></P>

After the operator died, the licensor gave notice terminating the agreement and then removed the operator's equipment and merchandise from the department. The operator's wife brought an action for damages, claiming protection under various landlord-tenant laws. The trial court denied the store's motion for summary judgment in the operator's wife's action for damages, holding that the agreement provided for more than a license. The court disagreed, reversed the trial court's order, and entered summary judgment for the store. In support of its ruling, the court considered that: 1) the operator's use of the space was limited and the space itself was subject to change and substitution at the will of the store; 2) the operator had only the privilege of conducting the department and not exclusive possession and control as against the store; 3) the operator did not pay rent, which was defined in N.Y. Bus. Rent Law ch. 314, &sect; 2(f), as consideration for the use or occupancy of space, but paid the store 25 percent of the gross receipts for occupancy and the privilege of conducting the department.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.  In May, 1939, a department store, described as licensor, and an optician, described as licensee, entered into an agreement for the operation of an optical department in the store.  The agreement provided that the licensor leased to the licensee and the licensee hired from the licensor certain space, which was shown on a diagram made part of the agreement.  The licensor&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  reserved the right to remove the department to another place in the store.  The sales were to be made in the name of the licensor and receipts were to go through the regular channels of the business of the licensor, and, after deducting the licensor's commissions, the proceeds were to be retained by the licensor in trust for the licensee, who agreed to pay for the privilege of conducting the department 25% of the gross receipts thereof and to spend 8% of the gross receipts on advertising.  The licensee was made liable to the licensor for unpaid charge accounts.  Selection of employees by the licensee was to be subject to the approval of the licensor. Prices were made subject to regulation by the agreement and final adjustment of disputes with customers was to be made by the licensor. The license could not be assigned and the licensee was forbidden to permit anyone else to occupy the space or transact business therein without consent of the licensor. The original agreement covered the period from April, 1939, to January 27, 1940, subject to continuance at will with the right of either party to cancel on fourteen days' notice.  It was specifically provided that the relationship between&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  licensor and licensee was personal.  Such agreement did not create a relationship of landlord and tenant. The licensee was not granted exclusive possession of the space and the agreement provided for such control by the licensor that the licensee had only the privilege of conducting the department.  The fact that the space occupied is specific and described by diagram does not effect a landlord-tenant relationship. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.  It is immaterial that the Business Rent Law (L. 1945, ch. 314, &sect; 2, as amd.) defines a tenant as including a licensee. The licensee herein did not have exclusive possession of a rentable area. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3.  Moreover, compensation paid under the agreement was not &quot;rent&quot;, defined in the Business Rent Law as consideration &quot;for the use and occupancy&quot; of space (L. 1945, ch. 314, &sect; 2, as amd.).  The consideration paid under this agreement was, as provided by the agreement, for occupancy &quot;and the privilege of conducting the said department.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4.  Accordingly, in an action brought by the optician's widow as his executrix, who had conducted the department for several months and was then excluded from the premises, to recover damages resulting from such exclusion (L. 1945, ch. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  314, &sect; 8, as amd.), summary judgment dismissing the complaint should have been granted.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner licensee sought review of a judgment of the supreme court (New York), which ruled in favor of respondent State Liquor Authority (authority) in the licensee's N.Y.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The licensee was found guilty for the third time of cutting prices on sales of liquor in violation of the Fair Trade Law, N.Y. Gen. Bus. Law &sect;&sect; 369-a to 369-e, and the authority's Rule 26, which required the adoption and observance of fair trade contracts fixing resale prices. The court annulled the authority's decision to revoke the licensee's license, holding that: (1) N.Y. Alco. Bev. Cont. Law &sect; 17(12)(b) simply granted the authority discretion to prohibit the sale of alcoholic beverages except pursuant to a fair trade contract; (2) whether mandatory price-fixing should be adopted was not a fit subject to be relegated to determination by an administrative board; (3) what the authority did went far beyond anything enacted by the Fair Trade Law, which was intended to protect producers of branded commodities in the ownership of their brand names and which made price-fixing entirely voluntary; and (4) the incorporation of the Fair Trade Law by reference in &sect; 17(12)(b) violated N.Y. Const. art. III, &sect; 16. Thus, both N.Y. Alco. Bev. Cont. Law &sect; 17(12)(b) and the authority's Rule 26 respecting mandatory price-fixing were invalid.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional law - intoxicating liquors - Fair Trade Law - delegation of legislative power - incorporation of another statute by reference - (1) mandatory price-fixing provisions of Alcoholic Beverage Control Law ( &sect; 17, subd. 12, par. [b]) and of rule 26 of State Liquor Authority are unconstitutional and void (N.Y. Const., art. III, &sect;&sect; 1, 16) - (2) Legislature may not delegate discretion to administrative body to determine whether price-fixing of brandname alcoholic beverages shall be mandatory - (3) price-fixing under Fair Trade Law (General Business Law, art. XXIV-A) depends on voluntary contract of owner of brand name, whereas here discretion is delegated to make it mandatory - (4) statute fails to set standard to control discretion of administrative body - (5) statute also unconstitutionally incorporates&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Fair Trade Law by reference - (6) revocation by Authority of liquor license annulled and matter remitted for further action in respect of lesser charges. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.  Paragraph (b) of subdivision 12 of section 17 of the Alcoholic Beverage Control Law is an unconstitutional delegation of legislative discretion (N.Y. Const., art. III, &sect; 1) to the State Liquor Authority to make mandatory as to alcoholic beverages the provisions of the Fair Trade Law (General Business Law, art. XXIV-A) permitting contracts to be made fixing the prices of brandname commondities.  This provision of the Alcoholic Beverage Control Law also violates the constitutional prohibition against incorporating another statute by reference (N.Y. Const., art. III, &sect; 16).  The provision, as well as rule 26 of the Rules of the State Liquor Authority adopted pursuant thereto, is invalid. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.  The General Business Law (art. XXIV-A, known as the Fair Trade Law) provides that no contract relating to the sale or resale of a commodity which bears the trade-mark, brand, or name of the producer or owner and which is in fair and open competition with commodities of the same general class shall be deemed in violation of law notwithstanding&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  that such contract prohibits the buyer from reselling except at the price stipulated by the vendor, and notwithstanding that it may require any dealer to agree that he will not resell except at the price stipulated by such vendor or vendee (&sect; 369-a).  Willfully and knowingly advertising, offering for sale or reselling a commodity at less than the price stipulated in such a contract, whether or not by a party thereto, is made unfair competition and actionable at the suit of any person damaged thereby (&sect; 369-b).  Paragraph (b) of subdivision 12 of section 17 of the Alcoholic Beverage Control Law purports to authorize the State Liquor Authority &quot;in its discretion&quot; to prohibit &quot;the sale of any or all alcoholic beverages * * * except pursuant to a fair trade contract entered into in accordance with the provisions of article twenty-four-a of the general business law.&quot; Whether mandatory price-fixing shall be adopted is not a fit subject to be relegated to determination by an administrative board, under the guise of making regulations to facilitate the accomplishment of its purpose to enforce the liquor laws enacted by the Legislature.  Under section 1 of article III of the New York State&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Constitution, &quot;The legislative power of this State shall be vested in the Senate and Assembly.&quot; This legislative power cannot be passed on to others. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3.  What has been done here goes far beyond anything enacted by the Fair Trade Law. Such laws are primarily designed to safeguard the producers of branded commodities in the ownership of their brand names.  The purpose here ( Alcoholic Beverage Control Law, &sect; 17, subd. 12) is different, viz., by avoiding price wars, &quot;to foster and promote temperance, and provide for the orderly distribution of alcoholic beverages.&quot; This motivation has nothing to do with protecting property rights of producers in brand names.  Under the Fair Trade Law, price-fixing depends upon the voluntary act of the owner of the brand name in entering into or refraining from entering into a fair trade contract; in the present case, price-fixing of branded alcoholic beverages is made compulsory by the State Liquor Authority except as it may, in its unlimited discretion, choose to make exceptions.  (Rule 26.) </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4.  The quoted words of subdivision 12 of section 17 of the Alcoholic Beverage Control Law do not set a standard by which the action of the Authority is controlled&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  in determining whether or not there shall be mandatory price-fixing. The statute delegates to the Authority the power to determine the important and delicate question whether price-fixing of branded alcoholic beverages does tend &quot;to foster and promote temperance, and provide for the orderly distribution of alcoholic beverages.&quot; The Constitution of the State and the orderly processes of representative government require that the Legislature should make such important decisions itself.  Otherwise there is no method by which the people can locate responsibility for such fundamental determinations of public policy. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5.  Paragraph (b) of subdivision 12 of section 17 of the Alcoholic Beverage Control Law likewise violates section 16 of article III of the New York State Constitution, which provides: &quot;No act shall be passed which shall provide that any existing law, or any part thereof, shall be made or deemed a part of said act, or which shall enact that any existing law, or part thereof, shall be applicable, except by inserting it in such act.&quot; Incorporation of the Fair Trade Law by reference in subdivision 12 of section 17 of the Alcoholic Beverage Control Law, even if it were to take&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  effect without being subject to the fiat of the Authority, would violate the spirit of this provision of the Constitution, for the significant reason that the Fair Trade Law was adopted for a different purpose, viz., to enable the owner of a brand name to protect such name by fixing resale prices at its own election, whereas it is incorporated in the Alcoholic Beverage Control Law for the purpose of facilitating the enforcement of the liquor laws.  The Fair Trade Law is not mandatory on produces, and cannot be made so without being removed from its context and altered in substance.  The Legislature is constitutionally forbidden to do that except by inserting the applicable provisions of the old law in the new act. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6.  A determination of the State Liquor Authority, revoking petitioner's liquor license because of his violations of said statute and rule, should be annualled and the matter remitted to the Authority for suitable action as to the other charges proven against petitioner.  Those other charges - receipt of an unfilled order for an excess quantity of liquor, one actual sale of an excess quantity, and some informalities in books and records - were too unsubstantial to have&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  warranted complete revocation of license. </SPAN></P>

C.P.L.R. art. 78, petitioners, the surviving directors of a corporate taxpayer, sought review a determination by respondent, the State Tax Commission (New York), which affirmed an assessment of a tax under former N.Y.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer challenged the legality of the tax as imposed because &sect; 209(3) was enacted and made effective at a time when the taxpayer was lawfully existing and had paid all franchise taxes theretofore imposed and due, the payment of which, prior to the enactment of &sect; 209(3), had, by law, given sanction to the enjoyment of its franchise for a future period subsequent to the effective date of the &sect; 209(3)'s enactment. The taxpayer claimed that it was granted the right to exist for a future period, which included also the right to cease to exist, or dissolve, during that time without payment of such a franchise tax. In affirming the tax imposed by the Commission, the court ruled that the mere abolishment of the taxpayer's opportunity to take measures to become free of a tax violated no rights. The tax imposed by &sect; 209(3) was not a new tax, but only the time and circumstance that occasioned its becoming due and payable constituted the new arrangement. All that was done was to accelerate the time of payment should dissolution be decided upon, and thus close the door to the old opportunity to escape payment.

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Injunctions - picketing - (1) New Jersey packer sold frozen kosher poultry to kosher stores and frozen food stores in New York City; local union of kosher slaughterers picketed such retailers in order to monopolize city kosher poultry market; temporary injunction granted - (2) no labor dispute involved since plaintiff's employees are members of same parent union as defendant and fact that monopoly would increase piece rate pay of New York City operatives of no moment - (3) private embargo to prevent foodstuffs from entering New York City not lawful objective - (4) Allen Bradley Co. v. Union (325 U.S. 797) distinguished -- (5) ousting of State jurisdiction arises where burden imposed on interstate commerce not where, as here, law prevents burden on all commerce whether interstate or intrastate - (6) section 876-a of Civil Practice Act not&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  intended to amend State law as to restraint of trade - (7) identification of constitutional protection of right of free speech with immunity to impose private embargoes on foodstuffs entering New York City, unwarranted - (8) section 876-a of Civil Practice Act inapplicable - (9) no intention in Labor Management Relations Act of 1947 to divest State courts of jurisdiction in cases like present. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.  A slaughterer and packer of kosher poultry in New Jersey entered the New York City market where it sold such poultry exclusively to retail kosher butcher stores and frozen food stores.  In an action to restrain defendants from interfering with such seller's business the complaint alleges that defendant union - an organization of religious officials qualified to slaughter animals in accordance with the ritual requirements of the Hebrew Orthodox faith - has picketed the New York retailers in an endeavor to monopolize the market for the benefit of operatives in that city.  Plaintiff's motion for a temporary injunction should be granted and defendants' motion to dismiss the complaint against the union should be denied. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.  Since plaintiff's poultry is conceded to be kosher there is no religious&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  question in the case nor is there any labor dispute between the parties for plaintiff's employees are members of locals affiliated with the same parent union as defendant.  The purpose of defendants' activities is to keep away from the New York City market all frozen kosher poultry slaughtered elsewhere and to limit the market to poultry slaughtered in the city so as to obtain better wages. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3.  A private embargo to prevent foodstuffs from entering New York City is not a lawful objective and is not made so by using procedures which would be legitimate if directed toward the accomplishment of other purposes.  In the case of foodstuffs alone the consequences of such embargoes would be disastrous in a city as dependent upon outside sources of supply as is New York.  That is the interest of the consuming public in this issue. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4.  The case of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Allen Bradley Co. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">v.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11"> Union</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (325 U.S. 797) relied on by defendants, although somewhat similar to the present case on the facts, is distinguishable. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5.  The question whether State jurisdiction has been ousted is accustomed to arise where a State has imposed a burden upon interstate commerce not where, as here, the State laws prevent burdens&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  from being laid upon commerce, whether interstate or intrastate.  An intention of Congress to exclude States from asserting their police power must be clearly manifested.  While the present case involves interstate commerce, the circumstance is coincidental since the barrier established by defendant union applies equally to all poultry slaughtered in the State of New York elsewhere than in New York City. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6.  Section 876-a of the Civil Practice Act was not intended to have the effect of amending the substantive State law, common or statutory, respecting restraint of trade and kindred subjects which the United States Supreme Court ascribed to the Norris-La Guardia Act as amending the Federal Antitrust Law. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7.  While picketing has been held to be akin to free speech guaranteed by the Constitution of the United States, in none of the cases considered was the United States Supreme Court dealing with an unlawful objective, one which is not a labor objective at all.  The controlling features in the present case are that the purpose of the picketing, the erection of an embargo against the importation of frozen kosher poultry into New York City, is an unlawful objective, that no labor controversy&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of any kind is involved; that the information on the signs carried by the pickets, while technically accurate, was actually misleading as indicating that there was a labor dispute whereas none existed, and that the signs were not displayed for the purpose of publicizing any legitimate grievance of the union, but rather as a verbal act in a conspiracy to accomplish an unlawful purpose.  To identify the cherished constitutional protection of the right of free speech with immunity to impose private embargoes on foodstuffs entering New York City would be unwarranted. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8.  Section 876-a of the Civil Practice Act does not apply since the controversy has no relation to terms or conditions of employment but relates instead to something which cannot even properly be the subject of collective bargaining. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff citizen sought review of a decision from the Supreme Court, Erie County (New York), which granted the motion to dismiss the citizen's complaint that was filed by defendants, the New York State Emergency Housing Joint Board, a church-related college, and a construction company, in an action to declare a $ 128,000 allocation to the college by the Board unconstitutional as a violation of N.Y. Const. art. IX, &sect; 4.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The citizen sought a declaratory judgment to the effect that a $ 128,000 allocation to the church-related college by the Board was unconstitutional. The trial court dismissed the complaint on the ground that the citizen had no special or peculiar interest in the matter other than that common to all taxpayers, which meant that he lacked legal capacity to bring the action. On appeal, the court sustained that judgment. The court noted that the clear weight of authority in the state was against the alleged power and authority of a court to pass upon the constitutionality of a statute except in an action or proceeding on behalf of a person whose special, peculiar personal rights were affected thereby. Because the citizen had not shown any special rights or interests in the matter, the complaint was properly dismissed.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Actions - taxpayer's action - (1) taxpayer without capacity to maintain action testing constitutionality of expenditure of State funds for religious educational institution; civil or property rights of plaintiff not particularly affected thereby - (2) if question of capacity to sue not raised and matter of great public exigency, court need not inject issue; but such is not this case - (3) section 51 of General Municipal Law, granting taxpayer right to prevent illegal act by municipal officer, not applicable to actions against State. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.  Plaintiff, as a citizen and taxpayer, sought a judgment declaring that a $128,000 allocation to Canisius College (a religious educational institution) by the Emergency Housing Board was unconstitutional.  An individual taxpayer is without capacity to maintain an action for a declaratory judgment to test the constitutionality of an act of the Legislature or the activities of State officers thereunder, unless his civil or property rights are specifically and particularly affected thereby. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The plaintiff in this action has not shown any special rights or interests in the matter other than those common to all taxpayers and citizens.  A complaint which does not show that the plaintiff has the requisite rights or interests to enable him to maintain his action must be dismissed for insufficiency. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.  If the question of capacity to sue is not raised and the matter is of great public exigency concerning which all parties desire an immediate determination on the merits, the court on its own motion need not inject that issue.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant landlord challenged the decision of the Supreme Court (New York), which denied the landlord's application for an order under N.Y. Civ. Prac. Act &sect; 78 to compel respondent clerk of court to issue a warrant of dispossess to a tenant.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landlord contended that the clerk's refusal, pursuant to the Sharkey anti-eviction law, New York City, N.Y., Admin. Code &sect; U41-7.0 (1947), to issue a writ of dispossess to a tenant in an eviction action, was an unconstitutional infringement on the landlord's rights. The court affirmed the trial court's decision in favor of denying the writ because 1948 N.Y. Laws 4 validated New York City, N.Y., Admin. Code &sect; U41-7.0 (1947), which did not conflict with the Housing and Rent Act of 1947, 50 U.S.C.S. &sect;&sect; 1881-1902, and neither the due process nor the impairment-of-contract clauses of the United States Constitution invalidated the anti-eviction law.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's decision that denied the landlord's request to compel the clerk to issue a warrant of dispossess to a tenant.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Municipal corporations - legislative power - landlord and tenant - rent regulation - validity of local law restricting evictions - (1) Local Law No. 66 of 1947 of City of New York (Administrative Code, &sect; U41-7.0), as validated by State (L. 1948, ch. 4), requiring landlord to obtain certificate from city rent commission before bringing summary proceedings, is constitutional - (2) local law may be validly adopted by State even if such law originally exceeded city's power - (3) local law expressly applies to pending proceedings; landlord had obtained final order, but his application for order under article 78 of Civil Practice Act to compel municipal court clerk to issue warrant of dispossess was properly denied - (4) immaterial that landlord had obtained, prior to enactment of local law, certificate from former U.S. Office of Price Administration permitting eviction proceedings; Federal Housing and Rent Act of 1947 omits prohibition&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  against local controls contained in Price Control Extension Act of 1946. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.  Local Law No. 66 of 1947 of the City of New York (Administrative Code of City of New York, &sect; U41-7.0), validated by the State (L. 1948, ch. 4), declares a housing emergency situation in the city and prohibits the institution of proceedings to remove a tenant from an apartment unless the landlord first obtains a certificate from the temporary city housing rent commission.  The requirement is constitutional.  (N.Y. Const., art. IX, &sect; 12; City Home Rule Law, &sect;&sect; 11, 31; New York City Charter, &sect; 27.) </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.  The State may enact legislation which in effect constitutes an adoption of a local law even if the local law originally exceeded the powers of a municipality. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3.  The local law applies &quot;to all pending and future eviction proceedings&quot;.  The State law provides that &quot;Such local laws shall be deemed effectual as of the date when such local laws purported to take effect and all acts authorized thereby are hereby legalized and confirmed.&quot; Said requirement of a certificate therefore applies to a pending summary proceeding, at least until a warrant of eviction has been issued, and even though the landlord has&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  obtained a final order. An application by the landlord in this case for an order under article 78 of the Civil Practice Act to compel the municipal court clerk to issue a warrant of dispossess was therefore properly denied. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4.  The landlord had obtained a certificate from the former United States Office of Price Administration permitting eviction proceedings, and had instituted such proceedings on May 6, 1947, but under said local law, enacted September 17, 1947, he must obtain a certificate from the city rent commission.  The act extending the Emergency Price Control Act of 1942 to June 30, 1947, provided that &quot;such housing accommodations shall not be subject to rent control by any State or local government&quot; (U.S. Code, tit. 50, Appendix, &sect; 902; Price Control Extension Act of 1946, Public Law 548, 79th Cong., 2d Sess.), but the Federal Housing and Rent Act of 1947 relaxed Federal controls and omitted such provision.  (U.S. Code, tit. 50, Appendix, &sect; 1881 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">et seq.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Public Law 129, 80th Cong., 1st Sess.) The local law as validated by the State law is not in conflict with the Federal law and can be enforced without clashing.  No matter how the rights obtained by the landlord&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  under the certificate previously issued by the Federal Office of Price Administration may be characterized, the validity of the subsequently enacted legislation by the city and State under the police power is not impaired.  </SPAN></P>
