</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">Relator citizen filed an action in the Court of Appeals for Hamilton County (Ohio) against respondents, a county board of elections and the secretary of state, seeking a writ of mandamus directing respondents to arrange the names of candidates for a general election in accordance with the provisions of Ohio Const. art. V, &sect; 2a, rather than Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3507.07. The court of appeals allowed the writ. Respondents appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">The court first addressed the arguments that the citizen did not have standing to attack the constitutionality of the statute and that the citizen had an adequate remedy by way of injunction or declaratory judgment. The court held that the citizen had the capacity to maintain a proper action to enforce the performance of a public duty relating to elections and affecting himself and citizens generally, even where such act involved an attack on the constitutionality of a statute. The court further held that the court of appeals did not abuse its discretion in allowing the writ merely because the citizen also had an adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law. With regard to the substantive issue, the court of appeals determined that &sect; 3507.07, which set forth a method for arranging the names of candidates for general elections on voting machines, was in conflict with Ohio Const. art. V, &sect; 2a, and was, therefore, unconstitutional. The court upheld that determination and affirmed the judgment. The court noted that the constitutional provision was self-executing and applied instead of the provisions of the statute.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">APPEAL from the Court of Appeals for Cuyahoga County.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This action in mandamus originated in the Court of Appeals, wherein the relator, The Cleveland Electric Illuminating Company, seeks to compel the respondent city of Euclid to issue a permit for the construction of an overhead electric transmission line to carry electrical energy at a voltage of 132,000 volts over certain streets in the respondent city.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The city refuses to issue such permit primarily for the reason that the application is for a permit to construct </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">overhead</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> transmission lines carrying electrical energy in excess of 33,000 volts, which would be contrary to ordinance No. 78-1957 of such city requiring such lines to be placed </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">underground</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.  That ordinance reads as follows:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Whereas, this council finds that it is necessary to provide for the safety, welfare, comfort and convenience of inhabitants of the city of Euclid, and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Whereas, this council further finds that increasingly higher voltages of electric power are being carried to and through urban centers and cities such as the city of Euclid, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and that provision must be made whereby such power lines are so constructed and maintained as to provide the greatest safety factors for persons using the public streets and ways, as well as those persons occupying private property and to provide quiet and peaceable possession of the same, and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Whereas, making provision for such high tension lines also provides for the usual daily operation of municipal departments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, therefore, be it ordained by the Council of the City of Euclid, state of Ohio:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Section 1: That ordinance No. 288-1956, passed December 3, 1956, be and the same is hereby amended and supplemented by adding the following new section, to be known as Section 2.1, which shall read as follows:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Section 2.1: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Permit issued by council</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It shall be unlawful to construct or maintain an electric power line carrying greater voltage than 33 KV, without first obtaining a permit therefor from the council.  No charge shall be made for such permit.  The applicant shall first file plans and specifications, which shall show the course and route of such proposed line in or through the city of Euclid.  Such line shall be installed underground, at a minimum depth of six feet&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  below grade.  It shall be backfilled by and laid in at least six inches of sand.  It shall be standard underground pipe-type cable, lead covered, to be no less than the standard minimum A. E. I. C. specification as to voltage, herein adopted.  Such line shall be encased in an enclosed sealed and welded steel pipe with protective sheath, having a somatic coating.  Such pipe may either be oil or gas filled and shall be capable of withstanding any maintained pressure.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Court of Appeals referred the case to a special master who found such ordinance unconstitutional on the basis that it is not a lawful exercise of the police power and recommended that a writ of mandamus issue.  The Court of Appeals adopted the special master's report as its conclusions of law and fact and issued the writ.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cause is before this court on an appeal as of right from the judgment of the Court of Appeals.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">Respondent city appealed from the judgment of the Court of Appeals for Cuyahoga County (Ohio), which had issued a writ of mandamus requiring the city to issue a permit for construction of overhead electric lines to relator electric company. The city contended that the court of appeals erred in its determination that its ordinance requiring the line be constructed underground was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">The city passed an ordinance requiring that high-voltage electric lines be installed underground. Statutes required the electric company to obtain the consent of the city before constructing electric transmission lines through the city. The electric company sought to construct a high-voltage line above ground in an industrial area of the city. The city denied the request and the electric company brought an action in mandamus in the court of appeals. The court held that the requirement of consent necessarily implied that the city could regulate the construction of electric transmission lines. It took judicial notice that high-voltage lines were dangerous and held that the city's ordinance was a reasonable exercise of the police power. Even if it were assumed that the original ordinance granting the electric company a franchise to install power lines created a contract, the contract was subject to the reasonable exercise of the police power. The electric company had no right to erect a high-voltage transmission line above ground.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">The court reversed the judgment of the court of appeals.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">APPEALS from the Court of Appeals for Hamilton County.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cause No. 35653 was originated in the Court of Common Pleas of Franklin County as an action to enjoin the defendant, Cain, City Clerk of the city of Columbus, from forwarding to the city council the transcript of the proceedings of the Board of County Commissioners of Franklin County approving the annexation to the city of approximately 84 acres in Mifflin Township.  The proceeding before the Board of County Commissioners was initiated by the filing of a petition signed by 16 resident adult freeholders living in territory proposed to be annexed.  Although the petition before the board stated that 19 adult freeholders resided in the territory, there were admittedly 21 such freeholders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Upon receipt of the petition on April 20, 1956, the board on April 24, 1956, adopted a formal order (1) directing that the petition be filed with the county auditor, (2) fixing the date of public hearing as June 26, 1956, and (3) directing notification of the agent of the petitioners as to the time and place of hearing.  Later, the date of hearing was postponed to August 14, 1956.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After April&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  24 and before August 14, signers withdrew their signatures (some of whom withdrew their withdrawals) in such numbers as to leave the petition signed by ten freeholders as of the date of hearing, which was one less than a majority of the adult resident freeholders residing in the territory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the time of public hearing before the Board of County Commissioners, the withdrawals were disregarded and the annexation was approved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Court of Common Pleas denied the injunction which was sought and the Court of Appeals affirmed the decision of the lower court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Causes Nos. 35763, 35785 and 35786 were originated in the Court of Common Pleas of Hamilton County by the various plaintiffs as actions to enjoin the defendants, Director of Finance, City Clerk and the city of Cincinnati, from reporting to the council of that city the transcript of the proceedings of the Board of County Commissioners, map and petition, in connection with annexation to the city of a portion of Green Township in said county.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The petition for annexation bearing signatures of 340 adult resident freeholders of the area described therein was filed with the Board of County Commissioners of Hamilton County on July 1, 1955, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and on July 5 was referred by that board to the county engineer for checking signatures and description.  That officer, under date of July 25, 1955, made a return to the Board of County Commissioners finding that the petition contained valid signatures which represented 55.3 per cent of the resident freeholders of the area for which annexation was sought, and that the descriptions were correct.  On July 26, 1955, the Board of County Commissioners set the petition for annexation for public hearing on October 11, 1955.  At the hearing, certain withdrawals of signatures and additions thereto presented in the interim between July 26 and October 11 were considered together with the evidence, and the matter was again referred to the county engineer who reported on October 24, 1955, that he found 52.2 per cent of the resident freeholders in the territory proposed for annexation signed on the petition in favor of the annexation.  At the October 11 hearing, proponents and opponents of the annexation presented additional signatures supplementing the original petition and seeking withdrawal therefrom, respectively.  As of October 24, a further request for the withdrawal of 28 more signatures&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  was submitted, which further request the Board of County Commissioners refused to consider.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On November 19, 1956, a little more than a year later, the petition for annexation was approved and a transcript of the proceedings was forwarded to the Director of Finance of the city of Cincinnati by the Board of County Commissioners of Hamilton County.  Before action could be taken by the city council these three causes were instituted in the Court of Common Pleas.  They were consolidated for trial in that court, and at their conclusion the petitions for injunction were dismissed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Court of Appeals affirmed the judgments of the Court of Common Pleas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Franklin County cause and the three Hamilton County causes are before this court on allowance of motions to certify the records, and two of the Hamilton County cases (Nos. 35785 and 35786) are here also on appeals as of right.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">In consolidated actions, appellants, some of the residents in their respective unincorporated areas, challenged the judgments of the Court of Appeals for Franklin County and the Court of Appeals for Hamilton County (Ohio), which affirmed the lower court's denial of injunctive relief to stop the annexations of the unincorporated areas by appellee city and county officials pursuant to Ohio Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">In five separate actions brought in two counties, the issue was whether the respective city and county officials could continue with the annexation of previously unincorporated areas once the residents of those areas withdrew or attempted to withdraw their approval. In one county, residents withdrew their signatures on the authorizing petition to where there was no longer a majority approval. In the other county, the residents challenged the technical sufficiency of the petition. Both the trial court and the intermediate appellate court denied the residents their request for an injunction and they sought review. The court held that the ability to annex unincorporated areas into a municipality was an inherent and discretionary power of any city that did not violate any constitutional voting or property rights of the residents of the unincorporated areas. Once &quot;official action&quot; was begun, the petitioners no longer had the right to withdraw their approval; it was at the discretion of the city to go forward, or not, or to permit &quot;withdrawal&quot; of the residents' approval as it saw fit, but in any event the residents could not stop the process once the city had obtained jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By entry dated December 6, 1957, the Board of Tax Appeals, appellee herein and hereinafter called the board, adopted ten rules under the caption, &quot;Ohio Real Property Valuation Rules.&quot; Under the provisions of the board's entry, nine of these rules (Nos. 100 through 108) became effective on January 1, 1959.  The tenth, rule No. 109, became effective January 1, 1958.  Because so much of the present litigation evolved from rule No. 100, it is set forth in full as follows:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Pursuant to the provisions of Amended Senate Bill No. 109, adopted by the 102nd Ohio General Assembly, and particularly Revised Code Sections 5713.03 and 5715.01, which must be read together to the end that uniformity be obtained, the Board of Tax Appeals does hereby define the term 'taxable value.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The term 'taxable value' means such percentage of 'true value' as the Board of Tax Appeals shall determine, from time to time by journal entry, as to all taxable real property.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The 'true value' of real property, as here used, means the value to be determined, in the first instance, by the county auditor as the assessor of real property in his county on consideration&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">all</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the facts relating to the physical nature and construction of the property, its availability for the purpose for which it was acquired or constructed, or for the purpose for which it is, or may be, used, and every other applicable factor which may tend to indicate the value of the property such as actual cost, value as indicated by reproduction cost, physical and functional depreciation and obsolescence, if any, market value, and the income capacity of the property, if any.  The assessor shall likewise take into consideration the location of the property and the valuations of similar properties in the same locality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The county auditor shall not be concerned with 'taxable value' until such time as the Board of Tax Appeals shall determine the percentage of 'true value' usable for a given period.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As is stated in the first paragraph of rule No. 100, it was promulgated pursuant to the provisions of Amended Senate Bill No. 109 adopted by the 102nd General Assembly, amending Sections 5713.03 and 5715.01, Revised Code.  The first of these sections requires that the county auditor shall make a determination of the &quot;taxable value&quot; of the various parcels of real property within&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  his jurisdiction in accordance with the provisions of other named sections of the Revised Code and &quot;in accordance with the uniform rules and methods for valuing and assessing of real property as adopted, prescribed, and promulgated by the Board of Tax Appeals.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The second section of the Revised Code referred to in rule No. 100 (Section 5715.01) reads as follows:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Board of Tax Appeals shall direct and supervise the assessment for taxation of all real property.  The board shall adopt, prescribe, and promulgate rules for the assessment of real property by uniform rule according to value.  Such uniform rules shall prescribe methods of determining the taxable value of such real property.  Such rules shall provide that such taxable value be determined on the basis of all facts and circumstances which the board finds necessary in order to achieve uniformity and avoid overvaluation and discrimination.  The value of each tract, lot, or parcel of real property and improvements thereon, determined in accordance with such uniform rules and the methods prescribed thereby shall be the taxable value thereof for all purposes of Sections 5713.01 to 5713.26, inclusive, of the Revised Code, of&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Sections 5715.01 to 5715.99, inclusive, of the Revised Code, and of Sections 5717.01 to 5717.06, inclusive, of the Revised Code.  County auditors shall, under the direction and supervision of the board, be the chief assessing officers of their respective counties, and shall list and value the real property within their respective counties for taxation in accordance with such rules and methods.  There shall also be a board in each county, known as the County Board of Revision, which shall hear complaints and revise assessments of real property for taxation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;On or before the first Monday in August, in the year 1959, and each sixth year thereafter, it shall be the duty of the Board of Tax Appeals to transmit to each county auditor a statement which specifies the amount or per cent to be added to or deducted from the valuation of the real property or any class thereof, in the county, township, municipal corporation or other taxing district in his county for the current tax year so that every class of real property shall be listed and valued for taxation by an equal and uniform rule, in each county in the state.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The board thereupon perfected an appeal to the Court of Appeals for Franklin County, which reversed the judgment of the Common Pleas Court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">Pursuant to legislative authority, the Board adopted a series of valuation rules for assessing taxes on real property. The auditor charged that the rules were unlawful and unreasonable in setting different valuation dates for land and the improvements thereon. He also alleged that the statute under which the rules were promulgated amounted to an unconstitutional delegation of the legislative power, and that the Board's rules violated the constitutional cap on property taxes. In affirming the intermediate court's decision upholding the rules, the court held that different dates for valuing improvements and land were consistent with the legislative purpose and were reasonable and lawful. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 5715.01 was not an unconstitutional delegation of legislative authority because it contained sufficient standards for the Board's guidance in enacting subordinate rules. The Board's rules basing tax assessments on taxable values did not violate the one-percent limitation on property taxes contained in Ohio Const. art. XII, &sect;2 so long as the taxable value was uniformly applied and did not exceed the constitutional maximum.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This action originated in the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio on February 21, 1956, when The Cleveland, Columbus &amp; Cincinnati Highway, Inc., a motor transportation company, filed a petition requesting the establishment of a commercial zone for the city of Niles, Ohio, under the provisions of Section 4921.26, Revised Code.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">Appellant carrier filed a petition with appellee, the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio, requesting the establishment of a commercial zone for a certain city under the provisions of Ohio Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">On appeal, the carriers claimed that the Commission's order was arbitrary and unreasonable. The court rejected this claim and upheld the Commission's order. Contrary to the carriers' claim, the court found that under &sect; 4921.26, the Commission had authority to create a commercial zone, even in the absence of a showing and finding of public convenience and necessity. In addition, the court rejected the carriers' challenge to the reciprocity provision of the Commission's order that was made in conformity with Ohio Pub. Utilities Comm'n R. 28. The court found that reciprocity of a commercial zone made the carriers' service uniform throughout the zone, which was in the best interest of shippers and receivers of commodities. Further, such reciprocity was more equitable and fair to the carriers themselves. In addition, the court refused to address the carriers' claim that the Commission's order violated several constitutional protections because the carriers did not provide any argument or authority to support these claims.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This cause originated after the issuance of a use-tax assessment against the appellee Tri-City Broadcasting Company, an Ohio corporation, which owns and operates a television station with studios in Wheeling, West Virginia, and a transmitter at Bridgeport, Ohio.  The transmitter broadcasts over a tristate area, including Ohio, West Virginia and Pennsylvania, under a license granted by the Federal Communications Commission, and began transmitting operations on July 30, 1953.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The appellee purchased certain transmitting equipment outside Ohio to be used in the transmitter at Bridgeport.  These items, purchased between August 7, 1953, and October 27, 1954, as set forth in the stipulation, were shipped by motor freight directly from Camden, New Jersey, to Bridgeport ready for installation and were installed within one to three days after arrival at the transmitter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The appellee paid the use tax and thereafter made application for refund of the tax so paid, claiming the assessment to be unconstitutional for the reason that the items and equipment assessed are used in interstate commerce for radio and television broadcasting.</SPAN></P>

An appeal was taken to the Board of Tax Appeals, which affirmed the order of the Tax Commissioner.  Tri-City Broadcasting Company then appealed to the Court of Appeals for Belmont County, which reversed the decision of the Board of Tax Appeals, without opinion.  In the journal entry it held &quot;that the Ohio use tax levied by Section 5741.02, Revised Code, is an excise tax levied only against personal property purchased for and used principally and primarily in a taxable way; that broadcast transmitting is an interstate commerce activity; that broadcast transmitting equipment purchased by appellant Tri-City Broadcasting Company is used principally and primarily in interstate commerce; that therefore such equipment is exempted under the provisions of Section 5741.02 (C) (3), Revised Code; that to impose a use tax on the equipment would violate Article I, Section 8, clause 3 of the Constitution of the United States; that to impose a use tax on the equipment would discriminate against interstate commerce and burden such commerce in violation of Article I, Section 8, clause 3 of the Constitution of&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the United States; that therefore, appellant's broadcast transmitting equipment can not constitutionally be subjected to the use tax levied by Section 5741.02, Revised Code; and that a contrary holding would bring Section 5741.02, Revised Code, into conflict with Article I, Section 8, clause 3 of the Constitution of the United States.&quot;</SPAN></P>

The Commissioner refused to refund the tax, and the Board affirmed its decision. The lower court reversed the Board's determination.

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For their second cause of action, relators assert that on or about December 9, 1957, there was filed with respondent Board of Education of Clermont County a petition containing&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  a total of 2,320 names of voters, 2,056 being voters of the Amelia school district, 149 of the Withamsville district and 115 of the Mt. Carmel district, which petition requested the county board of education to &quot;take immediate action under the provisions of the Ohio Revised Code, R. C. 3311.26 and R. C. 3311.26 as amended and related sections, so as to create a new local school district or districts or as to dissolve a school district and return it to its original districts, Amelia, Withamsville-Tobasco and Mt. Carmel-Glen Este school district.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Relators allege that the county board &quot;failed and refused to carry out the provisions of said sections of the Revised Code of Ohio and to take such action so as to duly certify said issue for a vote in accordance with and as required by law.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For their third cause of action, relators assert that the Board of Education of West Clermont Local School District &quot;whose existence and validity is questioned&quot; on or about March 19, 1958, initiated a proposed bond issue and tax levy authorizing the issuance of bonds by such board of education for the purpose of construction of new fireproof school buildings and improvements and additions to present&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  plants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An election was held May 6, 1958, and the bond issue was approved by a vote of 2,218 for and 1,471 against, the vote in the territory formerly comprising Amelia Local School District being 580 for the issue and 762 against.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Relators in their third contention allege that the Board of Education of the West Clermont Local School District was not legally constituted to take such action and in addition &quot;that the action it took was contrary to the express provisions of R. C. 133.04, which requires that prior consent be obtained from the Department of Taxation before such question is certified for a vote and was in violation of other provisions of the Revised Code of Ohio.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Relators pray for a writ of mandamus against the Board of Education of the West Clermont Local School District and the Board of Education of Clermont County, &quot;holding and commanding said respondents (1) that the action taken in 1956 following the election held in November, 1956, and causing the reorganization and consolidation of the various school districts and the inclusion of the Amelia Local School District in said West Clermont County, Ohio School District is invalid, and that the same should be severed&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and said Amelia Local School District parted from, separated from and re-established as a school district of itself; that said respondents take such action as provided by the provisions of the several sections of the Revised Code of Ohio in order to certify for a vote of the voters and citizens of the several districts, causing the separation, dissolution and disorganization of the West Clermont County school district so as to restore each of said districts and, particularly, to release and restore the Amelia Local School District; that respondents disregard any further action on the issuance of said bonds, said action leading to the election having been contrary to and in violation of the Revised Code of Ohio; and for such other and further relief as may be proper in the premises.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Answers were filed by the respondents which contain certain admissions of the facts pleaded and denials of a general nature as to the allegations that the reorganization election and subsequent administrative acts, the refusal to act on the petition to separate Amelia Local School District from the reorganized district, and the proceedings to issue the bonds were illegal and invalid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As to the relators' &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  third cause of action, the answer of the West Clermont local board states:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Answering respondents further state by way of affirmative allegation that the matter was submitted to a popular vote at the primary election on Tuesday, May 6, 1958, that the Department of Taxation of the state of Ohio had consented to the issue and submission, as provided in Section 133.04 of the Revised Code on the 29th day of April, 1958, which consent had been received in the office of the respondent West Clermont Local School District Board of Education on Thursday the 1st day of May, 1958, prior to the date of the election, as provided by law.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Court of Appeals held that the petition is not well founded and dismissed it.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">The residents were residents of the village, which was part of the school district. The board had initiated a reorganization in which a consolidation of school districts was proposed and completed.

The appellate court dismissed the petition and the residents appealed. In affirming, the court held that the requirement in Ohio Rev.

The statute simply forbade submission of the question unless the Department of Taxation consented thereto. Accordingly, the petition was properly dismissed.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is an action in mandamus brought originally in this court by the Superior Foundry, Inc., an Ohio corporation and a contributor to the State Insurance Fund, against the Industrial Commission of Ohio and involves a challenge of certain orders made by the commission against relator with respect to a former employee of relator who contracted silicosis.  The cause is submitted upon the petition, answer and a stipulation of facts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It appears that on April 28, 1955, pursuant to his application therefor, respondent awarded compensation to Peter Bobich, a former employee of relator, after determining that he was totally disabled by the disease of silicosis contracted while in relator's employ.  Respondent found that Bobich had become disabled on August 10, 1954, some two years and ten months after the termination of his services with relator, which occurred on October 12, 1951.  Subsequently relator filed motions with respondent requesting reconsideration and disallowance of the award to Bobich or, if the award stood, an allocation of the charge against relator's account, because of such award, to the year 1951 instead of the year 1954.  Such motions were overruled, whereupon&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the present action was instituted.  In its petition relator charges respondent with a violation of Section 4123.68, Revised Code, upon the claim that such section, by its terms, excludes Bobich's disability as a compensable one.  In the alternative, the petition alleges that, if the disability is compensable, the award, when made, should have been allocated to relator's account as a 1951 award and not as a 1954 award, and that, by selecting and fixing the latter date and so charging the award against relator, respondent made an unlawful and arbitrary distinction between occupational-disease awards and awards for injuries, contrary to statute and respondent's administrative general rating rule III, with the result that relator and other employers in a similar position are subjected to unconstitutional discrimination.  </SPAN></P>

In the alternative, the petition alleged that the Commission made an unlawful and arbitrary distinction between occupational-disease awards and awards for injuries, contrary to statute and an administrative general rating rule. The court rejected the employer's contentions and denied the writ. The court held that &sect; 4123.68(W), dealing specifically with silicosis, had to be given full force and effect and, therefore, the specific provision relating to silicosis took precedence over and controls the general provisions, which had reference to occupational diseases generally. The court noted that it would not undertake to control the lawful exercise of the discretion vested in the Commission with respect to determinations covering classifications, establishment of basic rates, and merit ratings.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is an action in mandamus originating in this court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Relator is Russell Leach, City Attorney of Columbus, and respondent is Floyd C. Redick, Director of the Department of Public Service of Columbus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his petition relator alleges that the city of Columbus adopted a charter on May 5, 1914, which charter, with the amendments adopted thereafter, remains in full force and effect; that included in such charter are sections 1, 2, 3, 17, 18, 19, 20, 24, 25, 73, 97, 115, 116 and 117, copies of which are attached to the petition, marked exhibit A and made a part thereof; and that relator brings this action pursuant to Section 73 of the Charter of Columbus, which reads as follows:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In case any officer, board or commission fail to perform any duty required by law, the City Attorney shall apply to a court of competent jurisdiction for a writ of mandamus to compel the performance of such duty.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Relator says that on April 14, 1958, the Council of the City of Columbus passed ordinance No. 546-58, a copy of which is attached to the petition, marked exhibit B and made a part thereof, which authorizes and directs the Director of the Department of Public Service to execute, on&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  behalf of the city, a lease of land to the Linden Veterans' Center Association, a nonprofit organization under the laws of Ohio, which land is owned by the city and known as 2682 Cleveland Avenue, on the terms and conditions set forth in the lease agreement, the provisions of which are contained in full in the ordinance above referred to.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Relator says that on April 23, 1958, the Mayor of Columbus vetoed ordinance No. 546-58, but that such ordinance was passed over his veto on May 12, 1958.  Relator says that the lease as set forth in ordinance No. 546-58 was properly authorized and executed by the proper officials of the Linden Veterans' Center Association and was delivered to respondent on June 12, 1958, for execution by him as directed by the ordinance; that respondent, in violation of the duties specifically enjoined upon him by law, failed and refused and still fails and refuses to sign such lease; and that relator has no plain and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Relator prays that a writ of mandamus issue from this court commanding respondent to execute the lease as set forth in ordinance No. 546-58 and for all further relief to which relator may be entitled. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  To relator's petition respondent filed a general demurrer and supports such demurrer by the contentions (1) that ordinance No. 546-58 is invalid for the reasons (a) that it fails to comply or show compliance with the Ohio statutes requiring competitive bidding for a sale or lease of real property owned by a municipal corporation and (b) that it represents an unlawful interference with the administrative function and, more particularly, with the discretion given the respondent by the statutes of the state of Ohio and the Columbus Charter in his capacity as Director of Public Service of the City of Columbus; and (2) that by reason of the fact that an ordinance is not a law within the meaning of Section 73 of the Columbus Charter, as shown by the journal of the commission, no duty required by law of the respondent is involved herein and, hence, an action in mandamus will not lie.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On February 27, 1957, the Director of Highways of the State of Ohio, acting under the provisions of Section 5519.01, Revised Code, filed in the Court of Common Pleas a &quot;resolution and finding&quot; for the appropriate of certain parcels of land located in Harrison County, Ohio, needed for the construction of a public highway.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Named as the owners of the land were Charles Long, Blanche Long, and Edgar Long.  The required statutory notice was mistakenly issued first to the sheriff of Tuscarawas County for service on the three parties.  As soon as this error was discovered, it was corrected by the issuance of another notice to the sheriff of Harrison County, and personal service was obtained on Charles and Edgar Long on March 29, 1957.  As to Blanche Long, the sheriff's return read, &quot;Blanche Long of Dennison, Ohio, Route No. 1, is deceased,&quot; and subsequently the court dismissed her as a party to the proceeding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On April 10, 1957 -- </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">twelve</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> days after Charles and Edgar Long were served with the notice -- they filed their petition appealing from the findings and the amount fixed by the Director of Highways as compensation for their&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  land to be taken and the damage to the residue thereof.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thereafter the court granted a motion to dismiss the appeal for the reason that it was not filed within </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">ten</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> days as then required by Section 5519.02, Revised Code (Recodification Act of 1953).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On an appeal to the Court of Appeals on questions of law, the judgment of the Court of Common Pleas was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">Appellant landowners filed a petition challenging the amount that appellee Director of Highways of the State of Ohio fixed as compensation for their land to be appropriated for construction of a public highway. The landowners appealed the judgment of the Court of Appeals for Harrison County (Ohio), which affirmed the common pleas court's judgment dismissing their petition as untimely under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 5519.02 (1953).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">The landowners contended that the 10-day limitation for filing a petition challenging the amount of compensation fixed by the Director under &sect; 5519.02 was directory rather than mandatory and that they should have received an extension to file their petition within 12 days. The court found no merit in the contention. The landowners did not request an extension. Thus, the common pleas court's action was not erroneous even if the limitation was merely directory. Further, the summonses issued to the landowners contained the required statutory warning that there was a 10-day limit on their right of appeal. Regardless, the landowners' failure to timely file their petition and request an extension of the deadline were not their only omissions. Nearly two months elapsed before they filed their bond, even though &sect; 5519.02 required them to file it within five days after its amount was determined; and the landowners never filed a brief in opposition to the motion to dismiss their appeal, even though they were granted a continuance so that they could file a brief. Accordingly, the court concluded that the court of appeals did not err in affirming the judgment of the common pleas court.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">The Attorney General sought to oust the Commission from the exercise of all it powers conferred on it by the Act. The petition alleged that the Act was invalid because it was a law of general nature that did not have uniform operation throughout the State of Ohio and was therefore in contravention of Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 26. In the alternative, the Attorney General claimed that Act was invalid because it was a special act conferring corporate powers contrary to Ohio Const. art. XIII, &sect; 1. The Commission demurred on the ground that the law was uniform and that the corporate powers given to it were not such that would invalidate the Act. The Court of Appeals sustained the demurrer. The court found that the operation and effect of the Act was local. The court also found that the garage would have to be a parking garage open to the general public and competitive in every respect with existing commercial parking facilities in order to accumulate sufficient revenue to repay the bondholders for money advanced to construct it.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant, Joseph Betts, appellee herein, by affidavit filed in the Cleveland Municipal Court was charged with the violation of Section 11.2314 of the Codified Ordinances of the City of Cleveland, which, so far as it affects the instant case, provides:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Whoever carries a pistol, revolver, bowie knife, dirk or other dangerous weapon concealed on or about his person, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and upon conviction thereof shall be fined not less than $ 200 nor more than $ 500, and imprisoned not less than three months nor more than six months * * *.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It appears from the evidence that in the early morning of July 9, 1957, Betts, a private citizen, was driving his automobile on the streets of the city of Cleveland and was stopped by the police who found a loaded pistol in the locked glove compartment of his car.  He entered a plea of not guilty to the charge, was tried, found guilty and sentenced.  (See </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Porello </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">v.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8"> State</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 121 Ohio St., 280, 168 N.

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An appeal on questions of law was thereupon taken to the Court of Appeals, which found, according to its judgment&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  entry, &quot;that the ordinance under which this defendant was charged, namely, Section 11.2314 of the Codified Ordinances of the City of Cleveland, is in direct conflict with the Revised Code of Ohio, Section 2923.01, defining the crime of carrying concealed weapons.  Therefore, the ordinance being unconstitutional as a result of such conflict, the court finds that the Municipal Court of Cleveland is without jurisdiction to entertain the action.  The judgment imposing sentence on the defendant is reversed and set aside and ordered held for naught and the case remanded with instructions to discharge the defendant on the affidavit filed in this case.  Further, the case is remanded to the Cleveland Municipal Court with instructions to institute further proceedings under the proper statute as provided by law.&quot;</SPAN></P>

Defendant sought review of the judgment of the Court of Appeals for Cuyahoga County (Ohio), which found that &sect; 11.2314 of the Codified Ordinances of the City of Cleveland was unconstitutional, reversed and set aside the judgment imposing sentence, and remanded the action to discharge defendant.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">Section 11.2314 of the Codified Ordinances of the City of Cleveland provided that whoever carried a dangerous weapon concealed on or about his person was guilty of a misdemeanor and upon conviction would be fined not less than $ 200 nor more than $ 500 and imprisoned not less than three months nor more than six months. The issue to be decided was whether a municipality, under the police power given it by Ohio Const. art. XVIII, &sect; 3, could validly enact and enforce an ordinance prohibiting the carrying of concealed weapons and making the violation thereof a misdemeanor, in face of a statute covering the same subject and providing that a convicted offender might be sentence to the penitentiary. Where the punishment could be imprisonment in the penitentiary, the offense was a felony. The court affirmed the judgment. The court reasoned that, although the ordinance in issue did not permit what the Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2923.01 prohibited, and vice versa, it contravened the expressed policy of the state with respect to crimes by deliberately changing an act which constituted a felony under state law into a misdemeanor, and this created and unconstitutional conflict.</SPAN></P>

It refused to pay the tax on the ground that the effect of the tax as administered was discriminatory and thus unconstitutional. The Board affirmed the assessment, and the appellate court affirmed the Board's decision. The taxpayer argued that its equal protection guarantees were violated by the administrative classification of motor vehicle common carriers according to state residency, namely, requiring the Ohio highway use tax to be paid by carriers domiciled in Ohio but not by those domiciled in Michigan or Indiana. The Commissioner argued that residency was not the only test but that a second was the place of maintenance and registry of vehicles.

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On March 20, 1957, one Earl Taylor was served by a police officer with an instrument, captioned &quot;Affidavit and Warrant,&quot; issued out of the Dayton Municipal Court.  The affidavit, sworn to and signed by one George Cooper on March 19, states that &quot;on or about the 12 day of March A. D. 1957 * * * Earl Taylor being the owner of premises located at 130 Henry Street, did unlawfully refuse to permit a duly authorized agent of the Division of Housing Inspection of the City of Dayton, to enter and survey the said premises for the purposes of repairs or alteration as are necessary to comply with the provisions of minimum housing standards contrary to the form of the ordinances to wit: Section 806.30 of Dayton, Ohio * * *.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It appears from the record that Taylor had previously received a notice from the office of the Prosecutor in the criminal division of the Dayton Municipal Court, dated March 12, notifying him to appear at that office on March 19, 1957, to answer a complaint made against him for refusing entry for housing inspection, to which notice Taylor did not respond.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When served with the affidavit and warrant he was not physically&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  placed under arrest but was ordered to appear in Municipal Court on March 26.  On that day he appeared in court, entered a plea of not guilty and, bond having been fixed in the sum of $ 1,000, was placed in the city jail.  Late in the afternoon of the same day a writ of habeas corpus was sought in the Common Pleas Court of Montgomery County against the Chief of Police of Dayton on the application of Arthur T. Eaton to produce the body of Taylor, at which time he was released on his own recognizance by order of the court, and the matter was set for hearing on April 8.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Following the hearing, the writ was allowed on May 26, 1957, and Taylor was discharged from custody, the court finding in its entry that &quot;Section 806.30 of the Code of General Ordinances of the City of Dayton, Ohio, being ordinance No. 18099 * * * is unconstitutional as it applies to the facts in this case as violative of the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States and Article I, Section 14 of the Constitution of the state of Ohio.&quot;</SPAN></P>

The appellate court reversed and the attorney appealed. The supreme court noted first that the case should not have been brought in the relation of the state and the client, not the attorney, should have been designated as the party in interest. In affirming, the court ruled that the Fourth Amendment applied only to the federal government and not the states and the housing inspection ordinance did not violate the similar prohibition against unreasonable searches under Ohio Const. art.

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This case involves the 1957 tax return of the appellant, The Second Federal Savings &amp; Loan Association of Cleveland, an incorporated financial institution without shares of capital stock.  In making its return for 1957, the appellant listed no taxable amount for book value of capital employed, for the reason that the federal securities held by it exceeded the value of the capital employed.  The only matter in issue is the tax of $ 19,730 assessed against the &quot;ownership interests of the depositors,&quot; upon the basis of the surplus or reserve and undivided profits without deduction of federal securities owned by the appellant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The appellant filed an application for review and redetermination, contending that the statutory provisions under which ownership interests of depositors were assessed are unconstitutional.  The Tax Commissioner found that he was without authority to pass on the question of the constitutionality of the statutes involved; that as an administrative official he must proceed in accord with the statutory provisions; and that the assessment was correct.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The confirmance of the assessment by the Tax Commissioner was made pursuant&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to certain statutory provisions relative to the taxation of shares of, and capital employed by, financial institutions, contained in an act (126 Ohio Laws, pt. 2, 12) amending, among others, Sections 5709.02, 5719.09, 5719.10, 5725.04 and 5725.07, Revised Code.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On appeal, the Board of Tax Appeals held that it was without authority to declare a statute unconstitutional, considered all applicable sections of the Revised Code to be constitutional, and affirmed the order of the Tax Commissioner.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The petitioner, Latham, appellant herein, on his plea of guilty to two counts of an indictment charging sodomy, was ordered committed to the Lima State Hospital for observation as provided in Section 2947.25, Revised Code.  Thereafter, petitioner was returned to court, and, upon consideration of a report of the superintendent of the hospital and other evidence, the court found him to be psychotic and sentenced him to the Ohio Penitentiary.  Under the provisions of Section 2947.25, Revised Code, sentence was suspended, and petitioner was committed indefinitely to Lima State Hospital.

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">APPEAL from the Court of Appeals for Cuyahoga County.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">APPEALS from the Court of Appeals for Butler County.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the several causes now here for review the defendants, storekeepers and one clerk, were charged with and convicted in various Municipal Courts of violating Section 3773.24, Revised Code, commonly known as the Sunday closing law or blue law, and all the convictions were affirmed on appeal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Causes Nos. 35215 and 35216 originated in the Cincinnati Municipal Court.  Defendant Kidd was a co-owner and operator of a self-serve food market in the city of Cincinnati, and defendant Mills was clerk at the check-out counter in such store.  Purchases consisting of groceries, soap, an electric iron and insect spray were made in the store on a Sunday afternoon by police officers, who then advised Kidd and Mills that they were being cited to court -- Kidd for opening and conducting a business on Sunday and Mills for engaging in common labor on that day.  Affidavits were subsequently filed against the two.  The cases were tried concurrently, and some of the evidence introduced is to the effect that the store was located in a neighborhood&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  inhabited and frequented by those who lacked facilities for storing and preserving food.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cause No. 35233 originated in the Cleveland Municipal Court.  Leff, the defendant, was president of the Three Bears Super Stores, Inc., an Ohio corporation, engaged in a number of stores in selling a variety of products.  The store here involved was opened on a Sunday, sales of flashlight bulbs were made and prosecution followed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Causes Nos. 35317 and 35318 had their inception in the Hamilton Municipal Court.  One of the affidavits charges the defendant, Ullner, with opening or causing to be opened a building for the transaction of business on Sunday, and the other charges him with requiring a person (his employee) to engage in common labor on Sunday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Causes Nos. 35215 and 35216 were appealed on questions of law from the Municipal Court to the Court of Appeals for Hamilton County.  Cause No. 35233 went from the Municipal Court to the Court of Appeals for Cuyahoga County.  Causes Nos. 35317 and 35318 went from the Municipal Court to the Court of Common Pleas of Butler County and from there to the Court of Appeals for that county.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In all causes, the Courts of Appeals affirmed the judgments of&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the lower courts.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 3773.24.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">Defendants were two co-owners of a self-serve food market and one clerk at the market's counter. Purchases consisting of groceries, soap, an electric iron and insect spray were made in the store on a Sunday afternoon by police officers, who then advised two of them that they would be cited for opening and conducting a business on Sunday in violation of &sect; 3773.24. All three defendants were convicted. On appeal, they challenged the constitutionality and validity of &sect; 3773.24. The court found that &sect; 3773.24 did not interfere and was not designed to interfere with the freedom of religious worship or the free exercise of religious beliefs. Furthermore, the court did not find any reason to overturn the trial court's finding that none of the three defendants showed their work to be of necessity on the day in question. Moreover, the court ruled that whether the Sunday Closing Law was outmoded, obsolete, and unrealistic and should be eradicated was essentially a legislative and not a judicial problem.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the trial court was in error in admitting the questioned evidence and in permitting the jury to determine the lessee's compensation for the leasehold interest as a separate item in the total compensation for the land and building taken. Further, the court held that it was unable to construe the unambiguous mandatory provision in Ohio Rev.

II, &sect; 26 and that it was so confused, vague, unworkable, and discriminatory that it amounted to no effective legislation and was void. Under such circumstances, it followed that the former &sect; 305.01 was in effect, and that there was but one county commissioner to be elected for a full term in each of all the state's counties in the general election in November 1958. Because of the enactment of the new law, many persons of both parties had filed nominations, and it was only fair and logical that the candidate be given a chance to run in the election. Because of its decision, the court treated as surplusage the reference to a term in the candidate's petition.</SPAN></P>

On March 25, 1957, a petition was filed with the Board of Elections of Cuyahoga County, an appellee herein, for the detachment of a certain portion of the village of Beachwood, appellant herein, and the formation of this territory into a new township under the provisions of Section 709.39, Revised Code.  The board of elections having determined that such petition complied with the provisions of the statute relating to detachment ordered an election to be held on April 30, 1957.  Thereupon the village instituted this action seeking to enjoin the election, on the theory that the petition for detachment and the proceeding thereunder were null and void for the reason that the petitioners had failed to comply with the charter provisions of the village of Beachwood relating to detachment of territory but instead had brought such proceeding under the general statutes of the state.  The village's basic contention is that detachment proceedings are matters of local self-government under the home-rule provisions of Article XVIII of the Ohio Constitution, and that the charter provisions relating&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to detachment supersede the general statutory provisions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Court of Common Pleas denied the injunction, and upon appeal to the Court of Appeals the judgment of the Court of Common Pleas was affirmed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cause is before this court on an appeal as of right and pursuant to the allowance of a motion to certify the record.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">Appellant village challenged a judgment of the Court of Appeals for Cuyahoga County (Ohio), which affirmed the decision of the trial court, denying an injunction against appellee county board of elections to enjoin the election for the detachment of a certain portion of the village.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">A petition was filed with the Board for the detachment of a certain portion of the village and the formation of this territory into a new township under Ohio Rev. Code &sect; 709.39. The Board ordered an election to be held. The village sought to enjoin the election on the theory that the petition and the proceeding were null and void for the reason that the petitioners failed to comply with the charter provisions of the village relating to detachment of territory but instead had brought such proceeding under the general statutes of the state. The village's contention was that detachment proceedings were matters of local self-government under the home-rule provisions of Ohio Const. art. XVIII and that the charter provisions relating to detachment superseded the general statutory provisions. The trial court denied the injunction, which was affirmed on appeal. The court held that the detachment of the territory from the township was not a subject which fell within the sphere of local self-government, but was a matter which required the establishment of a uniform procedure throughout the state and was exclusively within the control of the general assembly.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ON CERTIFIED REPORT by the Board of Commissioners on Grievances and Discipline.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The present cause is before this court upon objections to the final report of the Board of Commissioners on Grievances and Discipline, including its findings of fact and recommendations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This court, having determined to exercise more fully original disciplinary powers over the Bar of this state and the members thereof, amended its Rule XXVII, effective January 1, 1957.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under such amendment, the Board of Commissioners on Grievances and Discipline is set up, empowered and charged to receive, entertain, inquire into, take proofs, make findings, and submit recommendations to this court concerning complaints of misconduct of attorneys and concerning petitions for reinstatement as attorney.  Such board is empowered to investigate upon its own motion and refer any matters to a grievance committee of an appropriate local bar association or to the Committee on Legal Ethics and Professional Conduct of the Ohio State Bar Association.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The commissioners are appointed by this court, one from each of 17 districts.  The board has exclusive jurisdiction concerning the investigation of complaints and grievances as to&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  attorneys and judges, and all proceedings for reinstatement of an attorney, although nothing is to be construed to prevent any committee of a regularly organized bar association or the Ohio State Bar Association from investigating and reporting on any complaint filed with either of them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rule defines misconduct as a violation of the oath of office taken upon admission to practice law, or as any violation of the Canons of Professional Ethics or the Canons of Judicial Ethics as adopted by this court from time to time, or as the commission of or conviction for a crime involving moral turpitude.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The following four grades of discipline are established:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(a) A permanent disbarment from the practice of law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(b) Suspension for an indefinite period from the practice of law, subject to reinstatement upon certain conditions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(c) A public reprimand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(d) A private reprimand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rule sets forth the manner of making a complaint and the duty of the board upon the filing of the complaint as to notice to respondent and time for answer, provides for a hearing of the complaint by a panel of three commissioners, no one of whom shall be a resident of the district from which the complaint originated, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and sets forth the power of the panel to dismiss the complaint if found without merit or to administer a private reprimand.  If the panel finds that a more severe disciplinary action is merited, it shall make a certified report, including its findings and recommendations, to the board of commissioners, which must review such findings, and, if the board finds that a public reprimand, suspension or disbarment is merited, the board shall make a final certified report of its proceedings, including its findings of fact and recommendations, and shall file the same, together with the transcript of testimony taken, with the clerk of this court.  The rule then provides for the filing of objections to the report of the board by the one against whom the charges have been filed and for a review and final order in respect thereto by this court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rule provides further that all proceedings shall be private until filed in this court, unless the one against whom the charges are made shall request in writing that they be public.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rule provides in detail for petitions for reinstatement and proceedings incident thereto, which provisions are not of importance in the present case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The present case&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  originated by the filing of charges by the Cleveland Bar Association against Henry H. Pleasant, and, after the matter was considered by the Board of Commissioners on Grievances and Discipline, that board made findings of fact and recommendations, as follows:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This matter came on for consideration before the Board of Commissioners on Grievances and Discipline on the pleadings, the evidence, the exhibits, on the briefs of counsel, and on the transcript of the proceedings before the hearing panel.  Said board of commissioners hereby makes the following findings of fact:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;1. The respondent, Henry H. Pleasant, on February 19, 1949, was duly appointed by the Probate Court of Cuyahoga County as administrator of the estate of William A. Wright, deceased.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;2. The respondent also acted as attorney for the estate of William A. Wright, deceased.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;3. The respondent also represented, as attorney, one of the claimants, William Wright, who was later determined by the court to be the sole heir of the estate of William A. Wright, deceased.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;4. The respondent represented the claimant, William Wright, as attorney, from on or about the 15th day of March 1949, until the termination of said estate. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;5. The respondent at no time made full and complete disclosure to the judge or any officer of the Probate Court of Cuyahoga County of his representation of William Wright, claimant or sole heir of said estate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;6. The respondent made a fee arrangement on a percentage basis with William Wright for a share of his recovery from the estate of William A. Wright, deceased, as evidenced by a written contract dated September 20, 1949, of which no disclosure was made.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;7. The respondent, as a result of his conduct with reference to said estate, was, as a matter of record, found guilty of perpetrating a fraud on the Probate Court of Cuyahoga County, which finding remains unreversed and unmodified.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;8. The respondent violated the statutory requirements provided for in Section 10509-193, Ohio General Code ( Section 2113.36, Ohio Revised Code), relative to the further allowance of counsel fees to be charged against an estate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;9. The respondent violated the established practice in the Probate Court of Cuyahoga County relative to the procedure pertaining to the allowance of counsel fees to be charged against an estate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;10. It is therefore the determination of the board of commissioners that&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the respondent, Henry H. Pleasant, has violated Section 5 of Rule XXVII on disciplinary procedure of the Supreme Court of Ohio.  The respondent is guilty of misconduct in that he violated his oath of office and the Canons of Professional Ethics, more particularly sections 6, 29, 32, and 38 of said canons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;RECOMMENDATION</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Board of Commissioners on Grievances and Discipline hereby recommends that the respondent, Henry H. Pleasant, be suspended from the practice of law for an indefinite period.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Henry H. Pleasant was admitted to the Bar of the state of Ohio in 1931 and has been practicing law ever since that date, except that in 1941 he was suspended from practice for eight months by the Common Pleas Court of Cuyahoga County.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1949, much of Pleasant's practice consisted of Probate Court work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On February 16, 1949, one William A. Wright, whom Pleasant had known since 1944 but had never represented, died intestate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Bessie Hansen called Pleasant to come to a funeral home, which he did, taking with him an application for the appointment of an administrator.  Upon arrival at the funeral home, he met Hansen and two others who claimed to be second cousins of the deceased.  Pleasant&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  had never before known these people and took it for granted that they were second cousins.  These second cousins requested Pleasant that he be appointed administrator, they signed waivers on the application for appointment, and, on February 19, Pleasant obtained such appointment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On February 20, Pleasant and the second cousins went to the deceased's house to search for a possible will, bankbooks, or papers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shortly thereafter, a woman by the name of Helen Pavloski came to Pleasant's office and claimed to have been the commonlaw wife of the deceased, and a few days later she returned with a young man whom she claimed was her son by the deceased.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pleasant told her he would not recognize her claim and if she wished to press the matter she would have to obtain a lawyer and have the court decide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On February 22, Pleasant prepared a petition to determine heirship, an application to determine succession tax, and a petition to sell real estate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About two months after Pleasant's appointment as administrator, William Wright came to Pleasant's office and claimed to be a friend of the family.  About 10 days later, Wright returned and claimed to be a first cousin of the deceased.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This happened&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  between March 10 and 15.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The petition to determine heirship was not filed until March 21, 1949.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pleasant did not advise Wright to obtain a lawyer to represent him as he had done with reference to Pavloski.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pleasant wrote letters to England and elsewhere and eventually obtained a birth certificate on May 15, 1949, establishing that William Wright was the first cousin of the deceased.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On May 24, 1949, Pleasant amended his petition to determine heirship by adding, in longhand, the following, &quot;Unknown heirs, devisees, legatees, administrators, executors of William A. Wright, deceased, and Agnes Boltz,&quot; and in addition the following was written, &quot;William Wright, new party deft.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The petition to sell real estate, which was prepared on February 22, 1949, but not filed until March 22, 1949, failed to set forth the claim and interest of William Wright as first cousin, but was amended May 24, 1949, by adding &quot;William Wright, new defendant.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On June 3, 1949, there was a hearing on the petition to determine heirship, at which time William Wright was found to be the sole heir, and the real estate was ordered sold.  On the same date, in Pleasant's office, William Wright discussed with him&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***9]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  a new claim made by Pavloski for alleged services.  Such claim had been filed on May 19, and, although Pleasant denied that he agreed to act as Wright's individual attorney, apparently, according to testimony Pleasant gave in a previous hearing, he had agreed to be Wright's lawyer with reference to the Pavloski claim.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On September 20, 1949, Pleasant and Wright signed an agreement, which stated that Wright </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">had</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> retained and employed Pleasant to act for and on his behalf in various legal matters pertaining to the estate of the deceased, and that Wright </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">had</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> agreed to pay Pleasant 40 per cent of whatever sums Wright might receive from the estate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Based upon the wording of the agreement, an inference can be drawn that it was simply a written memorandum of an agreement entered into long before, and such inference, of course, is strengthened by the fact that, although Wright had told Pleasant before March 15 that he was a first cousin of the deceased, and the petition to determine heirship was filed on March 24, Wright was not made a defendant in such petition until May 24.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The final account filed in the administration of the estate shows administrator's fees of $ 235, and that&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***10]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  William Wright was paid $ 3,612.10.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The final account was prepared on September 20, 1949, and, on September 21, Pleasant and Wright went to the Second Federal Savings &amp; Loan, whereupon Wright was given a check for $ 3,612.10, Pleasant being designated as the maker.  The check was approved by an officer of the Second Federal Savings &amp; Loan, and then two checks were issued, one to Pleasant for $ 1,444.84, being 40 per cent of $ 3,612.10, and the other to Wright for the balance of $ 2,167.26, or 60 per cent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The final account does not show that Pleasant received 40 per cent of the estate, nor was it ever brought to the court's attention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a result of the proceedings in the settlement of the estate, the Probate Court of Cuyahoga County found that Pleasant had perpetrated fraud upon it, and he was held in contempt.  The matter finally reached this court in the case of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In re Estate of Wright</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 165 Ohio St., 15, 133 N. E. (2d), 350, where this court held in the syllabus as follows:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;1. It is a fundamental principle of law that, where parties having different interests are involved, no lawyer can represent or receive compensation from such parties without a full disclosure, to all&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***11]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the parties involved, of his dual representation and the arrangements as to the compensation to be received therefrom.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;2. Where an attorney is administrator of an estate and is likewise acting as attorney in such administration, in the absence of a full disclosure concerning an arrangement for compensation from a claimant against the estate and the consent of all interested parties, he impliedly represents that he has no such arrangement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;3. Where an attorney, who is administrator of an estate, enters into a contract with a claimant against such estate for a percentage of the proceeds which such claimant may receive from the estate, makes no disclosure of such arrangement to the Probate Court in whose jurisdiction such estate is being administered, and such court proceeds to confirm the final account of such administrator, which it probably would not have done had it known of the arrangement, such administrator thereby perpetrates a fraud upon the court, for which the order confirming the final account may be vacated and which may constitute a direct contempt upon the court punishable under Section 2705.01, Revised Code.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pleasant has presented four objections to the finding of&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***12]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the Board of Commissioners on Grievances and Discipline:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;1. This entire procedure, it is humbly suggested, is based upon an erroneous assumption that respondent occupied an adverse position and represented adverse and conflicting interests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;2. The panel, and all of the courts that have had anything to do with this matter, assumed the existence of a rule in the Probate Court of Cuyahoga County, which rule in fact did not exist.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;3. The respondent was not afforded a fair legal hearing before the panel inasmuch as he was not advised of the charges he was called upon to answer and certain requests and motions made by the respondent were never acted upon by the panel before, during, or after the hearing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;4. The entire proceeding before the panel, as well as the rule of this court under which the proceeding was brought and conducted, is unconstitutional.&quot; </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><BR><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">DISPOSITION:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Report confirmed and judgment accordingly</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.  <BR></SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">Respondent attorney filed objections to the complaint of relator bar association and the report and recommendation of the Ohio Board of Commissioners on Grievances and Discipline, which found that he had perpetrated a fraud on a court with regard to a probate proceedings and recommended his indefinite suspension from the practice of law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">The attorney was appointed administrator of a deceased's estate and thereafter undertook representation of one of the heirs with regard to his claims against the estate. The heir received the assets of the estate and paid the attorney a 40 percent fee. The attorney never advised the other potential heirs or the probate court of his duel representation and was thereafter found guilty of committing a fraud on the probate court. The bar association filed a grievance against the attorney, and the board recommended his indefinite suspension. The attorney objected to the report and recommendation, and the court confirmed the report. The attorney's actions in representing the estate and an heir created a conflict of interest that was required to be disclosed to the probate court and other potential heirs. The fee for the attorney's services to the estate was required to be approved by the probate court pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2113.36 and the private agreement with the heir circumvented the statute. Finally, the court had the power under the rules of court and Ohio Const. art. IV, &sect; 1 to disbar the attorney, and the rules of the court were not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">The court confirmed the report and recommendation of the board and suspended the attorney from the practice of law for an indefinite period.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">A pipe line company had, at its own expense, laid down and extended mains and water pipes to its compressor station about four miles beyond the city's limits. By resolution, the city authorized the proper officer of the waterworks to superintend or supervise such laying and extension. Relator, a property owner who lived outside the city on the extended line, sought a writ of mandamus to compel the city to allow her to tap into the water line and have the city furnish her with water pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 743.13. The appeals court denied the writ by finding that &sect; 743.13 was unconstitutional. On appeal, the court affirmed the denial of the writ by holding that &sect; 743.13&nbsp;unconstitutionally imposed limitations and restrictions on the power conferred on a municipality by Ohio Const. art. XVII, &sect; 6 by requiring the municipality to furnish water to non-inhabitants, whether or not the city was willing and able to do so, but also by limiting the price which it could charge for such water. To the extent that &sect; 743.13 did limit and restrict the city's power to sell and deliver to non-inhabitants its surplus product, &sect; 743.13 conflicted with Ohio Const. art.

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This cause involves a part of the Ohio Fair Trade Act (Section 1333.05 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">et seq.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, Revised Code) and originated in the Court of Common Pleas of Lake County in November of 1954, when the Union Carbide &amp; Carbon Corporation, plaintiff and the appellee herein, sought an injunction against Bargain Fair, Inc., and Mentor Brands, Inc., defendants and the appellants herein, to restrain them from selling at a price less than the minimum resale price set by plaintiff under the Ohio Fair Trade Act an antifreeze solution for the radiators of motor vehicles, bearing the trade or brand name of Prestone and produced by the plaintiff.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A general demurrer to the amended petition was filed and overruled, whereupon, after the filing of an answer, the cause was tried on its merits, and the court issued a permanent injunction against defendants in conformity with the prayer of the amended petition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thereafter, the cause was appealed on questions of law and fact to the Court of Appeals, which court likewise granted a permanent injunction against the defendants, almost identical in context to the one secured in the court below.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">Defendant retailers challenged an order from the Court of Appeals for Lake County (Ohio), which enjoined them from selling a certain antifreeze solution at certain at prices less than the plaintiff manufacturer's minimum resale price as provided for in the manufacturer's agreements with the brand name antifreeze solution and dealers in Ohio. The retailers challenged the validity of &sect; 1333.07.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">The manufacturer sought an injunction against two retailers to restrain them from selling at a price less than the minimum resale price set by the manufacturer under the Ohio Fair Trade Act (Act), specifically at Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 1333.07, for the antifreeze solution for the radiators of motor vehicles, bearing a certain trade or brand name and produced by the manufacturer. The trial court tried the case on its merits and issued a permanent injunction against the retailers in conformity with the manufacturer's prayer. The retailers had purchased it at a certain undisclosed price and were selling it to customers, &quot;over the counter&quot; and without additional service, at a price lower than that for which the manufacturer had contracted. The retailers challenged the validity of &sect; 1333.07. The court concluded that &sect; 1333.07, which prohibited those who were not parties to the stipulated-price contract from selling trademarked items at a price lower than that stipulated by the manufacturer, was unreasonable and unenforceable and constituted an unauthorized exercise of the police power in that there was no substantial relation to the public safety, morals or general welfare.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">The court reversed the judgment of the appellate court below and remanded the cause to that court with instructions to dissolve the injunction issued, having found in favor of the retailers, that the statutory provisions of the Act were unenforceable.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  APPEALS from the Court of Appeals for Franklin County.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These two actions for declaratory judgment and injunction were heard together by the Common Pleas Court of Franklin County under a stipulation that any evidence competent in one case should be competent in the other, and that the validity of three ordinances of the city of Columbus should be treated as being involved in each case.  The plaintiffs in both cases, herein referred to as plaintiffs, have for varying numbers of years owned and operated in Columbus varying numbers of pin-game machines having very substantial values.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The three ordinances, the validity of which are questioned and which are now incorporated in the Code of the City of Columbus, are ordinance No. 156-53, relative to licensing of mechanical amusement devices but containing some provisions relative to seizure of machines tending to encourage gambling, ordinance No. 157-53, relative to gambling but containing some provisions declaring as a nuisance the exhibition for the purpose of operation of machines merely tending to encourage gambling and authorizing their seizure, and ordinance No. 1615-54 which reads so far as pertinent:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Section 29.69-1.  * * * Whoever&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  shall within the city have in his possession, or in his custody or under his control any table game or device commonly known as a 'pin game,' 'pin-ball game,' or 'marble game,' the operation, use or play of which is controlled by placing therein any coin, plate, disk, plug, key or other token, or by the payment of a fee, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor * * *.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the preamble to the ordinance enacting that section of the Code of the City of Columbus, it is stated in part:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Whereas, the operation of pin-ball machines and similar machines involving chance or skill or reward encourages gaming and the general disorder incident thereto, and is a threat or menace to the peace and morals of the community; and,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Whereas, even the so-called amusement-only pin-ball machines are so constructed as to be almost identical in appearance and operation to certain gambling devices, per se; and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Whereas, even the vast majority of such so-called amusement-only devices are readily convertible to gambling devices; and,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Whereas, the operation of even amusement-only pin-ball machines has become and now constitutes a nuisance in that it encourages a false sense of values, idling, and loitering * * *.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  This latter ordinance was enacted in December 1954, immediately after the Court of Appeals in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Ferguson </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">v.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8"> City of Columbus</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 70 Ohio Law Abs., 277, 128 N. E. (2d), 198, had cast doubt upon the effectiveness of the two earlier ordinances in discouraging the ownership or exhibition of machines which, although not gambling devices per se or shown to have been used for gambling, either tended to encourage gambling, were adapted for gambling, might readily be converted to be so adapted, or registered odds or a score.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Common Pleas Court determined that all these ordinances are &quot;invalid, unconstitutional and void, insofar as they prohibit the ownership, possession, custody, control and operation of pin games for amusement purposes only&quot; and decreed that defendants should be enjoined from interfering under these ordinances &quot;with the ownership, possession, custody, control and operation of said pin games by * * * plaintiffs * * * as well as interfering with or molesting any merchant with whom said plaintiffs have either heretofore had, or may now or hereafter have, contracts for the operation of said games, so long as said games are not used for gambling.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Benjamin </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">v.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8"> City</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8"> of Columbus</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 73 Ohio Law Abs., 143, 136 N. E. (2d), 641.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On appeal to the Court of Appeals on questions of law and fact, that court determined that the three ordinances are valid and that plaintiffs were &quot;not entitled to an injunction restraining the enforcement of said ordinances&quot; and dismissed the petitions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These two causes are now before this court on appeal from the judgments of the Court of Appeals, both as appeals involving constitutional questions and pursuant to allowances of motions to certify the records.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">Plaintiffs, in two separate cases, brought an action for declaratory judgment and injunction, seeking to have the ordinances held invalid. The cases were consolidated and the trial court found in plaintiffs' favor. Defendants appealed and the appellate court reversed the decision of the trial court. Plaintiffs appealed and the court concentrated its attention on Columbus, Ohio, Code &sect; 29.69-1 (1954), disagreeing with plaintiffs' contention that, although the city had power to make regulations with respect to pin-game machines, it had no power to prohibit them. The court also disagreed that the ordinance was arbitrary and unreasonable and took plaintiffs' property without due process. The court held that the breadth of the prohibition of possession of the machines had a reasonable basis and could reasonably have been determined by the city to bear a real and substantial relationship to the health, morals, safety, and welfare of the people of the city. The court concluded that the allegations of plaintiffs' petitions and the provisions of &sect; 29.69-1 required the dismissal of the petitions and declined to rule on the validity of the other ordinances.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  APPEAL from the Court of Appeals for Hamilton County.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is an appeal on questions of law from a judgment of the Court of Appeals for Hamilton County, modifying and affirming a declaratory judgment of the Court of Common Pleas of that county that the &quot;Hamilton County District Board of Health has the right, power and duty to enact reasonable rules and regulations to provide for licensing and registration of plumbers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The parties will be referred to as they appeared in the Court of Common Pleas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plaintiffs Wetterer, Kellogg, Gerde and Nordeman have worked at the pipe-fitting trade, including the installation of pipe fixtures and other apparatus for processing industrial waste products, for varying periods of years ranging from 11 to 27, and at the time this action was begun they were so employed in the construction of certain additional test facilities for the completion of the manufacture of jet engines on the premises of the General Electric Company, at Lockland, Ohio.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The other plaintiffs are the Journeymen Pipe Fitters' Local Union No. 392 of the United Association of Journeymen and Apprentices of the Plumbing and Pipe Fitting Industry of the United States and Canada, A. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  F. of L., and James P. Maher, individually and as an officer and member of said union.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defendants are the Hamilton County Board of Health, herein called defendant, and E. J. Nolan Corporation, the subcontracting company engaged by the General Electric Company to construct a part of the test cells, which corporation filed no answer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The facts are undisputed and may be summarized as follows:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The plans and specifications of the proposed test facilities were submitted to the Hamilton County Board of Health for approval and permit.  A building permit was issued and work begun.  The plumbing inspector of the Hamilton County Board of Health designated the piping work as plumbing, in accordance with the definition thereof in the &quot;Rules and Regulations for Installation and Inspection of Plumbing within the Hamilton County General Health District,&quot; adopted by the Hamilton County Board of Health in 1951 and amended in 1953.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 1953 amendment provided for a Board of Plumbing Examiners authorized to examine and license master and journeyman plumbers and provided that &quot;all plumbing and private sewer disposal installations, repairs and replacements within the * * * district&quot; were to be made&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  by a certified licensed master plumber licensed by the Hamilton County Health Department.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By the standards of eligibility fixed by the Board of Plumbing Examiners, the plaintiffs were ineligible for examination as journeyman plumbers and therefore forbidden to perform jobs and work which admittedly they have performed capably and competently for many years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The plaintiffs claim that the board of health &quot;has no authority whatsoever to license persons to perform plumbing work&quot; or &quot;to require licenses of persons performing plumbing work within the Hamliton County General Health District,&quot; and pray for an order restraining the Hamilton County Board of Health from enforcing said regulations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A temporary restraining order was issued by the Court of Common Pleas, and when the matter was heard on the merits the court made this finding:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;1. The legislation creating the health districts in Ohio is a valid exercise of legislative power;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;2. The Hamilton County District Board of Health has the right, power and duty to enact reasonable rules and regulations to provide for licensing and registration of plumbers;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;3. The Hamilton County Board of Health exceeded its authority when it created&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and delegated to the Board of Examiners of Plumbers powers and duties restricted to the board of health and the actions of the board of examiners are a nullity;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;4. The prerequisites for eligibility to take an examination for plumbers' license are not shown to be an unreasonable exercise of discretion by the board of health;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;5. The rules and regulations set forth in sections 1 and 2, which restrict to plumbers only work in connection with plumbing which does not have a reasonable relation to the health and general welfare of the public are invalid.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The restraining order was made permanent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An appeal was prosecuted to the Court of Appeals, which court affirmed the judgment of the Court of Common Pleas, with the modification that &quot;there is a requirement that reasonable standards be set up by which the eligibility for license as a plumber might be ascertained by those seeking such a license, with standards for examination.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cause is before this court upon the allowance of a motion to certify the record and on appeal as of right.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">Plaintiffs, pipe fitters and a pipe fitters' local union, appealed from the judgment of the Court of Appeals for Hamilton County (Ohio) that held that defendant board of health had the right, power, and duty to enact reasonable standards by which the eligibility for license as a plumber could be ascertained.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">Plaintiffs filed a declaratory judgment action, asserting that the board of health had no authority to license persons to perform plumbing work and praying for an order restraining it from enforcing its regulations to that effect. The action arose after plaintiffs were declared ineligible to perform certain piping work on a project in which the board of health was the subcontractor. The court of common pleas declared that the board of health had the right, power, and duty to enact reasonable rules and regulations to provide for licensing and registration of plumbers. The court of appeals affirmed, but modified the judgment by stating that reasonable standards had to be set up by which the eligibility for license as a plumber might be ascertained. The court reversed, holding that there was neither express, nor implied power in a board of health of a general health district to enact rules and regulations providing for the licensing of plumbers, and that the board of health was a creature of statute and had such powers only as were expressly conferred on it, together with such powers as were necessarily implied in order to effectuate such expressly granted powers.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The class A-2, B-4 and B-5 permits of appellant herein were suspended by order of the Board of Liquor Control, appellee herein, pursuant to a hearing by said board and a finding that appellant was guilty of specified violations of a certain regulation adopted by the board and fixing minimum prices at which bottled wine might be sold in the state of Ohio.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The regulation of the board which the appellant was found to have violated is Section 1, Article VII of Regulation 3, which article is in part as follows:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This article is promulgated pursuant to the provisions of Section 6064-3</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">a</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> of the General Code [Section 4301.13, Revised Code], to avoid economic and social consequences which flow from unfair competition and improper practices in the sale and distribution of alcoholic beverages.  It is hereby declared to be the policy and intent of the board, in promulgating this article to advance the social control of an alcoholic beverage and to stabilize the sale and distribution of bottled wine in Ohio.  It is intended to eliminate practices in the sale and distribution of wines in Ohio which cause intemperance and improper usage&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of bottled wines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Section 1.  In determining the 'minimum wholesale price' at which bottled wine, except champagne, sparkling wines and aperitif wine, shall be sold or distributed in Ohio by the holders of A-2, B-5 and B-2 permits for resale to holders of C-2, D-2, D-3, D-3a, D-4 or D-5 permits, the board will take into consideration and will be guided by the current selling price of wine in bulk in California, the current selling prices for California wines in bulk in the principal markets of the United States, the charges for the necessary transportation and delivery of wine in bulk from the place of origin to Ohio, all taxes and assessments and levies on wine (both federal and state or states), and the general prevailing cost of labels, containers, crowns, caps and seals.  The cost so determined will be termed the 'prevailing cost' of such wine bottled in Ohio and there will be added to the cost above referred to, a bottling cost markup of 16% (sixteen per cent) of such 'prevailing cost' and which price so determined will be termed the 'minimum base cost.' The 16% markup is to cover in part, but without limitation, the cost for such items as labor, salaries of executives and officers, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  rent, depreciation and maintenance of equipment and property, selling costs, insurance, license fees, property taxes, delivery charges (if any), shrinkage, breakage, evaporation and general overhead expenses.  There will be added to the 'minimum base cost' of wine a wholesaler's markup of 20% (twenty per cent) of the minimum base cost; which price will be deemed the 'minimum wholesale price' to class C-2, D-2, D-3, D-3a, D-4 or D-5 permit holders and which markup is to cover in part, but without limitation, the cost of doing business by a distributor at wholesale of bottled wine for such items as labor, salaries of executives and officers, rent, depreciation, and maintenance of equipment and property, selling cost, insurance, license fees, property taxes, delivery charge (if any), breakage and general overhead cost.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The board will fix as the 'minimum wholesale price' to class C-2, D-2, D-3, D-3a, D-4 and D-5 permit holders for wine produced outside the United States and imported into Ohio, the same 'minimum wholesale price' as is fixed for wine produced or bottled in Ohio.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The 'minimum wholesale price' to class C-2, D-2, D-3, D-3a, D-4 and D-5 permit holders for wine produced in&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the United States, but bottled outside of Ohio, will be fixed by the board to be the same as the 'minimum wholesale price' fixed for wine produced or bottled in Ohio.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellant contends that this regulation is defective, but the board asserts that such regulation represents a valid exercise of the power given it by the General Assembly through the enactment of that part of Section 6064-3</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">a</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, General Code, which, as present Section 4301.13, Revised Code, is, in part, as follows:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The board [of liquor control] may determine and fix the minimum markups at wholesale or retail, or both, for bottled wine, and fix the minimum prices at which the various classes of bottled wine shall be distributed and sold in Ohio either at wholesale or retail, or both.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Court of Common Pleas of Franklin County affirmed the finding of the board as to this aspect of the charges made against appellant, reversed the finding of the board on a point not in issue herein, and rendered a judgment to that effect.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The judgment of the Court of Common Pleas was affirmed by the Court of Appeals for Franklin County.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cause is before this court as an appeal as of right and pursuant to the allowance of a&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  motion to certify the record.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">Appellant wine company challenged the judgment of the Court of Appeals for Franklin County (Ohio) affirming a lower judge's ruling favoring appellee Board of Liquor Control's decision terminating the company's liquor license.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">The wine company's alcohol sales permits were revoked by the board owing to the company's refusal to sell its wine at the minimum price specified by regulations. The company sued, contending the various statutes and regulations authorizing the board to set such a price were unconstitutional. A trial judge held for the board, and a panel of intermediate appellate judges upheld that ruling. A further appeal was taken. The court affirmed, holding that although U.S. Const. amend. XI revoked prohibition, it expressly authorized the states to continue to regulate alcohol as they saw fit. Consequently, the State was authorized to regulate alcohol up to the point of banning it and that included the lesser action of setting a minimum price for it. The decision to delegate to the board the power to establish the applicable regulations for alcohol was not an unconstitutional delegation of legislative power to an executive body, as there were sufficient legislative guidelines on how that power was to be employed. Finally, the board's regulations did not contradict applicable state statutory law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">The judgment was affirmed. The board had the constitutional power to regulate the price of alcohol, and the guidelines provided by the state legislature for the adoption of regulations were sufficiently concrete to avoid a separation of powers problem.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  APPEAL from the Court of Appeals for Cuyahoga County.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is an action for a declaratory judgment and injunctive relief originating in the Court of Common Pleas of Cuyahoga County.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The plaintiff appellee is the owner of real estate improved with a gasoline service station located at 17700 Lake Shore Boulevard in the city of Cleveland, Ohio.  These premises were originally acquired by her in 1931, and, when so acquired, such premises were zoned for retail business use by a comprehensive zoning ordinance of the city of Cleveland, effective as of November 5, 1929.  Under the ordinance, all the parcels of real estate on both sides of Lake Shore Boulevard between points at and near the intersections therewith of Nottingham and Windward Roads, respectively, were included in a &quot;retail business district,&quot; which encompassed the premises of the plaintiff appellee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Effective April 15, 1945, the council of the city of Cleveland adopted an ordinance, No. 1159-A-44, known as Section 210-109 of the Municipal Code of Cleveland, which provided that this retail business district should be changed into an apartment house district, designated as a &quot;C-residence district.&quot; On December 19, 1949, Section&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  210-109 and other kindred provisions of the Municipal Code of Cleveland were repealed by the council of the city of Cleveland, and Sections 981 to 981-63, Municipal Code of Cleveland, were enacted to replace them.  By Section 981-8 the designation &quot;C-residence district&quot; was changed to &quot;multi-family districts.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sections 981-29, 981-31 and 981-32 of the Municipal Code of Cleveland (now Sections 5.1132, 5.1134 and 5.1135 of the Codified Ordinances of the City of Cleveland, 1951) are summarized by the Court of Appeals in its findings of fact, as follows:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Section 5.1132 of the Codified Ordinances of the City of Cleveland permits each property owner to continue the use existing on the effective date of ordinance No. 1159-A-44, April 15, 1945, but prevents the enlargement or expansion of such uses if they are nonconforming uses, that is, not a residential use.  Section 5.1134 of the Codified Ordinances of the City of Cleveland imposes limitations upon a nonconforming use which is abandoned and, upon abandonment, prevents the use of the premises for purposes other than those permitted in a multifamily district.  Section 5.1135 of the Codified Ordinances of the City of Cleveland prevents&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the restoration of nonconforming buildings or structures which have been more than 50 per cent destroyed or removed by whatever cause, including acts of God, but not including acts of malicious mischief or vandalism.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The plaintiff commenced this action in the Court of Common Pleas on November 29, 1950, against the city of Cleveland and the owners and lessees of other business premises located within the district included in the zoning ordinance.  In her amended petition she asserts that the effect of the adoption of the zoning ordinance of 1945, of itself and construed in connection with the other applicable provisions (1949) of the Municipal Code of Cleveland, is impairment and depreciation of the economic use value and marketability of her property; that said amendatory ordinance is null and void, in that it deprives plaintiff and all other owners of real estate to which it appertains of their property and interest therein and of their possession and enjoyment thereof, without due process of law, in violation of the pertinent provisions of the state and federal Constitutions; and that the ordinance bears no substantial relation to the public health, safety, morals, convenience, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  comfort, prosperity and general welfare.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The prayer of the petition seeks a declaration by the court that the zoning ordinances of 1945 and 1949 are unconstitutional, that said ordinances do not and shall not in any manner or degree impair, restrict or affect the full right and power of the plaintiff to improve and use her property for all the purposes and uses and in the manner prescribed as lawful therefor in the original zoning ordinance in force when she acquired and improved her property, and that said ordinances shall likewise not affect the owners of all parcels on Lake Shore Boulevard within reasonable proximity to her property; and asks that the city of Cleveland and all its officers, representatives and employees be restrained and enjoined from enforcing the amendatory ordinances against her property or that in the proximate vicinity of her property, and for further relief.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Answers and cross-petitions were filed by some of the defendants named in the petition as owners of real estate located in the vicinity of the plaintiff's property, which answers and cross-petitions in effect joined them with the plaintiff in her claims.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The answer of the city of Cleveland to the plaintiff's&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  petition and the cross-petitions of the defendants sets forth fully the applicable provisions of the Charter of the City of Cleveland empowering it to enact said zoning ordinances, which charter provides for the creation of a Board of Zoning Appeals; sets forth the prior applicable zoning ordinances, together with present ordinances, which apply to the premises of the plaintiff; and states further that the City Planning Commission adopted the general plan of Cleveland May 6, 1949, under which this area is to be limited to apartment use, that the business district is to be situated on E. 185th Street (some distance from plaintiff's premises), and traffic is to be routed to Lakeland Freeway instead of the presently used Lake Shore Boulevard, that, since the passage of the 1945 and 1949 ordinances, residence buildings have been constructed in the vicinity in accord with the 1945 ordinance, and that the city was fully authorized by law to enact the 1945 ordinance in question.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All other allegations in the plaintiff's petition and the cross-petitions of the defendants are denied generally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Upon trial in the Court of Common Pleas, the court found for the plaintiff and for the cross-petitioning&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  defendants and held that the amending ordinances No. 1159-A-44 (1945) and No. 2204-A-48 (1949), known as Sections 981 to 981-63 of the Municipal Code of Cleveland, and all subsequently enacted ordinances of similar import and effect, so far as the same purport to restrict the improvement and use of the properties of plaintiff and the cross-petitioning defendants differently than the same were restricted by the original zoning ordinance of 1929, are unconstitutional, void and of no effect; and that the amendatory and subsequently enacted ordinances do not and shall not in any manner or degree impair, restrict or affect the full right and power of the plaintiff, the cross-petitioning defendants or the owners of all parcels on Lake Shore Boulevard between Nottingham Road and Windward Road to improve and use their properties in the manner prescribed as lawful therefor under the original zoning ordinance.  The court then enjoined the city and its officers from enforcing the provisions of the amendatory ordinances against the plaintiff and the other owners above mentioned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An appeal on questions of law and fact was prosecuted to the Court of Appeals by the city of Cleveland.  Some defendant&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  cross-petitioners did not join in the proceedings in the Court of Appeals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The case was submitted to the Court of Appeals on the official court reporter's transcript of the testimony adduced in the Court of Common Pleas and the exhibits offered at such trial, and the transcript of the testimony and the exhibits offered at a hearing before a master commissioner appointed by the Court of Appeals, and other stipulated evidence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Court of Appeals heard the appeal of the city of Cleveland </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">de novo</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and entered a judgment, accompanied by findings of fact and conclusions of law.  The judgment of the Court of Appeals holds that the amendatory ordinances and enactments by the council of the city of Cleveland and all amendments and codifications thereof, specifically set forth in its findings of fact, to the extent that they affect certain listed properties that were substantially improved for business use prior to April 15, 1945, and owned by any of the appellees herein, as found in said separate findings of fact, so far as they purport to restrict the improvement, use and enjoyment of any such parcels differently than was lawful under the original zoning ordinance (effective November&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  5, 1929) and the amendments thereto effective before April 15, 1945, are unconstitutional, null and void, and that &quot;the same shall not, in any manner or degree, impair, restrict or affect the full right and power of the owner or owners of such parcels of land, his or their heirs, legal representatives, successors and assigns, to improve, use and enjoy the same for all purposes and uses and in the manner prescribed as lawful therefor in such original zoning ordinance.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The judgment contains thereafter a list of the parcels so improved, by auditor's parcel number, and of their present owners.  The city of Cleveland and all its officers, representatives and employees were &quot;forever&quot; enjoined from enforcing the provisions of the 1945 zoning ordinance and subsequently enacted amendatory ordinances as against the owners of any of the parcels listed or any persons claiming through or under such owners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An appeal was prosecuted by the city of Cleveland to this court as a matter of right on the ground that a constitutional question is presented, which appeal was heard.  A motion to certify the record was overruled.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">Defendant city sought review of a decision of the Court of Appeals for Cuyahoga County (Ohio), which found, on a de novo review of a decision of the Court of Court of Common Pleas, that the city's zoning ordinances which rezoned plaintiff property owner's land were unconstitutional, null, and void, and enjoined the city from enforcing the ordinances against the property owners.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">After the property owners purchased their land and made improvements, the city passed ordinances which changed the use of the land from retail business to multi-family. The trial court found the ordinances unconstitutional, and the Court of Appeals agreed. On appeal, the court reversed, holding that there was no authority for theory that one who acquired and improved property had a right to rely on the zoning regulations effective at the time of improvement, even to the point that such regulations would not be repealed or materially changed in the absence of compelling necessity. Rather, there could be no vested or contract rights against rezoning or an extension of a district, since zoning constituted a governmental, legislative, and discretionary power. The property owners' reliance on the original zoning ordinance in purchasing and improving their land was not sufficient to prevent rezoning. Where the rights of the property owners to continue the use indefinitely were preserved and provision made for administrative appeal for relief in individual cases, the ordinances could not be considered arbitrary or confiscatory.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">The judgment finding the amended zoning ordinances to be unconstitutional was reversed and remanded.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">Appellant taxpayer sought review of a decision from the Board of Tax Appeals (Ohio), which affirmed appellee tax commissioner's orders assessing an Ohio highway use tax upon the taxpayer. The board found that the assessments were reasonable and lawful. The tax was imposed upon the taxpayer, a foreign state corporation engaged in a business of trucking in interstate commerce with trucks licensed in three states.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">The Ohio Highway Use Tax Act, also known as an &quot;axle-mile tax,&quot; levied a graduated tax upon trucks, ranging from certain sums per mile for trucks having three or more axles. The taxpayer argued that the tax was unconstitutional. The court stated that the taxpayer's argument should have been directed to the Ohio General Assembly. The court determined that the tax imposed bore a reasonable relationship to a purpose for which it was created, did not impair interstate commerce, and was not discriminatory. The tax was a valid exercise of a taxing power. The court considered a reciprocity board's power, under Ohio Rev. Code &sect; 4503.37, to cancel a reciprocity agreement entered into by the board between Ohio and a foreign state. The board, created by &sect; 4503.37, had the power to cancel the reciprocity agreement entered into with the foreign state. There was no mandatory duty on the board created by Ohio Rev. Code &sect; 5728.15 to require the board to enter into reciprocity agreements. Although the court could have instructed the board that it was required to enter into reciprocity agreements, the agreements required an acquiescence of another state over which the court had no control.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This litigation originated in the form of two actions in the Court of Common Pleas of Mahoning County.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By stipulation of counsel, the two actions were consolidated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The present plaintiffs are and have been respectively the lessee and the owner of a tract of approximately 135 acres of farm land located on the western edge of Canfield Township in Mahoning County.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the defendants is the zoning inspector for the township and the remaining three are the trustees for the township.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Court of Common Pleas rendered a decree in favor of the plaintiffs by holding the subsequently adopted township zoning ordinance unconstitutional so far as its operation prohibits the plaintiffs from removing coal from their land by the strip-mining method, and the defendants were enjoined from interfering with such removal of coal by the plaintiffs. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">In consolidated cases defendants, a township zoning inspector and township trustees, appealed a decree of the Court of Appeals (Ohio) in favor of plaintiffs, a lessee and an owner of a tract of farm land, in an action to enjoin defendants from interfering with the removal of minerals underlying their land and that the trial court declare unconstitutional a township zoning ordinance prohibiting strip mining in an agricultural district.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">Both lower courts held that the subsequently adopted township zoning ordinance insofar as it prohibited plaintiffs from removing coal from their land by strip mining was arbitrary and unreasonable, and deprived plaintiffs of their property without due process of law, in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment and Ohio Const. Art. I, &sect;&sect; 1, 16, and 19. Defendants contended that the decisions of the lowed courts were adverse on the ground that the zoning ordinance was invalid so far as it affected the land of plaintiffs. The court found that minerals underlying plaintiffs' lands had a market value in excess of $ 1,000,000 and the residual value of the lands after removal of the minerals would be about $ 17,000. The minerals could only be removed through strip mining and such operation only constituted a temporary use of the lands. The court held the State of Ohio recognized strip mining as a legitimate business and no township could arbitrarily prohibit the conduct of that business. Accordingly, the court concluded that the ordinance to the extent to which it applied to plaintiffs' land was unreasonable and arbitrary.</SPAN></P>

The owners appealed. The court reversed because the General Assembly had indicated that airports were beneficial to the public and were to be promoted and encouraged. In addition, in delegating to township trustees the power to zone it did not include the power to circumvent the general law by completely prohibiting airports, throughout the unincorporated territory of a township, as being nuisances per se. Therefore, the zoning resolution was invalid and unenforceable because it was an unlawful extension of the power delegated to township trustees.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plaintiff, a duly elected, qualified and acting justice of the peace of Mead Township, Belmont County, filed his petition in the Common Pleas Court of that county, alleging that the defendant Board of County Commissioners of Belmont County, purporting to act under the provisions of Section 1907.47, Revised Code, fixed the annual salary and expenses of the office held by plaintiff at a total sum of $ 150; that such section is unconstitutional and void in that neither it nor any other section of the Code prescribes any standards or rules governing the exercise of authority stated therein to be delegated to the board; and that the provisions of the statute purport to be of a general nature but cannot have uniform operation throughout the state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The prayer of the petition is that the section be declared unconstitutional and void, or that so much of the resolution of the board as pertains to plaintiff's salary be set aside and the board be ordered to enter as the annual salary of plaintiff the sum of either $ 3,600 or $ 1,000.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On April 21, 1954, the Council of the City of Reading, Ohio, passed an ordinance (No. 918-1954), the pertinent portions of which are as follows:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Be it ordained by Council of the City of Reading, Ohio, two-thirds of all members elected thereto concurring;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Section I: That it shall be unlawful for any person, partnership, firm or corporation to operate any vehicle or vehicles on any of the public streets within the boundaries of the city of Reading, Ohio, containing a gross weight, including load, in excess of 20,000 pounds, excepting for the purpose of loading or unloading said vehicles at a residence, place of business or industry within the boundaries of the city of Reading, Ohio, which shall include ordinary deliveries to any of such places, and excepting also for the purpose of traveling to or from a residence, place of business or industry where said vehicle or vehicles are registered or hired and excepting also for the operation of vehicles over Reading Road, a state highway.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Provided further, that the gross weight, including load of any vehicle or vehicles, shall include the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  gross weight of any trailer or trailers attached to any vehicle or vehicles, together with load.</SPAN></P>

Therefore, this ordinance shall take effect and be in force immediately from and after its passage.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The following October three employees of Richter Concrete Corporation, having its principal place of business in Cincinnati, were arrested while driving concrete mixer trucks on Galbraith Road in the city of Reading and were charged with violating said ordinance.  After these arrests, Richter Concrete Corporation, hereinafter called plaintiff, brought an action in the Court of Common Pleas of Hamilton County to enjoin the city of Reading and its mayor from enforcing the provisions of the ordinance against it or its drivers and to have such ordinance declared invalid and unconstitutional.  The trucks admittedly weighed in excess of the limit specified. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The trial court after final hearing found the ordinance to be valid and accordingly dissolved the temporary restraining order previously allowed and dismissed plaintiff's petition.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">Defendant City appealed a decision of the Court of Appeals for Hamilton County (Ohio) that reversed a trial court and ruled that Reading, Ohio, Ordinance 918-1954 (April 21, 1954), violated the Equal Protection Clauses of the U.S. and Ohio Constitutions. After its truckers were arrested for violating the ordinance, plaintiff company obtained a temporary injunction against enforcement by the City. The trial court dissolved the injunction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">Under the ordinance, it was unlawful to operate, on any of the City's public streets, a vehicle with a gross weight, in excess of 20,000 pounds, except for the purpose of loading or unloading at a residence or place of business within the City or for travelling to or from a place in the City where the vehicle was registered or hired. There was also an exception for travel over one state highway. The company, which had its principal place of business outside the City, challenged the ordinance after its truckers were arrested while driving concrete mixers, which weighed in excess of the limits, within the City. The court found that the ordinance in effect discriminated between residents and nonresidents engaged in the operation of trucks weighing in excess of 20,000 pounds. The ordinance illegally imposed restrictions on those engaged in through traffic and imposed no such regulations upon those using the streets for other than through traffic, notwithstanding that such traffic imposed the same stress upon the streets and created the same hazards. The ordinance created an arbitrary and discriminate classification in violation of U.S. Const. amend. XIV and Ohio Const. art. I, &sect; 2.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">The court affirmed the judgment of the lower appellate court that the ordinance was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

The trial court found that the injured was not a guest at the time of her injuries within the meaning of Ohio Rev. Code &sect; 4515.02, commonly known as the &quot;guest statute.&quot; The judgment was affirmed by the court of appeals. Upon review, the court affirmed the judgment. The court found that when the injured left the automobile to summon help, she temporarily, at least, removed herself from the category of one being transported in or upon a motor vehicle and would not have resumed a guest status until she again entered the car. The court stated that the trial court properly applied the rule of ordinary negligence because the injured was not a guest at and immediately before the time she was injured.

The court noted that in its original opinion the majority of the court decided that the use of the contested funds was not for statutory highway purposes. However, the court reversed its former judgment and rendered final judgment for plaintiff because the sole question arose over the defraying of certain preliminary costs of the construction with funds the use of which was restricted by a section of the Ohio Const., art. XII, &sect; 5a. Obviously, the parking garage could be constructed without the use of these funds. The holding of the majority was not a holding that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 5538.01 et seq. was unconstitutional, but rather it was a holding that the use of the funds was not, within the meaning of Ohio Const., art.

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Allied Stores of Ohio, Inc., herein referred to as the taxpayer, is an Ohio corporation.  In an appeal to the Board of Tax Appeals from a final order of the Tax Commissioner, the taxpayer contended that the Tax Commissioner had erroneously assessed for taxation for the year 1954 certain &quot;merchandise * * * held in a storage warehouse for storage only&quot; within the meaning of those words as used in Section 5701.08, Revised Code, in effect prior to September 30, 1955, and that the statutes of Ohio were unconstitutional to the extent that they purported to levy a tax on such property not &quot;belonging to a nonresident of&quot; Ohio, in that they denied a resident such as the taxpayer the protection of the laws equal to that enjoyed by a nonresident.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">The Court of Appeals for Cuyahoga County (Ohio) affirmed a decision of the Ohio Board of Tax Appeals, which affirmed a final order of appellee tax commissioner imposing a tax upon certain merchandise held by appellant corporation in a storage warehouse. The corporation filed a motion for certification of the record, and the appellate court granted the motion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">The commissioner assessed the merchandise pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 5709.01, which provided that all personal property located and used in business in Ohio was subject to taxation, regardless of the residence of the owner of the property. The corporation objected to the assessment of the tax on equal protection grounds, claiming that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 5701.08, which provided, in part, that merchandise owned by a nonresident was not &quot;used in business&quot; in Ohio if was being held in a warehouse for storage only, discriminated against residents in favor of nonresidents. The Board affirmed the commissioner's order, and the appellate court affirmed the Board's decision. The court affirmed, concluding that even if the allegedly discriminatory language was deemed to be unconstitutional, the corporation would not be entitled to relief because the court could not simply strike the offending language therefrom, but would be required to strike the provision in its entirety, and if the provision were stricken in its entirety, the property in question would remain subject to taxation under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 5709.01.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Youngstown Sheet &amp; Tube Company, herein referred to as the taxpayer, is an Ohio corporation.  In its 1954 return, it eliminated from the average value of its reported manufacturing inventories certain inventories of property owned by it and held in various storage places in Ohio.  The Tax Commissioner in his final order found these withheld inventories to be taxable.  Furthermore, the Tax Commissioner in that order made no deduction from the tax base of any amount on account of &quot;drawings&quot; which the taxpayer claimed to be exempt from taxation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On appeal to the Board of Tax Appeals, that board affirmed the order of the Tax Commissioner so far as it related to the &quot;drawings.&quot; With respect to the property held in storage, the taxpayer had contended that that provision of Section 5701.08, Revised Code, which, prior to September 30, 1955, read, &quot;but merchandise * * * belonging to a nonresident of this state is not used in business in this state if held in a storage warehouse for storage only,&quot; should have stricken therefrom the words &quot;belonging to a nonresident of this state&quot; for the reason that those words made such provision unconstitutional&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and that such provision when so revised excepted such property from taxation.  The Board of Tax Appeals determined that it had no power to determine that any part of Section 5701.08, Revised Code, was unconstitutional and that it was therefore bound to render its decision in accordance with the provisions of that statute as it found them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The taxpayer further contended that certain iron ores imported by it from foreign countries were exempt from taxation by reason of the provisions of Clause 2 of Section 10 of Article I of the Constitution of the United States.  This contention was sustained by the Board of Tax Appeals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cause is now before this court on appeals by the Tax Commissioner and by the taxpayer from the decision of the Board of Tax Appeals.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">The taxpayer further contended that certain iron ores imported by it from foreign countries were exempt from taxation by reason of the provisions of U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 10, cl. 2. That contention was sustained by the Ohio Board of Tax Appeals. The court ruled that the drawings were exempt under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 5701.03. The taxpayer's evidence as to the value of &quot;drawings&quot; was largely evidence as to the cost of drawings and specifications. The evidence in the record did not require the conclusion as a matter of law that the specifications referred to in the evidence of cost were part of the drawings. The court found that the evidence did show conclusively that there were a very substantial number of drawings. Also, there was evidence disclosing that both the cost of such things as some of the &quot;tracings, blueprints and supplies&quot; and also the charges for some of the &quot;detail draftsmen and tracers&quot; amounted to several thousands of dollars.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">The court affirmed the case except to the extent that it related to the claimed deduction from the tax base on account of &quot;drawings,&quot; and the cause was remanded to the Board for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plaintiff seeks to enjoin the expenditure of money from the Highway Improvement Fund for defraying the cost of certain preliminary studies relative to the construction of a parking lot under the Statehouse grounds in Columbus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plaintiff alleges in his petition that Section 5538.17, Revised Code, provides in part that, with the approval of the Underground Parking Commission, the Director of Highways shall expend out of any funds available for the purpose such moneys as are necessary for the study of any underground parking lot; that pursuant thereto the commission, acting through the director, has contracted for certain engineering studies and surveys in connection with the proposed underground parking lot and has authorized the director to expend from the Highway Improvement Fund $ 64,500 for paying the cost of studies and surveys; that the Highway Improvement Fund is made up of revenues derived from taxes collected on the sale of gasoline used for propelling motor vehicles on the highways of the state; that such use of the fund does not constitute expenditure for the costs of administration&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of laws concerning the registration, operation and use of vehicles on public highways, statutory refunds and adjustments provided in such laws, payment of highway obligations, costs of construction, reconstruction, maintenance and repair of public highways and other statutory highway purposes, etc.; and that unless restrained the auditor will expend portions of the Highway Improvement Fund to pay vouchers relative to engineering studies and surveys in connection with the proposed underground parking lot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The prayer is that the auditor be enjoined from expending any sums from the Highway Improvement Fund or from spending any money, derived from fees, excises and license taxes relating to registration, operation and use of vehicles on public highways and to fuels used for propelling such vehicles, for the purpose of paying any part of the cost of engineering studies or surveys in connection with the underground parking lot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant filed a demurrer to the petition on the ground that it does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.</SPAN></P>

The auditor filed a demurrer to the petition on the ground that it did not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action. The trial court sustained the demurrer and rendered judgment for the auditor. The appellate court affirmed, and plaintiff appealed. The court affirmed because Ohio Const. art. XII, &sect; 5a did not forbid the expenditure from revenues derived from the motor vehicle fuel excise tax for studies and surveys for the underground parking lot, for which provision was made in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 5538.17. The court reasoned that a purpose of providing parking space on a highway would appear to be no more a highway purpose than a purpose of providing necessary parking space off the highway.</SPAN></P>

On that date, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 4123.512 to 4123.519, were to become effective, and no provision was made that required the Commission to complete the rehearing proceedings. The court found that relator's claim had been filed on August 10, 1954, and disallowed on January 4, 1955. On September 8, 1955, the Commission found that it had authority under the existing law to grant relator's request for a hearing but that there was insufficient time to permit relator to complete the case, and for the Commission to hear and determine it, prior to October 5, 1955. The Commission ordered that relator's claim would, on and after October 5, 1955, be deemed to be pending before the Commission on appeal as provided for by the new sections. The court found that the new statute was constitutional because the new statute still applied to certain pending proceedings before the Commission, which included relator's claim.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cause was submitted to that court for decision upon an agreed statement of facts which disclosed that in 1953 the civil service commission of Findlay adopted a rule that examinations in the civil service in that city should consist of a written examination and an oral examination with a 75 per cent weight being given to the written examination and a 25 per cent weight given to the oral examination; that on or about November 2, 1954, a vacancy arose in the office of the chief of police of that city; that thereafter the civil service commission of the city &quot;posted * * * a notice of examination&quot; to fill that vacancy which stated that &quot;75 per cent of said examination would be written and 25 per cent of the examination would be oral and interview&quot;; that on December 1, 1954, said commission &quot;gave a written, competitive examination to fill the vacancy&quot; in&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  said office; that on December 3, 1954, the civil service commission &quot;did give, to relator and respondent, along with three other participants in said written examination, an oral examination&quot;; that in grading the examination a 75 per cent weight was given to the written part of the examination and a 25 per cent weight was given to the oral part of the examination and the resulting grades were then, pursuant to the rules and regulations of the commission, multiplied by 0.9, and there was then added thereto by reason of Section 143.16, Revised Code, a seniority credit of 10 for relator and of 6.4 for respondent; that, upon completion of these examinations and the computation of grades, the commission certified to the mayor that respondent had received the highest rating and the mayor promoted respondent to the office of chief of police of the city; and that relator's grade on the written portion of said examination, including his credit for service in the police department, was the highest grade obtained by any person on that part of the examination but the grade of respondent which was the basis of his certification by the commission to the mayor was higher than that of relator solely&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  because of the greater percentage received by respondent on the oral part of the examination.</SPAN></P>

A vacancy later arose in the office of the chief of police. Subsequently, the Commission gave a written, competitive examination to fill the vacancy in said office to the individual, the relator, and three other participants. The individual received the highest rating and the mayor promoted him to the office. The relator's grade on the written portion of the examination was the highest obtained by any person on the written portion of the examination. He filed an action against the individual, and the lower court ordered his ouster from the office of chief of police and ordered that the relator be certified and appointed to fill that vacancy. The court affirmed in part the judgment, by holding that the certification of the individual was unlawful because it was based upon the result of a promotional examination that was not authorized by law, as it was not an exclusively written examination.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Relator voted the Republican ballot in the May 1952 primary election but did not vote in the general election of that year.  In February 1954, relator filed a declaration of candidacy and nominating petition as a Democrat for Representative to Congress for the primary election to be held in May 1954; such declaration and petition was rejected by the Board of Elections of Trumbull County for the reason that he registered and voted as a Republican in 1952; and the Court of Appeals, in a mandamus action brought by relator, held that he was ineligible to be a Democratic candidate for the office in the May 1954 primary election.  He voted the Democratic ballot in the May 1954 primary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On February 8, 1956, relator filed with the board of elections his declaration of candidacy and petition for nomination as a candidate of the Democratic Party for the office of Representative to Congress from the Eleventh Congressional District, containing the requisite number of signatures and duly verified.  The board refused to have relator's name placed on the Democratic Party ballot for the May 1956 primary election for the reason that relator had voted as a member of a different political&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  party at a primary election held within the next preceding four calendar years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By the instant action in mandamus, originating in this court, relator seeks a writ requiring the board to certify to the board of elections of each county within the district that relator is entitled to have his name appear on the Democratic primary ballot.</SPAN></P>

Before the next election, he filed a declaration of candidacy and nominating petition as a Democrat to run for a congressional seat. The county board of elections rejected his declaration and petition. In a prior mandamus action, it was held that he could not run as a Democrat in that election. He voted as a Democrat in that primary. Then for the following election, he again presented a petition for nomination and declaration of candidacy. The board of elections again rejected his petition and declaration and again he sought mandamus relief. Again his petition for mandamus relief was denied. The court held that under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3513.191 as amended, he could not be a candidate for nomination for one party if he had voted as a member of another party in any primary election within the preceding four calendar years. It did not matter that under the pre-amendment &sect; 3513.191, he would have qualified to be a candidate. The amended statute was a valid exercise of police power and was not invalid retroactive legislation.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  APPEAL from the Court of Appeals for Cuyahoga County.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellants Putnam and Andrews are directors and majority shareholders of The Winous Company and own between them approximately 59 per cent of the stock of the corporation.  Appellee Humphrys controls approximately 40 per cent of the stock and for several years prior to the annual meeting of the shareholders of the corporation on January 18, 1954, had been a director of the corporation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Having failed to give notice of his election to vote cumulatively at the annual meeting on January 18, 1954, as required by Section 1701.58, Revised Code, Humphrys was not re-elected to the board of directors and was replaced on the board by one Anthony.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Following this election of directors, the annual meeting of the corporation was adjourned, at about noon on January 18, until certain financial statements requested by Humphrys could be typed for presentation.  Upon reconvening at about 2:30 p. m. on January 18, the shareholders adopted a resolution amending the code of regulations and providing that each director, after the election at that meeting, shall hold office for three years, and that the three directorships shall be designated by classes&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  as follows: Class A director shall hold office for one year and thereafter for three years; class B director for two years and thereafter for three years; and class C director for three years and thereafter for three years.  The shareholders then adopted a resolution which &quot;designated and appointed&quot; Anthony as the first class A director, appellant Andrews as the first class B director and appellant Putnam as the first class C director.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellees filed a petition for declaratory judgment and equitable relief in the Common Pleas Court of Cuyahoga County praying for a declaration of the invalidity of the amendment to the code of regulations of the company and the consequent election of directors by classes.  The Court of Common Pleas held that, although under Section 1701.64, Revised Code, it was within the power of the majority of the shareholders to classify their three directors in the manner undertaken, the notice of the annual meeting was insufficient to permit such classification at that meeting.  It, therefore, held that the three directors, having been duly elected for terms of one year, should continue in office during the remainder of such period.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Humphrys perfected an appeal&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to the Court of Appeals for Cuyahoga County on questions of law, which court held as follows:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That the Court of Common Pleas should have rendered final judgment for the plaintiffs appellants for the reason that where three directors are provided for with three-year terms of office, one to be elected each year, the right to cumulative voting is, in such case, completely nullified, and such amendment to the code of regulations for the classification of directors is null and void, being a violation of the terms of Section 1701.58, R. C.; that the resolution seeking to designate each of the directors already duly elected on the morning of January 18, 1954, to different respective classes was consequently also invalid; that the provisions of Section 1701.58, R. C., prohibiting the restriction or qualification of cumulative voting is specific in character and constitutes a limitation upon the applicability of Section 1701.64, R. C.; and this court coming now to render the judgment which the Court of Common Pleas ought to have rendered, it is therefore considered, ordered and adjudged by this court that the attempted classification of directors by the purported amendment of the code of&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  regulations of The Winous Company is null and void, and that the resolution seeking to designate each of the directors already duly elected on the morning of January 18, 1954, to different respective classes is invalid.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cause is before this court upon the allowance of appellants' motion to certify the record.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">Minority shareholder was not re-elected to the board of directors after he failed to give notice of his election to vote cumulatively at an annual meeting. At the meeting, the shareholders adopted a resolution amending the code of regulations and providing that each director, after election at that meeting, would hold office for three years and that three classes of directorships were designated so as to stagger the classes' terms. The shareholder then designated the newly elected directors into classes. Minority shareholders filed a petition for declaratory judgment and equitable relief that was granted on grounds that the notice of the annual meeting was insufficient to permit such classification at that meeting. The appellate court found that such action by the shareholders nullified the right to cumulative voting. On appeal, the court held that Ohio Rev. Code &sect; 1701.58 guaranteed to minority shareholders the right of cumulative voting and that the notice of the meeting was proper.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Relators allege in their amended petition that they &quot;all are adults of legal age and under no disability&quot;; that they have devoted many years of work to the furtherance of the nudist movement in this country, motivated by a desire to serve this cause; that to relators and other sincere adherents nudism is a religion; that all nudist groups maintain strict and high moral standards and seek constantly to improve physical and mental health; that it is relators' desire and they believe their inherent right to practice nudism within the state of Ohio, to conduct a program of general education and information in explanation of the movement, to attempt to convert the public to their point of view and to form nudist clubs; and that relators believe a nonprofit corporation to be the most effective organization for their purposes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Relators allege further&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  that they have tendered to respondent articles of incorporation for the proposed nonprofit corporation, with the necessary filing fee and with the request that they be accepted for filing and recording, and that respondent refuses to comply with the request.</SPAN></P>

They submitted the required documents and the required fee, but their request for incorporation was denied by the secretary. The nudists filed an action before the court seeking a writ of mandamus to compel the secretary to accept their documents and incorporate their group. The court noted that the proposed corporate purpose of the nudists violated Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2905.31 in that it necessitated the exposure of private parts in the presence of two or more persons of the opposite sex. The court additionally noted that a corporation could not have been formed for an unlawful purpose. The nudists argued, however, that &sect; 2905.31 was unconstitutional. The court held that &sect; 2905.31 was a valid exercise of the state's police power to prevent the practice of nudism regardless of the belief of those desiring to practice it as a doctrine of life, cult, or sect. Therefore, the nudists failed to show by their petition a clear legal right to the relief prayed for, and the writ was denied.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">APPEAL from the Court of Appeals for Hamilton County.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In cause No. 34311, appellant Anna H. Morgan, hereinafter called appellant, pursuant to subpoena, appeared before the Ohio Un-American Activities Commission at a hearing held by it in Columbus, Ohio, on April 1, 1952.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After being sworn, appellant refused to answer substantially each and every question propounded to her, &quot;under the Fifth Amendment of the Constitution, because to do so would give your committee an opportunity to incriminate me.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Subsequently, on May 21, 1952, appellant was indicted under Section 12845, General Code ( Section 2917.42, Revised Code), for her refusal to answer 37 of the questions so propounded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Her demurrer to the indictment, filed October 25, 1952, having been overruled, appellant, in writing, waived her right to trial by jury, and the cause was tried before a judge of the Common Pleas Court of Franklin County on November 16, 1953.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the trial the state called as witnesses Gordon Renner, Samuel L. Devine and Edwin H. Hammock.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first two witnesses are attorneys at law who were members of the 99th General Assembly and the Ohio Un-American&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Activities Commission, Renner being the elected chairman and Devine the elected secretary thereof, and both were present at the hearing at which appellant appeared.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hammock is a court stenographer who was employed by the commission and who recorded the hearing out of which the indictment and trial here under consideration arose.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These witnesses were, of course, subjected to cross-examination.  Other than this, however, there was neither testimony nor evidence offered by appellant, she apparently being content to rely upon the validity of either her earlier attack upon jurisdiction by demurrer or her motion for a directed verdict of acquittal duly made at the close of the trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The only item of physical evidence in the record is a copy of a subpoena which purports to be a copy of the subpoena duly served upon appellant and by virtue of which she appeared before the commission.  It was introduced by the state and its validity is not questioned.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed defendants' convictions, determining that the general assembly had the power to create the Ohio Un-American Activities Commission under Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 8 for investigative purposes. One defendant invoked a privilege under the protection against self-incrimination afforded her by Ohio Const. art. I, &sect;10. The immunity from prosecution granted defendants by the state concerning any of the matters to which they might have testified afforded them as much protection from self-incrimination as the Ohio Constitution, and a refusal to answer on the attempted invocation of the privilege against self-incrimination was unavailable by virtue of the immunity granted. A direction by the Commission to answer after the refusal was unnecessary because the immunity precluded the possibility of justifying a refusal.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Appeals reversing a judgment of the Court of Common Pleas and entering final judgment against the appellant defendants.  The action is one wherein the state of Ohio is attempting to enforce a personal liability of the sellers and purchasers of a business for sales taxes accrued during the operation of the business by the sellers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The pertinent facts are as follows.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For some time prior to March 1946, M. L. Sloan and Kelsie Goodman operated a business known as the Corner Lunch.  In March 1946 such business was sold to appellants, Leonard and Clara Lowe, and the record reveals that no discussion was had or any provision made for the payment of sales taxes which had accrued during the operation of the business by the sellers.  On June 18, 1946, a sales tax assessment was made against Sloan and Goodman by the Department of Taxation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On June 24, 1949, the state instituted an action to recover such taxes and joined M. L. Sloan, Kelsie Goodman, Leonard Lowe and Clara Lowe as defendants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defendants Sloan and Goodman filed no answer and made no appearance and judgment by default was&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  entered against them.  The appellants filed an answer.  In the trial of the case the state proved the prior ownership of the business, the sale thereof to appellants and the failure to provide for the payment of the accrued sales taxes at the time of the sale; and, to prove the amount due, the state introduced into evidence the certificate of assessment of the taxes made against Sloan and Goodman.  The appellants introduced no evidence but contended that the certified copy of the findings of the Department of Taxation was insufficient to establish the correct amount of the taxes, and if it was sufficient then Section 5546-9</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">b</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, General Code ( Section 5739.14, Revised Code), was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trial court, upon the motion of appellants on the ground that the state had failed to prove facts sufficient to make a case, dismissed the petition as to appellants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On appeal to the Court of Appeals, the judgment of the Court of Common Pleas was reversed and final judgment was entered against the appellants.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">When the sellers sold the business to the purchasers, no discussion was had or any provision made for the payment of sales taxes which had accrued during the operation of the business by the sellers. The Ohio Department of Taxation subsequently assessed sales tax against the sellers. The trial court found that the State had failed to prove facts sufficient to make a case. The court of appeals reversed and final judgment was entered against the purchasers. On further appeal, the purchasers contended, inter alia, that even if a certificate of assessment was prima facie evidence of the amount of taxes due, they were denied due process because they had no notice, were not parties, and had no opportunity to be heard in the proceeding in which assessment was made. In affirming the judgment of the trial court, the court found that the purchasers were liable for the sales taxes because of their lack of due diligence under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 5739.14. The certificate of assessment was prima facie evidence of the amount due in taxes from the purchasers. Due process requirements were met because the purchasers had complete notice and an adequate opportunity to be heard in the trial court.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The appellant, Gladies B. Heine, instituted in the Court of Appeals an action in prohibition against the Chief Justice of the Cleveland Municipal Court.  She alleges in her petition that she is a licensed minister of the New Thought Temple in Cleveland; that two affidavits were filed against her in the Cleveland Municipal Court, based on Section 4731.34, Revised Code, charging her with the illegal practice of medicine; that Section 4731.34 is unconstitutional; that its constitutionality was attacked by appellant in the Municipal Court; that the unconstitutionality of the statute deprives the Municipal Court of jurisdiction; and that the Court of Appeals should immediately take jurisdiction and determine whether the statute is constitutional without exposing appellant to the hardship of a long and expensive trial.  The prayer is that an order be issued prohibiting the judges of the Cleveland Municipal Court from proceeding to hear and determine the action therein pending against appellant.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The petitioner herein, Joseph Giordano, instituted in this court a proceeding in habeas corpus, seeking discharge from the custody of the Warden of the Ohio Penitentiary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It appears from the petition that in 1934, in the Court of Common Pleas of Cuyahoga County, petitioner was convicted of burglary after a plea of guilty; that in 1939, in the same court, he was convicted of assault with intent to rob; that in 1947, in the Court of Common Pleas of Columbiana County, after a plea of guilty, he was convicted of robbery; and that thereafter he was charged with being an habitual criminal, tried, convicted and sentenced to the penitentiary.

Five years later, he was convicted of assault with intent to rob. Eight years after that, he was convicted of robbery, then charged with and convicted of being an habitual criminal. He sought habeas relief, which was denied. The court held that the first conviction was not void for lack of jurisdiction. The common pleas court which convicted him had concurrent jurisdiction with the juvenile court over 17 year old offenders pursuant to Ohio Gen. Code &sect;&sect; 1639 and 1683-20. The inmate's complaint that his robbery conviction was the result of a conspiracy by the prosecutor, to avoid convicting him of a crime (armed robbery) which would not sustain an habitual criminal conviction, was without merit. He could not raise alleged defects in the indictment in a habeas proceeding. Finally, the inmate could not raise the constitutionality of the habitual criminal statute, Ohio Gen. Code &sect; 13744-1 (Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2961.11), because the court that convicted him had jurisdiction to determine the statute's constitutionality.</SPAN></P>

Relator then sought a writ of mandamus from the court, contending the statute required substitution once allegations of bias were made. Otherwise, relator contended respondent abused his discretion. The court held that the course of law over 30 years and practical considerations precluded relator's first contention. As to the second, the court could not say respondent had plainly abused his discretion.

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This action in prohibition, instituted originally in this court, was brought to test the constitutionality of Section 3513.256, Revised Code, as amended effective January 1, 1956 (126 Ohio Laws, S. 220).  That section, relating to nominating petitions of independent candidates for county offices, provides in part as follows:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The nominating petition of independent candidates for the office of representative to the General Assembly, county commissioner, county auditor, prosecuting attorney, clerk of the Court of Common Pleas, sheriff, county recorder, county treasurer, county engineer, coroner, shall be signed by not less than 25 qualified electors of the county, or not less than seven per cent of the number of electors who voted for Governor at the next preceding regular state election in the county, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">whichever is the greater</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.  The nominating petition of independent candidates for the office of judge of Probate Court, judge of the Court of Common Pleas, and such other courts as are established by statute, shall be signed by qualified electors not less in number than seven per cent of the number of electors who voted for Governor at the next preceding regular state&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  election in the territory over which such court has jurisdiction, or 2,500 electors, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">whichever is the lesser number</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.&quot; (Emphasis supplied.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is alleged by relator that the section is unconstitutional in that it violates Section 26, Article II of the Constitution of Ohio, which provides that &quot;all laws, of a general nature, shall have a uniform operation throughout the state.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Relator contends that the statute is a law of a general nature within the meaning of the above-quoted constitutional provision; that by arbitrary classification it sets up conditions which in application make it impossible for citizens to become independent candidates for ten elective county offices in the large counties and then arbitrarily places judicial candidates in a class where the requirements to become independent candidates are substantially different; and that it arbitrarily and fictitiously creates a class or classification to such extent that it is unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The prayer of the petition is for an order commanding the respondent Secretary of State to withdraw or nullify all petition forms heretofore printed and circulated, based on Section 3513.256, Revised Code, as amended, and to notify&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  each county board of elections to refuse to certify the nomination of any judicial candidate who files an independent-candidate nominating petition containing signatures less in number than seven per cent of the electors who voted for Governor at the next preceding regular election in the territory in which the judicial candidate seeks office.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">Section 3513.256 related to nominating petitions of independent candidates for county offices. The taxpayer argued that &sect; 3513.256 violated Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 26, because, inter alia, it arbitrarily placed judicial candidates in a class where the requirements to become independent candidates were substantially different, and that it arbitrarily and fictitiously created a class or classification to such extent that it was unconstitutional. The court found that the classification in &sect; 3513.256 was reasonable and valid. The only classification made by &sect; 3513.256 in prescribing requirements for nominating petitions was a distinction between candidates for nonjudicial office and candidates for judicial office. Section 3513.256 operated equally on all members of a designated class. There was a substantial difference between the duties of judicial officers and the officers in the other departments of the government, and those differences made the classification a reasonable one.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is an action originating in this court to prohibit the respondent Ohio State Racing Commission from authorizing, permitting, or issuing any permits for conducting horse racing for a stake, purse, or award, with pari-mutuel or certificate type of wagering, within the state of Ohio, and especially to prohibit the issuing of any such permits to tracks within 30 miles of each other, on the same date or dates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The relators are Charles P. Masterson and Sophie Borek, citizens of the state of Ohio, and Georgeann Borek, Gerald Borek and Patrick Borek, citizens of Ohio and minors of tender years, by their mother and next friend, Sophie Borek, for and on behalf of the state of Ohio and all its citizens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The relators allege that they are interested in the execution of the laws of the state of Ohio, in the upholding and enforcing of constitutional prohibitions and in the enforcing of public duties affecting themselves and citizens of Ohio generally; that Sophie Borek is the former wife and Georgeann, Gerald and Patrick Borek are children of John Eugene Borek, who had lost money by wagering at one of the race tracks for which a permit had been given by the respondent commission; &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  that the commission was established pursuant to Section 3769.01 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">et seq.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, Revised Code, with power to prescribe rules and conditions under which horse racing for a stake or purse, with pari-mutuel or certificate type of wagering, shall be conducted in the state of Ohio, and, as authorized and restricted by the Horse Racing Act of Ohio, to determine to whom, for what date or dates, and for what track or tracks permits to conduct such horse racing shall be issued.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Relators allege further that at all times herein concerned Section 6 of Article XV of the Constitution of Ohio provided that &quot;lotteries, and the sale of lottery tickets, for any purpose whatever, shall forever be prohibited in this state&quot;; that to conduct either pari-mutuel or certificate type of wagering is to conduct a lottery contrary to the Constitution of Ohio; that both the winners of the lottery and the amounts won are determined by chance; and that any attempted statutory authorization thereof is unconstitutional and void.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Relators allege further that they have no ordinary remedy at law to prohibit the operation of this illegal lottery and abuse of the power by the commission, and, therefore, pray the court for&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  a writ of prohibition.</SPAN></P>

Relators alleged that they had no ordinary remedy at law. The Commission filed a demurrer.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">Relators alleged that they were interested in the execution of the laws of Ohio, in the upholding and enforcing of constitutional prohibitions, and in the enforcing of public duties affecting themselves and citizens of Ohio generally. The wife alleged that her former husband had lost money by wagering at one of the race tracks for which a permit had been given by the Commission. Relators argued that Ohio Const. art. XV, &sect; 6 prohibited lotteries and that pari-mutuel or certificate-type wagering was a lottery, so that the Commission's authorization of horse racing with such wagering violated the Ohio constitution. The court held that: (1) relators had an appropriate and adequate remedy in equity, so they could not pursue the remedy of prohibition; (2) the remedy of injunction was available; and (3) relators' petition did not state a cause of action.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  APPEAL from the Court of Appeals for Cuyahoga County.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is an appeal by the city of Euclid, its mayor and its building commissioner, hereinafter designated as respondents, from an order of the Court of Appeals for Cuyahoga County in a mandamus action against the respondents directing them to issue a building permit to the relator, Sun Oil Company, appellee herein and hereinafter designated as Sun, for the construction of a retail gasoline filling station upon a certain tract of land located at the northeast corner of Babbitt Road and Lakeland Boulevard in the city of Euclid, which land Sun is under contract to purchase from Pearl H. Henle, the fee simple owner, under date of July 12, 1950, for the sum of $ 15,000, on condition that Sun is able to procure from the city of Euclid a permit to construct and operate a retail gasoline filling station thereon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under the zoning ordinance of the city of Euclid, the property in question is zoned for retail store use.  In an earlier declaratory judgment action, instituted by Pearl H. Henle, owner in fee simple of the property in question, in which the respondents in this action were defendants, both the Common Pleas Court and on appeal&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the Court of Appeals for Cuyahoga County by unanimous decision held that such zoning ordinance, to the extent that it prohibits the use of the premises in question for a retail gasoline filling station, is unreasonable and confiscatory and, therefore, unconstitutional; that the action of city council in refusing to rezone the premises was arbitrary, capricious, unlawful and void; and that the owner of the legal title to such premises and her successors in title were entitled to a building permit for the construction of such buildings for such use upon such premises.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Court of Appeals in that case ordered the respondents to permit the plaintiff or Sun to file an application for a permit for the construction and operation of a retail gasoline filling station.  The opinion of the Court of Appeals in that case is reported in 97 Ohio App., 258, 118 N. E. (2d), 682. On appeal in that case, this court, on October 20, 1954, dismissed the appeal of the respondents and overruled their motion to certify the record.  See 162 Ohio St., 280, 122 N. E. (2d), 792.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Upon the refusal of this court to review the judgment of the Court of Appeals in that case, copies of the order of that court were&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  served on November 1, 1954, by the sheriff of Cuyahoga County, personally upon the mayor and building commissioner of the city.  A few hours later on the same day, the council of the city of Euclid adopted a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">resolution</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> declaring it necessary to appropriate the fee simple estate in the specific premises hereinbefore described, for highway purposes, to wit, for Lakeland Freeway.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By stipulation it is disclosed that, with the aid and financial assistance of the federal government, the state of Ohio made a study of the feasibility of a limited access highway, to be known as Lakeland Freeway, from downtown Cleveland to a point of intersection with U.S. Route No. 20, one and three-tenths miles east of Painesville, surveyed a proposed center line therefor and determined the construction of such highway on such surveyed center line to be feasible.  Lakeland Freeway is now a completed limited access highway from downtown Cleveland to East 140th Street in that city.  The portion which has been completed was constructed by the joint financial contributions of the city of Cleveland, county of Cuyahoga, state of Ohio, and the federal government.  Some lands in the surveyed course of such center&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  line have been acquired by the city of Euclid, and it is agreed that such surveyed center line passes through the center of the premises in question.  However, no co-operation agreement of any kind in connection with the portion of the proposed Lakeland Freeway within the city of Euclid has been entered into by that city with the state of Ohio, the federal government or the county of Cuyahoga, nor has the city of Euclid adopted any legislation to provide on its own behalf for the establishment and construction of such highway through that city.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pursuant to such resolution, however, the council of Euclid, on December 20, 1954, passed an ordinance, as an emergency measure, declaring that, the premises in question having been &quot;appropriated&quot; for the Lakeland Freeway, the director of law was authorized to apply to a court of competent jurisdiction to have a jury impaneled to assess the compensation to be paid for such property, pursuant to the provisions of Section 719.06 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">et seq.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, Revised Code.  No other resolutions or ordinances have been adopted by the city of Euclid concerning the appropriation or acquisition of the premises described in the petition or any other property within&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  such city.  Subsequent to January 3, 1955, the city of Euclid filed in the Common Pleas Court of Cuyahoga County an application to assess compensation for the property described in the petition herein, pursuant to the resolution and ordinance of its council as hereinbefore described, and a hearing was set in the Common Pleas Court for January 27, 1955, for the impaneling of a jury to make inquiry into and assess the compensation to be paid by the city of Euclid to the owner of the premises in question, but this action did not proceed further.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a result of the judgment of the Court of Appeals in the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Henle case</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, Pearl H. Henle, as owner, and Sun, as purchaser, on November 3, 1954, filed with the building commissioner of Euclid an application for a permit for the construction on the above-mentioned Henle premises of a gasoline filling station, together with plans and specifications therefor, which complied with the building code of the city of Euclid.  On November 9, 1954, the permit was refused by the building commissioner on the ground that, since the premises in question had been ordered to be appropriated by the city of Euclid, he could not lawfully issue the permit.  On November&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  22, 1954, this action for mandamus was instituted in the Court of Appeals for Cuyahoga County by Sun, in which it seeks an order to require respondents to issue it a permit for the construction of a gasoline filling station upon the premises in question, pursuant to its application hereinbefore described.  On the same day, the court issued an alternative writ of mandamus, returnable November 29, 1954, to the respondents to show cause why such permit should not be issued.  On November 26, 1954, a joint answer of respondents city of Euclid and its building commissioner and a demurrer by the mayor to the petition were filed.  The case was submitted on the pleadings and a stipulation of facts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On February 14, 1955, the Court of Appeals rendered judgment as follows:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is therefore ordered, adjudged and decreed that a peremptory writ of mandamus issue against the defendants, the city of Euclid, Kenneth J. Sims, as Mayor of the City of Euclid, and Clyde R. Woodmansee, as Building Commissioner of the City of Euclid, enjoining such respondents to forthwith issue and cause to be issued to relator, Sun Oil Company, a building permit for the construction of a gasoline filling station upon&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the premises described in the petition and in the application for such permit now on file with the respondent city, in accordance with the application, plans and specifications so filed with the respondent building commissioner; and that such permit be delivered to relator * * *.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A motion for new trial was filed by respondents and the same was overruled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cause is now in this court on appeal as a matter of right.  </SPAN></P>
</DIV>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">In a mandamus action, respondents, a city, the mayor, and the building commissioner, appealed an order from the Court of Appeals for Cuyahoga County (Ohio), which directed respondents to issue a building permit to relator applicant for the construction of a retail gasoline filling station upon a certain tract of land, which the applicant was under contract to purchase on condition that it was able to procure the permit.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">The landowner filed a declaratory judgment action, challenging the zoning ordinance for her property. The zoning ordinance, to the extent that it prohibited the use of the premises for a retail gasoline station, was unconstitutional. Respondents were directed to allow the applicant to seek a permit for the construction and operation of the station. Thereafter, the city council passed an ordinance, as an emergency measure, declaring that the landowner's property was &quot;appropriated&quot; for highway purposes. The applicant's permit was refused by the building commissioner on the ground that, since the land in question was ordered to be appropriated by the city, he could not lawfully issue the permit. The applicant filed an action for mandamus, seeking the issuance of a permit. The judgment in favor of the applicant was affirmed. The court found that establishment of a street was a prerequisite to the maintenance of a proceeding to appropriate private property. However, no such ordinance establishing a highway within the city was adopted by the city council. The so-called appropriation was only an abortive attempt to acquire title to the property for possible future highway purposes.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is an action instituted originally in this court and seeking a writ of mandamus requiring the respondents, Board of Elections of Cuyahoga County and Dan W. Duffy, Alexander L. DeMaioribus, Ben C. Green, Philmore J. Haber, Ray C. Miller and Tom L. Terrell, as the duly appointed, constituted and acting members and clerks of the board, to cause the name of relator, Thomas F. Flynn, to be printed on the ballot for Judge of the Cleveland Municipal Court for the term commencing January 2, 1956, to be used in the general election of the city of Cleveland on November 8, 1955.  Issue is made on the petition of the relator, the answer of the respondents, the demurrer thereto, and an agreed statement of facts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The petition alleges that the relator duly filed his nominating petitions which were properly executed in conformity with the laws of Ohio and the charter of the city of Cleveland, by which he was nominated as an independent candidate for Judge of the Cleveland Municipal Court, and that he accepted the nomination by written statement; that the respondents illegally and in gross abuse of any discretion granted to the board by law heard and allowed a protest against his&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  candidacy based on the sole ground of relator's insufficient experience in the active practice of law and the respondents refused to accept his name to be printed on the official ballot for said election; and that the respondents based their action on the provisions of Section 1901.06, Revised Code, which provides in part:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A municipal judge during his term of office shall be a qualified elector and a resident of the territory of the court to which he is elected or appointed, and shall have been admitted to the practice of law in the state and shall have been actively engaged in the practice of law as his principal occupation for at least five years.  The requirement relative to active practice of law does not apply to any judge holding office on June 13, 1951, and who is subsequently a candidate to succeed himself.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Relator says that he is a qualified elector of the city of Cleveland; that he was duly admitted to the practice of law by the Supreme Court of Ohio on January 12, 1925; that since 1927 he has performed the duties of referee in the Cleveland Municipal Court and continued until his retirement on July 31, 1954, as a regularly appointed and sworn referee of the Cleveland&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Municipal Court; that relator has, since his admision to the practice of law in Ohio, undertaken and completed legal consultations, drafting of papers and advocacy of causes before the Probate and Common Pleas Courts of the state of Ohio, such as were not in conflict with his duties in the Cleveland Municipal Court or contrary to the rules of said court, to the approximate total of 4,000 substantial legal problems; and that on April 25, 1949, he was admitted to practice before the Supreme Court of the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Relator pleads that Section 1901.06, Revised Code, so far as it provides for the five-year active practice qualification for the office of judge of a Municipal Court is an invasion of a branch of the judicial power, is contrary to explicit provisions of the Constitution of the state of Ohio and is therefore void; and that the respondents have a clear legal duty to cause relator's name to be printed on said ballot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The answer of the respondents admits that the relator filed his petitions for nomination as a candidate for the office of Judge of the Cleveland Municipal Court; that a protest against such petitions and the qualifications of the relator as a candidate for Judge&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of the Cleveland Municipal Court was filed with the Board of Elections of Cuyahoga County by a qualified elector; that, following such protest and notice to the relator and the protester, a hearing was had in the offices of the Board of Elections of Cuyahoga County on September 7, 1955; that the said board of elections found that the relator does not possess the qualifications for a Municipal Court judge as provided in Section 1901.06, Revised Code; that the board of elections is charged with the duty of determining the sufficiency and validity of the petitions and papers of candidates; that it has determined that the relator does not possess the necessary qualifications to be elected and to hold the office of Judge of the Cleveland Municipal Court for the term beginning January 2, 1956; and that said nominating papers of the relator are invalid, and that in pursuance to law the protest was allowed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The evidence taken before the board of elections at the hearing on September 7, 1955, was adopted by the parties as an agreed statement of facts and is in substantial agreement with the allegations in the pleadings as set forth above.  Evidence was adduced which disclosed the duties performed&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  by the relator as referee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These duties consisted mainly of the hearing of afterjudgment proceedings, garnishments, proceedings in aid of execution and motions of various kinds.  In some instances relator acted upon settlements of cases and passed upon demurrers and acted in a more or less judicial capacity in hearing these matters, and his decisions were stamped with the name of the judge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The relator testified that he was paid a salary at all times for these services; that he had civil service status during the entire period of his employment; and that his duties occupied a full working day.  Relator admits that his services in the Cleveland Municipal Court were his chief occupation but contends that the services rendered as referee and those performed in private law practice constituted active engagement in the practice of law as his principal occupation.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">The applicant had served as referee to a municipal judge. The board denied his application after a protest was filed. The board found that the applicant had not practiced law for the immediately preceding five-years as required by Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 1901.06. The court overruled the demurrer and denied the writ of mandamus. The court held as follows: 1) Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 1901.06 was not unconstitutional because the Ohio Constitution was silent as to the qualifications of municipal judges and the legislature had authority to set the qualifications for the position; 2) the board had statutory authority to determine whether the applicant, if elected, could successfully assume the office he sought; 3) the board's determination was subject to judicial review only if procured by fraud or corruption, or where there had been a flagrant misinterpretation of a statute, or a clear disregard of legal provisions applicable thereto; and 4) the applicant's services as a referee in assisting a municipal judge was not the practice of law because Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4705.01 precluded a municipal judge from practicing law while performing his judicial duties.</SPAN></P>

E. F. Veterans' Association, Ohio Rainbow Division, Veterans of Foreign Wars, 83rd Division A. E. F. Veterans' Association, American Legion of Ohio and United Spanish War Veterans, are for rehabilitation of war veterans and for the promotion of patriotism.  These appropriations are made subject to reports by each of these organizations semiannually to the state controlling board and no release of funds for any six-month period shall be made until the state controlling board has received a report of the expenditures made from these appropriations for the prior sixmonth period.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The petition alleges that the relators are taxpayers and citizens of the state of Ohio; and that respondent state officers are proposing to release official funds of the state to respondent private veterans organizations, pursuant to appropriations made by Amended House Bill No. 10 of the General Assembly of Ohio, for the fiscal biennium 1953-1955.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is alleged that the respondent veterans organizations are private organizations, organized for private purposes, conducted privately and have memberships determined by the organizations themselves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is alleged that the releasing of such&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  funds was in violation of the Constitution of Ohio and constituted an expenditure of public funds for private purposes and the taking of private property; that said appropriations were in direct violation of the Constitution of the state of Ohio, prohibiting the giving or lending of the state's credit to private individuals or organizations; and that the appropriation act in question is an unlawful delegation of the legislative power of the General Assembly of Ohio to the respondent veterans organizations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The petition alleges further that demand had been made on the respondent state officers not to pay out this fund to said organizations, but that said demand had been refused.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Answers of the respondents affirmatively allege that they are and have been accredited to appear and practice before the Veterans Administration and to represent before it veterans of all the wars of our country and their dependents.  (The Veterans Administration administers and handles all the rehabilitation facilities of the federal government for veterans, including financial compensation for the wounded and disabled.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Respondents answer further that the funds appropriated to each by the General Assembly&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of Ohio are for a public purpose, and that said state funds are not under the control of the various respondent veterans organizations or their officers, as such, but only so that the provisions of the act governing and controlling the expenditure of said appropriations may be carried out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Respondents answer further that the funds appropriated by the state are not commingled with the dues and other funds of these veterans organizations, but the state funds are kept in separate bank accounts and a separate set of books maintained to account for the funds appropriated for the uses and purposes set out in the statute.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The respondents American Legion, Department of American Veterans, Veterans of Foreign Wars and Disabled American Veterans answer further that each is chartered by act of Congress and that eligibility for membership in each of said organizations is determined by act of Congress.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Respondents answer further that the funds appropriated are under the supervision of the state of Ohio; and that each of the respondent veterans organizations is required to report each six months to the controlling board setting out how expenditures of the funds for the previous six months have&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  been made.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Each answer contains a general denial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Court of Common Pleas held that the appropriations complained of in the petition are unconstitutional and enjoined their payment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">A bill passed by the General Assembly of Ohio that appropriated funds to respondent veterans associations, and relator taxpayers sought to enjoin respondent state officers from distributing those funds. The trial court found that the legislation was unconstitutional and enjoined the payments, but the intermediate appellate court reversed, holding the appropriations to be valid. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that the appropriation of funds for respondent veterans associations provided for expenditures for a public purpose. The court determined that Ohio Const. art VIII, &sect; 4 permitted the legislature to appropriate public money to private corporations for a public purpose. In this case, the appropriations were made for the rehabilitation of war veterans and for the promotion of patriotism. The court found that Ohio had no agency except respondent veterans associations to aid veterans in making claims to the Veterans Administration, thereby performing a function for the state. The court analyzed the legislation by liberally construing it and by giving it every reasonable presumption of constitutionality.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">The court affirmed the intermediate appellate court's finding that legislation appropriating funds to respondent veterans associations was valid and constitutional because the rehabilitation of war veterans and the promotion of patriotism was a public purpose for which public moneys could be appropriated to private corporations under the Ohio Constitution.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  APPEALS from the Board of Tax Appeals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In case No. 34218, the appellant, Interstate Motor Freight System, has appealed from a decision of the Board of Tax Appeals affirming an order of the Tax Commissioner refusing a claim for refund for taxes (sometimes referred to as the axle-mile tax) levied against it under the Highway Use Tax Act, Sections 5728.01 to 5728.15, inclusive, Revised Code, which taxes were claimed to have been paid erroneously.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The appellant is a Delaware corporation having its principal place of business in the city of Grand Rapids, Michigan, and is engaged in the transportation of property for hire as a common carrier by motor vehicle in interstate commerce over highways located within the state of Ohio and 16 other states of the United States, under authority by the Interstate Commerce Commission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The appellant claims that the highway use taxes paid to the state of Ohio from October 1, 1953, to March 31, 1954, in the amount of $ 29,533.59, were erroneously paid for the reason that there is presently in existence a reciprocity agreement between the state of Ohio and the state of Michigan, dated October 26, 1937, under which agreement those states agree to waive&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and forego &quot;license plate taxes, including weight taxes for motor vehicles and also mileage fees for their operations including Ohio taxes levied under the provisions of Sections 614-94, 614-112, 6291, 6292 and 6293, and any connected provisions of the Ohio General Code, or which may be levied or payable in lieu of such provisions.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The matter was submitted to the Tax Commissioner who, in denying the refund, held in part as follows:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Tax Commissioner finds it unnecessary to ascertain the validity or existence of the alleged agreement of October 26, 1937, since by the provisions of Section 15 of the Highway Use Tax Act (Amended Substitute House Bill No. 619, Section 5728.15 of the Revised Code) the Legislature has provided the manner in which reciprocal agreements relating to the highway use tax law may be effected.  The Tax Commissioner finds that said section is controlling over any existing reciprocal agreements that may be in effect between Ohio and her sister states and that no reciprocal agreements have been entered into between Ohio and Michigan under the above noted provisions of the highway use tax law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Tax Commissioner further finds that the highway use tax law&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  makes no provision for authorizing refunds except as provided in section 6 of the act ( Section 5728.06 of the Revised Code) which section authorizes refunds on taxes paid for axles not actually used.  There is no provision in the act which authorizes refunds on tax alleged to have been erroneously paid.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An appeal was prosecuted to the Board of Tax Appeals and that body affirmed the order of the Tax Commissioner, two of its members writing concurring opinions and one a dissenting opinion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Case No. 34407 is the appeal of Geo. F. Alger Company and six other nonresident corporations from the Board of Tax Appeals, growing out of 10 separate final orders of the Tax Commissioner in which that officer refused to grant their petition for reassessment of highway use taxes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was stipulated that the appellant companies are nonresident motor carriers engaged in the business of transporting freight for hire in interstate commerce under certificates of public convenience and necessity issued to them by the Interstate Commerce Commission, and that such companies have registered the certificates with the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio and have been granted and hold authority to conduct motor&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  carrier operations in interstate commerce over the public highways of Ohio.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The assessments, which are the subject of this appeal, were made by the Tax Commissioner for the first two quarter periods under the Highway Use Tax Act and cover the period from October 1, 1953, to March 31, 1954.  Each assessment order provides that no penalty shall be added to the basic assessment if the assessment is paid within 30 days after final determination by the Board of Tax Appeals or the Supreme Court.  Otherwise a 15 per cent penalty is to apply to the basic assessment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An appeal was prosecuted from the assessment made by the Tax Commissioner to the Board of Tax Appeals by each of the appellant companies.  Although each of the appeals was separately docketed, the ten cases were consolidated by the Board of Tax Appeals for hearing because the same questions were raised in each appeal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the appeal by the Geo. F. Alger Company the claim was made that the assessment of the Tax Commissioner imposed a tax which is illegal, excessive, discriminatory and in violation of constitutional guaranties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Board of Tax Appeals affirmed the orders of the Tax Commissioner, reciting with approval in its&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  entry the following finding of the Tax Commissioner:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Tax Commissioner finds it unnecessary to ascertain the validity or the existence of the alleged agreement between said states since by the provisions of Section 15 of the Ohio Highway Use Tax Act (Amended Substitute House Bill No. 619, Section 5728.15 of the Revised Code), the Legislature has provided the manner in which reciprocal agreements relating to the highway use tax law may be effected.  The Tax Commissioner finds that said section is controlling over any existing reciprocal agreements that may be in effect between Ohio and her sister states and that no reciprocal agreements have been entered into between Ohio and Michigan under the above noted provisions of the highway use tax law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As to the constitutional question raised by the petitioner, the Tax Commissioner finds that he is without jurisdiction to set aside acts of the Legislature on the grounds that they are unconstitutional.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One member of the Board of Tax Appeals wrote an opinion, concurred in by a second member, and the third member wrote a dissenting opinion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The seven companies involved perfected an appeal to this court from the decision of the Board&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of Tax Appeals, assigning as error both the question as to the existence of a reciprocity agreement raised in the Interstate Motor Freight System appeal and the claims that the Highway Use Tax Act is unconstitutional.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">Appellants, Michigan motor carriers, sought review of the decisions of the Ohio Board of Tax Appeals, which affirmed the orders of appellee tax commissioner assessing highway use taxes against the carriers under the Highway Use Tax Act, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 5728.01 to 5728.15, for operating in Ohio, in several administrative proceedings consolidated for review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">The carries attacked the assessments made against them pursuant to the provisions of the Act and the decisions of the Board validating such tax. The carriers argued, among other things, that a reciprocity agreement between Ohio and Michigan provided that motor vehicles engaged in commercial transportation were exempt from the payment of any highway use tax. The court noted that the reciprocal agreement was duly enacted under the then existing statute and was still in force and effect between the two states. The court held that the subsequently enacted Act was not in conflict with the provisions of the reciprocity agreement or with the statutes that authorized the agreement. In fact, the Act carried the same or greater power to make such reciprocity agreements. The court further held that, as long as the agreement was in force, Ohio could not impose the highway use tax on commercial motor carriers operating out of Michigan in interstate commerce. Also, the commissioner had the power to refund illegally collected taxes under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 5703.05. Thus the Board's decisions were reversed and the commissioner was directed to make refunds.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">The decisions of the Board were reversed and the tax commissioner was ordered, in accordance herewith, to make refunds of taxes erroneously paid.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The city of Cleveland owns and operates a municipal water department which supplies water to the inhabitants of said city and surrounding territory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After public hearings thereon, certain ordinances and resolutions were passed and adopted providing for the fluoridation of such water, for the purpose of preventing dental caries.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is unnecessary to make an extensive review of the evidence before the trial court.  It consists of testimony and exhibits as to the value and effect of fluoridation as a preventive of dental caries.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">Appellant taxpayer sought review of a decision of the Court of Appeals for Cuyahoga County (Ohio), which entered judgment in favor of appellee city in a taxpayer's action which had sought a permanent injunction restraining the city and others from expending money for the fluoridation of the water. The taxpayer sought to declare certain resolutions and ordinances for the fluoridation of water unconstitutional and void.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">The taxpayer attacked the legislation on two grounds, first, that it infringed upon certain of his fundamental liberties, and, second, that it was beyond any power granted to municipalities by the laws and the Constitution of Ohio. The issue before the court was whether a municipality had the authority under its police power, in relation to public health, to add inorganic fluoride chemicals to its water supply, where such addition had for its sole purpose the prevention of dental caries. The taxpayer argued that for a valid exercise of the police power on the basis of public health, the subject matter of the regulation had to relate to contagious or infectious diseases, and that there had to exist an overriding necessity. On appeal, the court held that neither an overriding public necessity or emergency nor infectious or contagious diseases were the criteria which authorized the exercise of the police power in relation to public health. Dental caries was neither infectious nor contagious. Such, however, did not detract from the fact that it was a common disease of mankind. As such, its prevention and extermination came within the police power of the state.</SPAN></P>

The court allowed the writ, holding that &sect; 6(f), which permitted gasoline filling stations in retail business districts only in accordance with the provisions of a variance permit issued by the board of appeals, was an unconstitutional delegation of legislative authority because it did not contain any criteria or standards to guide the board, vesting it with absolute and uncontrolled discretion. The court further held that &sect; 6(f) was unconstitutional in its application by the officials, as shown by the numerous instances in which competitors of the property owner had been granted permits while the property owner's request was denied.

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The note was authorized by relator's resolution of February 18, 1954, in anticipation of the issuance of a first installment of $ 500,000 of bonds to be issued for the purpose of constructing a transportation subway in that part of the county popularly known as &quot;downtown Cleveland.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The issues in this case are presented by relator's petition, answer of the respondent, and relator's demurrer to the answer.  The pertinent properly pleaded facts thus admitted are substantially as follows:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Relator is the &quot;taxing authority&quot; and &quot;bond issuing authority&quot; of Cuyahoga County.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. On August 25, 1953, relator adopted and certified to the respondent within the time prescribed by law a resolution declaring the necessity of issuing bonds in the amount of $ 35,000,000 for the purpose of paying the cost of the construction of subways for transportation purposes, such subways to be owned by the county and to be operated for municipally owned transportation systems.  Respondent, on or after August 25, 1953, filed with relator a certificate fixing the maximum maturity of the subway bonds at 25 years and two years for the note issued&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  in anticipation of the issuance of the subway bonds.  Such certificate also stated on its face that the life of usefulness is at least ten years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Such certificate of maximum maturity was recorded in relator's loose-leaf journal, but the journal record of the proceedings of August 25, 1953, was not signed by any of the three members of relator or certified as being a true and correct record by its president and clerk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Respondent timely filed with relator a certificate wherein he calculated and certified the average annual levy throughout the estimated 25-year period of the bonds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Relator on August 31, 1953, adopted a resolution submitting to the electors the question of issuing bonds in the sum of $ 35,000,000 for the purpose of paying all the costs of the construction of subways, under authority of Section 2433-3, General Code, passed as an emergency measure by the General Assembly June 11, 1953, and approved by the Governor June 26, 1953.  Said resolution, together with the amount of the average tax levy so estimated and the maximum number of years to retire said bonds, was certified to the Board of Elections of Cuyahoga County within the time required by law, and the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  board of elections gave due notice of the election.  At said election held November 3, 1953, more than 55 per cent of the electors voting on the question voted in favor of the issuance of the subway bonds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. On February 18, 1954, relator adopted the note resolution hereinbefore referred to, and the note was accepted by the county treasurer as officer in charge of the bond retirement fund of the county.</SPAN></P>

The court sustained relators' demurrer as to each defense of respondent's answer and allowed the writ of mandamus compelling respondent to execute the note. The court concluded that the statutory authority for the construction of the proposed subway and the procedure taken by the county thereunder did not contemplate a gift of county property to any private entity in violation of Ohio Const. art. VII, &sect; 6 and held that it made no difference that there was no financial consideration passing to the county from publicly owned transportation systems for its use. Section 6 had no application since the construction of the subway was for the use of municipally owned transportation systems and not for privately owned systems. The court held the bonds did not violate the requirements of taxation by uniform rule under Ohio Const. art XII, &sect; 2 even though the subway would only be used by a fraction of the county population.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  APPEAL from the Court of Appeals for Hamilton County.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On June 10, 1953, appellees, hereinafter designated plaintiffs, instituted an action in equity in the Court of Common Pleas of Hamilton County against appellants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In their amended petition plaintiffs allege that each of them is an owner of residential property located in the unincorporated area of Sycamore Township in Hamilton County; that the defendants are the duly elected and acting county commissioners of Hamilton County and the building inspector thereof; that the action is brought in behalf of plaintiffs and many others similarly situated, pursuant to Section 3180-36, General Code; that plaintiffs' residences are approximately 15 miles from the city of Cincinnati, where their attorney has his office; that due to the numerous persons involved and the nature of the case it was impossible for them to prepare their petition, following the order of the county commissioners referred to hereinafter, prior to the date of the commencement of the action; and that to require plaintiffs to file their petition within ten days from the date of the order of the county commissioners would constitute an undue hardship upon plaintiffs and&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  deny them due process of law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plaintiffs allege further that in the year 1948 the Hamilton County Rural Zoning Commission conducted a field survey of all the unincorporated territory in the county, and that as the result of such survey the commission found a then existing necessity of zoning such unincorporated area as being the only means available to protect property owners against the harmful effects of use of neighboring property, whereupon the county commissioners passed a zoning resolution on August 10, 1949, which was submitted to the voters of the townships and was favorably voted upon by the voters of Sycamore Township.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As part of the zoning resolution a zone map of the county was adopted, dividing the county and townships into districts, including residential A, residential B, residential C, retail business D, light industry F, heavy industry G, and resort H.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On December 20, 1952, an application for zone change was filed with the zoning commission, seeking a change of property, containing 134 acres, from the original classification of residential A, B, and C to industrial G, which application gave as a reason for the requested change, &quot;lack of sufficient land in the county&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  which was zoned industrial.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hearings were held in accordance with law, and the application came before the county commissioners with recommendations from the zoning commission and the Hamilton County Regional Planning Commission of the change requested.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On May 19, 1953, a hearing was held on the application by the county commissioners, and on May 26, 1953, they passed a resolution entitled, &quot;Zoning Amendment No. 30,&quot; approving the change of zoning from residential A, B, and C to industrial G.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The plaintiffs allege further that the county commissioners acted arbitrarily and capriciously in that the zoning amendment states no facts upon which the county commissioners reached their conclusion, and that, unless the court intervenes, the zoning amendment will become effective on June 25, 1953, and the defendant county building inspector will issue building permits permitting the erection of industrialtype buildings on the 134-acre tract.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The plaintiffs allege further that the use of these premises for industrial purposes will result in great congestion of population, increased traffic problems, overcrowded schools, destruction of the privacy of plaintiffs' property, creation of noise&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and confusion in what is now a quiet and peaceful community, lessening of property values, and great harm to the county zoning plan and property owners; that the order of the county commissioners violates Section 1, Article I of the Constitution of Ohio, and Section 1, Article XIV of the Amendments to the Constitution of the United States, in that &quot;the Board of County Commissioners acted arbitrarily and unreasonably, and solely to meet the demands made upon it by those who contended that the passage of said resolution was necessary to raise additional funds for the township schools; and further said resolution is unreasonable and not a proper exercise of the police powers, in that it denies to persons thereby the equal protection of the laws and has no reasonable relation to public health, safety and welfare of said local community and the entire county.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plaintiffs allege further that they have no adequate remedy at law and pray that the resolution be held unconstitutional and void and that an injunction be granted to prevent its enforcement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendants filed a demurrer to the amended petition upon three grounds:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The court has no jurisdiction of the subject matter of the action. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  2. The action was not brought within the time limited for the commencement of such action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The petition does not state facts which show a cause of action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Court of Common Pleas sustained the demurrer, and, plaintiffs having failed to plead further, that court, upon motion, dismissed the amended petition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An appeal on questions of law was perfected to the Court of Appeals which, finding in its journal entry that there was error upon the face of the record to the prejudice of plaintiffs in that the Court of Common Pleas erred in sustaining the demurrer and in dismissing the amended petition, reversed the judgment of the Court of Common Pleas and remanded the cause to that court for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cause is before this court upon the allowance of a motion to certify the record.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">The Board passed a resolution changing certain land zoning to industrial.

On further appeal, the court reversed and dismissed the petition. The court held that, while the applicable time frame for the petition was 15 days under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 307.56, the petition itself was not capable of being entertained. The court determined that the failure of the residential homeowners to pursue administrative remedies under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 313.12 rendered the petition untenable.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is an action in mandamus originating in this court, in which the relator, the Director of Public Welfare of Ohio, seeks to require the respondents, commissioners of Harrison County, to make and maintain certain records and accounting procedures and to make certain reports to the Department of Public Welfare concerning the administration of aid to the permanently and totally disabled in Harrison County.  The facts are not in dispute.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1950, the Congress of the United States passed Sections 1351 to 1355, inclusive, Title 42, U.S. Code, a part of the Social Security Act, whereby federal funds are made available for aid to the permanently and totally disabled in each of those states which submits a &quot;state plan&quot; for such aid which complies with the conditions required by the act.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Department of Public Welfare submitted to the federal administrative authority a &quot;state plan&quot; of its own adoption, but not adopted by the General Assembly, a description of which is set out in the petition filed herein.  By the provisions of Section 5113.02, Revised Code, the administration of poor relief in each county outside the corporate limits of any city is made the responsibility&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of the commissioners of the county, and by the provisions of Section 5113.11, Revised Code, a county local relief authority, which includes the commissioners of the county, may act as the agent of state or federal authorities in any matter relating to public welfare.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The petition in part and in substance sets forth that the state Department of Public Welfare is charged by law with the duty of supervision of the administration of poor relief by county relief authorities and is authorized by law to make reasonable rules for the effective administration of poor relief and to prescribe forms and to require reports from local relief authorities, either directly or through any county officer or board, in such form as the director of such department shall prescribe; that the United States has made certain grants of money to the state of Ohio for payment of a portion of the cost of poor relief to indigent persons who are totally and permanently disabled, conditioned upon the use of such funds by the state of Ohio for the objects and purposes set out in the federal statute; that such grants have been accepted by the state of Ohio, and the sums so received have been appropriated by the General&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Assembly, under provisions of the general appropriation act, for expenditure, distribution and use for the purpose for which such grants were received by the state of Ohio; that the conditions upon which such grants were made to the state of Ohio are those set out in the federal Social Security Act, and in order to comply with such conditions the Ohio Department of Public Welfare, in the exercise of its statutory authority to make reasonable rules for the effective administration of poor relief, adopted a &quot;state plan&quot; for the administration of poor relief to indigent persons who are permanently and totally disabled; that the Department of Public Welfare in order to qualify the state for grants from the federal government for aid to individuals 18 years of age or older who are permanently and totally disabled, which funds the department is receiving and distributing to the proper aid authorities throughout the state, adopted &quot;Executive Order No. 25&quot; which established a &quot;Rotary Fund L. Federal -- Permanently and Totally Disabled,&quot; under I Rotary in the Division of Social Administration, into which are paid all funds received from the federal government to provide aid for the permanently&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and totally disabled, as provided by Section 3391-1, General Code, and other related sections; that the proper officer of the Department of Public Welfare shall pay to each county relief authority for each quarter from this rotary fund certain percentages of the federal relief funds expended by such authority during such quarter, under rules established by the federal authorities, to reimburse such county relief authority for funds expended by it in aid to the permanently and totally disabled; that separate records and accounting procedures pertaining to the granting of such aid must be kept and maintained by each county relief authority and the Department of Public Welfare; that one of the conditions under which the state of Ohio receives such grants of federal funds is that the Department of Public Welfare shall make certain reports to the federal government, and, in order to provide the information on which to prepare such reports, the Department of Public Welfare included in such &quot;state plan&quot; requirements that county relief authorities maintain separate records and accounting procedures and submit to it certain reports pertinent to the granting of aid to persons who are permanently&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and totally disabled; that the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">department has made demand</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on such county relief authorities, including the respondents, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">as authorized by Section 5113.09, Revised Code, for such reports on forms prescribed by the department</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">; and that the respondents, as the county relief authority of Harrison County, have failed and refused to comply with the requirements of such &quot;plan&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">or to make and return such reports as to such aid and its expenditures</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, in violation of a legal duty to do so.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The prayer of the petition is that the respondents be required to make and maintain such records and make reports at stated intervals to the department showing the number of permanently and totally disabled persons to whom poor relief payments have been made and the aggregate of the sum so dispersed, separately from similar reports as to disbursement of poor relief funds to other persons in such county.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The respondents filed a demurrer to the petition on the ground that the latter does not state a cause of action warranting the relief sought.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">Before the court was an action in mandamus in which relator state director sought to require respondent county commissioners to make and maintain certain records and accounting procedures and to make certain reports to the Department of Public Welfare concerning the administration of aid to the permanently and totally disabled in the county.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">The director requested the commissioners to make and maintain certain records and accounting procedures and to make certain reports to the Department of Public Welfare concerning the administration of aid to the permanently and totally disabled in the county. The commissioners refused, and the director instituted a mandamus action to compel compliance with the request. The commissioners demurred to the petition contending that the director lacked the authority to make such a request, and that the director's plan was unconstitutional and illegal as it conflicted with state legislation. The court noted that any discrepancies between the plan and state statutory requirements were a matter of concern for the federal authorities that furnished the funds. Inasmuch as neither the state nor the individual counties receiving such funds were in any way responsible for their repayment or reimbursement to the federal government, such discrepancies were not a matter of legal concern for the commissioners. Furthermore, the action of the director was within the broad authority granted to make rules and to require an accounting of dependent individuals. According, the writ was issued.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the Court of Common Pleas the relator, solely as a taxpayer, instituted this action for the purpose of obtaining an injunction to restrain the respondent Ohio State Racing Commission from expending funds of the state of Ohio or issuing permits for the conducting of horse racing in this state.  Additional parties respondent are the Auditor of State and the Treasurer of State.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To the relator's petition the respondents filed a demurrer on the two grounds that the relator taxpayer lacks the legal capacity to sue and that there is a defect of parties respondent.

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then the relator filed an amended petition.

The court noted that, even in the absence of a statute, a taxpayer could call upon a court of equity to prevent the illegal expenditure of public money if he, in common with other property holders of the taxing district, may otherwise be compelled to pay. However, because Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3769.10 only authorized the commission to expend those public funds collected from a special class of taxpayers, of whom the taxpayer was not a member, the taxpayer had no special interest in the funds involved, and he lacked the legal capacity to prosecute the action.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court noted that the United States Supreme Court handed down several decisions which essentially declared the Act to be unconstitutional. However, because fewer than six members of the court were of the opinion that the Act was unconstitutional, the court stated that it could not declare the Act unconstitutional. Yet, because the majority of the court believed the United States Supreme Court's decisions amounted to a declaration that the Act was in fact unconstitutional, the court held that any orders issued by the Department pursuant to the Act were &quot;unreasonable&quot; and &quot;unlawful&quot; within the meaning of Ohio Rev.

It was not a reasonable designation of the electors of one county for special treatment as distinguished from those of the other counties, but on the other hand it was an unjust and capricious classification. Furthermore, the classification was not based upon a real distinction. The court held that that portion of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3513.256, referring to counties with a population of one million or more, which included only one county, was in conflict with Ohio Const. art.

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is an action &quot;for declaratory judgment, injunction and equitable relief&quot; brought by Earl L. and Myrtle M. Stary, partners doing business as Ideal Trailer Park, against the city of Brooklyn located in Cuyahoga county and the mayor, chief of police, building inspector and fire chief of the city of Brooklyn.  The petition was filed November 2, 1951.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In May of 1952, A. W. Christian and Ralph H. Bassett, by leave, intervened as petitioners.  They were occupants of the trailer camp here involved.  The plaintiffs seek judgment in reference to the validity of an ordinance enacted by the city of Brooklyn regulating trailers and trailer camps within the limits of the city of Brooklyn.  The original ordinance was enacted July 8, 1940, and was amended in some particulars on three occasions, the last being in 1947.  Section 7 of the ordinance against which the criticisms of the plaintiffs are chiefly directed has not been changed so far as the record reveals.  That section provides:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It shall be unlawful for any person to park or occupy a trailer in a trailer camp for more than sixty days, and no trailer camp licensee shall permit a&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  trailer or occupants thereof to remain in a trailer camp for more than sixty days; nor shall a trailer licensee permit a trailer or the occupants thereof to re-enter the trailer camp for ninety days after the expiration date of a former occupancy; and it shall be unlawful for the occupants of a trailer to park or occupy a trailer in any trailer camp for ninety days after the expiration date of a former occupancy in any other trailer camp within the village limits.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The same ordinance was the subject of litigation on a previous occasion and the decision of this court in respect thereto, rendered April 1, 1942, is reported as </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Renker </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">v.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8"> Village of Brooklyn</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 139 Ohio St., 484, 40 N. E. (2d), 925. In that case, the constitutionality of the ordinance was attacked, with particular reference to section 7, and this court held the ordinance constitutional.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the present action, which was instituted approximately nine years after the decision of this court in the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Renker case</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, the plaintiffs urge the following three principal grounds for relief against the ordinance, which they assert did not exist at the time of the trial of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Renker case</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(1) Change in conditions, including&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  particularly a great increase in the use of house trailers, increase in the average size thereof and great improvements in their construction and equipment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(2) The enactment by the General Assembly of Ohio in 1951 of an act (Sections 1235-1 to 1235-5, inclusive, General Code) with respect to the regulation of house-trailer parks, in which act the Public Health Council was authorized to &quot;make regulations to be of general application throughout the state governing the location, layout, construction, drainage, sanitation, safety and operation of house-trailer parks.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(3) The adoption in December 1951 by the Public Health Council of comprehensive regulations with respect to trailer parks pursuant to the aforesaid statutory authorization.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the instant case, the Common Pleas Court held that there is no conflict between the statutes above referred to and the city ordinance; that the ordinance in question is a valid exercise of the police power of the city; and that the plaintiffs are not entitled to injunctive relief.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Upon appeal the Court of Appeals affirmed the judgment of the Common Pleas Court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cause is in this court upon the allowance of a motion of the plaintiffs to certify&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the record.  </SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court upheld the lower court judgments, finding that the ordinance was not in conflict with state statutes and was not an illegal exercise of the police power. The court noted that the trailer parks in question housed trailers that were about 200 square feet in size, contained no bathrooms, and usually housed families with children. The court found that the ordinance was reasonable and directly related to the public health, safety, and welfare and was thus a constitutional exercise of local power.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">APPEAL from the Court of Appeals for Wood county.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These two cases involve the same primary question, viz., the right of the Ohio Turnpike Commission to acquire by appropriation proceedings the right to prohibit the erection of billboards, signs, notices, posters or other advertising devices on the remaining lands of the owner whose property is taken for turnpike construction purposes.  Because of this primary question, both cases will be considered and decided together.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cause No. 33868, hereinafter referred to as the Ellis case, originated in the Court of Common Pleas of Lucas County.  Ellis, the owner of two 50-acre tracts of land in Lucas county, one situated in the city of Maumee and the other in the cities of Toledo and Maumee, seeks to enjoin the Turnpike Commission from imposing on such land by appropriation a servitude whereby no billboards, signs and other advertising media may be placed thereon.  A demurrer to the petition was sustained by the trial court and the petition dismissed.  An appeal on questions of law and fact was perfected to the Court of Appeals where the petition was dismissed with prejudice and judgment&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  was rendered for the Turnpike Commission with costs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cause is before this court on appeal as of right and pursuant to the allowance of a motion to certify the record.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cause No. 33901, hereinafter referred to as the Solether case, had its inception in the Court of Common Pleas of Wood County.  In this action, too, Solether, the owner of land in Lake township, Wood county, asks for an injunction &quot;restraining and prohibiting the defendant [Turnpike Commission] from the acquisition of the rights she [Solether] may have to signs or/and other advertising devices set forth in its action brought against her in cause No. 32866 and pending in this court.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As in the Ellis case, a demurrer to the petition was sustained by the trial court and the action dismissed.  However, on an appeal on questions of law to the Court of Appeals, that court, by a majority vote, decided that the petition is sufficient as against demurrer and remanded the cause for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In its opinion the Court of Appeals said:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;* * * a majority of this court conclude that an owner whose property rights are sought to be appropriated by the Turnpike Commission has the right to institute an action for&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  a judicial determination upon the evidence adduced at the trial thereof -- (1) whether the taking of such rights is reasonably necessary to the operation of the turnpike, and (2) whether such rights are to be taken for a public purpose.  * * * If the evidence should disclose that the taking is unnecessary or not for public use, it follows that such attempted taking is unreasonable and unlawful.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The allowance of a motion to certify the record brings the Solether cause here for review.  </SPAN></P>

The court held that no express statutory authority was given the commission which enabled it by appropriation proceedings to deny the owners of land taken for the construction of a turnpike the right to use the remaining lands for the erection and maintenance of advertising devices.

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is an appeal to this court from a judgment of the Court of Appeals for Mahoning county affirming a judgment of the Common Pleas Court of that county in an action wherein the defendant The Lake Erie Coal &amp; Supply Company was enjoined from stripmining coal from the lands of the defendants, Juillerat and Marrie, in Poland township, Mahoning county.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The plaintiffs own residential properties which abut or are adjacent to the lands of the defendants, all of which are in a rural residential area less than one mile from the limits of the village of Poland, Mahoning county.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There existed certain leases between the coal company and the defendant property owners for stripmining coal.  These leases were entered into prior to the enactment of a zoning ordinance adopted by the trustees of Poland township.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On October 21, 1949, the coal company applied for a license to strip-mine coal, which license was issued on November 2, 1949, and on that date the company posted a bond covering five acres of the land under lease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The petition filed by the plaintiffs on October 21, 1949, alleges that the proposed strip-mining operations of the coal&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  company would constitute a nuisance, and that a township zoning law which made stripmining in that area unlawful was awaiting submission to the electorate of the township.  A temporary restraining order was granted upon the filing of the petition.  On November 4, 1949, the defendants filed a motion to dissolve the temporary restraining order.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At an election held November 8, 1949, a majority of the electors of the unincorporated area of Poland township adopted a zoning ordinance for that area, which included the lands in question, became effective November 13, 1949, and prohibited the strip-mining of coal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the hearing on November 9, 1949, the plaintiffs filed and served upon the defendants a supplemental petition alleging the passage of the zoning ordinance and claiming that its passage constituted an additional ground for granting a permanent injunction as prayed for.  The coal company filed an answer to the original and supplemental petitions, and defendants Juillerat and Marrie filed an answer to the petition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the time plaintiffs' action was commenced, defendants had drilled a hole for testing purposes on the Juillerat property but had removed no coal from either property&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  before the zoning ordinance became effective.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trial court granted a permanent injunction against strip-mining operations, by the coal company, on the properties in question, on the ground &quot;that the operations proposed by defendants are illegal by reason of the duly adopted and constitutional zone legislation.&quot; The court found &quot;that plaintiffs are not barred from seeking equitable relief upon any principle of laches or estoppel.&quot; The court did not determine whether the proposed operations would amount to a common-law nuisance.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">On October 21, 1949, the coal company applied for a license to strip-mine coal on the lessors' land in Poland township. Also on that date, the neighbors sought and received a temporary restraining order to prevent the operations. On November 2, 1949, the coal company's license was granted. At a November 8, 1949 election, a majority of the electors of Poland township adopted a zoning ordinance prohibiting the strip-mining of coal. The trial court subsequently granted the neighbors a permanent injunction, and the appellate court affirmed the judgment. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment of the appellate court. The court found that the operation of an ordinance might affect the rights of both the parties to a contract but not their rights inter se. Finding that the record supported a finding that appellants had not perfected a pre-existing nonconforming use in the operation of a strip mine prior to the effective date of the ordinance, the court held that the zoning ordinance did not impair the obligation of the contract between appellants and that appellants had no vested right to use of the land as a strip mine.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On October 12, 1948, Regina Tary, hereinafter referred to as the claimant, was employed by Konopak &amp; Dalton, certified public accountants of Toledo, Ohio, to do statistical work and was so employed until her employment was terminated on November 11, 1949.  At no time during this period of employment was she required to work on Saturdays.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thereafter, she applied for unemployment benefits.  Her application was approved on November 25, 1949, and she received such benefits until January 13, 1950.  On that date she was referred by a representative of the Ohio State Employment Service for employment which would have required her to work half a day on Saturdays.  She refused to accept employment on this referral.  The Administrator of the Bureau of Unemployment Compensation thereupon suspended her unemployment compensation benefits, and she appealed to the Board of Review of the Bureau of Unemployment Compensation.  The referee affirmed the decision of the administrator and the Board of Review disallowed the application for a further appeal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She then appealed to the Court of Common Pleas of Lucas County which reversed the action of the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Board of Review.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">The claimant was a member of a church that did not allow its members to do any secular work on their Sabbath day, which was Saturday. While she was receiving unemployment compensation, the claimant refused a job referral because it would have required her to work a half-day on Saturday. The court affirmed the judgment that the claimant should continue to receive unemployment benefits. The court stated that under the prior version of Ohio Gen. Code &sect; 1345-6, a claimant could not refuse a job under these circumstances; the only standard was the fitness of the claimant for the work. After the amendment to &sect; 1345-6, which included a charge that the administrator shall consider, among other things, the degree of risk to a claimant's morals, a claimant could refuse a job on this basis. There was no question that the claimant here was a faithful member of her church and the court was of the opinion that the acceptance of the proffered employment would have seriously offended the claimant's morals based on her sense of duty and her religious conscience.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This cause arose under the so-called Uniform Dependent's Act as embodied in Act No. 50 (1951) of the General Assembly of Pennsylvania and in Sections 8007-1 to 8007-19, inclusive, Ohio General Code (Sections 3115.01 to 3115.15, Revised Code).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On October 27, 1952, the relator initiated this proceeding by filing a complaint in the Court of Quarter Sessions, Mercer county, Pennsylvania, in which it is alleged that the complaint is made on behalf of Lawrence A. Mong of Wheatland, Pennsylvania; that respondent, James Mong, is a legally responsible relative, to wit, a son of Lawrence Mong; and that the respondent is financially able to contribute to his support.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Pennsylvania court examined said complaint and certified it to the Court of Common Pleas of Huron County, Ohio, which was the alleged place of residence of respondent, together with a certified copy of the &quot;Uniform Support Law of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After notice was served upon the respondent, a hearing was had in the Common Pleas Court of Huron County and evidence was received as to his ability to contribute to the father's support and as to respondent's&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  claim of exemption from liability to so contribute.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Common Pleas Court ordered the respondent to pay $ 21 per month to the clerk for transmission to the probation officer of Mercer county, Pennsylvania, toward the support of his father.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The respondent appealed from that judgment, and the Court of Appeals reversed such judgment on the ground that it &quot;is contrary to law.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This court granted relator's motion to certify the record.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">In an action controlled by Ohio Gen. Code &sect; 12431, appellant, the Commonwealth Of Pennsylvania, sought review of a decision of the Court of Appeals for Huron County (Ohio) that reversed a decision finding appellee Ohio resident liable for the support of his father, a Pennsylvania resident, pursuant to the Uniform Dependent's Act, Ohio Gen. Code &sect;&sect; 8007-1 to 8007-19.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">This claim was originally brought in a Pennsylvania court and then certified to the trial court in Ohio. It was brought on behalf of relator, a resident of Pennsylvania and the father of the Ohio resident, seeking support from his son, the Ohio resident, pursuant to the Act. The trial court found for the father. On appeal, the court reversed. First, both Pennsylvania and Ohio had adopted the Act; however, Ohio's version, codified at Ohio Gen. Code &sect; 12431, did not require a son to support his father if the son had been abandoned or neglected. Pennsylvania's version of the Act had no such provision. There was no dispute that the Ohio resident had been abandoned by his father. Thus, the issue became which version of the Act was appropriately applied in the instant action. The court noted that the Ohio resident was a citizen of Ohio, entitled to all the rights and privileges accorded by the laws of Ohio to its citizens, and to the equal protection of its laws. The court held that requiring him to make support payments compulsory under the law of another state would be violative of his right to equal protection. Accordingly, there was no error.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The facts in this case are not in dispute.  One Harry Nowakowski was employed by relator and its predecessors continuously from May 15, 1928, through October 26, 1948.  On July 16, 1949, he filed his application with the Industrial Commission for compensation on account of claimed total disability resulting from silicosis, a compensable occupational disease, contracted in the course of such employment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pursuant to the consideration of such claim, the Cleveland District Board of Claims of the Industrial Commission on September 18, 1950, entered an order finding that Nowakowski was exposed to silica dust up to the time he quit work on October 26, 1948; that he was permanently and totally disabled due to silicosis contracted in the course of employment and associated with an unrelated heart disease; and that without the simple silicosis he would not have been disabled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The board ordered that Nowakowski's average weekly wage be fixed at $ 71.95; and that his employer, relator herein, as a self-insurer pay him compensation for permanent total disability at the maximum rate beginning October 27, 1948.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pursuant to the order, the relator paid Nowakowski compensation from&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  October 27, 1948, to May 2, 1952, in the total amount of $ 4,517.86.  Upon the latter date he died as a result of the silicosis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On August 20, 1952, relator filed with the commission a notice of the death of the decedent, recognizing his widow, Mary Nowakowski, as being wholly dependent upon him and stating that, in addition to an allowance of $ 300 for funeral expenses, there was due such dependent in weekly payments of $ 25 each the sum of $ 2,982.14, such sum being the difference between $ 7,500, the maximum death award, and $ 4,517.86, the amount paid to the decedent during his lifetime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Upon hearing, the commission found that the death of the decedent resulted from silicosis contracted in the course of his employment; that his widow was wholly dependent upon the decedent at the time of his death; and that she was entitled, in addition to a funeral allowance of $ 400, to the maximum death award of $ 9,000 less $ 4,517.86 theretofore paid to the decedent in his lifetime, or the sum of $ 4,482.14, at the rate of $ 32.30 per week beginning May 3, 1952.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The difference between the amount of the award conceded by the relator to be due to the widow and the award actually made to her&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  by the commission is due to amendment of the statutes, fixing a maximum death award and a maximum allowance for funeral expenses, effective after the date of decedent's injury and before the date of his death.  At the time of decedent's injury, Section 1465-82, General Code ( Section 4123.59, Revised Code), fixed the maximum death award at $ 7,500, and Section 1465-89, General Code ( Section 4123.66, Revised Code), fixed the maximum allowance for funeral expenses at $ 300.  By amendment of those statutes, effective September 18, 1951, the maximum death award was increased to $ 9,000, and the maximum allowance for funeral expenses was increased to $ 400.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The relator, through its petition in mandamus to compel an amendment of the award, claims that the maximum-death-award provision in effect on the date of injury, and not that in effect on the date of death, controls, and prays that the order of the commission be amended accordingly.  </SPAN></P>

DeMaioribus, Dan W. Duffy, and Daniel H. Wasserman, the duly appointed, qualified, and acting members of the Board of Elections of Cuyahoga County, and Ray C. Miller, clerk of such board.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his petition which was filed July 31, 1953, relator alleges the following:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At all times mentioned in such petition there was in force a statute of Ohio known as Section 4831-15, General Code, providing that the qualified electors residing within a portion of a municipality, which is part of a school district of another municipality, may petition the board of elections to submit to the qualified electors of the territory affected the proposal to transfer such portion of a territory which is in another municipality to the municipality of residence, so as to make the lines of such school district coincide with the corporate lines of the municipality of residence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are situated in Cuyahoga county the city of&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Fairview Park and the city of Rocky River which are adjacent to each other, and a portion of Fairview Park wherein relator resides has for some years been a portion of the school district which embraces all of Rocky River as well as the aforementioned portion of Fairview Park.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Relator, together with more than 10 per cent of the qualified electors in that portion of Fairview Park in the school district of Rocky River, signed a petition proposing to transfer such territory to the school district of Fairview Park so as to make the lines of such district coincide with the corporate lines of Fairview Park in accordance with Section 4831-15, General Code.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Such signed petition was filed with respondents on February 5, 1953, asking for a special election to be held at the primary election on May 5, 1953, or at the first election thereafter, and respondents duly accepted such petition with the statement that the question would be submitted at the general election on November 3, 1953.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On July 30, 1953, relator was advised by respondents that the question of the transfer of the territory would not appear on the ballot at the November 3, 1953, election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Relator prays that a writ of mandamus&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  issue to the respondents commanding them to prepare for and conduct an election at the general election on November 3, 1953, on the question of transferring that portion of Fairview Park which is part of the school district of Rocky River to the school district of Fairview Park so as to make the lines of such school district coincide with the corporate lines of Fairview Park.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Answers were filed by the Board of Education of the Rocky River City School District, which had obtained leave to become a new party respondent herein, the Board of Elections of Cuyahoga County, and the clerk thereof.  In the answers the allegations of the petition are admitted generally and, as a defense, it is alleged that the General Assembly enacted Amended House Bill No. 713 which was signed and approved by the Governor on July 17, 1953, and which read as follows:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;To repeal Section 3311.25 of the Revised Code relative to the transfer of school territory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Be it enacted by the General Assembly of the State of Ohio:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Section 1. That Section 3311.25 of the Revised Code [Section 4831-15, General Code] is hereby repealed, and all rights, elections, actions and proceedings now pending thereunder are hereby&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  null and void.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Respondents allege that on and after October 15, 1953, and on election day, November 3, 1953, there will be no authority in law to hold the election on the proposal set forth in relator's petition or to submit the issue to the qualified electors within that portion of Fairview Park referred to in relator's petition, and that by reason thereof it is respondents' intention not to present such question at such election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Relator filed a demurrer to the answers, on the ground that Amended House Bill No. 713 was unconstitutional in that it violated Sections 26 and 28, Article II of the Constitution of Ohio, and Section 10, Article I, and the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States.  </SPAN></P>

The elector petitioned for a writ of mandamus commanding the board members to prepare for and conduct an election on the question of the transfer. The board members alleged that there was no authority in law to hold the election. The elector filed a demurrer to the answer on the ground that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3311.25 was unconstitutional. On review, the court overruled the demurrer and denied the writ of mandamus. The court held that the denial of mandamus was proper because a mere change in a method or proceeding not involving any substantive rights did not violate any constitutional provision with reference to retroactive legislation or to impairment of contracts, and that a statute which provided a rule of practice, a course of procedure, or a method of review was remedial in its nature.</SPAN></P>

The city exceeded the lawful exercise of its police power in enacting these ordinances. While solicitations for charities were subject to the police power, such solicitations could be reasonably regulated only in order to protect the people from deceit, fraud, or the unscrupulous obtaining of money.

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first of these two causes was begun before the Board of Liquor Control, hereinafter designated board, by the Director of Liquor Control, hereinafter designated director, causing a citation to issue against appellant, D. E. Corn, hereinafter designated Corn, to show cause why his C-1, C-2, and D-5 permits, which by the terms thereof expired on December 17, 1950, should not be suspended or revoked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The citation was issued on June 6, 1950, with the hearing date before the board fixed for June 22, 1950.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The hearing was continued several times and was finally held on January 31, 1951, which was subsequent to the expiration date of the permits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the same day the board heard an appeal perfected to it on December 29, 1950, by Corn from an order of the director dated December 22, 1950, rejecting the applications of Corn for the renewal of the permits involved in the citation case, which permits had been placed in the possession of the Department of Liquor Control on March 30, 1950.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On February 1, 1951, the board entered an order in the appeal case and, on February 5, 1951, issued an order in the citation case.  Both orders were&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  adverse to Corn.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Corn, pursuant to the provisions of Section 154-73, General Code, appealed the citation and appeal cases to the Court of Common Pleas, in which court the appeals were submitted and heard jointly.  That court reversed the orders of the board in both cases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The board and the members thereof, the Department of Liquor Control, hereinafter called department, and the director appealed the causes to the Court of Appeals, in which court the causes were consolidated, argued, and heard as one case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Corn filed motions to dismiss the appeals in the Court of Appeals on the ground that no statutory or constitutional provision authorized the board, its members, the department, or the director to appeal to the Court of Appeals for a review of the judgments entered by the Court of Common Pleas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Court of Appeals overruled the motions to dismiss the appeals, heard the cases on the merits, reversed the judgments of the Court of Common Pleas in both causes and overruled applications for rehearing filed by Corn.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">Appellant licensee sought review of a judgment of the Court of Appeals for Franklin County (Ohio), which reversed the trial court's judgment, reversing Board of Liquor Control orders that cited the licensee and rejected his license renewal application. The licensee appealed the Board's orders pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code &sect; 154-73. Appellees, the Board, the Department of Liquor Control, and its Director, appealed from the trial court's judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">The licensee contended that the Administrative Procedure Act, Ohio Rev. Code &sect;&sect; 154-61 to 154-74, did not confer a right of appeal upon appellees from a judgment of the trial court reversing an order of the Board, and that under such Act the judgment of the trial court was final unless reversed upon appeal by the licensee. The court agreed. It reversed the appellate court, holding that it should have granted the licensee's motion to dismiss the appeals from the trial court's order. From the definitions in Ohio Rev. Code &sect; 154-62, it was obvious that the term, &quot;agency,&quot; included the Board, the Department, and the Director. That section provided that &quot;appeal&quot; included a procedure whereby a person aggrieved by an adjudication of an agency invoked the jurisdiction of a court, and &quot;party&quot; was defined to include persons whose interests were subject to an adjudication by an agency. Ohio Rev. Code &sect; 154-73 provided the method by which a party adversely affected by an order of an agency could perfect an appeal to the court of common pleas. The Board, the Department, and the Director, being agencies, could not be considered persons aggrieved by a decision, giving them a right of appeal.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IN MANDAMUS.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These three cases were heard and considered together since the same or similar questions are involved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In case No. 33265, the plaintiff was the producer and is the owner of a motion picture entitled &quot;M.&quot; On September 11, 1952, pursuant to the provisions of Sections 154-47 to 154-47</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">i</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, inclusive, General Code, the plaintiff submitted such motion picture to the Division of Film Censorship of the Department of Education for censorship and approval.  On September 16, 1952, the division issued a certificate rejecting the film for distribution and exhibition in the state of Ohio, the grounds of rejection being stated as &quot;on account of being harmful.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On September 25, 1952, the plaintiff commenced this action by filing its petition in this court pursuant to Section 154-47</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">h</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, General Code, and later filed its amended petition seeking to have this court vacate the order of rejection.  In its amended petition the plaintiff alleges that the motion picture in question &quot;artistically and dramatically publishes important social problems and either clearly suggest solutions therefor or so dramatically presents each such problem that anyone having&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  an opportunity to see the picture will become vitally interested in such problems and will more readily respond to efforts at a solution thereof in the community in which he lives&quot;; that the statutes in question constitute on their face, as applied to the plaintiff's motion picture, &quot;M,&quot; a prior restraint and censorship for which the standards of criteria are indefinite and vague and are repugnant to the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution of the United States and to Sections 2 and 11, Article I of the Constitution of Ohio; and that the statutes, to the extent that they require payment of a fee prior to the distribution and exhibition of motion pictures, are unconstitutional and void.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The answer of the defendant admits that on September 11, 1952, the plaintiff submitted its motion picture, &quot;M,&quot; to the defendant for censorship accompanied by the necessary fee, and that on September 16, 1952, defendant rejected the film for distribution and exhibition in the state of Ohio, but denies all other allegations.  The case was submitted on a stipulation of facts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Case No. 33282 is an action in mandamus by Classic Pictures, Inc., to require the respondent to accept for censorship&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Classic's motion picture, &quot;Native Son,&quot; pursuant to the provisions of Sections 154-47 to 154-47</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">i</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, inclusive, General Code.  Respondent's answer alleges that he refused to censor this picture because respondent had previously viewed and considered this motion picture on the application of Classic on three previous occasions after cuts and deletions had been made, and that he had issued a certificate of rejection of the motion picture on November 2, 1951, for the reason, as stated in such certificate, that it was &quot;harmful: because -- contributes to racial misunderstanding, presenting situations undesirable to the mutual interests of both races; against public interest in undermining confidence that justice can be carried out; presents racial frictions at a time when all groups should be united against everything that is subversive.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The answer alleges also that Classic failed to appeal from such rejection as provided by law, but on July 22, 1952, filed a petition in this court for a review of the order of rejection, and that on motion of respondent such petition was dismissed by the court on October 15, 1952.  The facts are undisputed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Case No. 33283 is an action in this court&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to set aside the order, referred to in case No. 33282, refusing to review the motion picture, and to require the issuance of a certificate approving the same, or in the alternative to direct the defendant to further review the motion picture, or in the alternative to declare &quot;Section 154-47 and subsections 154-47</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">a</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> through 154-47</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">i</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> of the General Code of Ohio, and each of them, unconstitutional and void.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The answer of the defendant alleges facts substantially the same as in the answer in case No. 33282.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Classic in its brief describes the picture film, &quot;Native Son,&quot; as follows:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;* * * The action of the story takes place in Chicago, and part of the picture was filmed there.  The role of the central character, Bigger Thomas, an embittered young negro, is acted by Richard Wright, the author of the book.  Bigger accidentally kills a white girl, Mary Dalton, and after disposing of her body, attempts to extort money from her parents by means of a ransom note.  After the murder is discovered, Bigger goes into hiding with his sweetheart, Bessie Mears, and immediately before his capture, murders Bessie in the mistaken belief that she betrayed him.  The picture ends with a scene between&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Bigger and his lawyer, in which it is made clear that Bigger will be electrocuted for his crimes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No record has been made in this case.  Classic seeks to treat the refusal of the defendant to issue a certificate as a final order and to obtain its vacation.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">Plaintiff, the producer and owner of a motion picture, filed a petition in mandamus seeking an order vacating an order of defendant, the Division of Film Censorship of the Department of Education (Ohio), rejecting the producer's film for distribution and exhibition in the state on the ground that the film was harmful. The producer challenged the constitutionality of Ohio Gen. Code &sect; 871-49 (1913), which allowed the Division to censor the film.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">The producer submitted its film to the Division for review prior to its publication, as required by &sect; 871-49. The Division rejected the film as harmful, finding that it contributed to racial misunderstanding and presented racial frictions, inter alia. The producer filed a petition seeking a writ of mandamus alleging that the film artistically and dramatically published important social problems. It argued that &sect; 871-49 was an unconstitutional prior restraint, repugnant to U.S. Const. amend. 1 and 14 and Ohio Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 2 and 11, and that its standards of criteria were unconstitutionally indefinite and vague. It asserted that motion pictures were entitled to the same protection as speech and the press. The court held that expression by motion picture was included within the free speech and free press guaranties of the federal and state constitutions; however, motion pictures were not granted absolute freedom. Prior restraint was proper to protect the public health, safety, and welfare. The standards specified in &sect; 871-49 had been specifically upheld by the United States Supreme Court as not unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">The court denied the producer's petition.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In ordinance No. 345-1951, the city council found that an area in said city described therein by metes and bounds, including Laurel Redevelopment Area No. 3, is an area in which the majority of the structures are detrimental to the public health, safety and welfare, and that said area is a blighted area.  In ordinance No. 347-1951, the council adopted a plan for the redevelopment of Laurel Redevelopment Area No. 3.  Thereafter, the council by resolution described Laurel Redevelopment Area No. 3 by metes and bounds and approved the foregoing redevelopment plan for that area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thereafter, by ordinance No. 197-1952, the city manager of Cincinnati was authorized to execute a loan and grant contract with the United States for&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  financial assistance in connection with redevelopment of Laurel Redevelopment Area No. 3.  Thereafter, that contract was duly executed on behalf of the United States and on behalf of the city.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By the terms of that contract the United States agrees to lend not to exceed $ 3,097,968 to the city to pay its cost and expense of undertaking and carrying out the redevelopment of Laurel Redevelopment Area No. 3 and of complying with the contract.  The purpose of the contract is to provide, under Title I of the Housing Act of 1949, for the extension by the federal government to the city of financial assistance with respect to the Laurel Redevelopment Area No. 3 project.  That project involves substantially:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(a) The acquisition by the city of all such land in the project area as shall be necessary to carry out the project redevelopment plan,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(b) The demolition and removal of any buildings and improvements on project land to the extent necessary to carry out that plan,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(c) The installation, construction and reconstruction of streets, utilities and other site improvements in the project area essential to the preparation of sites therein for uses in accordance with the plan, and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(d) The making&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  by the city of project land available for development and redevelopment by private enterprise or public agencies (including sale, initial leasing, or retention by the city itself) at its fair value for uses in accordance with the plan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under the contract the federal government agrees to make the city, at the conclusion of the project, a &quot;capital grant&quot; in an amount equal to two-thirds of the net loss to be sustained in connection with the project; and the remaining one-third is to be made up by the city in the form of &quot;local grants in aid&quot; and may consist of site improvements, the furnishing of parks, playgrounds, and public buildings and facilities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Payments on project temporary loan notes are to be made solely from the project temporary loan repayment account provided for by a duly enacted ordinance.  This account will be made up of:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(a) The proceeds of all sales of project land by the city,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(b) All lease proceeds which the city derives under leases, if any, of project land,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(c) All monies constituting compensation by the city for project land which it retains for use in accordance with the project redevelopment plan instead of selling or leasing that land (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">i. e.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> land retained&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  for site improvements, parks, playgrounds, city buildings or other public facilities furnished by the city as &quot;local grants in aid&quot;),</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(d) All deficiency cash grants, if any, but only to the extent that such grants are provided by the city itself from funds which are donated to it for the purpose of making such grants,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(e) All payments which are made by the United States to the city on account of the project capital grant,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(f) All accrued interest, if any, which is paid to the city on project temporary loan notes at the time when the United States takes up and pays for such project temporary loan notes, and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(g) The unexpended balance, if any, remaining in the project expenditures account after all costs of the project shall have been paid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The costs of the project are to be paid from the project expenditures account duly established by ordinance and which consists of:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(a) The proceeds of all project temporary loan obligations,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(b) The proceeds of all preliminary loan obligations,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(c) All cash grants, if any, which are actually made with respect to the project by the city from funds donated to it for that purpose,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(d) All income which is derived by the city directly from its&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  temporary operation of project land pending its preparation and ultimate sale, lease, or retention by the city, and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(e) All income which is derived by the city directly from its demolition of buildings and structures on project land.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is no obligation or promise of the city to pay project temporary loan notes, if the funds in the project temporary loan repayment account are insufficient, and there is no obligation to levy taxes for their repayment.  On the contrary, those notes state on their face that the full faith and credit of the city are not pledged for the payment of principal thereof or interest thereon.  There is no obligation or promise by the city to supply from its own funds anything for the project temporary loan repayment account, except compensation for project land retained by the city for such uses as parks, playgrounds, public buildings and other public facilities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also, there is no obligation or promise by the city to provide from its own funds anything for the project expenditures account.  Any city grants in aid will be in providing parks, playgrounds, public buildings or other public facilities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By their answer the respondents allege that, if they sign&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the Laurel Redevelopment Area No. 3 project temporary loan note No. 1 in the amount of $ 100,000, as they are directed to do by city ordinance, they will violate their oaths of office and participate in the unauthorized and illegal expenditure of public funds for reasons set forth in seven numbered defenses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Relator has demurred to this answer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pursuant to leave of court, certain owners of property in the redevelopment area filed an intervening petition praying the court to dismiss the petition for the reasons stated in the several defenses of the answer and for the additional reason that the prior acts of the respondents have been such that they have no legal right to question the validity or constitutionality of the acts to compel which the relator seeks a writ of mandamus.  While the intervening petition, by general denial, purports to put in issue and require strict proof of the allegations of the petition, the parties have made admissions in an &quot;agreed statement of facts,&quot; which, in effect, represent an admission of the material allegations of the petition as hereinbefore summarized.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">Relator city solicitor petitioned for a writ of mandamus to require respondent city officials to execute a loan note to effect an urban redevelopment project as directed by city ordinance. Intervenor property owners sought to dismiss the city solicitor's petition. The city officials and the property owners contended that the urban redevelopment plan violated Ohio Const. art. I, &sect; 19.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">The city officials and property owners contended that Ohio Const. art. I, &sect; 19 prohibited the exercise of the right of eminent domain because the urban redevelopment was not a public use or purpose for which public funds could have been expended and the power of eminent domain exercised. The court rejected the contentions of the city officials and the property owners. While the power of eminent domain could not have been exercised merely or primarily to take private property for private purposes, there was no constitutional provision which limited the exercise of that power to a taking which would have been exclusively for the public welfare or for public uses or for public purposes. The court found that the primary purpose of the redevelopment of the area was to eliminate the slum and other conditions of blight and provide against their recurrence. Thus, the primary purpose was for the public welfare. The court held that since the primary purpose for the exercise of the eminent domain power was to acquire the property for the public welfare within the meaning of the constitution, the power could have been exercised even where there was an incidental nonpublic use of the property.</SPAN></P>

The commission secretary-treasurer interposed 15 questions of law for consideration. The court pointed out that under Ohio Gen. Code &sect; 1220, the Ohio Turnpike Commission (Commission) was authorized to reimburse the Department of Highways for a turnpike feasibility study if made with the Commission's approval. The court asserted that the commission secretary-treasurer misinterpreted Ohio Const. art. XVIII, &sect;&sect; 3, 7, and that turnpike construction across the state was not a matter of local self-government. The court found that it was not unconstitutional for the governor to call a special legislative session to give the Commission eminent domain powers, as long as any limitation did not invade the province of the general assembly by specifying the method, manner, or means by which the purpose of the special session was to be accomplished.

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The plaintiff, Northern Boiler Company, is a corporation existing under the laws of the state of Ohio.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defendants are the city of Cleveland, Samuel F. David, who is its duly appointed, qualified and acting director of public service, and Alban J. Pruesser, who is its duly appointed, qualified and acting commissioner of streets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This cause originated in the Court of Common Pleas of Cuyahoga County.  The plaintiff seeks a mandatory injunction directing the city of Cleveland, by its duly appointed officers, to issue a permit to cut the curb in front of property owned by the plaintiff.  The pertinent parts of the amended petition are as follows:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Plaintiff further says that it is the owner of certain property, one parcel being located on the westerly side of West 88th street and one parcel which fronts upon Silverton avenue, both parcels being in the city of Cleveland.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Plaintiff further says that both of said parcels of property are zoned for industrial purposes and that it does operate and has operated for more than the past twenty-five (25) years a plant for the manufacture and fabricating of steel products in the building&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  fronting on Silverton avenue.  That immediately adjoining the building on Silverton avenue, the plaintiff is in the process of erecting an addition to its existing plant.  That the property on West 88th street has a frontage of approximately two hundred (200) feet and is presently being used for the storage of steel for use in the construction of the new addition to its existing plant.  That for the purpose of constructing said building, it is now necessary to move the structural steel from the lot on West 88th street to the lot on Silverton avenue where the addition is being constructed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Plaintiff further says that there is no means of ingress or egress to the said 88th street property unless a driveway be built from the property to West 88th street, which, of necessity, requires the cutting of the curb on West 88th street at the point where plaintiff's said property is located.  That on the 1st day of May, 1951, the plaintiff made application to the proper authorities in the service department for permission to cut the curb on West 88th street so as to permit vehicles to enter its said property located on West 88th street.  This application was made under the provisions of Municipal&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Code Section 135, the pertinent part of which reads as follows:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;'He shall have charge of the planning, construction, improvement, repair and maintenance of streets, boulevards, sidewalks, alleys, lanes, bridges, viaducts, aqueducts, wharves, docks, landings, and other public highways * * *.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That this application was orally approved by the commissioner of streets of the city of Cleveland and by the director of public service of the city of Cleveland.  That written formal approval was withheld by the above named officials pending the lapse of ten (10) days in which the councilman of the ward in which the property is located could object to the cutting of said curb under provisions of ordinance No. 1941-50, which reads as follows:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;'Except as to residential property no permit shall be granted by the director of public service to cut the curb within any ward of the city unless and until written notice of the application for such permit has been given to the member of council from such ward.  If within ten days after receipt of such notice such member of council shall notify said director in writing of his objection to the issuance of such permit, such permit shall not be issued except&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  pursuant to resolution of council; otherwise such permit may be issued any time after the expiration of ten days following the said required notice to the member of council.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That the said councilman did so object, and that by reason of the objection of the councilman under the provisions of said ordinance, the permit to cut said curb is being held up to the irreparable damage of this plaintiff in that he has no means of ingress or egress to his property and no means of transporting the steel from where it is stored to the building which is now under construction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Plaintiff further says that the aforesaid ordinance No. 1941-50 is unconstitutional and void in that it illegally delegates the power and authority to an individual to deprive a property owner of the proper and legal use of his property and to prevent the property owner from obtaining the means of ingress and egress to his property and said ordinance violates the equal protection of the law guaranteed by the state and federal Constitutions.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defendants' general demurrer to the petition was sustained by the Court of Common Pleas on the ground that the petition, failing to state that the city council had refused to&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  grant the permit by resolution, discloses that the plaintiff had not exhausted its remedies and, therefore, was not entitled to an injunction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The plaintiff not desiring to plead further, judgment was entered against it and the petition was dismissed at its cost.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An appeal on questions of law was prosecuted to the Court of Appeals which court reversed the judgment of the Court of Common Pleas and remanded the cause to that court for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cause is before this court upon the allowance of a motion to certify the record of the Court of Appeals and because it presents a question arising under the Constitution of this state.  </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><BR><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">DISPOSITION:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment affirmed</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.  <BR></SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">Appellants, a city and an individual official (city), challenged the judgment of the Court of Appeals for Cuyahoga County (Ohio), which reversed the order of the trial court that had dismissed appellee landowner's action for injunctive relief. The primary issue was whether an ordinance was unconstitutional and void because it delegated legislative power and authority to the official to deprive the owner's use of his property.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">The corporate landowner's property abutted a public street and it sought a permit so that it could cut away a portion of the curb and install a driveway; however, a city official under the authority of a local ordinance denied it the permit and the landowner sought an injunction. The trial court denied the injunction but the intermediate appellate court reversed that decision. The issue before the court on a motion to certify was whether the ordinance by which the official denied the permit was constitutional. The court held that any landowner whose property abuts a public street has an inherent property right to have entrance and egress to the street; therefore, the denial of that property right by the government had to be subject to due process, equal protection, and fair compensation. The court held that the ordinance was an unconstitutional delegation of legislative power to the official because it placed no guidelines as to the official's decisions and placed no restrictions on his discretionary authority.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">The court held that the ordinance in question was unconstitutional and affirmed the judgment of the intermediate appellate court that reversed the trial court's judgment that denied an injunction against the city and on behalf of the landowner.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This cause originated in the Court of Common Pleas of Hamilton County.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The plaintiff is a resident and taxpayer of the city of Cincinnati and brought this action for himself as a taxpayer and on behalf of the city of Cincinnati and all other taxpayers of said city.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defendants are the city of Cincinnati and Wilbur R. Kellogg, its duly appointed and acting city manager.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The petition alleges that the city has been and is proceeding under the direction of the city manager with a program for improvement of certain streets and avenues, by the use of the city's own employees and with materials supplied by the city, and that such improvements are being made without compliance with the provisions of Sections 4678-1 and 4678-2, General Code, requiring all cities and villages to have reliable estimates of the cost of making improvements prepared and compared with bids solicited by newspaper advertising.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plaintiff says that these sections of the General Code are binding on all cities and villages in Ohio; that the attempted limitation in the last sentence of Section 4678-2, General Code, that &quot;this act shall not apply to any city&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  or village having a charter form of government,&quot; is illegal and void since it is not according to the classification set up in Section 1, Article XVIII of the Ohio Constitution; and that said limitation is also unconstitutional, being in conflict with Section 26, Article II of the Ohio Constitution, as an unreasonable and arbitrary classification.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The petition of the plaintiff prays for a preliminary injunction enjoining the defendants from carrying out said program of paving streets without following the procedure set out in said statutes and for a permanent injunction on final hearing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The answer of the defendants admits the formal allegations of the petition and denies generally all other allegations therein.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The case was tried on certain stipulated facts and the pleadings.  At the conclusion of the case judgment was rendered for the plaintiff.  The court found the facts to be those stated in the pleadings, found that the defendants had not and did not intend to comply with the provisions of Sections 4678-1 and 4678-2, General Code, in making the street improvements, and found that their refusal to comply with these statutes will be &quot;a misapplication of funds of a defendant corporation, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  an abuse of its corporate powers and the execution and performance of a contract made in behalf of defendant corporation in contravention of the laws or ordinances governing it.&quot; The court thereupon enjoined the defendants from further proceeding with the paving of the streets in question without following the procedure set forth in Sections 4678-1 and 4678-2, General Code.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An appeal was prosecuted to the Court of Appeals which court affirmed the judgment of the Court of Common Pleas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cause is before this court upon the allowance of a motion to certify the record of the Court of Appeals.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">Appellee taxpayer filed an action against appellants, city and city manager (collectively city), seeking to enjoin the city's public improvements program. The trial court found for the taxpayer and enjoined the project until the city complied with the procedures found in Ohio Gen. Code &sect;&sect; 4678-1, -2 (code). The Court of Appeals for Hamilton County (Ohio) affirmed. The city appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">The code required all cities to have reliable estimates of the cost if making improvements prepared and compared with bids solicited by newspaper advertising. However, Ohio Gen. Code &sect; 4678-2 stated that the code did not apply to cities with a charter form of government. Ohio Const. art. XVIII, &sect; 1 classified municipalities into cities and villages based on their populations. Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 26 stated that all laws of a general nature had to have uniform operation throughout the state. Thus, the issue was whether Ohio Gen. Code &sect; 4678-2 attempted to classify municipalities in a manner beyond that allowed by the state constitution. The court reversed. The court held that &sect; 4678-2 was constitutional. The court reasoned that the state constitution itself allowed municipalities to adopt charters. The code was adopted by reason of the authority conferred by the constitution upon charter cities to adopt different procedures for purely local matters. Thus, differentiation by the state as to charter and non-charter cities did not violation the constitution.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The parties will be referred to herein as they appeared in the Common Pleas Court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The plaintiffs, stockholders of the defendant corporation, in their amended petition set forth three causes of action.  In the first cause of action they seek to enjoin the conversion of the defendant corporation into a federal savings and loan association on the grounds that (a) the proposed plan of conversion is inequitable to stockholders, (b) the actions of defendants in their promotion of the plan were both actually and constructively fraudulent and (c) the corporate action taken by the defendant corporation in adopting the plan was illegal.  In their second cause of action, they ask as alternative relief for a fair cash value of $ 455.19 a share for their shares in the defendant corporation.  In their third cause of action they assert that, if they are denied the relief demanded in their first and second causes of action, then the plan of conversion and Section 9660-2, General Code, are unconstitutional in authorizing and permitting the taking of their property without due process of law and are violative of the Fifth Amendment of the Constitution&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of the United States and of Section 16, Article I, Ohio Constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defendant Security Savings &amp; Loan Company was organized in 1916 as a building and loan association under the laws of Ohio.  The other defendants, excepting the state Superintendent of Building and Loan Associations, are directors and officers of the defendant corporation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On August 8, 1949, at a special meeting duly called for the purpose, resolutions were adopted by the stock-holders to convert the Security Savings &amp; Loan Company into a federal savings and loan association pursuant to and in accordance with the provisions of Sections 9660-1 and 9660-2, General Code, and approving a plan of conversion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sections 9643 to 9674-3, inclusive, General Code, deal with the organization and powers of building and loan associations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Section 9647, General Code, provides:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Home Owner's Loan Act of 1933 (Section 1464, Title 12, U.S. Code) provides, so far as material:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;(i) Any member of a federal home loan bank may convert itself into a federal savings and loan association under this chapter upon a vote of 51 per centum or more of the votes cast at a legal meeting called to consider such action; but such conversion shall be subject to such rules and regulations as the board may prescribe, and thereafter the converted association shall be entitled to all the benefits of this section and shall be subject to&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  examination and regulation to the same extent as other associations incorporated pursuant to this chapter.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those rules and regulations of the board provided, so far as material:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;202.19 After approval by its board of directors, any member of a federal home loan bank desiring to convert may make a preliminary application to the board.  The form of such preliminary application for conversion may be procured from a federal home loan bank.  * * *&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;202.24 The plan of conversion which shall be voted upon by the shareholders of the applicant must provide, among other things, as follows:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;(a) All creditors shall be paid in full either in cash or in a share account of the federal association, or in a combination of cash and share account; or the creditor obligations shall continue to remain as outstanding obligations of the converted federal association.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;* * *</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;(c) All shareholders without preference shall be given share accounts in the federal association of an aggregate value equivalent to the present value of their accounts, after provision for appropriate reserves, as determined by the board.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;(d) All holders of guarantee, permanent, reserve fund, or other nonwithdrawable capital&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***9]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  stock shall be given share accounts of the federal association of an aggregate value equivalent to the present value of their stock, after provision for appropriate reserves, as determined by the board.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;202.23 After the preliminary application for conversion has been approved by the board, the applicant shall proceed forthwith to obtain the vote of its shareholders required by state law, if any, which expressly authorizes conversion, and at least the vote required by federal statute, or, in the absence of such a state law, the vote of its shareholders required by Section 5 (i) of Home Owner's Loan Act of 1933, as amended (48 Stat., 646; 12 U. S. C., 1464 [i]) in favor of the plan of conversion approved by the board, and to comply with all other necessary legal formalities.  It shall thereafter file its formal application for conversion into a federal association in the form set in Section 202.17.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;202.17 Any member of a federal home loan bank may convert itself into a federal association upon a vote of 51 per cent or more of the votes cast at a legal meeting called to consider such action.  A legal meeting is any annual, regular, or special meeting of the holders of share accounts&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***10]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of the applicant for conversion, which is a member of a federal home loan bank, called in the manner and upon the notice required by state law, the charter and bylaws of applicant for any such annual, regular, or special meeting to consider conversion, at which a quorum is present in person or by proxy.  The applicant must comply with all state laws, if any, which expressly prescribe procedure for conversion, federal laws, and those rules and regulations * * *&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is apparently conceded that the foregoing requirements of the rules and regulations were complied with.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The &quot;board&quot; referred to in the foregoing regulations determined that, after cancellation of treasury stock, the issued and outstanding permanent stock of the defendant corporation had a present aggregate value, after provision for appropriate reserves, which would enable provision therefor of share accounts of the federal association on the basis of $ 135 for each $ 100 par value of said permanent stock.  Provision therefor was made in the plan of conversion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whether the provisions of defendant corporation's constitution or the only statutory provisions which might be applicable (Section 8623-48, General Code) are followed, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***11]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  there was a quorum present at the special meeting of stockholders of defendant corporation which had been duly called to authorize conversion and approve the plan of conversion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Excluding treasury shares, the number of the issued and outstanding shares of stock on the day of that meeting was 1,828.34.  Of these, 993.88 shares were voted for the resolutions to convert and to approve the plan of conversion and 680.6 shares were voted against adoption of the resolutions.  Votes with respect to 80 of the 993.88 shares voted in favor of the resolutions were challenged for irregularities in the proxies.  Assuming that these challenges were well taken, the affirmative vote was reduced to 913.88 shares.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If effect is given to the limitation in the defendant corporation's constitution &quot;that no member shall be entitled to vote more than 20 shares held in his own right,&quot; 612.18 shares were cast in favor of adoption of those resolutions and 447.6 shares against their adoption.  The figure of 612.18 would be reduced by 50 to 562.18 if the challenges heretofore referred to were allowed.  There were 1,213.64 shares entitled to be voted under the limitation in defendant corporation's constitution&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***12]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  but only 1,059.78 of those shares were represented at the meeting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thus, unless the challenges for irregularities in proxies are sustained, more than a majority of the outstanding shares were voted in the affirmative and more than a majority of the stock entitled to be voted under the defendant's constitution was voted in the affirmative.  However, it is obvious that, even if those challenges are all sustained, there was, to use the words of the Home Owner's Loan Act and the regulations thereunder, &quot;a vote of 51 per centum or more of the votes cast at a * * * meeting called to consider such action.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Common Pleas Court rendered judgment for the defendants.  (97 N. E. [2d], 435.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On appeal to the Court of Appeals on questions of law and fact, that court found generally for the defendants &quot;on the issues joined&quot; and entered judgment for the defendants.  (99 N. E. [2d], 84.)</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

Furthermore, the court held plaintiffs, as dissenting stockholders, were not entitled the fair cash of value for plaintiffs' shares because &sect; 9660-2 had not provided such a right.

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plaintiff is the administrator of the estate of Dorothy B. McDougall who died intestate in 1945 and who is herein referred to as decedent.  Plaintiff is also the surviving spouse of decedent, having been married to her in 1936.  In 1930, the decedent had created an irrevocable trust.  In 1935, by supplemental agreement, she added to the assets of the trust.  By the terms of this trust, she reserved the income to herself for life and reserved the right to designate the donee of the corpus of the trust by will.  The trust provided that, in default of such designation, the corpus was to be distributed to the decedent's children but, if she had no children, to her mother and sister or the survivor.  No provision was made in the trust agreement or the supplemental agreement of 1935 regarding taxes or their payment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The decedent left no issue, and she was predeceased by her mother.  Since she executed no will, the corpus of the trust was distributable to decedent's sister.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For estate tax purposes, the gross taxable estate of the decedent amounted to $ 612,541.57.  This figure represented the sum of the net assets before estate tax&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  in the decedent's probate estate, amounting to $ 462,993.91, and of the assets in the trust, amounting to $ 149,547.66.  The federal estate tax amounted to $ 149,587.89.  This was paid by the administrator out of the probate assets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The administrator brought an action requesting the court to determine what amount was a fair and equitable portion of the estate tax that should be borne by and paid from the trust estate and prayed for judgment against the trustee for that amount.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Common Pleas Court held that the estate tax was payable entirely from the probate assets and that the administrator had no rights against the trust estate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That judgment was affirmed by the Court of Appeals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cause is now before this court on appeal, pursuant to allowance of a motion to certify the record.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">Appellant, the administrator of decedent's estate, sought review of a judgment of the Court of Appeals for Cuyahoga County (Ohio), which affirmed the trial court's holding that the estate tax was payable entirely from the probate assets and that the administrator had no rights against the trust estate. The administrator had initiated the action to recover from appellee trustee a portion of the estate tax he had paid.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">The corpus of decedent's trust was transferred to her sister. The administrator and decedent's husband paid the estate taxes due and brought an action against the trustee for determination of what portion of the taxes should have been paid out of the trust estate. The trust agreement did not have a provision for the payment of taxes. The lower courts found that the trust estate was not liable to any portion of the federal estate tax. On appeal, the court reversed. The taxable estate of decedent for estate tax purposes was divided into two separate parts, the probate estate and the trust estate. Congress intended that the federal estate tax had to be paid out of the estate as a whole, and that the applicable state law as to the devolution of property at death governed the distribution of the remainder. The estate tax was a burden on &quot;the estate as a whole,&quot; including the trust assets and represented an obligation on all of the assets included in decedent's gross estate. The court had previously approved equitable apportionment of the federal estate tax. Thus, an apportionment of the federal estate tax burden between the probate assets and the trust assets was required.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">The court reversed the judgment and held that the trust estate had to pay a relative portion of the total tax paid.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  APPEAL from the Court of Appeals for Franklin county.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is an action brought in the Common Pleas Court of Franklin County to enjoin certain alleged conduct on the part of the defendants tending to interfere with and prevent the plaintiff from carrying out its contractual and usual business activities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The plaintiff, W. E. Anderson Sons Company, hereinafter designated Anderson, is a corporation having its place of business in the city of Columbus where it is engaged in the business of transporting and delivering by motor truck building materials and other commodities.  For that purpose it owns and operates about 60 trucks and employs drivers to operate them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defendant Local Union No. 311, International Brotherhood of Teamsters, Chauffeurs, Stablemen &amp; Helpers of America, hereinafter designated local union, is an association the members of which are employed as operators of motor trucks and motor vehicles.  A number of such members own and operate their own trucks.  The defendant Don Pfeiffer is the president and business agent of the local union.  The defendant Columbus Building Trades Council is an association of local unions operating in the Columbus area, created by authority&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of the Building Trades of the American Federation of Labor, and is composed of delegates or affiliates of various local unions connected with the building trades, including the local unions named as defendants in this action.  The defendant Phil O'Day is an officer of such building trades council.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In February 1949, the James I. Barnes Construction Company, hereinafter designated Barnes, was the general contractor engaged in the construction of one of the buildings constituting University Health Center on the campus of Ohio State University at Columbus, Ohio, and in such construction work employed a number of subcontractors.  In such construction work Barnes and all its subcontractors employed only union building trade workers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of such subcontractors was H. W. Holt &amp; Son Company, hereinafter designated Holt, which had a subcontract to do the filling and grading work on the construction premises.  Holt, in turn, engaged Anderson as its subcontractor to haul bank-run gravel from a borrow pit located outside the city of Columbus and dump it at the construction site.  The truck operators doing the hauling for Anderson were not members of any union.  Their employment comprehended the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  dumping of the gravel at the construction site as a delivery operation and was not in any way implemented with the employment of other workmen on the construction project.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The local union had previously sought to obtain this trucking work from Holt for its members who owned and operated their own trucks but the effort was unsuccessful.  The local union, both before and after Anderson had secured the contract from Holt to do the hauling work, sought to persuade Anderson's employees to become members of the union but likewise without success.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the afternoon of February 9, 1949, Anderson's men began delivering by truck dirt and gravel to the construction site.  Later the same day, Pfeiffer informed Holt that since it was not employing union men to do this hauling he decided to banner the job.  The next day Pfeiffer stationed a picket at the entrance of the construction project where Anderson's truckers entered and left the premises, which picket carried a large body-size banner bearing in display lettering: &quot;Anderson does not employ members of Teamsters Local 311 affiliated with the Building Trades Council, A. F. of L.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Immediately following the placing of the picket and banner, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  most of the union employees working directly for Barnes and for its various subcontractors quit work.  As a result of such work stoppage Barnes ordered Holt, its subcontractor, to stop Anderson and its nonunion truck drivers from delivering further materials to the construction site.  The order was given by Holt and Anderson ceased hauling on February 16, 1949.  The union employees of Barnes and of his subcontractors then resumed work on the job.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the hauling was suspended, a meeting attended by Holt, Barnes, Pfeiffer and O'Day was held, at which it was agreed that Holt should employ union truck drivers to do the hauling of the dirt and gravel.  Two or three such operators were secured but after an hour or two of work they were stopped by representatives of the Public Utilities Commission on the ground that the union operators did not have permits from such commission and were not qualified to operate the trucks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On February 21, 1949, after Holt had been unsuccessful in securing union operators, Anderson's nonunion truck drivers resumed the work of hauling and continued work for two days without incident.  No hauling was done on February 23, 24 or 25 on account of unfavorable&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  weather.  Hauling was resumed, however, on February 28, 1949, and on March 1, 1949, a picket and banner were again placed at the entrance to the construction site, and again most of the union men on the job employed by Barnes and his subcontractors quit work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After a second conference between Pfeiffer, O'Day and Barnes, Pfeiffer and O'Day requested that an order in writing be sent to Holt to stop Anderson's men from further work, whereupon, under date of March 3, 1949, a telegram was sent to Holt by one Stahl, a representative of Barnes, which was as follows:<BR><BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c29"><SPAN CLASS="c11">&quot;Columbus, Ohio, March 3, 1949</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;H. W. Holt &amp; Son</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;998 West Mound Street</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You are hereby notified to cease work on the TB hospital job in accordance with your contract within 48 hours and we also request that you cease work as soon as possible.  You shall not start work without our written consent that all employees are satisfactory to this company.  Further changes in arrangements after starting work shall be only made by advising us and with our consent.<BR><BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c29"><SPAN CLASS="c11">&quot;James I. Barnes Construction Co.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c30"><SPAN CLASS="c11">&quot;By Ray Stahl.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Again Anderson and his men ceased hauling and the union men employed by Barnes and its&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  subcontractors resumed work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A few days later, Anderson instituted this action.  After setting up in his petition the facts substantially as above stated, he prayed that the defendants be enjoined from &quot;picketing or bannering the site of any building, job or work whereat plaintiff has or shall have delivered building materials * * * for the purpose of preventing plaintiff from making delivery of materials or other commodities to such site.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Four of the defendants filed answers admitting certain of the allegations of plaintiff's petition with general denials as to the remainder of such allegations, and variously alleging that the granting of an order or orders as prayed for by the plaintiff against the defendants would constitute a deprivation of rights as guaranteed in Articles I, XIII and XIV, Amendments, U.S. Constitution, and Sections 6 and 11, Article I, Ohio Constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the trial, Arthur Stray, superintendent of construction for Barnes, testified that on the day before the banner was posted O'Day called him by telephone and asked him if Anderson was hauling.  Stray answered, &quot;yes,&quot; whereupon O'Day said there &quot;would be a banner up in the morning&quot; and &quot;well, if they want&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  a showdown we will give it to them.&quot; O'Day admitted that he had the telephone conversation with Stray but denied the statement as to showdown and denied that he said the banner would be posted, because &quot;I cannot banner the job, that is up to the locals.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Holt testified that on the day Anderson's men began working Pfeiffer informed Holt that he decided to have the job bannered because Anderson was making deliveries of gravel and was not employing members of the local union to do the work.  Pfeiffer admitted that he posted the picket with the banner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">O'Day, when asked whether there are any principles of the unions, other than specific rules and regulations, against crossing a picket line or working behind a banner, replied, &quot;I think the principle lies within the man himself that is working on the job.&quot; Pfeiffer testified that Anderson had other jobs it was hauling to at the same time but that he did not put banners up at any of those places.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two union men who testified at the hearing, in response to questions involving reasons for quitting work, said that they quit work because they did not want to work behind a banner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On hearing, the Common Pleas Court found that the defendants, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  local union, Pfeiffer, Columbus Building Trades Council, and O'Day, individually and as an officer of the Building Trades Council, had instituted an illegal secondary boycott and that the action of the defendants was in restraint of trade.  The court granted an injunction restraining the defendants generally from acts, the purpose of which was to prevent plaintiff from making delivery of materials to the construction site.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Court of Appeals for Franklin county on stipulation that the cause be submitted to that court solely upon the evidence presented in the Common Pleas Court denied an injunction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cause is in this court for review upon the allowance of a motion to certify the record.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">Appellant subcontractor, a gravel hauling company, sought review of a judgment of the Court of Appeals for Franklin County (Ohio), which reversed the order of the trial court granting an injunction, and denied the subcontractor's request for an injunction against appellee union members to prevent them from picketing or bannering to prevent the subcontractor from making delivery of materials to the construction site.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">The subcontractor, who was hired to make delivery of gravel and building materials to a construction site, employed drivers who were not union members. When the union members who worked on the site began picketing and bannering, all the other workers walked off the job, causing repeated work stoppages. The subcontractor brought an action to enjoin the conduct of the union members tending to interfere with and prevent the subcontractor from carrying out its contractual and usual business activities. The trial court granted an injunction restraining the union members from acts that prevented the subcontractor's drivers from making delivery of material. The appeals court reversed, and denied the injunction, and certified the cause to the court for review. The court reversed the appeals court's judgment, finding that the union members were engaged in a secondary boycott, which was illegal in the state when employed in a labor dispute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">The court reversed the judgment of the appeal court and rendered final judgment for the subcontractor on its complaint for an injunction preventing the union workers' bannering and picketing.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the September 1948 term of the Court of Common Pleas of Cuyahoga County, the grand jury returned an indictment, containing 12 counts, charging the defendant, Leslie T. Healy, with the violation of Section 12447-1, General Code, commonly referred to as the &quot;larceny by trick statute.&quot; Upon application therefor a bill of particulars was furnished the defendant on June 6, 1949, which was prior to the trial.  The state entered a nolle prosequi as to five counts in the indictment and the trial proceeded on the remaining seven.  The validity of both the indictment and the bill of particulars was challenged by the defendant on the ground that they were vague, indefinite and uncertain in their terms, and for the further reason that Section 12447-1, General Code, under which the indictment was purported to have been drawn, is unconstitutional and void because of being vague, indefinite and uncertain.  The challenge was rejected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trial was had to a jury which returned a verdict of guilty on each of the seven counts.  A motion for a new trial and a motion in arrest of judgment were filed in due course and overruled.  Judgment was entered&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  on the verdict and the defendant sentenced to the penitentiary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Court of Appeals (one judge dissenting) reversed the judgment of the trial court for error of law &quot;(1) in failing to instruct the jury that 'an intent to deprive owners of their property' as an element of the crimes charged, and (2) for error of law in exclusion of evidence proffered by defendant-appellant.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cause is before this court following the allowance of a motion by the state for leave to appeal.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>

The court disagreed, reversed the intermediate court's order, and affirmed defendant's convictions. The court held that the trial court properly applied the language of the larceny by trick statute, Ohio Gen. Code &sect; 12447-1, in its instructions to the jury. The court noted that the trial court charged generally on intent. The court said that it would have been error had the trial court attempted to establish by fiat some definition of specific intent, which was not required by the statute to constitute the offense. Regarding the exclusion of evidence, the court held that the trial court did not err in rejecting defendant's proffered bank records. The court said that defendant was allowed to testify fully that he did not make false representations, and that he honestly intended to build houses in accordance with the contracts. The court concluded that defendant was not prejudiced in any way by the rejection of the photostatic copies of the bank statements.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On June 28, 1946, a bastardy proceeding was instituted in the Court of Common Pleas of Franklin County, Division of Domestic Relations, upon the complaint of Joan R. Gill charging the accused, Robert Volz, to be the father of her unborn child.  The child was born prior to the trial of the case and was then living.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In September 1947, the case was tried in the Common Pleas Court, wherein a jury returned a verdict of guilty, nine jurors concurring.  A motion for new trial was overruled, but the trial judge failed to enter a judgment that the accused was the reputed father of a bastard child.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On application to the Common Pleas Court, Division of Domestic Relations, to fix the money support for the mother during pregnancy and the expenses in connection with the birth of the child, the same were fixed at $ 819.46, and an order was made for the support of the child.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An appeal was taken to the Court of Appeals which reversed the judgment of the Common Pleas Court because it had failed to enter any judgment after the return of the verdict of guilty by the jury, and ordered the cause remanded to the Court of Common Pleas for further&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  proceedings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thereafter, in February 1949, without further hearing, the Common Pleas Court entered a judgment adjudging the accused to be the reputed father of the bastard child and ordering that such judgment be entered </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">nunc pro tunc</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> as of November 8, 1947.  Following this entry, the Common Pleas Court, without taking any further testimony, re-entered its identical former judgment </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">nunc pro tunc</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A second appeal was taken to the Court of Appeals which again reversed the judgment of the Common Pleas Court on the ground that the latter court was in error in entering such judgment </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">nunc pro tunc</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and again remanded the cause.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On June 7, 1950, the Common Pleas Court, without further hearing, entered a judgment as of that date adjudging the accused to be the reputed father of a bastard child, whereupon the Division of Domestic Relations of such court re-entered its judgment for expenses of the child's birth, support of the mother during pregnancy and the child's support and maintenance from its birth and ordered that the accused be committed to jail if he neglected to comply with the order of the court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On appeal on questions of law, that third judgment was affirmed by the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Court of Appeals, and, on motion, the judges of that court certified the record to this court for review and final determination on the ground that its judgment was in conflict with that of the Court of Appeals for Hardin county in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">State, ex rel.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">The Court of Appeals for Franklin County (Ohio) certified the record of its judgment that appellant father was the reputed father of a bastard child born to appellee mother. A jury had returned a verdict that the father was the father of the child. On appeal, the judgment was reversed because the trial court had failed to enter the judgment. The case had been appealed and remanded twice before it was certified to the court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">The mother instituted a bastardy proceeding against the father and charged that he was the father of her unborn child. A jury returned a guilty verdict with nine jurors concurring. After two appeals and two remands, the appellate court affirmed the judgment and certified the record to the court due to a split between the appellate courts as to whether a bastardy proceeding was a civil or a criminal action. The court concluded that a bastardy proceeding was essentially a civil action and affirmed the judgment of the appellate court, which had affirmed the judgment of the trial court. The court noted that while bastardy proceedings had often been referred to or classified as &quot;quasi-criminal&quot; proceedings, as such, they were not the same as purely criminal proceedings. The court found that past legislation authorizing a civil jury to enter a verdict upon the concurrence of three-fourths or more of their number encompassed all types of cases that were not purely criminal. The court concluded that the trial court committed no error in accepting the verdict of guilty concurred in by nine members of the jury.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On March 18, 1948, Consetta P.

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George C. Green died October 31, 1947, while such policy was in effect.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant filed an answer in which it alleged that decedent in his application for the policy claimed to be in good health, whereas he was not, in giving false answers with reference to his physical condition; and that defendant relied on such answers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant tendered to plaintiff the amount of the premium paid for the policy, with interest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After trial, plaintiff filed a reply to defendant's answer </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">nunc pro tunc</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jury returned a verdict in favor of plaintiff for the full amount of the policy, with interest, whereupon defendant filed a motion for a judgment notwithstanding the verdict.  The motion was overruled and&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  judgment was entered by the trial court upon the verdict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Within ten days thereafter defendant filed a motion for a new trial, which was granted by the trial court by an order reading as follows:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This cause being heard on defendant's motion to set aside the verdict and judgment herein and to grant a new trial, was argued by counsel and submitted to the court; on consideration whereof the court, having been requested by plaintiff to state the grounds of the finding, finds said motion well taken on the grounds that there is newly discovered evidence material for the defendant and because the verdict and judgment are manifestly against the weight of the evidence, and that the motion should be sustained.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;To all of which the plaintiff, by her counsel, excepts.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From that order the plaintiff appealed to the Court of Appeals of Hamilton County, and the defendant filed a cross-appeal from the order of the trial court overruling its motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Court of Appeals dismissed both the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  appeal and cross-appeal and in reference to the former found &quot;no abuse of discretion on the part of the Court of Common Pleas in vacating and setting aside the judgment and granting the motion for a new trial and that said appeal not being predicated upon a final order is not reviewable by this court and should be dismissed.&quot;</SPAN></P>

The insurer then filed a timely motion to set aside the verdict and for a new trial, which the trial court granted. The beneficiary's appeal was dismissed by the appellate court on the ground that it was not predicated upon a final judgment, and then was certified to the court for a final determination. The court affirmed. The court held that an order that granted a motion for a new trial was not, in the absence of an abuse of discretion, a final judgment that was reviewable to an appellate court. The court ruled that once the judgment for a new trial had been entered, the former verdict was no longer in existence and no judgment existed that could have been appealed, absent an abuse of discretion. Because the court found that there was no abuse of discretion by the trial court, the beneficiary's appeal was properly dismissed.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is an action in mandamus originating in this court to compel the clerk of the City Commission of the City of Springfield and the Clark County Board of Elections to submit to the electors of the city of Springfield an ordinance proposed by initiative petition to amend and supplement an existing ordinance.  The ordinance which was proposed to be amended had been passed by the city commission of Springfield on May 24, 1948, was known as ordinance No. 4741 and became effective July 1, 1948.  It provided for a tax of one per cent on certain specified types of income.  The amending ordinance proposed by initiative would reduce the rate of the tax to one-half of one per cent and make certain provisions for exemptions.  The charter of the city of Springfield contains comprehensive provisions authorizing the initiative, including the following:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Section 53.  &quot;Any proposed ordinances, including ordinances for the repeal or amendment of an ordinance then in effect, may be submitted to the city commission by petition signed by at least five per cent of the total number of registered voters in the municipality.  All petitions circulated with respect to any proposed ordinance&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  shall be uniform in character, shall contain the proposed ordinance in full, and shall have printed or written thereon the names and addresses of at least five electors, who shall be officially regarded as filing the petition and shall constitute a committee of the petitioners for the purpose hereinafter named.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Each signer of a petition shall sign his name in ink or indelible pencil and shall place on the petition, opposite his name, the date of his signature and his place of residence by voting precinct and by street and number.  The signatures to any such petition need not all be appended to one paper, but to each such paper there shall be attached an affidavit by the circulator thereof, stating the number of signers to such part of the petition and that each signature appended to the paper is the genuine signature of the person whose name it purports to be, and that it was made in the presence of the affiant and on the date indicated.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Section 54.  &quot;All papers comprising a petition shall be assembled and filed with the clerk of the city commission as one instrument, within one hundred and twenty days from the date of the first signature thereon, and when so filed, the clerk shall&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  submit the same to the city commission at its next regular meeting and provision shall be made for public hearings upon the proposed ordinance.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Petitions were circulated between May 4, 1950, and August 21, 1950, on which latter date they were filed with the clerk of the city commission as one consolidated petition.  On the evening of August 21, 1950, the petition was submitted to the city commission in regular session.  The commission ordered its clerk to have the petition checked to determine its adequacy, sufficiency and validity and authorized the clerk to utilize the facilities of the Clark County Board of Elections and such other means as were necessary and proper for the accomplishment of that purpose.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the time said petition was so filed there were in the city of Springfield 31,345 registered voters.  Five per cent of the registered voters was 1,568.  The initiative petition contained 1,810 names.  The check of the petition made by the clerk of the city commission with the assistance of the board of elections and certain others indicated that many signatures on the petition were invalid or irregular and that the number of valid signatures thereon was less than the required&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  number of 1,568.  The city commission accepted the report of the check of the petition and on September 20, 1950, formally rejected the petition by ordinance declaring it to be insufficient, inadequate and invalid for the reasons therein set forth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Section 55 of the charter provides in substance that if the city commission rejects a proposed ordinance the petitioners by written demand filed within 20 days after such final action may require that the proposed ordinance be submitted to a vote of the electors in its original form &quot;if, with or prior to such demand, a petition for such election, signed after the final action or inaction of the city commission, is filed with such clerk bearing additional signatures of five per cent of the electors of the city, none of whom were signers of the first petition.&quot; That section then continues: &quot;Such clerk shall forthwith cause notice of the filing of such demand and petition to be published in some newspaper of general circulation in the city, and shall also within five days certify to the officers having control of elections the proposed ordinance, stating whether or not a special election is demanded in the petitions, the percentage of registered&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  voters who signed the two petitions in the aggregate, and the date on which he published the notice last mentioned.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On October 3, 1950, the petitioners did file with the city commission a second petition purporting to contain 2,574 additional signatures.  Some check was made of the names appearing upon the second petition but notice of the filing of such demand and petition was not published in any newspaper and no certificate was issued to the board of elections with respect to placing the petition upon the ballot at any election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This action in mandamus was instituted on October 17, 1950.  The prayer of the petition is:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Relator prays that a peremptory writ of mandamus be issued directing the defendant herein, Mrs. M. Lucille Shaffer, clerk of the City Commission of Springfield, Ohio, to comply with her mandatory obligation to cause notice of filing of this demand to be published in some newspaper of general circulation in the said city and also to certify to the officers having control of elections the proposed ordinance, that a special election is demanded, the percentage of registered voters who signed the two petitions in the aggregate and the date on which she published&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the notice last mentioned.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The petition also prays for an alternative writ requiring the board of elections to place the initiated ordinance on the ballot for the election of November 7, 1950.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">Relator filed a petition for a writ of mandamus to compel respondents, city clerk and city commissioner, to submit to the electors an ordinance proposed by initiative petition to amend an ordinance providing for a tax on certain income. The city commissioner had refused to submit the ordinance upon a determination that it contained an insufficient number of valid signatures, as required by Springfield, Ohio, Ordinance &sect; 53.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">While relator's petition contained signatures equaling at least five percent of the voters registered on the date the petition was submitted, as required by Springfield, Ohio, Ordinance &sect; 53, the city commissioner determined that many of the signatures were invalid. The court denied the petition for a writ. At the outset, the court ruled that the initiative sections of the city charter were not unconstitutional simply because they required a certain number of signatures. Moreover, the court ruled that relator had no standing to challenge the constitutionality of the initiative provision while at the same time attempt to compel the city officials to effectuate those provisions. The court also ruled that the city commissioner had both a right and a duty to ensure that the signatures were valid. The court explained that the right of citizens to vote on legislation proposed by initiative petition had to be exercised in conformity with the provisions of the city charter. Finally, the city commissioner properly determined that there were insufficient valid signatures because either the signators were not residents or registered voters, or because the signatures were not signed in ink.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On May 12, 1948, the Jefferson County Board of Education adopted a resolution to create a new local school district from the territory theretofore comprising the Port Homer Local School District and the Saline Local School District.  On June 10, 1948, there was duly filed with the county board a written remonstrance against the creation of the new school district.  The remonstrance contained the signatures of 705 qualified electors residing in the combined districts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thereafter the county board of education found and determined that the remonstrance was insufficient in that it did not contain the signatures of at least 330 qualified electors who voted in the territory constituting the newly created school district at the 1947 general election.  It is agreed that 659 qualified electors residing in the territory included in the newly created school district voted in the 1947 general election.  The county board named the new district &quot;Saline Local School District,&quot; appointed a five-member board and directed an audit of the books of the former districts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Suit was instituted in the Court of Common Pleas of Jefferson County to enjoin&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  further proceedings in the creation and establishment of the new local school district.  Issue was made by petition, amended answer and reply.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">A written remonstrance, which contained the signatures of 705 qualified electors residing in the combined districts, was filed against the board's decision to create a new local school district.

The electors then sought to enjoin further proceedings in the creation and establishment of the new local school district. On appeal from a judgment for the board, the court held that: (1) the board had authority under Ohio Gen. Code &sect; 4831-1 (1947) to create a new local school district; (2) the language of the general assembly in &sect; 4831-1 was susceptible of only one meaning, that to qualify and to be counted as a remonstrator against the action of the board, one had to have voted at the last general election; and (3) &sect; 4831-1 did not violate the constitution because it did not deprive any right conferred by any constitutional provision, it had uniform operation throughout the state, it did not abridge the privileges or immunities of any citizen.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On January 3, 1949, Thomas McWilson, hereinafter designated petitioner, filed a petition in the Probate Court of Cuyahoga County, under Section 10509-25, General Code, in which petition he alleged that one James Hawkins McWilson, hereinafter designated decedent, last resided in St. Louis, Missouri; that he disappeared from his home and domicile in St. Louis on or about September 25, 1936, and has not been heard from or seen since; and that on account of his absence from the place of his last domicile for a period of more than seven years he is presumed to be dead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Petitioner in his petition applied to be appointed administrator of the estate of decedent and prayed that proceedings be had by the court so that the legal presumption of the death of decedent may be established and an administrator of his estate appointed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On January 3, 1949, the Probate Court found that petitioner is the father and only next of kin of decedent and entitled to administer decedent's estate, ordered the advertisement provided for in Section 10509-25, General Code, and set a further hearing on February 14, 1949.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On this latter date the court entered&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  an order finding that the statements contained in the petitioner's petition were true; that decedent was a resident of St. Louis, Missouri; that he disappeared from his home and domicile in St. Louis on or about September 25, 1936; that he has not been heard from or seen since; and that he has been absent for a period of more than seven years and is believed to be dead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The court found further that the presumptive death had been made out and it so decreed, ordered that the date of the death of decedent be fixed as of September 25, 1943, ordered the publication as provided in Section 10509-28, General Code, and continued the case until July 1, 1949.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On this latter date the court made absolute the decree rendered on February 14, 1949, and fixed the date of the presumptive death of decedent as September 25, 1943.</SPAN></P>

The father filed a motion to correct the journal entry, by changing the date of death to the date of the decree. The trial court denied that motion, and the appellate court affirmed. In reversing, the court held that the common law, requiring the presumption of death at the end of seven years, had been modified by Ohio Gen. Code &sect;10509-28, causing the presumption to arise at the date of a decree by the trial court. Thus, the trial court did not have the authority to fix the date of death as the date seven years after the decedent's disappearance, and it committed error in denying the father's motion to change the date as to the presumption of the decedent's death.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The appellant is The Standard Oil Company, an Ohio corporation, and the appellees are C. Emory Glander, Tax Commissioner of Ohio, and John A. Zangerle, auditor of Cuyahoga county.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This appeal from the Board of Tax Appeals involves the final orders and tax assessments made by the Tax Commissioner with respect to and on certain tangible personal property of the appellant for the tax years 1943, 1944, 1945 and 1946, respectively.  Three separate appeals to the Board of Tax Appeals were prosecuted by the appellant which were consolidated in the hearing by that board.  One of the appeals, involving the validity of a final assessment by the Tax Commissioner for the year 1945, was decided in favor of the appellant and no appeal was prosecuted to this court.  The appeal to this court is limited to the decision of the Board of Tax Appeals in regard to Tax Commissioner's case No. 12488, which involves a final assessment certificate and an amendment thereof assessing taxes for the tax years 1943 and 1944 on a Houdry catalytic cracking unit which was in the process of construction on January 1, 1943, and on January 1, 1944, but which was not completed and&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  not in operation on either of those tax-listing dates, and Tax Commissioner's case No. 14381, which is an appeal from final orders of the Tax Commissioner assessing taxes for the tax years 1945 and 1946, respectively, on certain towboats and barges of the appellant, the then finished and operating Houdry catalytic cracking unit above referred to and certain machinery and equipment in process of construction which were unfinished and not in operation on January 1, 1945, and January 1, 1946.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The decision of the Board of Tax Appeals affirmed in most respects the orders and assessments in each of these causes, and the appellant, by appeal to this court, presents the question whether the decision of the Board of Tax Appeals is unreasonable or unlawful.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">Appellant taxpayer disagreed with appellees, the tax commissioner and the county auditor, concerning the state's right to tax taxpayer's barges and towboats under Ohio Gen. Code &sect; 5328 as well as the valuations of a refinery and equipment and machinery in the process of construction. After the Board of Tax Appeals (BTA) substantially rejected the taxpayer's consolidated appeals and upheld the commissioner's rulings, the taxpayer appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">The taxpayer claimed that its barges and towboats were not subject to state tax. It also challenged the valuation of a plant and certain equipment and machinery in the process of construction. When the BTA substantially upheld the commissioner's determinations, the taxpayer appealed. The court affirmed in part and reversed in part. The court upheld the taxation of the barges and towboats despite a Fourteenth Amendment challenge because the law did not require apportionment based on the percentage of actual use in the state's waters and apportionment, as a legislative function, was not properly undertaken by a court. The court also upheld the BTA's ruling that machinery under construction nonetheless was &quot;used in business&quot; for the purposes of Ohio Gen. Code &sect; 5325-1 because the ruling was neither unreasonable nor unlawful. However, the court reversed the BTA's plant valuation. While the commissioner had properly eliminated certain &quot;overrun&quot; costs from the plant's assessed value, the court agreed with the taxpayer that further reduction was needed to reflect the plant's functional obsolescence and the holding was reversed and remanded for redetermination of the plant's true value.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">The court upheld the imposition of state property tax on the taxpayer's barges and towboats, upheld the imposition of tax on certain machinery and equipment under construction, and upheld the commissioner's determination of certain &quot;overrun&quot; costs. However, the court found that the BTA had inadequately reflected the impact on taxable value of the plant's functional obsolescence. It reversed the ruling and remanded the issue for redetermination.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On June 14, 1950, relators, a firm of consulting engineers, entered into a written agreement with the Director of Highways which provided for their performing certain services necessary for the study of a proposed turnpike project.  This contract provided for payment of the relators' fees in installments.  At the time of the filing of their petition, relators had performed all the services required by the agreement to be performed in order to entitle them to certain payments under the agreement, and the Director of Highways had transmitted to the Auditor of State vouchers for the issuance of warrants to relators for such payments.  The auditor refused to issue the warrants.  Thereupon, relators brought this original action against the Auditor of State, seeking a writ of mandamus compelling the auditor to issue the vouchers for such payments.  The case is now before this court for hearing upon the demurrer of relators to the amended answer of the auditor.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">The engineers sought payment for work they did on a study for a proposed turnpike project. The auditor claimed that the Ohio Director of Highways did not have authority to make the contract involved for numerous reasons: Ohio Gen. Code &sect; 1220 required that the director use employees of the highway department; the project had not even been located; a turnpike commission did not exist; and the turnpike act was unconstitutional. The court sustained the engineers' demurrer. The court held that &sect; 1220 impliedly permitted the director of highways to enter into a contract with a firm of consulting engineers. It also allowed the turnpike commission to secure necessary information before locating a turnpike. The turnpike commission appointees had power and authority to act as a turnpike commission while awaiting confirmation by the state senate. Ohio Const. art. I, &sect; 19 permitted the taking of private property for toll roads as long as the owner was first compensated. Even if sections of the turnpike act not pertinent to this case were unconstitutional, the remainder of the act was independently valid.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">Village of Westlake, Ohio, Zoning Ordinance prohibited the erection of commercial greenhouses in residential districts without a special permit. The ordinance provided that any applicant had a right notice and a public hearing to determine whether its greenhouse would be detrimental to the character of the district. The village building commissioner denied a landowner's application for a special permit. Instead of requesting a hearing, she filed an action for a writ of mandamus in the court of appeals on the ground that the ordinance as applied was unconstitutional. The court of appeals granted the writ and ordered the commissioner to issue the permit. The village and the commissioner appealed. The court quoted the ordinance's provisions for administrative appeal and observed that the landowner had not exercised her rights under the ordinance to appeal. Constitutional questions were not to be addressed unless they could not be avoided. Moreover, the constitutional issues would not be properly preserved unless the landowner exhausted her administrative remedies. The court reversed.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is an appeal by six cities of this state, Columbus, Cleveland, Akron, Toledo, Dayton and Canton, from an order of the Public Utilities Commission made March 28, 1949, approving a schedule of service rates to be charged by The Ohio Bell Telephone Company pursuant to its application therefor filed February 2, 1948.  The rates so approved went into effect April 1, 1949, and have been charged by the company since that date.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In this opinion, the Public Utilities Commission will be referred to as the commission, The Ohio Bell Telephone Company as the company, the appellants as the cities, the American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Company as American, and the Western Electric Company as Western.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hearings on the company's application were commenced on November 29, 1948, and the evidence was concluded on January 5, 1949.  As required by Section 614-20, General Code, a report of the secretary of the commission was filed on September 17, 1948, prior to the hearings and became available to all parties concerned.  This report and the schedules attached thereto disclosed the results of the commission's investigation of matters set forth in the application&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of the company.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The company's evidence covered the essential elements of proof in a public utility rate hearing case, including reproduction cost new, existing depreciation, revenues and expenses, separation of property used in interstate and intrastate commerce, and fair rate of return.  The evidence fully disclosed the company's and Western's intercorporate relationships with American as its subsidiaries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To replace the schedule of rates fixed in 1927, the application sought the approval of a new schedule estimated to produce additional revenue of about $ 8,500,000 annually, or an increase of gross revenues of approximately nine per cent per annum.  The company claimed and offered evidence to show that the increase sought was necessary because of increased operating expenses due to increase in cost of equipment and largely to increase in wages and salaries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The only witness called by the cities was an engineer assigned to the law department of the city of Cleveland who testified only on the cost of money as related to a fair rate of return.</SPAN></P>

The commission held a hearing, reviewed the evidence, and approved the increase. On appeal, the court ordered a modification of the commission's determination of a proper rate base, and as modified, affirmed. The court found that a modification of the proper base rate was necessary because part of the depreciation reserve was inappropriately included in the rate base, which was used to justify the rate increase. The court determined that the depreciation reserve, to the extent that it exceeded the present or accrued depreciation of the utility property, could not be invested in new or additional property and its value included and treated as a part of the rate base. The court also found that the straight line basis of computation of depreciation reserve was more realistic, and a proper depreciation reserve should contemplate something more than an equivalent to present or accrued depreciation because the rate of depreciation should be equally distributed over the life of the plant, rather than unequally where in the later years of the plant the rates would be significantly higher.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  APPEAL from the Public Utilities Commission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On January 21, 1949, the Andrews Cartage Company, which will hereinafter be designated applicant, a motor transportation company certificated as a common carrier, applied to appellee, the Public Utilities Commission, hereinafter designated the commission, for a private motor carrier permit under which, pursuant to a private contract, applicant proposed to serve the United States Steel Supply Company, hereinafter designated shipper, a large shipper of steel operating in Cleveland.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The appellants, hereinafter designated protestants, protested the issuance of the proposed private motor carrier permit.  The hearing on the application was held before an attorney examiner of the commission before whom evidence was adduced that the applicant has been in business in Cleveland for 37 years, and that it holds common carrier authority from the commission, but as a common carrier has never served the shipper.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The applicant and its affiliated companies own more than 300 pieces of motor vehicle equipment which will be needed by the shipper for its business under the proposed contract, which contract provides for the exclusive use by the shipper of&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  specialized equipment.  The contract provides that the applicant is to acquire trucks specially designed for transporting fabricated steel of irregular shapes and varying lengths, with devices to facilitate unloading from the sides at places where there are no unloading cranes.  The shipper's business is that of warehousing, fabricating and supplying the smaller users of steel as well as the larger users who do not buy large quantities of particular types of steel.  The shipper also operates a warehouse in Cleveland where it has just completed a new plant which will handle about 5,000 tons of steel per month.  The steel which the shipper manufactures is made to fit particular jobs in reinforcing concrete and may be of most any shape or size.  The applicant is to move the steel to building job sites which will be in various parts of the state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The contract provides that the shipper will make exclusive use of the equipment furnished by applicant and that added equipment will be furnished on call when needed.  Under the contract the shipper is to pay applicant weekly for the regular equipment and daily for the extra equipment, the compensation being based on the size of the vehicle, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and additional payments for trucks depending upon the mileage traveled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Applicant's trucks are to be built to the shipper's specifications, painted in the shipper's colors and with its name on them.  There is evidence that the shipper is using the protestants' service and expects to continue to do so; and that about 40 per cent of its total tonnage will move by common carrier and 40 per cent by contract carrier.  There is evidence that the service of the applicant under the contract permit will cost the shipper more than the use of the trucks of the applicant as a common carrier if it were possible to do so.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The shipper will be using the services of contract carriers at other warehouses in the United States, since it has disposed of its own trucks and uses services such as proposed in the contract.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The business contemplated by the contract is entirely new and has never been served by any common carrier.  The contract provides that the shipper will keep the time of the truck drivers' work day, will do the dispatching of the drivers and trucks; and that the service furnished will be identical with private carriage except that it will be given to a contract carrier.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The evidence shows&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  that the contract will not take business from any existing facility either rail or motor.  There is evidence that the type of business contemplated by the contract is a specialized service; a common carrier is not sufficient for the type of business or service proposed and it is neither feasible nor practicable to attempt to devise a common carrier tariff which will apply to the business.  The shipper has never used the applicant as a common carrier under its certificate granted by the commission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The attorney examiner found that the application and formal requirements were in proper order; that applicant was a proper party to whom the commission may grant contract carrier authority; that the shipper has a need for the services proposed by applicant; and that the granting of the application is consistent with the public interest.  He found further that certificate No. 1141 now held by applicant should be restricted by prohibiting the transportation of property by applicant under such certificate for any shipper now or hereafter listed under applicant's contract carrier authority.  The examiner recommended that the application be granted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The commission adopted the findings of the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  attorney examiner, granted the application and on June 21, 1949, overruled the application of protestants for a rehearing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An appeal was taken to this court.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">Appellant protestants sought review of a decision of appellee Public Utilities Commission of Ohio, which granted an application for a private motor carrier permit submitted by a carrier who proposed to serve a large shipper of steel.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">The carrier applied to the Commission for a private motor carrier permit to service a large steel shipper. The protestants objected to the issuance of the permit. The Commission found that the carrier was a proper party to whom to grant contract carrier authority. The Commission overruled protestants' application for a rehearing. Protestants contended that a Commission rule prohibiting a common carrier from securing a private motor carrier permit unless approved by the Commission was illegal. The court held that: (1) there was ample evidence to demonstrate that the service to be performed by the carrier for the shipper was of such a special nature that it justified a contract with a private carrier in order to have it performed in a businesslike and sensible manner and in order to reduce the number of large trucks on the highways; and (2) while Ohio statutes defined common carrier by motor vehicles as something entirely different from a private carrier, there was no prohibition against one person being both, and thus, it was not unlawful for the Commission to vest a dual character upon a transportation company if consistent with the public interest.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On August 6, 1948, plaintiff, appellant herein, filed his petition (later amended) in the Common Pleas Court of Lucas County attacking the validity of the ordinance adopted by the council of the city of Toledo on January 28, 1946, known as Ordinance No. 18-46.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition to the officers of the municipal corporation, the E. B. Badger Company, plaintiff's employer, was made a party.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">The city employee argued that the city did not have the power to enact an ordinance that provided for the assessment and collection of an income tax. The General Assembly could not enact an income tax unless it was in accordance with the Ohio Constitution. Under Ohio Const. art. XII, &sect;&sect; 8, 9 it was permissible to pass an income tax, which could be either uniform or graduated and not less than 50 percent of the income and inheritance taxes collected by the state was to be returned to the locale in which the tax originated. Because the General Assembly had pre-empted the income tax field, the city, subject to the limitation as may be imposed by the General Assembly under Ohio Const. art. XVIII, &sect; 13 or Ohio Const. art. XIII, &sect; 6, could levy and collect a tax. Therefore, the court held that in the absence of legislation by the General Assembly providing for a uniform or graduated income tax, the city had the power to levy and collect an income tax. Because the city afforded to the city employee a place to work protected by the city government against fire, and theft, the city employee was subject to the tax, even though he was not a resident of the city.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">In a consolidated case, appellant taxpayers, a university and a board of education, challenged judgments from appellee, the Board of Tax Appeals (Ohio), which held that property belonging to the university that was rented out commercially was not exempt from taxation, and which held that the board of education's property allocated for a future junior high school was also not exempt from taxation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">Initially, the university asked for an exemption of its property under Ohio Gen. Code &sect; 4003-15 (120 Ohio Laws 475, 500). Similarly, the board of education asked for an exemption of its property under Ohio Gen. Code &sect; 4834-16. Thereafter, the Board held that both of the properties at issue were not exempt from taxes under the respective provisions. On appeal, however, the court reversed the Board's decisions. Specifically, the court held that although a majority of the members of the court were of the opinion that Ohio Gen. Code &sect;&sect; 4003-15 and 4834-16 were unconstitutional, more than one member of the court did not concur in that viewpoint. As a result, the court declared that both sections were constitutional and that the real properties at issue were entitled to exemption from taxation, except for two vacant lots involved in the university case. As to those vacant lots, the court emphasized that there was nothing to have been used for the endowment or support of the university. Thus, the court concluded that the words of Ohio Gen. Code &sect; 4003-15 did not provide for tax exemption of those lots. Otherwise, the court reversed the Board's decisions.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">The court reversed the decisions of the Board, except as provided in the court's opinion regarding two lots in the university's case.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Louis W. Grieb operated an establishment in the city of Springfield in which he sold beer, wine and spirituous liquors to the public at retail and by the drink under a permit issued by the Department of Liquor Control of the state of Ohio.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On March 1, 1946, the state Board of Liquor Control issued an order revoking Grieb's permit.  Prior to the receipt of the notice of such revocation, agents of the Department of Liquor Control entered Grieb's establishment and seized quantities of wine, whiskey, gin and rum, of the approximate value of $ 5,000, and retained the same as directed and authorized by Sections 6064-28 and 6064-40, General Code.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thereafter, Grieb brought an action for a declaratory judgment in the Court of Common Pleas of Franklin county against the Department of Liquor Control, the Board of Liquor Control and the then Director of Liquor Control.  In his petition Grieb alleged the facts narrated above and asked for a determination as to the constitutionality of:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;* * * (1) that part of Section 6064-40 of the General Code of Ohio which provides for the deduction of 25% of the gross proceeds of the sale of seized intoxicating&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  beverages, legally manufactured and legally acquired by the permit holder, having an alcoholic content of 3.2% by weight to 21% by volume plus the deduction of other costs and expenses as set forth in said section, before refunding the proceeds of said sale to the former permit holder, and (2) that part of Section 6064-40 of the General Code of Ohio which provides for the payment of no amount to the former permit holder for spirituous liquors legally manufactured and legally acquired by the permit holder, seized pursuant to the Liquor Control Act.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The petition was met by a denial of certain allegations thereof.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Findings of fact and conclusions of law were made by the Court of Common Pleas.  The conclusions of law are as follows:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;1. Section 6064-40, General Code, provides for the confiscation of private property which is legally acquired and which is not declared a public nuisance therein, without compensation to the owner thereof and with no provision for hearing or judicial process or judicial determination, in violation of Sections 16 and 19 of Article I of the Constitution of Ohio and the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;2. Section 6064-40, General&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Code, provides for the taking of spirituous liquor legally acquired and not declared a public nuisance therein for the use of public institutions without compensation in violation of Sections 16 and 19 of Article I of the Constitution of Ohio, and the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;3. Sections 6064-28 and 6064-40, General Code, are unconstitutional in that they authorize the taking of and confiscation of private property without due process of law and without compensation in violation of Sections 16 and 19 of Article I of the Constitution of Ohio and the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;4. The seizure of said liquor and the confiscation thereof by the defendants were illegal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;5. The plaintiff is entitled to have said liquor described in the petition returned to him by defendants or recover the fair value thereof from the defendants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is therefore declared, adjudged and decreed that the seizure and confiscation of plaintiff's liquor described in the petition was illegal and the plaintiff is entitled to have said liquor returned to him by the defendants or recover the fair value thereof from the defendants, at defendants' &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  costs, to all of which findings, conclusions of law and judgment the defendants except.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">Appellant Department of Liquor Control challenged a judgment from the Court of Appeals for Franklin County (Ohio) that affirmed a trial court judgment that Ohio Gen. Code &sect; 6064-28 and Ohio Gen. Code &sect; 6064-40, the seizure of appellee owner's liquor were unconstitutional. It also affirmed the judgment that the owner was entitled to have the liquor returned or to recover its fair value.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">The Department seized and destroyed the owner's liquor under Ohio Gen. Code &sect; 6064-28 and Ohio Gen. Code &sect; 6064-40 because the owner's liquor license had been revoked. The court held that the trial and appellate courts were correct in their judgment. Although the license was revoked because he was found to have violated certain statutes, that fact did not alter the fact that the liquor he owned at the time of the revocation of his permit were legally manufactured and acquired. Thus the liquor was not a nuisance per se. He had a property right in the liquor that could not have been taken away without judicial inquiry and determination.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">The court affirmed the judgment of the court of appeals that determined that the statutes allowing the seizure of the owner's liquor and the seizure itself were unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plaintiff's business is the manufacture and sale of ice cream and frozen desserts.  Sales are made by plaintiff's employee-salesmen who operate refrigerated vending tricycles through the streets of the residence sections of Dayton.  The sales take place at the curb, on the sidewalk or on private property.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On June 5, 1946, the commission of the city of Dayton passed the following emergency ordinance No. 16059:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Prohibiting in the interest of public safety, the sale in the parks, and on or from the streets, sidewalks and alleys of the city of Dayton, Ohio, of certain commodities herein enumerated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Whereas, the commission of the city of Dayton, Ohio, deems it necessary and in the public interest to reduce the hazards of injury to young children and to avoid traffic congestion in the parks, and on the streets, sidewalks and alleys of the city of Dayton, to prohibit the sale of certain commodities hereinafter enumerated; and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Whereas, it is necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, property, health and safety, that this ordinance take effect at an early date; therefore.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Be it ordained by the commission&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of the city of Dayton:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Section 1. That the Code of General Ordinances of the city of Dayton, Ohio, be supplemented by the enactment of Sections 228-1 [</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">sic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">] and 288-2 to provide as follows:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sec. 288-1. Excepting in any market stands, which now or may hereafter be licensed under the provisions of sections 156 to 196, Code of General Ordinances both inclusive, and park concessions, now or hereafter granted by the city of Dayton, no person, firm or corporation, shall sell or offer to sell, in the parks, and on or from the streets, sidewalks and alleys of the city of Dayton, Ohio, any ice cream in any form, popsicles, ice sherberts or frozen desserts of any kind, any and all kinds of soft drinks, such as pop cola drinks or others, candies of any kind, hot dog or other sandwiches, and peanuts, popcorn, or other similar products.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sec. 288-2.  Penalty.  Any person, firm or corporation, found guilty of the violation of this ordinance, shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and shall, upon conviction thereof, be fined not less than twenty-five dollars ($ 25) and the costs of prosecution, or more than fifty dollars ($ 50) and the costs of prosecution, and each violation hereof shall&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  constitute a separate offense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Section 2. For the reasons stated in the preamble hereof, this ordinance is declared to be an emergency measure and shall take effect immediately upon its passage.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On June 7, 1946, plaintiff filed its petition in the Common Pleas Court of Montgomery County alleging, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">inter alia</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, that the city officials would &quot;unless restrained and enjoined by this court, enforce the aforesaid ordinance against plaintiff, his agents and employees, and arrest or cause the arrest of plaintiff, his agents and employees.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plaintiff alleged further that the enforcement of the aforesaid ordinance would prohibit it from operating its business in the city of Dayton, Ohio, and would have the effect of stifling competition and would unfairly and unlawfully discriminate against plaintiff.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Common Pleas Court on June 7, 1946, allowed a temporary restraining order which on September 23, 1948, after hearing upon the petition, the answer, the evidence and the stipulation of parties, was made permanent upon the ground that such ordinance was unwarranted, unreasonable and discriminatory and that the provisions of such ordinance had no real and substantial relationship to public&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  safety, public health or public welfare, and that accordingly such ordinance was null and void and in violation of the Constitution of the state of Ohio and the Constitution of the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cause was appealed to the Court of Appeals for Montgomery county and was there heard under the following stipulation:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The parties do hereby stipulate and agree that the transcript of the evidence in the Court of Common Pleas of Montgomery County, filed herein by the appellant as a bill of exceptions, together with the exhibits, shall constitute all of the facts of this case for submission, together with briefs and arguments of counsel, to the Court of Appeals for its determination of this appeal.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">The city enacted an ordinance that prohibited the vendor from selling its ice cream on the city streets. The vendor filed an action against the city to enjoin enforcement of the ordinance. The trial court granted judgment in favor of the vendor and issued a permanent injunction against enforcement of the ordinance on the basis that it had no real or substantial relation to public safety, health, or welfare, and that it was null and void and violative of the Constitutions of Ohio and the United States. The appellate court affirmed the judgment, and the city challenged the decision. On appeal, the court affirmed and held that the ordinance discriminated against persons of the same occupation or business. Various city ordinances licensed sellers of different goods and commodities. The ordinance was unwarranted, unreasonable, and discriminatory.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">The court affirmed the judgment restraining the city from enforcing an ordinance that prevented the vendor from selling ice cream on the streets.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The appellant, Scioto-Sandusky Conservancy District, made an assessment (92 Ohio St., 215) under Section 6828-43, General Code, on the property (Section 6828-1, General Code) of appellee, The Baltimore &amp; Ohio Railroad Company.  Appellee company filed its complaint (Section 5609, General Code) with the board of revision of Fayette county, claiming that the auditor had included the value of personal property in his valuation of the company's real property.  The board of revision having acted adversely, the appellee company filed its appeal to the Board of Tax Appeals (Section 5610, General Code).  The Board of Tax Appeals vacated the finding of the board of revision and made a finding purporting to ascertain and determine the true value in money of the property (Section 5611-1, General Code).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellant was permitted to intervene by the county board of revision.  No question was raised as to the propriety thereof.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The case is in this court under Section 5611-2, General Code, which provides in part:</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">Appellant conservancy district challenged the finding of the Board of Tax Appeals (Ohio) that vacated the finding of appellee board of revision and purported to ascertain the value of appellee railroad company's property. The conservancy district voted an assessment against the railroad's property under the Conservancy Act of Ohio. The railroad company challenged the constitutionality of Ohio Gen. Code &sect; 6828-1, which defined property.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">The railroad company filed a complaint with the board of revision, alleging that the conservancy district had improperly assessed taxes for the value of its personal property, rather than real property alone. The board of revision upheld the assessment, but was overruled by the board of tax appeals. The power of assessment was conferred by Ohio Gen. Code &sect; 6828-43 on the board of directors of the conservancy district and the property assessed was limited to property as defined in Ohio Gen. Code &sect; 6828-1. On appeal, the court ruled, upon hearing and consideration of the record and evidence, that the decision of the board of tax appeals was both unreasonable and unlawful and reversed the order. The Conservancy Act of Ohio defined and controlled exactly what property was properly assessed. Although it was proper for the county board to classify property as between that described in Ohio Gen. Code &sect; 6828-1, within the Conservancy Act of Ohio, and property not described in that section, the court disagreed with the board of tax appeals' holding that the power of assessment was conferred on the Tax Commissioner by Ohio Gen. Code &sect;&sect; 5419, 5423.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">The court reversed the decision of the board of tax appeals and remanded the case to the board with instructions to determine the true value in money of the &quot;property&quot; of the railroad, to be assessed according to law under the resolution of the board of directors of the conservancy district.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">The taxpayers' contentions were based largely upon the claim that neither exhibit &quot;7&quot; nor exhibit &quot;8&quot; should have been admitted in evidence and that without such exhibits there was nothing upon which to base the judgment of the court of appeals. The court carefully examined the various claimed defects in respect of these exhibits and found no prejudicial error in the action of the court of appeals. The taxpayers also claimed the following errors: that the corrected minutes showed that all three of the initial and interdependent resolutions were passed at the same meeting contrary to the provisions of the Uniform Bond Act; the notice of election remained ambiguous and uncertain in a material matter; the resolutions, upon which the county officials acted and upon which the election was actually held, remain uncorrected and admittedly defective in a material matter. The court ruled that all necessary resolutions were adopted and all necessary steps were taken prior to the sale of the bonds, and thereby determined and certified that substantial justice was done to the party complaining as shown by the record.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">S. H. Squire, Superintendent of Banks of the State of Ohio, instituted an action in the Common Pleas Court of Cuyahoga county, as liquidator of The Union Trust Company and as such the holder and owner of a mortgage on certain lake-front property in the city of Cleveland.  Subsequently, Union Properties, Inc., having purchased the property at foreclosure sale, was substituted as plaintiff.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defendants which filed answers and crosspetitions in the Common Pleas Court were the city of Cleveland, The Union Salt Company (name later changed to The Lake Erie Salt Company) and Union Salt Company.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Union Properties, Inc., is the owner of a tract of land situated within the city limits of Cleveland, fronting on Lake Erie and bounded on the west by East 55th street, on the south by property owned by the New York Central Railroad Company and on the east by land owned prior to May 31, 1944, by The Union Salt Company (later The Lake Erie Salt Company) and subsequent to that date by Union Salt Company.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Union Salt Company is the owner of a tract of land also situated within the city limits of Cleveland, fronting on Lake Erie and bounded&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  on the west by the land owned by Union Properties, Inc., on the south by property owned by the New York Central Railroad Company, and on the east by land owned by the American Steel &amp; Wire Company.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Lake Erie Salt Company (formerly The Union Salt Company) is an interested party in this case by reason of the fact that when it sold its property to Union Salt Company it reserved to itself any cause of action for damages or other monetary recovery which had accrued to it prior to May 31, 1944, as the result of actions of the city of Cleveland.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The original petition for injunction was filed in the Common Pleas Court on October 26, 1937.  In an amended and supplemental petition, in addition to the declaratory judgment prayed for, it was sought to enjoin the city of Cleveland and others from proceeding to construct a highway from west to east across and over ground artificially created by filling into the shallow waters of Lake Erie immediately in front of the property of Union Properties, Inc., which highway, it was alleged, would permanently destroy the right of Union Properties to wharf out to navigable waters.  Not only was the city of Cleveland one of the original defendants but&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  also The Wilson Realty Company which had formerly owned the property now belonging to Union Properties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Demurrers were filed, also amended and supplemental petitions and amendments thereto, and the case went to trial upon a second amended and supplemental petition filed April 17, 1943, and the pleadings directed thereto.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The second amended and supplemental petition alleges that Union Properties, Inc., is the owner of premises formerly owned by The Wilson Realty Company; that in 1914 its predecessor in title, The Wilson Realty Company, in order to protect and preserve the littoral rights appurtenant to its property, including the rights of navigation and to wharf out to the navigable waters of Lake Erie, commenced to fill into the shallow nonnavigable waters of the lake; and that at the time of the bringing of this action the filled land extended 700 feet from the 1914 shore line at the westerly end of its property and extended a distance of 200 feet from such shore line at the easterly end.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Union Properties, Inc., alleges further that it has the rights to use the filled land as a wharf, to wharf out beyond the filled land to the navigable waters of Lake Erie and to have access to&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  such navigable waters to the exclusion of all persons, including the city of Cleveland; that such rights are and always have been appurtenant to its upland; that the westerly boundary of such rights is a line parallel to and 100 feet east of that found to be the westerly line of East 55th street, in a decision by the Court of Appeals of Cuyahoga county in the case of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Lake Front East 55th Street Corporation </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">v.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8"> City of Cleveland</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, in which decision the court found that the easterly boundary of the littoral rights appurtenant to the property owned by Lake Front East 55th Street Corporation was a line extending northerly and at right angles to the breakwater from the point where the west line of East 55th street intersected the shore line as it existed in 1925; and that the easterly boundary line of the land owned by Union Properties, Inc., is a line extending northerly from the intersection of the 1914 shore line with the easterly boundary of its upland to and at right angles to the breakwall.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The second amended and supplemental petition alleges further that the city of Cleveland asserts that Union Properties, Inc., has no right whatsoever in filled land or the waters beyond, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  that there are no littoral rights appurtenant to this upland either to use the filled land as a wharf or to wharf out beyond the same, or of access to navigable waters, or of any other nature, and that therefore there are no boundaries of any such rights; that the city of Cleveland bases all such assertions upon certain statutes of the state of Ohio known as the Fleming Act (Sections 3699-</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">a</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to 3699-9, General Code) and the Abele Act (Section 3699-10, General Code); that the Fleming and Abele Acts are unconstitutional and invalid, but, if valid, may not be construed to take away or deny any riparian or littoral rights otherwise than by due appropriation and compensation paid therefor; and that all the filling into the shallow waters in front of plaintiff's upland was done for the purpose of wharfing out to navigable waters of Lake Erie in aid of navigation and commerce and to preserve and protect the littoral rights appurtenant to such upland, including the right of navigation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the statement of its second cause of action, Union Properties, Inc., alleges that in the year 1936 the city of Cleveland, without the permission of either Union Properties, Inc., or its predecessor in&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  title, The Wilson Realty Company, entered upon the filled land extending out from the upland of Union Properties and constructed thereon a sewer, a 100-foot wide highway, known as Cleveland East Shoreway, traversing the land in front of Union Properties' upland from the western to the eastern boundary for a distance of 1,250 feet, and a curved approach to such highway connecting it with East 55th street which extends southerly therefrom; and that in constructing and maintaining such highway the city of Cleveland interfered with, interrupted and cut off access from such upland to the navigable waters of the lake and thereby deprived Union Properties, the owner of the upland, of the use of the filled land as a wharf and cut off and interfered with the owner's use and enjoyment of the littoral right appurtenant to its upland property.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The prayer of the second amended and supplemental petition is for a declaration by the court establishing Union Properties' rights to use the filled land to wharf out and to have access to navigable waters, a declaration establishing the boundary of Union Properties' land, and an interpretation of Sections 3699-</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">a</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> through 3699-10, General Code (the Fleming&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and Abele Acts).  The prayer is also for a perpetual injunction against the maintenance of the sewer and highway across the filled land in front of Union Properties' premises, and other equitable relief.  In the prayer, The Union Salt Company (later The Lake Erie Salt Company) is sought to be joined as a necessary party to the establishment of Union Properties' easterly boundary line.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The city of Cleveland filed an answer and cross-petition in which it alleges that its council had under consideration for many years plans for increasing the water commerce of the port of Cleveland; that the execution of such plans had been hampered by the claimed rights of shore owners as asserted by Union Properties; that, proceeding under the city's general powers and powers granted it by Section 3699-1, General Code, and Section 19, Article I of the Ohio Constitution, its council enacted ordinance No. 103455 authorizing the construction and opening up of a waterside street on the lake side of the natural shore line of Lake Erie, across the submerged or filled lands of the state of Ohio, in the east basin of Cleveland's harbor, extending from East 9th street on the west to Gordon Park on the east; &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and that the ordinance designated the purpose of the city in building the street to be to provide direct access to all piers, docks and wharves now or thereafter constructed along such harbor frontage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The city's answer alleges further that no part of the public improvements was placed on or over any area filled in by Union Properties or its predecessor in title and denies that The Wilson Realty Company began filling in the waters of Lake Erie in front of its upland for the purpose of preserving or protecting its so-called littoral rights, but says that such filling in by that company, or which was permitted by it, was done for the purpose of making land which it hoped to add to its upland as owner thereof.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cross-petition of the city alleges that the city plans eventually to take possession of all the filled land in front of Union Properties' upland for public uses in aid of navigation and seeks a declaration of rights, powers and liability, if any, to take or for having taken possession of part of such filled land and its right to take possession of other parts of such filled land, if it desires so to do, and a declaration of its rights and powers under the provisions of Sections&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***9]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  3699-1 and 3699-2, General Code.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An answer and cross-petition was filed by The Union Salt Company (later The Lake Erie Salt Company).  Such answer admits most of the allegations of the petition and alleges that &quot;the east and west line of its property extends at right angles from the upland boundary of said land to the breakwall, established by the United States government.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cross-petition of The Union Salt Company (The Lake Erie Salt Company) alleges the construction of the shoreway by the city, the damage to the company's littoral rights as appurtenant to its upland, and that The Union Salt Company has &quot;not caused any fill to be placed in the waters of Lake Erie nor has it in any artificial manner extended its shore line.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The prayer of The Union Salt Company (The Lake Erie Salt Company) is that the court require the city of Cleveland to institute proper appropriation proceedings, and that the littoral rights of The Union Salt Company be determined.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Union Salt Company, which, on May 31, 1944, during the pendency of this action, purchased the land formerly owned by The Union Salt Company (The Lake Erie Salt Company), filed an answer similar to the answer and cross-petition&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***10]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  filed by The Union Salt Company.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Wilson Realty Company was in default for answer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There have been numerous replies and amendments to pleadings filed, none of which varies materially the issues presented by the second amended and supplemental petition and the original pleadings filed to it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The case came on for trial in the Court of Common Pleas and the parties, in support of their claims, offered much evidence which is found in five volumes containing the printed record and numerous exhibits consisting of maps, official documents and ordinances.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Common Pleas Court made separate findings of fact and conclusions of law.  It found that a filling which made up the artificial land in front of the upland of Union Properties was done by or on account of The Wilson Realty Company, the predecessor in title of Union Properties; that the easterly and westerly boundaries of the littoral rights of Union Properties were located as set forth in the second amended and supplemental petition; that Union Properties is entitled to access to navigable waters in front of its upland; that it had and has a right to wharf out to such navigable waters for the purposes of navigation; that it has&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***11]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  a right to use and occupy such filled land as a wharf for the purposes of navigation; and that the city of Cleveland has no right to cut off, impede or interfere with such access or use without compensation therefor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The court found further that the sewer constructed by the city was located on filled land appurtenant to Union Properties' land; that the highway running from the west to east boundaries was constructed on filled land constituting a wharf appurtenant to Union Properties' upland; that the curved roadway connecting the highway with East 55th street was constructed upon filled land in front of Union Properties' upland; that in the construction of such highway the city had removed artificially made land of Union Properties, totaling 124,757 cubic yards; &quot;that such works of the city of Cleveland in and upon said made land of plaintiff are not works in aid of navigation and commerce;&quot; that the works were constructed without the permission or consent of Union Properties or its predecessor in title, and without compensating them in any amount whatsoever therefor; that these works impair, impede and interfere with access to navigable water from and to Union Properties' upland&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***12]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and deprive it of the use of the filled land; and that &quot;the acts of said defendant, the city of Cleveland, in so constructing and maintaining said works without having acquired from the owner of said upland of the plaintiff the right to so construct and maintain the same, were and are unlawful.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The court held Sections 3699-</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">a</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 3699-1, 3699-2, 3699-3, 3699-4, 3699-5, 3699-6, 3699-7, 3699-8, 3699-9 and 3699-10, General Code, violative of Section 26, Article II, Section 1, Article XIII, and Section 20, Article I, Constitution of Ohio and, therefore, invalid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The court determined that Union Properties was entitled to damages for the dirt removed and for the impairment of its littoral rights, and granted it certain rights of access over and under the highway.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The court found further that The Lake Erie Salt Company was the owner of premises formerly owned by The Union Salt Company; that the boundaries of its littoral rights were as set forth in the answer and cross-petition of The Union Salt Company (The Lake Erie Salt Company); that the land north of the 1914 shore line was artificial or filled land which resulted from filling in shallow, nonnavigable waters; that The Lake Erie Salt&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***13]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Company had at all times during its ownership the right to wharf out to navigable waters for purposes of navigation, the right of access to such waters and the right to take water from and to discharge water into the lake; that in constructing the highway the city of Cleveland filled in shallow nonnavigable waters in front of the upland owned by The Lake Erie Salt Company prior to May 31, 1944; that the highway constructed by the city extends from the westerly to the easterly boundaries of the littoral rights appurtenant to the upland; that such highway and fill in front of the upland are not works in aid of navigation or commerce; that they have been maintained by the city without permission or consent of The Lake Erie Salt Company; that such works impair, impede and interfere with the exercise of the littoral rights appurtenant to such upland; and that the construction thereof, without acquiring from the owner the right to construct and maintain, was unlawful.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The court determined also that The Lake Erie Salt Company was entitled to damages for such impairment and interference, accruing on or prior to May 31, 1944.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As to Union Salt Company, which purchased the land of The Lake&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***14]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Erie Salt Company on May 31, 1944, the court found that the easterly and westerly boundaries of its land are as found in the decision on the cross-petition of The Lake Erie Salt Company and determined that Union Salt Company was entitled to such damages as have accrued since May 31, 1944.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In its decision the Common Pleas Court located the 1914 shore line.  Since the highway was completed and in general use, the court declined to enjoin its maintenance but ordered the assessment by a jury of damages accruing to Union Properties, The Lake Erie Salt Company and Union Salt Company.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An appeal was thereafter perfected on questions of law to the Court of Appeals, which made its own findings of fact and reversed the judgment of the Common Pleas Court in most material respects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Court of Appeals found that the 1914 shore line was the last natural shore line and determined its location to be as found by the Common Pleas Court; that the highway was constructed in front of the upland of Union Properties and Union Salt Company, on submerged or filled-in areas of the harbor; that such highway was a harbor improvement constructed by the city of Cleveland acting within its powers in aid of navigation&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***15]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and water commerce and in furtherance of the public trust under which the site thereof is held by the state of Ohio; that the provisions of Section 3699-2, General Code, did not apply to the fill in front of the property owned by Union Properties and Union Salt Company, because such fills must be made for and useable in furtherance of navigation or fisheries or other public uses to which the site thereof is adapted; that Union Properties and Union Salt Company, because of such fills and the construction of the roadway and other improvements in front of their respective uplands, have lost their advantage of access to the waters of Lake Erie; and that Section 3699-10, General Code, does not apply and does not add to or lessen public and private rights defined by Section 3699-</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">a</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, General Code, and that, therefore, it was unnecessary to determine the constitutionality of Section 3699-10, General Code.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Court of Appeals held further that so far as Union Properties and Union Salt Company may have any rights under Section 3699-</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">a</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, General Code, the boundaries of such littoral rights are as found by the Common Pleas Court, and further granted them the right to cross, underpass or&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***16]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  overpass the shoreway highway and to take water from and return water to Lake Erie.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From the judgment of the Court of Appeals three motions to certify the record were filed in this court.  In case No. 31135 the appellant is Union Properties, Inc., and the appellees are the city of Cleveland, The Union Salt Company and The Lake Erie Salt Company.  In case No. 31136 the appellant is Union Salt Company and the appellees are Union Properties, Inc., the city of Cleveland and The Lake Erie Salt Company.  In case No. 31143 the appellant is The Lake Erie Salt Company and the appellees are the city of Cleveland, Union Properties, Inc., and Union Salt Company.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The case is before this court on the allowance of all three motions.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">Appellant property owners sought review of a judgment of the Court of Appeals for Cuyahoga County (Ohio) that found that a road or shoreway was constructed by appellee city over the filled lands of appellants in aid of navigation and water commerce and that therefore pursuant to the Fleming Act, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 3699-1 to 3699-9, the city was not required to compensate appellants for any interference with its upland or littoral rights.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">Appellant property owners challenged the court of appeals' reversal of an award of damages against appellee city for the impairment, impediment, and interference with their water access and the deprivation of a wharf and its use, as the result of the city's construction of a shoreway or road over filled land on appellants' property. The court of appeals held that the findings of the trial court were against the weight of the evidence and held that the Fleming Act, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 3699-1 to 3699-9, enabled the city to construct a road across the made land in front of appellants' land, whether or not such road was in aid of navigation and water commerce, without compensating appellants. On appeal, the court held that the court of appeals rendered a final judgment without the authority to do so because a remand to the trial court was necessary when the court of appeals reversed a judgment as against the weight of the evidence. The court reversed the court of appeals' judgment and remanded to the trial court for a retrial, which was what the court of appeals was required to do.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">The court reversed the court of appeals' judgment and remanded to the trial court for retrial because the court of appeals was required to remand when it reversed a judgment as against the weight of the evidence. The court held there was conflicting evidence regarding whether appellant property owners had filled their land, whether the fill constituted a wharf, and whether appellee city constructed the road in aid of navigation.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is an action originating in this court, and the question arises by a general demurrer by the respondent to the petition of the relator, which demurrer tests the sufficiency of the petition to state a cause of action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The petition recites that the relator is a duly qualified elector and taxpayer of the city of Hamilton, and that he brings the action for himself and other electors and taxpayers, on behalf of the city, the solicitor of the city having refused to institute an action upon the written demand of relator.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The petition recites further that in the year 1926 the city of Hamilton adopted a charter, pursuant to the Constitution of Ohio, and that such charter is now in full force and effect.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The charter provides, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">inter alia</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, that the council shall consist of seven members, who shall be elected by means of the proportional representation system; that the terms of the members of council shall be for two years; and that if a vacancy occurs in the council, except as the result of a recall election, such vacancy shall be filled by an eligible person named by the remaining members of council.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The petition recites further that the charter contains the following&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  provisions:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Recall.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Recall Petition Papers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Section 146.  A member of the council may be removed from office by the electors of the city.  The procedure for effecting such a removal shall be as follows:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Any elector of the city may make and file with the city clerk an affidavit stating the name of the member whose removal is sought and the grounds alleged for such removal.  The clerk shall thereupon deliver to the elector making the affidavit copies of petition papers for demanding such a removal, printed copies of which he shall keep on file for distribution as herein provided.  In issuing any such petition paper the clerk shall enter in a record to be kept in his office the name of the elector to whom issued, the date of issuance, the number of papers issued, and shall certify upon each such paper the name of the elector to whom issued and the date of issuance.  No petition paper shall be accepted as part of a petition unless it bears such certificate of the clerk and unless filed as hereinafter provided.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Filing Recall Petition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Section 147.  A petition demanding the removal of a member of the council shall be known as a recall petition.  A recall petition to be effective&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  must be returned and filed with the city clerk within 30 days after the filing of the affidavit as provided in the next preceding section, and to be sufficient must bear the signatures of electors of the city equal in number to at least fifteen per centum (15%) of those who voted at the last preceding regular municipal election.  A recall petition, if insufficient as originally filed, may be amended as provided in this charter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Recall Election Ordered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Section 148.  If a recall petition, or amended petition, shall be certified by the city clerk to be sufficient he shall at once submit it to the council with his certificate to that effect and shall notify the member whose removal is sought of such action.  If the member of the council whose removal is sought does not resign within five days after such notice the council shall thereupon order and fix a day for holding a recall election.  Any such election shall be held not less than forty nor more than sixty days after the petition has been presented to the council, and at the same time as any other general or special election held within such period; but, if no such election is to be held within such period, the council shall call&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  a special recall election to be held within the time aforesaid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Candidates to Succeed Member Recalled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Section 149.  The question of recalling any number of members of the council may be submitted at the same election, but as to each member whose removal is sought a separate petition shall be filed and provision shall be made for an entirely separate ballot.  Candidates to succeed any member of the council whose removal is sought shall be placed in nomination by petition, signed, filed and verified as provided for nominating petitions for a regular municipal election; except that each petition paper shall specify that the candidate named therein is a candidate to succeed a particular member of the council whose removal is sought.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Ballots in Recall Elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Section 150.  Ballots used at recall election shall conform to the following requirements:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;With respect to the member of the council whose removal is sought the question shall be submitted, 'Shall (name of person) be removed from the council by recall?' Immediately below such question there shall be printed on the ballots the two following propositions, one above the other, in the order here indicated:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;'For the recall&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of (name of person).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;'Against the recall of (name of person).'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Immediately at the left of each proposition there shall be a square in which the elector by making a cross mark (X) may vote for either of such propositions.  Under the proposition shall appear the words, 'Candidates to succeed (name of person) if recalled,' and beneath such words the directions to voters required to be printed on the ballots for a regular election of members of the council.  Following the direction to voters the names of candidates shall be printed on the ballots in rotation as provided for a regular municipal election.  The name of the member of the council whose removal is sought shall not appear on the ballot as a candidate to succeed himself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Result of Recall Election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Section 151.  If a majority of the votes cast on the question of recalling a member of the council shall be against his recall he shall continue in office for the remainder of his unexpired term, but subject to recall as before.  If a majority of such votes be for the recall of the member indicated on the ballots he shall, regardless of any defect in the recall petition, be deemed removed from office.  When a member of the council&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  is removed from office by recall the candidate to succeed such member, declared elected after counting the votes in the manner provided by this charter for a regular election, shall succeed the member so removed for the unexpired term.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Election When Member Resigns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Section 152.  If a member of the council in regard to whom a sufficient recall petition is submitted to the council shall resign within five days after notice thereof, the election shall be held as hereinbefore provided except that all propositions in regard to the recall shall be omitted from the ballots and that above the names of the candidates and before the direction to the voters, shall appear the words, 'Candidates to succeed (name of person) resigned.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Limitations on Recall Petitions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Section 153.  No recall petition shall be filed against a member of the council within three months after he takes office, nor in case of a member subjected to a recall election and not removed thereby, until at least six months after that election.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The petition recites further that on March 8, 1948, the relator filed with the respondent, the clerk of the city of Hamilton, the following affidavit:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;K.

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As grounds for such recall election or removal from office, affiant says that said Edward Beckett has violated the pledges which he made to the electorate of the city of Hamilton in the course of his campaign for election to said office; has departed from, and performed in office contrary to, the representations which he made to the electorate of said city whereby he sought election to said office; has circumvented the desires and purposes and betrayed the interests of the electors of said city by whose votes he was elected to said office; his conduct in said office has been inimical to the welfare and best interests of the city of Hamilton and&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of its citizens.  Affiant believes, and therefore states, that the majority of the electors of said municipality desire the recall and removal of said Edward Beckett from said office.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Relator prays for a writ of mandamus directing respondent to issue to relator such recall petition forms or papers as provided for in such charter.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">In an action by plaintiff relator against defendant city clerk the Supreme Court of Ohio considered the relator's request for a writ of mandamus issuing the clerk to deliver recall petition forms and papers so that a member of the city council might be recalled through popular vote.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">The relator, a taxpayer, hoped to recall a certain city council member and requested recall petition forms from the city clerk accordingly. The city clerk failed to deliver such forms and claimed that the recall provisions of the city charter violated Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 38. Essentially, the city clerk was claiming that only for reasons specified under the Constitution were city council members to be recalled. The court analyzed the issue by looking to various constitutional provisions and held that the selection of municipal officers was a matter of purely local concern, and that the method of their selection and the tenure of their office could legally be limited or circumscribed by the provisions of a municipal charter adopted in pursuance of Ohio Const. art. XVIII, &sect; 7. Thus, the city's recall charter provision was simply a device which the people of the city saw fit to write into their charter, by which the councilman could be called to the test of a popular vote as to his right to continue in office. The court granted the requested writ accordingly.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  APPEAL from the Board of Tax Appeals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is an appeal from a decision of the Board of Tax Appeals denying an application to exempt from taxation certain real property belonging to the New Orphans' Asylum of Colored Children of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, Ohio, appellant herein, hereinafter called the asylum, and an application for remission of taxes and penalties thereon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The facts are not in dispute.  The asylum is a corporation chartered by special act of the General Assembly in the year 1845.  The asylum has rented the property in question to others and has used the rental income therefrom for the maintenance of the asylum.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The stipulation of facts reads as follows:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;(1) The net income of the property in question in these proceedings is and uniformly has been used solely for the support of the New Orphans' Asylum of Colored Children, an institution used exclusively for a children's home for poor children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;(2) The New Orphans' Asylum of Colored Children has never at any time paid taxes on the property in question.  Prior to the tax year 1933, the lessee of the property paid taxes thereon.  In 1933, for the first time taxes on this property were assessed against the applicant&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  [asylum].  That action led to the application whose denial resulted in this complaint.  Neither before nor since 1933 has the New Orphans' Asylum of Colored Children paid any taxes on this property.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;(3) This stipulation may be made a part of the record in these proceedings.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In April 1946, the asylum filed with the county auditor of Hamilton county an application for exemption of this property from taxation for the year 1946 and an application for remission of taxes and penalties thereon, amounting to $ 5,821.23, both applications being based upon the provisions of Section 5353-1, General Code.  On the hearing thereon, it was contended further by the asylum that the property in question was also exempt by reason of section 8 of its charter (hereinafter referred to as section 8).  Section 8 recites &quot;that all property belonging to said corporation shall be exempt from taxation by any law of this state.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Board of Tax Appeals denied the applications, stating in its entry of denial that &quot;the Board is more than doubtful of the constitutionality of * * * Section 5353-1, General Code, in view of the decision of the Supreme Court of Ohio in tax exemption matters,&quot; and held further&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  that the board had no jurisdiction to hear the applications so far as they are predicated on section 8.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The asylum has appealed to this court pursuant to Section 5611-2, General Code, contending that the decision of the Board of Tax Appeals is unreasonable and unlawful.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">Appellant asylum sought review of the decision of the Board of Tax Appeals (Ohio), which denied the asylum's applications for tax exemptions on certain property, questioned the constitutionality of Ohio Gen. Code &sect; 5353-1, and held that it had no jurisdiction to hear the applications.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">The asylum applied for a tax exemption on certain property which it owned and rented, but used the net income therefrom for maintenance of the asylum. The asylum was denied an exemption. The court reversed. The court held that &sect; 5353-1, which exempted the asylum's property, was unconstitutional because the general assembly's power to exempt real property was limited by Ohio Const. art. XII, &sect; 2, and it had been established that when real estate was used for rental purposes, the right to exemption was forfeited even if the proceeds were used for charitable purposes. The court held, however, that the Board should have considered the appeal because pursuant to Ohio Gen. Code &sect;&sect; 1464-1, 5570-1, and 5579, the Board necessarily had the authority to determine whether or not the asylum was not delinquent where it was allowed to determine who was delinquent. The court also held that the asylum was entitled to an exemption under &sect; 8 of its charter because it obtained its charter by special act of the general assembly, and the charter was obtained prior to the enactment of Ohio Const. art. XII, &sect; 2; therefore the contract rights of the asylum could not be affected by the later constitution.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">The court reversed the judgment of the Board and remanded the case to the Board for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">APPEAL from the Secretary of State.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These two cases are so interrelated that they are considered together.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Case No. 31496 is an action in mandamus originating in this court, and case No. 31498 is an appeal from a finding of the Secretary of State, pursuant to Section 4785-100</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">a</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, General Code.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On April 6, 1948, the Ohio Wallace-for-President Committee, an unincorporated, independent group of citizens of Ohio, filed with the Secretary of State an affidavit which stated, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">inter alia</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, that the group does not advocate, either directly or indirectly, the overthrow by force or violence of our local, state or national government; and that it does not carry on any program of sedition or treason by radio, speech or press.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Secretary of State, pursuant to Section 4785-100</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">a</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, General Code, certified that this group is not entitled to have a place on the presidential ballot in the election of 1948.  There was an appeal from the finding of the Secretary of State to this court, in case No. 31498, and such case is here as a matter of right.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On June 10, 1948, the 25 relators, in case No. 31496, filed a petition for a writ of mandamus against respondent Edward J. Hummel&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  as Secretary of State and chief election officer of the state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The petition recites that respondent as chief election officer is the official with whom petitions are filed, which nominate candidates whose elections are to be determined by the electors of the state at large, and who is charged by law with the duty of supervising and processing such petitions and placing on the ballots the names of those duly nominated as candidates for state offices; that the relators are each possessed of the qualifications of an elector and are electors of the state; that a general election will be held in Ohio on November 2, 1948, when, together with other officers, 25 presidential electors of the state for 1948 will be elected by the voters of the state at large; and that the duties of the presidential electors who are elected are to meet in the state capitol at noon on a day designated by the Congress of the United States for the purpose of voting by ballot for president and vice-president of the United States for the term commencing in 1949, to make, sign and certify a list of all the persons voted for, the number of votes for each, and to transmit the list to the president of the United States&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Senate in Washington, D. C.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The petition recites further that petitions have been circulated among the electors of Ohio to nominate relators and each of them as independent candidates for election to the offices of presidential electors to vote for Henry A. Wallace for president and Glen H. Taylor for vice-president, each of whom resides in a state other than Ohio and who are constitutionally eligible to be elected to those offices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The petition recites further that the aforesaid nominating petitions were tendered to respondent on June 10, 1948, accompanied by the written acceptance of the nominations by the relators and each of them as independent candidates for the offices of the 25 presidential electors of Ohio in 1948; and that such petitions indicate thereon that the relators and each of them were being nominated to vote for and as representatives of the candidacies of Wallace for president and Taylor for vice-president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The petition recites further that the nominating petitions comply with all the provisions of Section 4785-91, General Code, and that respondent refused to accept and file such petitions and transmit separate petition papers to the proper county boards of elections&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  in order that such boards might examine and determine the validity of the signatures on the petition papers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The petition recites further that respondent refused to accept, file and process such nominating petitions because the statutes prohibit the placing on the presidential ballot or any other ballot at the general election to be held November 2, 1948, the names of candidates for president and vice-president or the candidates for presidential electors representing candidates, unless the candidates for president and vice-president were nominated as candidates for election to those offices by national conventions of political parties to which delegates or alternates were elected at the next preceding primary election, and unless the candidates for presidential electors in Ohio are nominated as candidates for such offices at a state convention of a political party (pursuant to Section 4785-74, General Code).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The petition recites further that independent candidates for presidential electors of Ohio may be nominated pursuant to Section 4785-91, General Code.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The petition recites further that if it be held that the election laws of Ohio do not permit the nomination of any candidates&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  for election as presidential electors except those of the Democratic or Republican parties, such laws are unreasonable, arbitrary and violative of Section 2, Article I, Section 1, Article V, and Section 4, Article XV of the Constitution of Ohio, and the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution of the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The petition prays for a writ of mandamus commanding the respondent to accept and file the nominating petitions of the presidential electors of Ohio tendered to him and to promptly transmit separate petition papers to the proper county boards of elections for action in accordance with Section 4785-92, General Code, and, if the nominating petitions comply with the statutes, commanding the respondent to place the names of Henry A. Wallace and Glen H. Taylor as independent candidates for the offices of president and vice-president of the United States on the official presidential ballot of the state of Ohio; that a vote for such candidates be counted and considered as a vote for each of the relators herein as candidates for election as presidential electors of the state for 1948; and that the court grant such other and further or alternative relief as is necessary&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and proper to fully protect the rights of the relators herein and of all other citizens of the state of Ohio and the United States of America.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By leave of court the petition was amended by adding to the prayer thereof, the following:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;including a writ commanding the respondent to accept, file and process said nominating petitions and print on the proper ballot at the general election of November 2, 1948, the names of the relators as independent candidates for presidential electors.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The respondent filed an answer in which he admits every essential allegation in plaintiff's petition.  However, he states that his refusal to accept and file the nominating petitions and transmit the same to the various boards of elections was for the reason that the relators are not entitled to be nominated to the offices of presidential electors of Ohio for 1948, and that Henry A. Wallace and Glen H. Taylor are not entitled to a place on the presidential ballot to be voted at the general election to be held in Ohio on November 2, 1948, because neither the relators nor the group of which they are or claim to be members has complied with the requirements of Section 4785-100</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">a</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, General Code, and for&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the further reason that there are no provisions of law in Ohio under the authority of which the nomination of independent candidates for election to the offices of president and vice-president of the United States and presidential electors can be effectuated by nominating petitions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The relators filed a reply in which they deny that they or the group of which they are members has not complied with the requirements of Section 4785-100</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">a</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, General Code, and allege that such section was duly complied with by them, and that an appeal pursuant to such section was duly taken to this court from the finding of respondent that the group of which the relators are members is not entitled, pursuant to such section, to have a place on the November 2, 1948, election ballot.  </SPAN></P>

The committee filed a petition for a writ of mandamus commanding the Secretary to place the names of independent candidates for the offices of president and vice-president on the ballot. The court reversed and set aside the findings of the Secretary and concluded that the fact that three members of the group belonged to the communist party, if true, without any showing that they personally advocated the overthrow of the U.S. government by force, did not destroy or impair the effect of the committee's affidavit to get a place on the ballot. The court granted in part the committee's writ petition and commanded the Secretary to accept and file the committee's nominating petition for presidential electors.

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In pursuance of their plan to steal an automobile to be used in the kidnaping of another boy, appellant Donald E. Frohner and Arthur N. Chapman, on Monday, January 13, 1947, went to a point outside the city of Youngstown, where they thumbed a ride from one William C. Spieth.  Chapman entered the Spieth automobile and sat beside Spieth while appellant Frohner got in the back seat with a brief case in which he was carrying a 38-caliber revolver, loaded, and a blackjack, both to be used in the obtaining of the automobile, license plates to be substituted for the license plates on the automobile to be stolen, two pairs of pliers with which to change the license plates, and two ransom notes (one typewritten and one pencil block printed) to be sent to the father of the boy to be kidnaped that evening.  A meeting with such boy had been arranged for that evening.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The decedent, Spieth, was 5 feet 8 inches in height and weighed 143 pounds, while appellant Frohner was 5 feet 11 inches in height and weighed 153 pounds.  The record does not show the height of Chapman but does show &quot;well built, fairly well nourished, white, male patient, 17&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  years of age, weight 135 pounds.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Spieth was asked to stop the car as the boys wanted to get out.  As Spieth slowed down his automobile, Frohner ordered him to get out and upon his failure to obey the order, Frohner struck Spieth over the head with a blackjack and then shot him twice in the back with the revolver, killing him.  Chapman tried but failed to start the automobile.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Observing the approach of a Greyhound bus from around a bend in the road, the boys became frightened, abandoned the automobile and started running across a field.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A deputy sheriff, assigned to investigate the homicide, apprehended Frohner and Chapman that same evening and took them to the Mahoning county jail where they were confined to that part of the jail set aside for juveniles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That same evening, in the presence of Frederic T. O'Connor, a member of the Youngstown police force especially assigned to the juvenile department and working out of Juvenile Judge Beckenbach's court, the deputy sheriff, an assistant prosecuting attorney and others, Frohner and Chapman made and signed the following confessions written by O'Connor, to wit:$&sect;$&sect;$&sect;</SPAN></P>

Then we started walking along Rt 62 towards Youngstown, when another car 1940 Ford 2 door sedan came along, with only the driver in it, I got in the rear seat and Arthur in the front seat, after riding with this man along Rt 62 for about a mile, I told him we wanted to get out and&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  for him to slow down, when he stopped I pulled the gun on him and ordered him out of the car, he wouldn't leave but put up a struggle, and I struck him on the head with the gun, and he continued to struggle so I shot him twice, we both got out of the car and started to run.  There was a Greyhound bus approaching from Youngstown, we started thru the field and then in the woods until it was dark then we came out on the highway where we were picked up by the sheriff, I hid the gun in the woods near the Terrace Gardens.</SPAN></P>

Don said he had a gun and brought it to school today, we were going to use it to get a car.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We rode the bus downtown and then out on Mahoning bus to the end of the line Meridian rd.  We then hitched a ride in a 1946 Ford and rode to Austintown where it turned south on Rt. 46 towards Canfield, the reason we didn't get this car was because there were two men in it.  When we got to the intersection of Rt. 62 and 46 we asked the men to leave us out, about 10 minutes after we got out another car came along and we hitched a ride with him, he drove east on Rt. 62 and after riding about 5 minutes, we told him we were going to get out so he would slow the car down, he started slowing the car down, and Don hit him on the head, and I grabbed the wheel and turned off the ignition and we coasted to a stop, while we were coasting&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to a stop this man started fighting with us, then Don shot him, the man was stunned before he got shot, after Don shot him the bus came along.  I was trying to start the car, reaching my legs over his to get my foot on the starter, did not get the car started, we both got out of the car and started running thru the fields, I thot Don only shot him once but I guess it was twice, Don said come on hurry up let's get away, after we were in the woods quite a while afterwards Don threw the gun in the leaves and covered it up.</SPAN></P>

The court held that no objections, either on policy grounds or constitutional grounds, could be found to Ohio Gen.

The court also held that the trial court properly explained defendant's rights to him, that defendant's decision to waive a jury trial was arrived at after much deliberation with his family and attorney, and that defendant had an intelligent understanding of the effect of the withdrawal of his plea of not guilty and his waiver of a jury trial. The court noted that the defendant could not plead guilty and waive his right to a jury in the hope that he would receive mercy in his sentencing and then later claim ignorance when his gamble failed.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This case originated in the Court of Appeals for Hamilton county.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The relator, Indian Hill Acres, Inc., is a corporation organized and existing under the laws of the state of Ohio, having its principal office and place of business in Cincinnati, Ohio.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The respondent C. A. Eberling is the superintendent of the waterworks of the city of Cincinnati and as such superintendent is in charge of the administration thereof.  The respondent W. R. Kellogg is city manager of the city of Cincinnati and as such is the chief executive and administrative officer of the city and has general supervision and control over respondent Eberling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The relator is engaged in the business of acquiring and developing land for residential purposes, and, at the time of the filing of the petition herein, it had platted and developed, from 226 acres of land which it owned, a subdivision known as Indian Hill Acres Subdivision in Hamilton county and in the vicinity of the city of Cincinnati.  This subdivision consists of 88 acres of land divided into building lots, some of which have been sold, but most of which are still owned by the relator.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This subdivision&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  is bounded on the east side by Miami road, and several roadways have been constructed within the limits of the subdivision to provide entrance to the numerous lots not contiguous to Miami road.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This subdivision lies within Sanitary Sewer District No. 1 of Hamilton county, Ohio, for which district the commissioners of Hamilton county established a water distribution system in 1925.  As a part of such water distribution system the county commissioners caused a 16-inch water main to be laid in Miami road, which main extends the entire length of relator's frontage of land on Miami road, and assessed the real estate within the boundary of the water distribution system for the cost of such improvement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This water main, together with other mains constructed as parts of the water distribution system, was connected with the water distribution system of the city of Cincinnati.  Under a contract with the county commissioners, dated April 24, 1926, the city of Cincinnati agreed to furnish surplus water from its waterworks to certain water distribution systems established by the county commissioners, among which systems was Sanitary Sewer District No. 1.  On October 10, 1930, a similar contract&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  was entered into between the same parties for a period ending May 29, 1946, which contract rescinded and superseded the former contract.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In August 1946, the relator completed the construction of water main extensions along the three streets serving the subdivision.  These main extensions were 6 inches in diameter and terminated at the 16-inch main located in Miami road.  Plans for these water main extensions had been submitted to the waterworks department of the city of Cincinnati and had been approved by it on or prior to May 18, 1946, and prior to the termination of the contract of the city with the commissioners of Hamilton county.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In August 1946, the relator applied to the waterworks department of the city of Cincinnati to have these extensions connected with the main in Miami road so that these extension mains would become a part of and be served by the water distribution system of the county.  The waterworks department of the city of Cincinnati did not grant this application for the reason that, by the provisions of an ordinance of the city of Cincinnati, designated ordinance No. 164-1946 and in effect on May 29, 1946, the city of Cincinnati had provided &quot;that water shall not&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  be furnished to any extension of existing mains outside the city.&quot; That ordinance provides further that under certain conditions the city manager is authorized to submit to council, for its approval, any case in which he feels that the denial of water service will result in great hardship, or he may submit the application of an owner desiring service who has indicated that he is willing that his land be annexed to the city of Cincinnati within a reasonable time after the granting of such service.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The city manager, complying with the above ordinance, submitted to council of the city of Cincinnati the application of the relator and stated that, in his opinion, denial of water service to these water main extensions was apt to result in great hardship and might result in serious economic disadvantage to the community in which the subdivision is located.  On November 13, 1946, the council declined to adopt the ordinance so recommended by the city manager.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thereafter, the relator demanded of respondent Kellogg that he instruct the city waterworks department to connect the relator's water main extensions to the main in Miami road, which the respondent city manager refused to do.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thereafter&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the relator commenced this action in mandamus, alleging that the city of Cincinnati, by voluntarily electing to sell its surplus water to consumers located in Sanitary Sewer District No. 1 under contracts with the county commissioners of Hamilton county, assumed the same duty to the public comprising this water district as a public service corporation would have assumed under a franchise granted by the county commissioners, namely, to serve the public in this district without discrimination; that the provisions of ordinance No. 164-1946, so far as they prohibit the city manager from supplying surplus water to the water main extensions constructed by the relator, are unreasonably discriminatory against the relator and persons desiring to receive water by means of such water main extensions and are contrary to Sections 2 and 19 of Article I of the Constitution of Ohio and the 14th Amendment to the Constitution of the United States; that the city of Cincinnati, by permitting water main extensions outside the city limits to be attached to county water distribution systems supplied with water by the city only upon condition that the owners of such water main extensions execute and file&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  with the city manager annexation agreements, is unlawfully discriminating against the relator and consumers served by such extensions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Relator alleges that the respondent Kellogg, city manager, and the respondent Eberling, superintendent of waterworks, have duties as public officers of the city of Cincinnati to authorize and permit relator's water main extensions to be connected with the 16-inch main in Miami road, and to authorize and permit consumers of water who may be served by such water main extensions to be served upon the same conditions as other persons now receiving water through such water main distribution system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The relator sought a writ of mandamus requiring the respondents to permit such connection.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Court of Appeals granted a writ ordering the respondents to immediately proceed to permit relator to connect its water main extensions to the water main in Miami road and to permit consumers of water to be served by such water main extensions to make connections thereto and to secure water from the water main in Miami road by means of such extensions and connections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The case is before this court upon the appeal of the respondents from the judgment and order of the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Court of Appeals.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">Respondent city officials sought review of a judgment entered in the Court of Appeals for Hamilton County (Ohio), which granted relator developer a writ of mandamus requiring the city officials to permit the developer to connect its subdivision water main extensions to the city water distribution system.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">After the developer's application to the city to have its subdivision water main extensions connected to a city water main was denied under an ordinance that prohibited the city from furnishing water to any extension of existing mains outside the city, it commenced an action in mandamus claiming that the provisions of the ordinance were discriminatory and unconstitutional. The court reversed the lower court's order granting the writ of mandamus and ruled that an express contract between the city and county to furnish surplus water to Sanitary Sewer District No. 1 where the subdivision was located had expired and the city, although it continued to provide water to the sewer district, could exclude those who could be served only through the connection of new extensions to the existing mains. The court found that the stated intention of the ordinance was to assure an adequate supply of water in the future to serve the possibly growing population of city consumers, that the ordinance was not in bad faith, arbitrary, or unlawfully discriminatory against the developer, and that the developer showed no clear legal right to the writ of mandamus.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  APPEAL from the Court of Appeals for Hamilton county.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pursuant to the provisions of Section 3526, General Code, there was filed on March 27, 1946, with the township trustees of Columbia township, Hamilton county, Ohio, a petition requesting that an election be held to obtain the sense of the electors of certain designated territory sought to be incorporated into a village.  The territory sought to be incorporated included platted lands.  Pursuant thereto, an election was held and a majority of the electors voted for incorporation.  Thereupon the trustees certified their proceedings to the county recorder, as provided by Section 3530, General Code.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Subsequent thereto and pursuant to Section 3532, General Code, as modified by Section 3531, plaintiff, appellant herein, filed his petition and subsequently his amended petition in the Court of Common Pleas of Hamilton county, seeking an injunction restraining the county recorder from making a record and certifying a transcript thereof to the Secretary of State.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On May 13, 1946, Thomas F. Dunlap and George C. Taylor, agents for the incorporation petitioners, were made parties defendant.  On June 6, 1946, the John Hilberg &amp; Sons Company&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  made application to become a party plaintiff and filed its petition seeking injunctive relief.  Separate answers were filed by the county recorder and the agents for the petitioners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The issues thus joined, the cause came on for hearing in the Court of Common Pleas, resulting in a finding and decree enjoining the recorder from certifying the record of the proceedings for incorporation to the Secretary of State.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appeal on questions of law and fact was prosecuted to the Court of Appeals where the cause was heard </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">de novo</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and a finding and decree was entered, denying and dissolving the injunction previously granted by the Court of Common Pleas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although urged in brief that the Court of Appeals was without jurisdiction to hear the cause as one in chancery and that Section 3526, General Code, is unconstitutional, it was stated in open court that those issues were not urged.  Therefore, no consideration is given them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cause is before this court upon the allowance of a motion to certify the record.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">Plaintiff challenger appealed from the order of the Court of Appeals for Hamilton County (Ohio), which reversed the trial court and dissolved an injunction that prevented defendant county recorder from proceeding to act on the incorporation of a township into a village after an election by the voters on the petition of defendant incorporators. The lower appellate court held that Ohio Gen. Code &sect; 3526 applied to platted and unplatted lands.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">The incorporators petitioned the township trustees to hold an election to ascertain the sense of the voters as to whether the platted township should become a village. The voters approved, but the challenger claimed that by Ohio Gen. Code &sect; 3517 et seq., the county commissioners had exclusive control over the incorporation of platted lands. On this appeal, the court found that Ohio Gen. Code &sect; 3517 et seq., provided for the incorporation of platted lands and adjacent unplatted lands, by and through the county commissioners, while Ohio Gen. Code &sect; 3526 conferred on the trustees of a township, jurisdiction of proceedings to incorporate villages out of any territory or portion thereof, instituted by petition to the trustees of the township in which the territory was located. The court held that nothing in &sect; 3517 made the authority of the county commissioners over platted lands exclusive, and the plain language of &sect; 3526 made it applicable to &quot;any territory,&quot; not just unplatted lands. The court held that &sect; 3526 was clear and unambiguous, so that the court could not expand or limits its terms, nor read &sect; 3517 to limit its scope, because the statutes were cumulative.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">The court affirmed the decision of the lower appellate court that dissolved the injunction issued by the trial court and allowed the incorporation to proceed.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is one of 30 proceedings in mandamus instituted in this court against the same respondent.

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The board found the &quot;declaration of candidacy and petition&quot; insufficient and rejected it because it was signed by more than five electors contrary to Section 4785-70, General Code.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thereafter, the controlling committee of the Democratic Party of Franklin county filed a protest against the candidacy of the relator.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A hearing was had and the board made a final determination that the &quot;declaration of candidacy and petition&quot; was insufficient and rejected it.</SPAN></P>

The form was properly signed by five electors as required by Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4785-70 (1948). At the same time, the candidate filed another candidacy petition that was also signed by five electors. On appeal, the court upheld the board's rejection of the forms because, in the aggregate, they failed to comply with the requirement of &sect; 4785-70 that the candidacy petition be signed by five, but not more than five, qualified electors. The fact that the signatures were on more than one petition did not affect the issue because the court regarded all petition forms filed by the candidate as his petition. The court explained also that because elections belonged to the political branch of the government, the board's decision was final and not subject to judicial review unless procured by fraud or corruption, or unless there had been a flagrant misinterpretation or misapplication of a statute. Because the candidate claimed no fraud or corruption and the board correctly applied the controlling statute, the court denied the requested writ.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The facts are not in dispute.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the first case the Dayton Rubber Manufacturing Company filed an application with the Tax Commissioner of Ohio for the refund of use tax in the sum of $ 657.10 assessed and paid for the period beginning January 1, 1940, and ending December 31, 1944, under the provisions of Section 5546-26, General Code, on monthly rentals for certain substitute business machines leased from the International Business Machines Corporation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The application was denied by the commissioner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On an appeal to the Board of Tax Appeals the order of the commissioner was affirmed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The history of the second case is similar except that it involves an application for the refund of sales tax in the sum of $ 668.14 which the Remington Rand, Inc., claims was paid erroneously for the period beginning May 1, 1942, and ending August 31, 1945, under the provisions of Sections 5546-1 and 5546-2, General Code, on monthly rentals for machines leased by it to the Fisher Brothers Company.  The commissioner allowed a refund of $ 217.74, representing the tax paid on rentals for&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  original machines delivered before January 1, 1935, the date the sales tax first became effective; but the remainder of the claim for a refund -- $ 450.40 -- was denied on the ground that it represents the tax paid on rentals for substitute machines subsequently delivered.  The order of the commissioner was affirmed by the Board of Tax Appeals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The two cases are in this court for review on the claim that the assessments are unreasonable and unlawful.  </SPAN></P>

The only machines involved were substitute machines delivered after the effective date of the tax. The issue was whether and when these substituted machines were &quot;purchased&quot; and &quot;acquired&quot; by the companies. The court held that the leased machines were &quot;purchased&quot; under Ohio Gen. Code &sect; 5546-25. The companies claimed they were &quot;acquired&quot; at the same time, when the leases were signed. The commissioner insisted that machines substituted later were acquired when they were delivered, after the tax became effective. The court agreed. The dates of the contracts were immaterial, as the contracts were executory until they were performed. Performance, not execution, constituted &quot;acquisition.&quot; Substituted machines were acquired upon delivery. The decisions were affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">Defendant appealed from the Court of Common Pleas of Summit County (Ohio) wherein he was convicted of aggravated murder and was sentenced to death.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">Defendant's conviction and sentence arose from a botched robbery of a pawnshop in which the proprietor was shot to death. Defendant argued that his motion to acquit at the close of the State's case in chief should have been granted because the State's case was based solely on the uncorroborated testimony of a co-conspirator. The court found that there was a reasonable inference to be drawn from the background of the parties and the testimony that four defendants conspired to find a way to get money; that it was natural that any suggestions as to how they could raise money would have emanated from defendant and his sister because the others were strangers to Akron; and that the testimony was corroborated by an independent witness who saw defendant run out of the pawn shop and by ballistics evidence. Defendant argued that the verdict on the charge of aggravated robbery was not supported by sufficient evidence. The court disagreed because part of the plan to rob the pawn shop was to use a gun, all of the participants knew the triggerman had live cartridges to put into the gun, and it was clear that the death was caused by the bullet fired from the gun held by the triggerman.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">The debtor argued that the Board erred in affirming the final order of the Commissioner because the forfeiture assessment and penalty were barred by &sect; 57(j) of the Bankruptcy Act. Section 57(j) of the Bankruptcy Act provided that debts owing to the United States or any state or subdivision thereof as a penalty or forfeiture were not to be allowed, except for the amount of the pecuniary loss. The debtor argued that the section only allowed penalties to the extent of any pecuniary loss and that inasmuch as the debtor had paid its tax with a penalty of 15 percent, the State had not suffered any pecuniary loss. The court held that the charge made by the Commissioner was not a penalty, but was revenue collectable by assessment and was subject to a penalty imposed upon it. The court also held that in accordance with &sect; 397 of the Bankruptcy Act, 11 U.S.C.S. &sect; 797 delinquency charges and penalties remained as personal liabilities of defendant and were non-dischargeable pursuant to &sect; 17 of the Bankruptcy Act.</SPAN></P>

The trial court held that the ''reckless&quot; portion of the ordinance was an unconstitutional attempt to punish speech.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">Defendant solicited the complainant, another male, to engage in homosexual activity. Defendant was indicted under a city ordinance that prohibited a person from soliciting another person to engage in sexual activity when the offender knew such solicitation was offensive to the other person or the offender was reckless in that regard. The trial court dismissed the complaint on the ground that the ordinance was an unconstitutional attempt to punish speech. The City argued that the ordinance merely prohibited recklessly offending another person by a solicitation to engage in sexual activity and that a complaint based on such an ordinance should not have been dismissed by the trial court on the grounds of a constitutionally insufficient culpable mental state. The court affirmed the judgment because the uttering of words that were ''rude'' or ''insulting'' could not be prohibited, although vulgar or offensive. The court held that in the same way in which invitations to engage in sexual activity were not necessarily obscene, such invitations were not necessarily &quot;fighting words.&quot; The court held that in fact such invitations could easily be classified as loving words.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">Appellant, a corporate holder of a liquor license, challenged a judgment of the Cuyahoga County Common Pleas Court (Ohio), which affirmed a decision of appellee, the Ohio Liquor Control Commission, to suspend the corporation's license to operate a tavern. The Commission charged the corporation with two unrelated violations of Ohio Liq. Control Comm'n Regs. LCc-1-52, where two employees allowed a woman to perform with exposed breasts.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">The Commission held a hearing on the corporation's case. Upon the advice of counsel, the corporation stipulated the truth of the facts alleged in each charge. The stipulation included the element of &quot;improper conduct.&quot; The corporation contended that the stipulated facts did not constitute a violation of LCc-1-52. The corporation also claimed that both the regulation and the charges were unconstitutional. The Commission heard no evidence other than the stipulations and held that the allegations of the director of liquor control were supported by the evidence. The trial court affirmed, finding also that the order of the Commission was supported by reliable, probative, and substantial evidence. The court affirmed, rejecting the corporation's argument that the trial court erred in failing to explicitly state that the Commission's order was &quot;in accordance with law.&quot; However, the court found that the trial court's journal entry implicitly stated that the Commission's ruling was &quot;in accordance with law.&quot; Further, the corporation had stipulated that it's agent had knowingly permitted &quot;improper conduct,&quot; which admission satisfied all the elements of LCc-1-52.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">Defendants appealed an order of Franklin County Common Pleas Court (Ohio), which overruled their motions for a new trial and for acquittal, after convicting them of operating gambling activities for profit, of acquiring, possessing, controlling, or operating a gambling device, and of altering, destroying, concealing, or removing documents or things, with purpose to impair their value or availability as evidence in a proceeding or investigation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">Based upon confidential information and an investigation, police officers obtained a search warrant for premises upon which defendants allegedly conducted gambling operations. The officers discovered paraphernalia related to gambling operations and found defendants in the process of destroying records and documents by burning them, chewing them, and flushing them in the toilet. Defendants were convicted after a jury trial, and they appealed their convictions, alleging that the trial court erred in failing to suppress evidence because the warrant was defective, that their right to avoid self-incrimination was violated by the seizure of their personal papers, that the prosecution should have had to elect which charges to proceed under at the beginning of trial, and that there was insufficient evidence to sustain the convictions. The court affirmed, finding that there was sufficient evidence to find that defendants were operating a numbers bank, that any devices, including paper and an adding machine, could be considered devices used for gambling, even though they were used for other purposes, and that personal papers were not protected under the Fifth Amendment if they were illegal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">The court affirmed defendants' convictions for conducting gambling operations and other gambling-related offenses.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">Columbus, Ohio, City Code &sect; 2307.04(B) stated that no person could solicit another person to engage in sexual activity with the offender, when the offender knew that such solicitation was offensive to the other person, or was reckless in that regard. Defendant was arrested and tried under the ordinance. The trial court dismissed the complaint, finding that the ordinance was unconstitutional. The City appealed. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that there was no question that whatever consenting adults might choose to do privately, in this area of human activity, was legal in Ohio at the present time. The court opined that the ordinance made a criminal offense of certain social interrelationships and of protected free speech rights of otherwise consenting adults. Additionally, the court found that the ordinance lacked definite standards and was constitutionally vague, as well as indefinite. The court articulated that the ordinance also involved two separate intentions: one, of the person using the words; the other, of the individual hearing them.</SPAN></P>

Appellants challenged the propriety of the entire proceeding.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">Appellants claimed the trial judge was disqualified because of his prior affiliation with the employer and also because his brother was a member of the employer's board of directors. After appellants filed an affidavit of disqualification, and after receiving a letter from the Chief Justice of the Ohio Supreme Court, which directed the trial judge to take no further action, the trial judge issued several rulings in the case. Appellants argued that the trial court judge erred by participating in the proceeding because his bias and prejudice disqualified him. The court reversed the judgment and granted a judgment for appellants. The court held that the trial judge had a mandatory duty from the beginning of the proceedings to disqualify himself from the case, and that his each and every subsequent act, being in violation of his clear and mandatory duty, was utterly void and without effect. The court stated that the mere filing of an affidavit of bias and prejudice had at least a temporary effect; it deprived a trial judge of the power to proceed on the case until such time as the affidavit of disqualification was ruled upon by the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the trial court had erred in failing to inform defendant specifically that the State had to prove defendant's guilty beyond a reasonable doubt and that defendant could not be compelled to testify against himself, but that the error was not prejudicial because defendant's counsel was competent and told the trial court that they had informed defendant of the effects of his plea.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the County Court, Noble County, Ohio, which convicted him of a violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2911.21(A)(1), the trespassing statute. The subject real estate involving the trespass was a ranch. Defendant had entered upon this land to dismantle an old mining shovel under an arrangement with an individual. Defendant had been previously warned that he was on property not owned by this individual.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">On appeal, defendant claimed that the trespass statute was unconstitutional. He contended that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2901.01 was not sufficiently definite to apply to defendant, or any other defendant, as to what trespassing consisted of; in that, in the instant case, defendant did not knowingly enter upon the premises of another, and if he did, he felt that he had a privilege to do so. Defendant further argued that the statute failed to state with definiteness and certainty the acts that were prohibited upon the property of another. The court found that defendant had misconstrued the section in question. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2901.01 did not prohibit acts upon the property, but simply prohibited going on or remaining on property. In this sense the wording of the statute was clear, explicit, and not unconstitutional. Further, an unlawful entry was not indispensable to a conviction under the terms of the Ohio trespass statute. Pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2909.21, remaining upon the premises of another without legal authority after being notified to leave was a misdemeanor.</SPAN></P>

The trial court overruled defendant's motion to suppress the marijuana on the grounds that defendant had committed a misdemeanor, the possession of an open flask and an alcoholic beverage in a public park, in the presence of the officer. Defendant entered a plea of no contest. On appeal, the court reversed the judgment and ordered that defendant be discharged, finding that the search of defendant's person was not incident to a lawful arrest and was a violation of his constitutional rights under U.S. Const. amend. IV. The court noted that the alleged offense of prowling was not an offense because it had been held unconstitutional by the Ohio Supreme Court.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">Appellant handgun owners sought review of the judgment from the Court of Common Pleas of Montgomery County (Ohio), which, after sustaining their objections to a city ordinance prohibiting the sale or possession of handguns because it was vague and impractical, found Dayton, Ohio, Ordinance No. 24780, which required registration by handgun owners, to be within the framework of the constitution, valid, and enforceable.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">The owners sought to restrain as unconstitutional two ordinances of the City of Dayton. The trial court found Dayton, Ohio, Ordinance No. 24746, which prohibited the sale or possession of handguns identified as &quot;Saturday Night Specials,&quot; to be vague and impractical and sustained the owners' objections. However, the court found that Dayton, Ohio, Ordinance No. 24780, which required the registration and possession of an identification card by owners of handguns, to be valid and enforceable. On appeal, the court disagreed with the owners' argument that U.S. Const. amend. II should have been interpreted as though the constitution guaranteed the right to bear arms to the individual rather than to the people. The court noted that the amendment's reference to a militia to protect the security of a free state and found that to argue that U.S. Const. amend II contained an individual rather than a collective state right destroyed the right to a militia and ignored the purpose clause of the second amendment. Lastly, the court held that each sovereign state had the natural and reserved power to regulate arms in the interest of the welfare of its people.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">The trial court (Ohio) dismissed a criminal charge against defendant pursuant to his motion for discharge for delay in trial under Ohio Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">The issue before the court was whether the State had a right of appeal from the trial court's dismissal of defendant's case on speedy trial grounds. The court opined that double jeopardy principles barred the State's appeal. Pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2945.73(D), defendant's discharge pursuant to &sect; 2945.73(B) for failure to bring him to trial within 270 days after his arrest barred any further criminal proceedings against defendant based on the same conduct. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2945.70 provided that the State lacked a right of appeal from anything other than a ruling on a motion to quash, a plea in abatement, a demurrer, a motion to suppress evidence, or a motion in arrest of judgment. The State failed to cite any statute or rule allowing its appeal from a dismissal on speedy trial grounds. Accordingly, the court denied the State's petition for leave to appeal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">Defendant challenged a decision of the Court of Common Pleas of Summit County, which sentenced defendant to death in the electric chair and to a term of seven to 25 years in the penitentiary pursuant to his conviction by a jury for the crimes of aggravated murder and aggravated robbery.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">Defendant shot and killed a local businessman while committing a robbery at the place of business. On appeal, defendant argued that the trial court erred in not suppressing his statements to the police. The court affirmed the judgment. In doing so, the court held that the statements were voluntary. The court noted that although defendant was in custody for nine and one-half hours, his first incriminating statement was made less than one hour after the initial questioning began, the periods of interrogation were not lengthy nor was the interrogation continuous. Further, defendant was 21 years old and had a high school education. Also, the trial court's finding that defendant did not fall within the class of persons excused from capital punishment under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2929.04(B)(3) was not something that fell within the trial court's discretion. It was a finding based upon evidence, and it amply sustained the trial court's ruling. While there was evidence indicating that defendant was below the average in intellectual functioning and was educationally deficient, he was not mentally deficient or retarded. Educational deficiency did not equate with mental deficiency.</SPAN></P>

The court stated that there was sufficient credible evidence with respect to speed to justify the trial court's judgment. The trial court could accept or reject defendant's statements where they contravened the officer's testimony. Because the trial judge chose to believe the officer, the court could not say he was in error and now rejected that testimony. An arrest ticket contained in detail the specific items deemed improper and because they were also a part of Ohio Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">The evidence suppressed was the result of a breathalyzer test and the use of the video tape taken of defendant at the time of defendant's arrest.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">The driver was arrested for operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol. At the police station, the driver refused to submit to a breathalyzer test. He was notified by the Registrar that his license was suspended as a result of his failure to submit to the breathalyzer test. The driver filed a petition for review, but the trial court entered judgment against him. On appeal, the driver argued that the trial court erred in finding that the driver had refused to take a test and in not finding in favor of the driver by reason of the fact that the arresting officer failed to comply with the provisions of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4511.191. In affirming the trial court's judgment, the court held that the trial court correctly found that the driver had refused the test where evidence showed that the driver by his own direct statements refused to take the test on two separate occasions after having been read the implied consent form. The implied consent form, which was read to the driver, contained the requisite information as to the consequences of refusal in compliance with &sect; 4511.191.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">Defendant was present when a friend robbed and killed another person. Thereafter, defendant was charged with aggravated murder. When defendant was convicted as an aider and abettor, defendant sought review, challenging the evidence's sufficiency and claiming the trial court had erred in barring the jurors examination with respect to the death penalty and in charging the jury that defendant could be convicted as an aider and abettor although charged as a principal. In holding that the trial court had not erred in barring the jurors examination with respect to the death penalty, the court noted that because the penalty of death was no longer a jury question, it did not follow that jurors should be questioned about capital punishment. Moreover, the court held Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2945.25(C), which allowed such questioning, was inapplicable. The court also held that in light of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2923.03(F), a party charged as a principal could be found guilty of complicity. Finally, the court upheld the evidence's sufficiency, which included defendant's failure to aid the victim, defendant's sharing in the fruits of the crime, defendant's flight, and spoliation of evidence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">The property owners filed a declaratory judgment action to enjoin the commissioners from taking any action to zone or rezone their property for commercial purposes.

The commissioners filed a motion to dissolve the temporary order and for relief from the final judgment. The trial court granted the property owners' request for a permanent injunction and the commissioners appealed. In reversing the trial court's judgment, the court held that the trial court erred. The court found that the trial court did not have jurisdiction to enjoin the commissioners from taking a legislative act to rezone property. The court stated that there was error in granting the injunction based on the prior declaratory judgment because the injunction granted greater relief than a request for declaratory relief justified.</SPAN></P>

The motion raised 13 assignments of error.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">Following an accident, the administratrix filed two actions against a common defendant. One of the actions was for wrongful death; the second action was a survivorship action. Following a consolidated trial, the jury entered a verdict for defendant in both cases. The administratrix filed a motion for reconsideration. The court considered only assignment of error number 12 which claimed that the trial court prejudicially erred in requiring the administratrix to meet the requirements of an unconstitutional guest statute. The assignment claimed that the trial court erred in its instructions to the jury. However, the court held that the administratrix was barred from asserting such an error on appeal because she failed to object to the trial court's instructions to the jury. The administratrix also failed to request a negligence charge from the trial court. Under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2321.03, the administratrix could not take advantage of errors she induced and that the administratrix was required to object to an alleged omission in the trial court's charge to the jury. As such, the court denied the administratrix's motion for reconsideration.</SPAN></P>

He sought review. The court affirmed. It found that defendant was not denied a speedy trial under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2945.71 because the 90 period was tolled by defendant's request for a continuance of the pre-trial hearing. The refusal to admit a photograph was within the sound discretion of the trial. The trial court did not abuse its discretion when it denied the admission of the exhibit because the photograph was not an accurate representation of the subject matter. The trial court did not err when it allowed the jury to view the entire video-taped testimony of a witness because the review of the testimony on videotape was no different than a review of a transcript of a witness's testimony. Finally, defendant was properly convicted of the gun charge under Ohio Rev.

Thereafter, defendant was dismissed from the facility for failure to observe its rules. The trial court terminated defendant's probation and ordered his incarceration after a hearing. On appeal, the court held that Ohio's revocation of probation provisions were not unconstitutional, per se because they provided for a preliminary and a final hearing. However, the court found that defendant did not receive a proper final hearing. In addition, the court found that defendant's counsel was not permitted to introduce into evidence a report prepared by the probation officer and he was not permitted to cross-examine the officer on the report.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">Plaintiff, an alleged illegitimate son of a decedent, appealed a judgment from the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio) that dismissed his will contest suit against defendants, an executrix of the decedent's estate and others, for lack of standing to bring the suit.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">The son claimed that he was the sole person entitled to inherit the estate if the decedent had died intestate. After the trial court sustained the executrix's dismissal motion on a claim that the son lacked standing because he was not an heir at law, the son appealed. Affirming, the court said that the trial court did not err in finding that the son had no standing to maintain the action. The son claimed no basis for his right to maintain the will contest other than his claim that he was an illegitimate son. Under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2741.01, a will contest action could be brought only by one who had a direct pecuniary interest in the estate of the decedent that would have been defeated or impaired if the will admitted to probate was a valid will. An illegitimate child did not per se have an interest in the will of his natural father and, thus, had no standing to maintain a will contest. There was no invidious discrimination constituting an unconstitutional denial of the equal protection of the law in the application of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2105.17, which denied to the illegitimate child a right to inherit from a natural father unless he provided for such inheritance.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">The board adopted the &quot;open transfer plan,&quot; which allowed students to transfer to a school outside of their neighborhood school for racial balance if appropriate space was available at the other school. The parents argued that the trial court erred in finding that they had failed to prove an immediate or irreparable injury. Finding no error in the trial court's judgment, the court affirmed. The evidence failed to indicate any present or threatened real, certain, substantial, serious, and direct injury. There was evidence that implementation could possibly cause an inconvenience because a student might have to attend a school other than his neighborhood school. Such evidence would not support an injunction. An injunction would not be granted where damage was trifling, fanciful, sentimental, or the result of a mere inconvenience. The parents also argued that the resolution, which was passed by the board establishing the transfer policy, was violative of Ohio Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 3313.48. The court disagreed. The resolution applied to those who were willing to voluntarily transfer schools. It did not threaten the right to attend the most convenient appropriate school.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">Plaintiffs, a passenger and his wife, appealed the judgment of the Common Pleas Court of Mahoning County (Ohio), which found in favor of defendants, a first driver and a second driver, in an action for personal injury damages. The passenger argued that the Ohio Guest Statute,&nbsp;Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4515.02, was inapplicable and that the trial court erred in refusing to instruct on the law governing speed under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4511.21.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">The passenger was riding in the first driver's car on the way to work when the car was involved in an accident with a car driven by the second driver. The passenger and the first driver were employed by the same company, and the passenger had paid the first driver for the ride to work. The passenger and his wife filed an action against the first driver and the second driver, and the trial court returned judgment in favor of the first driver and the second driver. Plaintiffs appealed, and the court reversed as to the judgment in favor of the first driver but affirmed the judgment in favor of the second driver. In light of a decision of the Ohio Supreme Court holding the Guest Statute unconstitutional, the trial court's charge to the jury on the Guest Statute was in error, and the error was prejudicial. However, the trial court did not abuse its discretion under Ohio R. Civ. P. 44.1(A)(2) in failing to take judicial notice of a city speeding ordinance because there was no evidence as to the characteristics of the thoroughfare in which the accident took place. Therefore, there was no prejudicial error in regard to the verdict in favor of the second driver.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">The court reversed the verdict and judgment as to the first driver, and it remanded to the trial court for a new trial on the action against the first driver. It affirmed the verdict and judgment in favor of the second driver.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">A jury convicted defendant of two counts of aggravated murder. He contended that the trial court erred in overruling his motion to order the State to elect no more than one specification for each count in the indictment, that the trial court erred in overruling his motions for acquittal, and that &sect; 2929.04 violated the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution and Ohio Const. art. I, &sect; IX. The court held that the trial court did not err in denying defendant's motion to order the State to elect no more than one specification because Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 2929.04, 2941.14 specifically allowed for more than one count for aggravated murder. The trial court did not err in overruling defendant's motions for acquittal at the close of the State's case, at the conclusion of all evidence, and after the jury returned the verdicts because the evidence was sufficient to sustain the convictions. The court was bound by prior United States Supreme Court decisions that the death penalty per se was constitutional and therefore was required to sustain the constitutionality of Ohio Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">When the property owners sought rulings from the respective local land-use decisionmaking bodies for certain developments on their real estate, their attempts failed. After the property owners filed declaratory actions, the common pleas court dismissed both complaints on the grounds that the property owners failed to exhaust their administrative remedies. The property owners filed appeals, and the appeals were consolidated. The court reversed the judgments of the common pleas court, holding that a complainant must normally exhaust all administrative remedies before seeking a declaratory judgment where the asserted unconstitutionality of a land-use decision was the fundament of his complaint. Further, an alternative to the declaratory judgment action was the Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2506 judicial appeal. However, declaratory relief was proper where the record indicated either that there was no administrative remedy available that could provide the relief sought, or that the remedy which was available was unnecessarily onerous. Because the records did not contain those indications, the actions were remanded for further development of the records.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 1707.44(C).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">Defendant contracted to supply distributors with uncut, pre-recorded reels of tapes, which the distributors were to package and sell back to defendant for resale. The erstwhile distributors paid defendant for this privilege, but defendant did not fulfill the agreement. Defendant was convicted of selling unregistered securities under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 1707.44(C). On appeal, the court held that the transaction met the definition of a &quot;security&quot; under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 1707.01(B), and was not an unregulated investment contract. No ex post facto violation occurred, because the appellate district's controlling case law was issued, in an &quot;unpublished&quot; format, only six days before defendant's crime. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2503.20, stating that only reported cases were officially sanctioned by Ohio courts, was directory, not mandatory. However, on the facts presented, defendant did not receive fair notice that his actions were criminal in nature. The court accordingly reversed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">The court reversed. Although defendant's due process rights were not violated per se by the fact that controlling case precedent was released in unpublished form only six days before he committed criminal acts, he was not given fair notice of the status of the law he was bound to follow.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the search was conducted after defendants gave their consent. The door to the freezer was open, and the police observed a sock with a gun stuffed within it. Also, defendants were already under arrest, because the victim had identified them as his assailants, and the search was incident to that arrest. One defendant's wig, which he used to disguise himself as a female hitchhiker, was properly introduced into evidence when the arresting officer identified it. The criminologist's testimony, that the hair on the trigger guard of the weapon was similar to that of the wig, created a permissible inference that the hair had come from the wig. The trial court, which was the trier of fact, was unlikely to be confused by the meaning of the wig. The trial court did not abuse its discretion by refusing to refer the case for a presentence investigation before sentencing one of the defendants.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">The State filed a civil action to abate a nuisance consisting of the sale of allegedly obscene material. Defendants, a lessor and lessee, appealed a judgment from the Hamilton County Common Pleas Court (Ohio), which found that certain materials were obscene, ordered the store closed for one year under the statutory padlock scheme of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3767.01 et seq., and subsequently granted the lessor's application to reopen the premises.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">At the nuisance hearing the trial court refused to admit defendants' evidence about contemporary community standards and prurient appeal. At the hearing on the application to abate the closure order, the lessor repeatedly offered to seek the trial court's prior approval of any new tenant, and the trial court required the lessor to prevent a nuisance from being established as part of the release order. Defendants claimed that the terms of the covenant to abate included an impermissible prior restraint and that the blanket exclusion of evidence was prejudicial error. Affirming in part, the court held that &sect; 3767.01 et seq. as judicially construed was constitutional. The court agreed that the terms of the covenant to abate were impermissibly broad under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3767.04, but overruled the assignment of error because the lessor agreed to them. Reversing in part, the court held that it was error not to allow defendants to introduce competent, non-repetitive evidence that bore upon the absence of any of the elements of the Miller obscenity test because to hold otherwise would make the trial court, sitting in equity without a jury, the sole arbiter of community standards.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">The court reversed the judgment in part, based upon the trial court's erroneous blanket exclusion of defendants' evidence regarding the elements of the Miller obscenity test. The court affirmed the remainder of the judgment and remanded the cause for further proceedings not inconsistent with the court's decision.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was charged under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2151.41 with acting in a manner tending to cause unruliness in two minor children. The trial court denied defendant's motion for acquittal at the close of the State's case and entered a judgment of guilty.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">The complaint charged that defendant kept the children out until the early morning hours, consuming alcoholic beverages with then and encouraging them to participate in acts of malicious destruction of property of another. Specifically, the State charged that the minors accompanied defendant and others to a scene, where defendant vandalized a police chief's car and later returned and picked up defendant after the mission was accomplished. On appeal, defendant argued that the evidence was insufficient to sustain the conviction and that the judgment was against the manifest weight of the evidence. He also argued, inter alia, that &sect; 2151.41 was unconstitutionally overbroad and vague. The court held that: (1) the vandalizing of the car was both immoral and criminal, and the exposure of the minors to such misconduct violated &sect; 2151.41; (2) any person of common intelligence who wanted to understand &sect; 2151.41 would have no trouble understanding it; (3) neither was &sect; 2151.41 over broad whereas it, as former Ohio Gen.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">The trial court found the executrix failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted in that she alleged no justiciable controversy. She appealed. Construing the complaint most favorably to the executrix, the court agreed that the parties were not entitled to litigate questions that might never affect them to their disadvantage. The general rule was that a court, under a declaratory judgment proceeding, did not have the right to determine whether a statute, ordinance, or regulation was abstractly valid or invalid. The executrix's complaint contained no allegation of a justiciable controversy; it merely alleged that the zoning ordinance classification in which the executrix owned a parcel of property was unconstitutional. Since the complaint's allegations did not set forth facts that gave rise to a disputed right-duty relation between the parties that placed the executrix in a position of peril or insecurity, it was deficient.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court held that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2917.11(A)(2) was unconstitutional. The trial court impermissibly injected a requirement of fighting words, taken from &sect; 2917.11(A)(3), into &sect; 2917.11(A)(2). Such judicial legislation was a denial of notice of a new charge and of due process. The two subsections defined two distinctly different crimes. One was directed exclusively to a choice of language and the second to language or conduct likely to provoke a violent response. Because defendant was not charged under &sect; 2917.11(A)(3), the juvenile court could not adjudicate defendant a delinquent based on a violation of &sect; 2917.11(A)(3), and &sect; 2917.11(A)(2), as construed by the juvenile court was unconstitutional.&nbsp;Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2917.11(A)(2) was overbroad and facially invalid when applied to the facts.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">Defendant argued that the trial court should have granted his motion for acquittal, but on review, the court disagreed. It found that the trial court did not err when it allowed testimony of a witness to be repeated to the jury after it commenced deliberation. The court found that a statement taken by a police officer was properly admitted because the statement was voluntary and defendant never filed a motion to suppress. Furthermore, the statement was exculpatory and did not prejudice defendant. The court rejected the claim that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2913.02 was unconstitutional in permitting evidence of a prior conviction of a theft offense to be taken into account. Finally, the court found that the indictment sufficiently followed the words of the statute and was not defective. While the court found that the trial court failed to comply with Ohio R. Crim. P. 5(B)(4), the court found that the error was harmless. Also, the court found that because defendant was represented by counsel from the time of his indictment, there was no merit to a claim that he was denied a right to counsel under the terms of the procedural rules, including Ohio R.

A bench conference ensued. The court affirmed defendant's conviction. Although the procedure of conducting the in camera inspection of the statement was not fully in accord with the criminal rules, the court found no prejudicial error that flowed from the trial court's denial of the use of the statement by defense counsel during cross-examination because the statement was completely consistent with the police officer's testimony on direct examination. Finally, the court declined to declare the law that provided the punishment for the sale of marijuana of a minimum sentence of 20 years and a maximum 40 years (with a minimum imprisonment requirement of a maximum of 10 years) unconstitutional. The court found that the question of the law's constitutionality was mooted by passage of Am. Sub. H.B. 300.</SPAN></P>

A physician testified that the nephew's intoxication at the time was heightened by amphetamines. Defendant claimed self-defense. A jury found defendant guilty of aggravated murder. The court reversed defendant's conviction because the trial court committed prejudicial error when it charged the jury that defendant had the burden of establishing self-defense by a preponderance of the evidence. The trial court also committed prejudicial error when it instructed the jury as to the circumstances when self-defense was legally justified. The net impact of an imminent danger requirement left a finding of guilty of involuntary manslaughter. Furthermore, the trial court erred when it failed to give defendant's requested instruction on circumstantial evidence. Circumstantial evidence was necessary to the issue of intent. Therefore, the failure to include a circumstantial evidence charge was prejudicial error. Finally, the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it did not declare a mistrial after one witness gave an unresponsive answer. Defendant was not prejudiced, and the jury was instructed to disregard the answer.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">On appeal, defendant alleged that his motion to limit imposition of sentence to life imprisonment should have been granted because the Ohio statute under which his death sentence was imposed was unconstitutional. He also alleged that his statement to police should have been suppressed because he did not make a knowing, intelligent, and voluntary waiver of his constitutional and Miranda rights. The court held that the Ohio and the U.S. Constitutions recognized, referred to, and provided for capital offenses. Furthermore, the U.S. Constitution permitted a person to be deprived of life if he was afforded due process of law. The court pointed out that the means, manner, or circumstances of inflicting the death penalty could constitute cruel and unusual punishment. However, the death penalty could not be found per se to constitute cruel and unusual punishment without violating the Constitution. The court also held that defendant's ability to understand and respond to questioning was not indicative of a person who was not able to comprehend and understand an explanation of rights. Therefore, the court concluded that defendant waived his rights knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">Appellant car dealer challenged a judgment of the Court of Common Pleas of Summit County (Ohio), which affirmed a decision of a city's board of zoning appeals denying a variance for the dealer to store and display motor vehicles outside a main building in conflict with Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio, Ordinance 142-1971. The dealer claimed that the denial violated its constitutional rights and that the ordinance was invalid, illegal, and void.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio, Ordinance 142-1971 was adopted to authorize a change of zoning for the dealer's property from multifamily and commercial to a designation as a 2-E automotive service district. It established conditions and declared an emergency. The zoning change was requested by the dealer's principal and property owner who made certain promises to the city's planning commission including that no vehicles would be stored or displayed outside. On review, the court found that it could take judicial notice of ordinances in its district, that Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio, Charter art. VIII, &sect; 2, allowed the board to hear and decide appeals, that the evidence showed that many neighbors objected to the adoption of Ordinance 142-1971, and that there was no denial of due process. The court ruled that the 2-E district was established first and existed moments before the dealer's property was declared part of such a district, that the dealer had urged the adoption of Ordinance 142-1971, and that the dealer was estopped from attacking the ordinance's validity because the dealer had aided in procuring the legislation and had benefited from its adoption.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">Defendant sought review of a decision by the common pleas court (Ohio), which convicted him of two counts of armed robbery, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2911.01, and imposed concurrent sentences of four to 25 years. Defendant claimed that his rights of compulsory process and due process were denied by the trial court's refusal to allow him to assert an alibi defense based on a failure of notice. He claimed it was totally impossible to comply.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">The State objected to defense counsel's references to alibi evidence based on defendant's failure to file a notice of alibi under Ohio R. Crim. P. 12.1. Defense counsel admitted the failure to file, claiming that he had been retained less than two weeks earlier and that he first learned of defendant's intent to assert an alibi on the trial date. He said the evidence would be testimony from defendant's common law wife that he was with her when the robbery was allegedly committed. Though the trial judge indicated that he could continue the case to allow notice to the State, neither party asked for a continuance, and the trial judge sustained the State's objection. The court found that because Ohio R. Crim. P. 12.1 only required prior notice of defendant's intention to present an alibi, defendant himself determined whether or not his alibi witness could testify by either complying or failing to comply with the notice requirement. It held that the notice of alibi statute did not violate defendant's right of compulsory process and that the exclusion of his alibi evidence was a discretionary decision that did not violate defendant's right to due process of law.</SPAN></P>

The driver chose none of the alternatives but sent the Bureau a letter disclaiming liability. Thereafter, the Bureau suspended the driver's operator's license and registration. The driver successfully appealed to the trial court. On appeal, the court found that the trial court erred in conducting an evidentiary hearing and in failing to grant the Bureau's motion to dismiss for failure to exhaust administrative remedies. The court reasoned that the driver failed to avail himself of the opportunity for a hearing before the Bureau; therefore, no record other than the complaint of the injured party against the driver, the Bureau's letter to the driver, and the notice of suspension existed for the trial court to review.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">Appellant State of Ohio challenged the judgment of the probate court (Ohio), which granted an allegedly excessive award to appellee property owners in an appropriation proceeding. Among the State's contentions was its assertion that the trial court improperly permitted expert appraisal witnesses and councilmen to testify as to the reasonable probability of a zoning change which would have been necessary for the owners' planned development.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">The State sought review of the trial court's judgment, contending that the appropriation award granted to the owners was excessive based on the actual market value of the property taken by the State for use in highway construction. The State contended that the court erred in admitting the testimony regarding the reasonable probability of a zoning change which affected the property appraisal value of the undeveloped property. The court on appeal affirmed the judgment of the trial court based on its determination that the State failed to show that it was prejudiced by the testimony pertaining to the probability of rezoning. The court found that the jury's award was reasonable and well within the range established with admissible expert testimony. The admission of the testimony was harmless error under the circumstances which allowed the trial court jury to consider that as an element in its determination of the property's fair market value and arriving at a value that the appellate court found was not unreasonable.</SPAN></P>

Defendant on appeal argued that the trial court erred in overruling her motion for dismissal, failing to discharge her, ordering her to stand trial, and judging her guilty. On appeal, the court affirmed the decision. The court held that the trial court continued the cases for trial on a date beyond the 45-day period specified in &sect; 2945.71. The court stated that the trial court was not required to hold a hearing and show affirmatively the necessity for a continuance based upon a specific reason.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">On appeal, the City argued that the trial court's judgment was against the manifest weight of the evidence. The court found that because it was an action to declare the zoning unconstitutional, the burden was on the property owners to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the residential zoning bore no real and substantial relation to the public health, safety, morals, or general welfare, or was clearly erroneous. The court held that the property owners' did not present sufficient evidence to overcome the presumption that the legislation bore a real and substantial relation to the public health, safety, morals, or welfare. The court found that the property owners' witnesses' testimony went solely to the issue of the economic feasibility of developing the land as residential property. The court reversed the trial court's judgment because proof of economic feasibility to develop residentially, without more, was not sufficient to establish constitutionality.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">Defendant was on trial for assaulting a deputy sheriff. He testified that the deputy's injury was the result of an accident. The prosecutor introduced evidence of an earlier incident in which defendant assaulted a different deputy sheriff. Upon review, the court found that evidence was admissible because defendant perjured himself on the stand and the prosecutor introduced contradictory evidence, which conformed to the requirements of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2945.59. Defendant failed to demonstrate that the prosecutor's remark during closing arguments was so offensive and prejudicial as to deny defendant a fair trial. Given the length of the comment, the nature and extent of the evidence, and the nature of the crime, the remarks of the prosecutor were not improper to the extent that they denied defendant a fair trial. The trial court did not err in overruling defendant's challenge of a juror for cause because he did not use his peremptory challenges to remove the juror to which an objection for cause had been raised.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">The applicant had been working for a licensed real estate broker for almost three years, in which time she had secured clients, obtained listings, and closed 15 sales transactions. She handled sales contracts and paperwork to obtain financing, and she attended closings. The Commission denied the applicant's request to take a real estate broker's license examination, contending that she did not fulfill the requirements of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4735.07(E) in that she lacked sufficient experience to the Commission's satisfaction. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded, finding that the Commission's action was arbitrary and an abuse of discretion. The court could find no rules or regulations promulgated by the Commission to define &quot;sufficient experience&quot; as used in &sect; 4735.07(E). By failing to define the term, the Commission could act capriciously and without any standards. The court noted that the legislature had enacted a new law substituting new standards in the section, but the validity of that law was not before the court.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">On review, defendant argued that the trial court erred in overruling her motion for dismissal upon the grounds that the ordinances in question were unconstitutional as violations of her rights to freedom of association, travel, privacy, equal protection under the laws, and due process of law. The court affirmed. The court found that the ordinance did not involve the rights of association, travel, or privacy, nor any other &quot;fundamental&quot; right guaranteed by the United States Constitution. The court determined that defendant failed to present the trial court with any evidence to support her contention that the ordinance was violative of the equal protection and due process clauses. The court concluded that, because defendant presented no evidence to rebut the presumption of legislative validity, the ordinance bore a real and substantial relation to public health, safety, or welfare, and was, therefore, valid.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">Appellant City of Brooklyn, Ohio sought review of a judgment from a Court of Common Pleas (Ohio), which was entered in favor of appellee landowner in his action appealing a decision from the Board of Zoning Appeals, which decision held that the Board was without jurisdiction to hear the landowner's appeal of a building inspector's denial of a permit to build a restaurant. The trial court ordered that the permit be issued to the landowner.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">The City challenged the trial court's jurisdiction to test the constitutionality of the City's zoning ordinances in the landowner's action, which was initiated by administrative appeal pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2506. The City also challenged the trial court's refusal to allow the City to introduce evidence in addition to that which was in the transcript of the proceedings before the Board. The court remanded the case, holding that the trial court had jurisdiction to consider the constitutionality of the City's zoning ordinances as applied to the landowner's property in his appeal from the Board pursuant to &sect; 2506, even though the Board correctly ruled that it did not have jurisdiction to hear constitutional issues. The court determined however, that although the City chose not to present evidence before the Board, it was wrongly prohibited from presenting evidence to the trial court. The court concluded that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2506.03 did not limit to the landowner the right to request such additional evidence and that instead, either party could have requested, or the trial court on its own motions could have required, that additional evidence be presented.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">The court remanded the case to the trial court with instructions to permit the parties to introduce additional evidence and to try the case as an original action based upon the transcript of proceedings before the Board and such additional evidence as the parties might have offered.</SPAN></P>

The court held that legislative acts could not be appealed pursuant to &sect; 2506.01 and that the action of the city council was a legislative act and not a quasi-judicial act. The court ruled that because the city council initiated the rezoning of the parcel and was not acting in an appellate administrative capacity, it was acting in a legislative capacity, and the neighbors could not challenge the city council's action under &sect; 2506.01.</SPAN></P>

The student contended on appeal that the trial court's judgment violated his rights under the Ohio Constitution, the United States Constitution, the statutes and common law of Ohio, and that the judgment was against the manifest weight of the evidence. The court found that the student's constitutional issues were insufficiently developed and went on to consider the issue of whether the regulation of hair styles of male students was reasonably necessary to a valid educational purpose within the meaning of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3313.20. The court found no causal connection between long hair and disruptive behavior or that persons with long hair were any less responsive to ordinary discipline. The court concluded that the school board's regulations were not essential, and that, absent health and safety factors which could suggest specific health rules and safety devices similar to that worn by women in dangerous activities, the regulation of the length of hair for boys and not for girls was not reasonably necessary to maintain discipline or to operate a public school.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">The corporation operated a speedway, at which it conducted concerts. The village enacted &sect; 709.05 in order to limit the number of spectators at such concerts. The corporation claimed that &sect; 709.05 was unconstitutional and invalid because it was unreasonable, discriminatory, capricious, and an abuse of legislative authority. The corporation sought to enjoin the enforcement of &sect; 709.05. The trial court denied the injunctive relief and specifically held that &sect; 709.05 was a valid ordinance. On appeal, the court affirmed, concluding that the village's determination that attendees at the speedway concerts would be limited to the actual seating capacity of the facility was reasonable. The village did not abuse its discretion in imposing the limitation nor chose a method of regulation that was unrelated to the health, safety, and welfare of the community. Rather, the village sought to legislate against a recurrence of the traffic and property damage difficulties experienced at other concerts. The limiting of the number of tickets sold to the number of grandstand seats available was a reasonable method of preventing such a recurrence.</SPAN></P>

The landowners denied that the parties had been unable to agree as to compensation, denied the necessity of the appropriation and specifically alleged many other reasons why the appropriation should be disallowed. The adjacent landowner sought to intervene. The trial court found for the landowners and denied the adjacent owner the right to intervene. On appeal, the court affirmed denying the right to intervene, but reversed judgment for the landowners holding that the trial court erred in finding that although the line was necessary, there was no need to put it in the route chosen. The court held that there was no evidence in the record to justify finding that the agencies had abused their discretion in putting the lines where they had, in failing to get approval from their respective boards, or to have the environmental report before them when making their decision.

The Commissioner filed a motion to dismiss the taxpayer's appeal to the Board on the ground that the taxpayer failed to comply with the mandatory requirements of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 5717.02 by not specifying the error or errors complained of. The Board held that the Commissioner's order was specific and exactly detailed his computations of the taxpayer's tax liability. On appeal of the Board's decision, the taxpayer argued that its property had been taken without due process, that the Commissioner's motion to dismiss should not have been granted, and that &sect; 5717.02 was unconstitutional. The court held that &sect; 5717.02 did not take the taxpayer's property without due process of law, was not vague or arbitrary, and did not violate the taxpayer's equal protection rights.</SPAN></P>

The taxpayer filed a petition for reassessment with the tax commissioner. The commissioner conducted a hearing thereon and affirmed the assessment. The taxpayer then appealed the commissioner's decision to the Board, which affirmed the commissioner's assessment in full. On appeal, the taxpayer argued that the Board erred in finding that the taxpayer was a vendor and in finding that the test checks on which the assessment was based were for a representative period. The court affirmed the Board's decision, holding that the Board's finding that the taxpayer was a vendor was neither unlawful nor unreasonable. In addition to acquiring a vendor's license and a liquor permit for the subject location, the taxpayer also signed several sales tax returns as the vendor. The taxpayer failed to produce credible evidence that he was not the vendor. Finally, there was ample evidence to support the Board's finding that the test check employed by the commissioner in determining the assessment was representative.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">The zoning board determined that the oil company was the owner of an abandoned service station. Based on the finding, they sought to demolish the building, pursuant to Columbus, Ohio, City Codes &sect; 3379.14(a). After the zoning board's decision was upheld on appeal, the oil company sought review. Specifically, the oil company contended that &sect; 3379.14(a) was unconstitutional. In reversing, the court found that the statute violated the oil company's due process rights. Under &sect; 3379.14(a), abandoned service stations constituted a nuisance per se. Once the zoning board determined that the service station in question was abandoned, there was no further determination as to whether or not the building was in fact a public nuisance. The owner of property, other than a service station, was entitled to have a hearing on the question of the existence of a public nuisance. It was unreasonable to require the razing of the building itself without a factual determination regarding its status as a public nuisance. Therefore, the court determined that &sect; 3379.14(a) was unreasonable, arbitrary, and unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">Defendant was tried with a codefendant. He was held in jail in lieu of bail and appeared at voir dire and opening statement in prison clothing. He appeared in civilian clothing during the trial. The trial court limited defense closing arguments to 20 minutes. When the codefendant had finished, nine minutes were left for defendant. The court held that there was no abuse of discretion because defendant's counsel was able to cover the issues in that time and did not request additional time. The court held that defendant's appearance in prison garb was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. During the time defendant was incarcerated waiting for trial, the speedy trial statute was amended. The old statute required that he be tried within two terms after his arrest. The amendment required that he be tried within 90 days.

On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that &sect; 2919.22(B) was not unconstitutionally vague and overbroad since a person of ordinary sensibilities and intelligence should have been capable of ascertaining its meaning and abiding by its proscriptions. The word &quot;corporal&quot; in the statute embraced the entire body, and not merely the trunk. Also, the judgment was not contrary to the manifest weight of the evidence because abundant probative and credible evidence supported the conclusion. Photographs of the child's injuries were properly admitted because they were relevant and probative. Because the photographs tended to diminish the severity of the injuries, the photographs inured to the benefit of defendant.</SPAN></P>

The appeal was the second appeal concerning the zoning issue.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">The zoning board initially approved the corporation's application for the construction of a mobile home park. The township filed an action against the corporation claiming a violation of its zoning regulations. Following appeal, the zoning board rescinded the permit. The corporation then filed an appeal in trial court, which found that the recision of the permit was unlawful and ordered the zoning board to re-issue the permit. The township again appealed. The sole issue on appeal related to the action taken by the zoning board in rescinding the permit, which it had originally issued. The validity of the original permit had been fully adjudicated and decided by the court. The court held that the original permit was unlawfully issued, contrary to the zoning resolutions, and the corporation was enjoined from using its land based on the permit granted. Because the original permit was held to be invalid, the action of the zoning board rescinding the permit was immaterial because the permit was invalid and nonusable in any event. Hence, any issues relating to the manner in which the permit was revoked were rendered moot by the court's previous decision.</SPAN></P>

The employees to whom he submitted the application testified before the grand jury as to defendant's identity. Because defendant argued no challenge to the validity of the grand jury's indictment, the court found that his arrest and prosecution were based on probable cause and that the application was admissible. The court rejected defendant's challenge to the constitutionality of the intimidation statute and held that defendant did not have to also be accused of bribing a public official to be guilty of intimidation, although the two crimes could be related. The court held that the speech contained in the letter was not protected by the First Amendment because the threats in the letter created a clear and present danger to the safety of the police chief to whom the letter was addressed.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">After the trial court entered judgment in favor of the driver, the administratrix argued that she was prejudiced because the surviving spouse and the decedent's children could not be present during the selection of the jury, but were excluded from the courtroom on motion for separation of witnesses. On appeal, the court found that there was no objection to the exclusion of the surviving spouse and the children. In addition, the court found that the administratrix failed to illustrate how she was prejudiced. The court also found that the administratrix was fully apprised of the driver's testimony. The court determined that by filing the lawsuit, the administratrix placed in issue the earnings of the decedent prior to his death. The court also determined that the administratrix waived any objection at trial relative to the selection of the jury. The court found that the cross-examination of the driver was in depth on all matters which were relevant and competent.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">The owner held title to three platted lots located in the city. The city's zoning ordinance imposed residential zoning on the property, restraining the owner from putting any commercial business on his property other than a gas station. The owner filed suit against the city and the state attorney general, alleging that the zoning ordinance was unconstitutional as it applied to his land. The trial court found for the owner, holding that the zoning ordinance exceeded the police powers of that city and was unconstitutional. The city and the state attorney general appealed and the court reversed. The court held that the trial court's conclusion of discrimination was contrary to law and against the weight of the evidence, and that the owner had purchased the property with actual or constructive knowledge of the zoning restrictions. The court found that the opinions of the expert witness were improperly received because the so-called expert was in no better position to give an opinion as to the matters therein than a layman. The court held that the owner produced too few facts to bolster his argument and that the presumption of the validity of the zoning ordinance was not overcome.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">Plaintiffs, a 245-member citizen committee, appealed a judgment of the Court of Common Pleas of Butler County (Ohio), which dismissed their amended complaint seeking injunctive and other relief in opposition to the proposed construction of an overhead high voltage circuit lines by defendants, two utility companies and their presidents and Public Utilities Commission of Ohio.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">The utilities proposed to jointly construct a 33-mile overhead double circuit transmission line initially energized at 345,000. The citizens, through a committee to preserve scenic and historic areas, claimed that the proposed transmission line would unreasonably and adversely affect public health and welfare by creating an electromagnetic field and a corona discharge which would endanger and adversely affect the citizens, their community, and their livestock. The citizens sought injunctive relief and an order requiring the Commission to perform its duty to protect the public. On appeal, the court affirmed in part the dismissal of the complaint as to the Commission in the absence of any authority for the Commission to guide or direct the utilities in such a project. The court reversed in part the dismissal of the complaint against the utilities and their presidents by finding that, given the serious allegations of the amended complaint as to whether the proposed power lines adversely affected the public's welfare under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4905.65(B)(3), the citizens were entitled to a day in court and an opportunity to marshal their evidence in support of their contentions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">A confidential informant told police that defendant, among others, was operating an auto theft ring.

Defendant appealed and the court affirmed. The court held that the fact that title to one of the vehicles was in defendant's wife was immaterial in the light of the fact that he himself had sold the car. The court found that it was not necessary that defendant knew the owner of the car, only that he had knowledge that it was stolen. The court found that the doctrine of ex post facto did not apply because the diminished knowledge requirement of Ohio Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Court of Common Pleas, Franklin County (Ohio) in which he was convicted of aggravated murder, punishable by death pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2929.04(A)(7). The defense based its case primarily on the claim that defendant was under the influence of drugs and alcohol, that he was paranoid, and that he was not guilty by reason of insanity. Defendant contended on appeal that his confession was coerced.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">On appeal, the court found no evidence to support defendant's argument. Defendant did not contradict the evidence that he had been fully advised of his rights. He voluntarily chose to waive his rights, and he voluntarily made a statement without the presence of his attorney. In fact, he chose not to follow his attorney's advice to remain silent. Furthermore, the police were careful to protect defendant's constitutional rights. Accordingly, the trial court did not err in overruling the motion to suppress. Defendant contended that the new law providing for the death penalty, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 2929.02 to 2929.04, was unconstitutional. Bound by United States Supreme Court decisions, the court upheld the constitutionality of the mandatory death penalty. Under the new law, the death penalty was to be imposed unless the trial court found evidence of one of the three mitigating circumstances set forth in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2929.04(B)(1), (2), or (3). This was not the case here, however. For example, the court found no evidence of any psychosis or mental deficiency, even though insufficient to constitute an insanity defense, of defendant at the time of the commission of the crime.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 4507.16(E).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">The operator was tried and convicted of a traffic violation, after which the registrar suspended his driver's license. The operator appealed the suspension to the trial court, which set aside the suspension after concluding that the suspension without a pre-suspension hearing was unconstitutional.

Code Ann. &sect; 4507.16(E). The operator had already received a hearing in his trial of the criminal charge, from which he had available an opportunity to appeal, and once he was convicted, the registrar had nothing further to consider in order to suspend the operator's license.

He was released on bond and did not appear for trial. On November 27, 1971, he was arrested in Brentwood, Ohio and charged with burglary. The Butler County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio) convicted him of the 1969 burglary, after a trial by jury, and sentenced him to serve a life term. Defendant filed an appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">Defendant appealed his conviction for the 1969 burglary. The court affirmed. There was sufficient evidence as to each of the elements of the crime of burglary to warrant a conviction. The evidence of the breaking and entering in the night season by two men, dressed as they were with a flashlight and gun, was a prima facie case of burglary. The additional evidence of the subsequent burglary added valuable evidence as to defendant's intent when he broke into the first house. The trial court properly admitted into evidence the commission of the second burglary, a similar act, pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2945.59. The evidence as to the second burglary was relevant because it helped establish the element of intent and defendant's method of operation. The evidence showed that defendant gained had entrance to both homes in the same manner and that he possessed a screwdriver in both instances. Defendant had not objected to the statute on constitutional grounds in the trial court and thus had waived any objection. In any event, the Ohio Supreme Court had found that the statute was not unconstitutional on due process grounds.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">A city ordinance required a homeowner to obtain a certificate of inspection from the director of buildings and inspections before entering into a contract of sale. Except when an inspection certificate was delivered to the buyer, the ordinance required a seller to warrant that the property complied with the building code. Paragraph (D) contained a presumption concerning a buyer's knowledge of deficiencies in the property and included two exceptions, and paragraph (F) stated that a failure to comply was a misdemeanor. The trial court ruled that the ordinance was unconstitutional and enjoined its enforcement. On appeal, the court held that the imposition of a criminal penalty on an owner who refused to consent to an inspection was unconstitutional under the Fourth Amendment, and that the ordinance's period of limitations was invalid because it conflicted with state law. The exceptions in paragraph (D) were severed from the ordinance as arbitrary and invalid. The court modified the judgment by removing the injunction against enforcement of the ordinance with respect to those provisions found valid and continued the injunction against the invalid provisions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">The corporation sought a permit to construct a mobile home park. The board of trustees argued that the proposed construction violated the township's zoning ordinances regarding lot sizes. The trial court found that the lot size set forth in the zoning resolution of the township was unconstitutional. The trial court ruled that the State had preempted the regulation of trailer lots, pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3733.02(A), and Public Health Council, Department of Health, State of Ohio, Regulation HE-27-08, which provided that mobile home lots shall have a land area of not less than 3,600 square feet. The court disagreed, reversed the trial court's judgment, and granted the board of trustees an injunction. The court stated that the township had broad authority under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 519.02, to develop a comprehensive plan of zoning. And, the State had not preempted the field concerning the original location of trailer parks so as to preclude township trustees, who had properly enacted zoning regulations, from requiring larger lot sizes than the minimums required by public health regulations.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">Appellant owner sought review after the Court of Common Pleas of Geauga County (Ohio) entered a judgment permanently restraining the owner from conducting a junk yard and/or automobile wrecking yard on its premises. Appellee township had initiated the action. The owner filed an appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c13">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">The owner had secured a zoning permit in 1972. Thereafter, the township revised the zoning resolutions and added certain amendments. The amendments defined &quot;junkyard&quot; and &quot;automotive graveyard,&quot; which were accordingly prohibited. The trial court granted the township's petition for a permanent injunction. The court affirmed. The section of the zoning ordinance on which the owner had relied did not apply. The applicable section was Township of Newbury, Ohio, Zoning Res. &sect; 403.6, which governed permitted uses in a business district. The permitted uses in a business district did not include a junkyard or automobile graveyard. The owner had not raised the constitutionality of the resolution in its answer to the complaint. The defense of unconstitutionality of a statute was an affirmative defense, which had to be pled pursuant to Ohio R. Civ. P. 8(C). Defendant had waived the defense. The fact that the prior owner had operated in about the same manner as the owner was unavailing. A use permitted to a former operator, improperly conducted, did not benefit the owner. Zoning was first passed in Newbury Township in 1948; to be a non-conforming use, the use had to date back to 1948.</SPAN></P>
