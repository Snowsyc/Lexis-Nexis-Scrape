Appellant failed various field sobriety tests and agreed to a blood alcohol test. His blood alcohol content (BAC) was above the legal limit.

Appellant sought review, claiming the prosecution should have presented relation-back testimony, this was the first time officer had effectuated a DUI arrest by himself, and the trial court improperly limited defense counsel's cross-examination of officer regarding the standing leg test. The court affirmed because the prosecution was not required to present expert relation-back testimony, officer's inexperience did not warrant reversal, and the trial court's refusal to permit officer from demonstrating the standing leg test did not require a new trial since evidence of appellant's guilt was overwhelming.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, a convicted felon, sought review of a decision from the Court of Common Pleas of Huntingdon County (Pennsylvania), dismissing his PCRA petition for untimeliness. On appeal, appellant contended that the trial judge failed to afford him an opportunity to file objections in violation of an earlier directive of this court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of first-degree murder, robbery, burglary, and escape. A jury imposed the death penalty. Before the court was appellant's second PCRA petition, which challenged the conviction and sentence. The first PCRA petition resulted in appellant being sentenced to life imprisonment. The petition was dismissed without the requisite 10-day notice of intent to dismiss given to appellant. Appellant sought review and this court remanded. The trial court thereafter issued a notice of intent to dismiss and allowed appellant 45 days to file objections. Following a lapse of the 45 days, the petition was dismissed. Appellant sought review in this court, contending that the trial judge failed to afford him an opportunity to file objections in violation of this court's earlier directive. The court held that appellant's PCRA petition was untimely pursuant to 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 9545 because it was not filed within one year of the date his judgment of conviction became final. Thus, the trial court lacked jurisdiction to consider the petition's merits. The court further ruled that none of the exceptions that would make the timeliness rule inapplicable applied.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the judgment of the Court of Common Pleas of the Montgomery County (Pennsylvania), convicting defendant of possession of a controlled substance, intent to deliver, and possession of marijuana, resulting from a police drug interdiction investigation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's drug conviction stemmed from a drug interdiction investigation performed at a bus terminal. The trial court denied defendant's motion to suppress the evidence seized by the police, as well as the statements defendant made to the officers. The appellate court held that defendant's initial contact with the police was a mere encounter. The court found that defendant voluntarily abandoned the bag containing the cocaine because the contact involved no police coercion. Additionally, defendant voluntarily revealed her intentions to one of the officers, and after defendant told him that she was delivering drugs, she was properly Mirandized. Finally, the statements made by defendant prior to being given her Miranda warnings were correctly allowed as evidence because defendant was not in custody when the statements were made.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged a judgment of the Court of Common Pleas of Delaware County (Pennsylvania) after a jury found him guilty of murder and assault but mentally ill, arguing that a prosecution expert's testimony violated the psychiatrist-patient privilege and the attorney-client privilege. Appellant also challenged the validity of the insanity defense statutes, 18 Pa. Con. Stat. &sect;&sect; 314, 315.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, who resided on an estate in which he housed wrestlers who were members of his team, challenged a judgment finding him mentally ill, but guilty of murder and simple assault. Witnesses testified that appellant's behavior changed after his mother died and that he exhibited paranoid fear that he was being spied on and that his life was in danger. Appellant subsequently shot and killed a wrestling coach to whom he had exhibited animosity. Appellant challenged the constitutionality of the state's insanity test, arguing that the burden was on the prosecution to prove that he was not insane and knew right from wrong. Appellant also argued that the trial court violated both the psychiatrist-patient and attorney-client privileges by allowing the testimony of an expert with a previous connection to appellant. Holding that the allocation of the burden of proof in an insanity defense had been clearly defined and that challenges to its constitutionality had previously been rejected, the court affirmed the judgment because application of the privileges required confidential communications or relationships that were protectable.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Concluding there was no merit to appellant's claims that the state's statutory scheme for determining mental illness was unconstitutional, the court affirmed the judgment because there was no confidential relationship between appellant and the challenged expert psychiatrist, and because the record did not support the conclusion that the attorney-client privilege was violated in any way.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Contending that appellee Department of Public Welfare lacked standing to sue for support and an assignment of a right of a child to support was unconstitutional, appellant noncustodial parent challenged an order of the Court of Common Pleas of York County (Pennsylvania), which retroactively awarded child support from the time appellee instituted paternity suit against appellant. Appellant also raised procedural due process challenges.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant noncustodial parent challenged an order that retroactively awarded child support from the time appellee welfare department instituted paternity suit, although appellant acknowledged paternity after nearly ten years of litigation. Appellant argued appellee lacked standing because child support rights could not be assigned to a third party, including a governmental agency. Appellant also argued portions of his support payment could be used for the support of siblings not related to him. Appellant contended procedural due process was violated in the manner the child support matter was prosecuted in violation of the separation of powers and other constitutional safeguards. Because substantial defects in appellant's brief precluded effective appellate review of his due process violation claims, the appellate court deemed those claims waived. The court also dismissed appellant's other claims because appellee's standing to enforce an unwed recipient's right to receive child support payments derived from state statute, and the requirement that support income be used for the benefit of the child did not preclude its use for common expenses.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Holding substantial defects in appellant's brief precluded effective appellate review of his procedural due process claims, the court dismissed appellant's other challenges because appellee possessed statutory authority to enforce appellant's support obligation, and the lower court properly refused to deviate from the support guidelines based upon the mother's status as a welfare recipient.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Common Pleas of Monroe County (Pennsylvania), the court granted the prosecution's petition for reargument to determine whether Pa. Const. art. I, &sect; 8, prohibited the random stopping of a Greyhound bus to permit police officers to conduct a drug interdiction investigation, in the absence of reasonable suspicion or probable cause to believe that an individual on the bus was transporting narcotics.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant convicted on drug charges contended on reargument that the state constitution prohibited the random stopping of a Greyhound bus at a toll plaza on a rural interstate to permit police to conduct a drug interdiction investigation in the absence of reasonable suspicion or probable cause to believe that an individual on the bus was transporting narcotics. With the permission of the bus driver, police boarded the bus and searched two bags. Appellant acknowledged the first was his, and it contained a brand-new pair of sneakers; the second bag, to which no one acknowledged ownership, contained a shoe box full of drugs that had held the identical size as appellant's pair of sneakers. Appellant contended the evidence should have been suppressed because the search and seizure was illegal. The prosecution contended the seriousness of the criminal activity under investigation justified the intrusion. The court disagreed and reversed the conviction, holding that the state constitutional requirement of a reasonable articulable suspicion to support an investigative seizure protected appellant's right to be free of arbitrary police intrusions on his privacy and free movement.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the conviction after determining appellant was unconstitutionally seized, holding that clear precedent defined the appropriate standards to be used when considering whether an individual had been seized, and the long-standing definition of what constituted a seizure could not be ignored, particularly when viewed in tandem with recognition of the privacy rights embodied in Pa. Const. art. I, &sect; 8.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant brought suit against appellee doctor alleging appellee doctor breached a contract guaranteeing a cure. The trial court dismissed appellant's complaint finding that the Health Care Services Malpractice Act (HCSMA), 40 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 606, barred recovery, because there was no written contract. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment. According to the superior court, section 606 required a writing in order to hold a health care provider liable as a warrantor or guarantor of a cure. The superior court held that appellant did not have a written contract and could not pursue its action. The superior court rejected the argument that section 606 was unconstitutional. The superior court held that section 606 was a limited and particularized statute of frauds addressing a certain type of contractual scenario and there was nothing unconstitutional about the provision. The superior court also rejected the argument that appellee doctor waived its affirmative defense by failing to allege it. The superior court held that was proffered by a party at a later stage of the proceedings and was considered by the court: the court's consideration was treated as approving an amendment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the judgment of the Court of Common Pleas of Delaware County (Pennsylvania), which was entered following defendant's jury conviction for aggravated assault by vehicle while driving under the influence, driving under the influence, and recklessly endangering another person.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant struck another vehicle while driving under the influence of alcohol and speeding during a severe rainstorm. The other driver and his passenger were severely injured, and defendant was subsequently convicted of aggravated assault by vehicle while driving under the influence, driving under the influence, and recklessly endangering another person. Defendant contended that there was insufficient evidence to convict him of aggravated assault because his bad judgment in inclement weather should be severable from evidence regarding his intoxication. The appellate court affirmed his conviction for driving under the influence and aggravated assault holding that the jury properly concluded that his driving under the influence started an unbroken chain of causation and directly precipitated the collision. Defendant's conviction for reckless endangerment was reversed, and the court held that the trial court committed reversible error by failing to instruct the jury on the issue of negligence and the level of negligence necessary for the behavior to constitute reckless endangerment. The action was remanded for a new trial on reckless endangerment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's convictions for driving under the influence and aggravated assault by vehicle while driving under the influence were affirmed. However, defendant's conviction for recklessly endangering another person was reversed where the appellate court found that the trial court failed to instruct the jury on the difference between reckless behavior and ordinary negligence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of the judgment of the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County, Criminal Division (Pennsylvania) convicting him of third-degree murder.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of his third-degree murder conviction arguing that the trial court erred in refusing to charge the jury with his requested jury instruction, erred in allowing the coroner to conduct an inquest, and abused its discretion in sentencing him above the guideline range without giving sufficient reasons. The appellate court appellant's conviction. The trial court accurately stated the law of justification to the jury as to the state's burden of proving appellant's reasonable belief that he was in imminent danger of death or great bodily harm and had to kill in order to save himself. It was not a constitutional violation to allow the coroner to conduct an inquest in lieu of a preliminary hearing. Appellant was given a fair, complete, and impartial trial on the merits before judgment was entered against him. Appellant's challenges to his sentence were to the discretionary aspects of the sentence and not the legality of the sentence. Appellant failed to show that there was a substantial question that the sentence was inappropriate. The trial court did not abuse its discretion by giving appellant the maximum sentence without providing sufficient reasons.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court affirmed the trial court's judgment. The appellate court held that the trial court's charge to the jury clearly, accurately, and adequately reflected the law of justification and was sufficient to guide the jury through its deliberations and further held that the trial court did not err in allowing the coroner to conduct an inquest in lieu of a preliminary hearing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to the Juvenile Act, 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 6301-6365, defendant's case went directly to criminal court, but defendant had the option of requesting decertification of his case to the juvenile system because he was seventeen. Defendant challenged the constitutionality of the act. The court upheld the denial of decertification and constitutionality of the act. The act's provisions were rationally related to its purpose of protecting the community, imposing accountability on young offenders and developing responsible members of society. The act's presumption of adult treatment for certain offenses did not create an irrebuttable presumption because a defendant was provided a hearing to rebut the adult treatment. Defendant was not denied due process by having the burden placed on him for decertification because the decision to transfer had no bearing on either the procedural or substantive aspects of the case. Juveniles were not a protected class and thus were not deprived of fundamental rights under the act. In light of defendant's violent history, the court found denial of decertification proper.</SPAN></P>

Decertification was properly denied based on defendant's violent history and previous futile encounters with the juvenile system.</SPAN></P>

After a hearing, appellant was found guilty and sentenced to six months' incarceration. The court vacated the judgment of sentence and relinquished jurisdiction because appellant did not have sufficient notice that a statement lacking any measure of immediacy, made outside the presence of the person to whom it was directed, and which did not cause the protected person to feel threatened constituted a violation of the trial court's order.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged the denial of his motion to suppress evidence by the Court of Common Pleas of Delaware County (Pennsylvania), which convicted him of driving under the influence and driving with a blood alcohol count of .10 percent or greater. Defendant contended that the arresting officer did not follow Del. Code Ann. tit.11, &sect; 1933 in extraditing him, and evidence obtained from the arrest should have been suppressed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A Pennsylvania state trooper observed defendant driving in an unsafe manner. By the time he &quot;pulled over&quot; defendant, they had crossed the state line into Delaware. Defendant showed signs of intoxication and failed two field sobriety tests. Defendant was arrested for driving while intoxicated and taken to a hospital for blood alcohol tests, which confirmed that his blood alcohol count was above the legal limit. Defendant was then taken before a district justice in Pennsylvania, who ruled that sufficient probable cause existed to justify the arrest. Defendant made a pretrial motion to suppress evidence obtained in what he alleged was an illegal arrest, but that motion was denied. On appeal defendant contended that his arrest was illegal because the state trooper had not followed the extradition procedure required by Del. Code Ann. tit. 11, &sect; 1933. The court agreed that the state trooper violated the extradition statute, but held that this violation did not touch upon defendant's fundamental constitutional rights. The court found that the exclusionary provisions of Pa. R. Crim. P. 323 did not apply in this case, and that the trial court correctly denied defendant's motion to suppress.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction of driving under the influence and driving with a blood alcohol count of .10 percent or greater, holding that the trial court committed no error in denying his pre-trial motion to suppress evidence. The court held that the arresting officer's violation of an extradition rule did not compromise defendant's constitutional rights and thus did not warrant automatic application of the exclusionary rule.</SPAN></P>

However, the court held that 61 P.S. &sect; 331.27a allowed a parole officer to search a parolee that was lawfully taken into custody. As defendant had been properly taken into custody prior to the search, the court held that the trial court properly denied defendant's motion to suppress.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction for possession with intent to deliver cocaine, as a parole officer had the legal authority to search appellant after taking him into custody. Thus, the trial court properly denied defendant's motion to suppress evidence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was sentenced to 6-23 months imprisonment in addition to a fine and other costs, after he entered an open plea to driving under the influence, receiving stolen property, fleeing and eluding the police, and various summary offenses. Appellant challenged the order, which granted the Commonwealth's motion to amend sentence, filed three and a half months after imposition of sentence, and modified the sentence to include restitution, on the basis that the motion was untimely and the court was without jurisdiction to amend his sentence. The court vacated the order. The failure to file a motion to reconsider sentence within 10 days after the imposition of sentence waived any complaint concerning the sentence that did not involve the lawfulness of the sentence itself under Pa. R. Crim. P. 1410(a). Though the trial court could sua sponte modify or rescind a prior order pursuant to 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. &sect;5505, the imposition of restitution for property damage was not mandatory under 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. &sect; 1106(a), (c)(1)(i). As such, appellant's sentence was not illegal and the commonwealth was required to file a timely post-sentence motion to challenge the sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court vacated the order that modified appellant's sentence to include restitution because the sentencing court was without jurisdiction to entertain the commonwealth's untimely motion to amend the sentence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged an order from the Court of Common Pleas of Dauphin County (Pennsylvania), that imposed a mandatory sentence for third degree murder pursuant to 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9714(a)(2) because the offense was his third conviction for a crime of violence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a jury trial, appellant was convicted of third degree murder and given a mandatory sentence pursuant to 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9714(a)(2) because the offense was his third conviction for a crime of violence. On appeal, the court vacated the judgment of sentence, holding that the trial court erred in concluding that appellant's prior convictions were exempt from the statutory requirement that only those prior convictions occurring within seven years of the current offense be included for mandatory sentencing. The court determined that under well-settled principles of statutory construction, the seven-year requirement applied to sentences imposed under both 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9714(a)1 and (2). Thus, the court remanded the cause to the trial court for a determination of whether appellant had been convicted of a prior crime of violence with seven years of the current offense. The court also concluded that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that the prosecutor proffered legitimate race neutral reasons for striking jurors.</SPAN></P>

The cause was remanded to determine if appellant had been convicted of prior violent crimes within seven years of the current offense.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged the sentence entered by the Court of Common Pleas of Fayette County (Pennsylvania) for third degree murder of his girlfriend's infant. Defendant argued that the evidence was insufficient and that the definition used for caregiver was unconstitutionally vague. Defendant also alleged prosecutorial misconduct, that jurors were stricken based on race, and that after-discovered evidence required a new trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The infant of defendant's girlfriend died from dehydration, malnutrition and hypothermia after being left in defendant's care. On appeal from his conviction for third degree murder, the court held that a person placed in control and supervision of a child has a duty to protect the child. Evidence that defendant was the only adult who could care for the infant and actively deceived the mother about its condition supported the jury's verdict. Defendant's intent to commit the crime charged was evidenced by his disregard of the fact that the infant consumed no food or fluids for 24-48 hours. The instruction on the definition of caregiver was based on statutory language and not constitutionally vague. The trial court adequately addressed any alleged instance of prosecutorial misconduct. No potential juror was stricken based on race since both black and white jurors were stricken for sleeping during voir dire. After-discovered evidence in the form of alibi testimony was not credible because defendant knew about the proposed witnesses prior to trial and had previously filed a notice of alibi based on entirely different facts. Accordingly, the judgment of sentence was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

Cons. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9791-9799.6 (the Act). Defendant argued that the Act was unconstitutional because it placed the burden of persuasion on a defendant to rebut the presumption that he was a sexually violent predator under the Act.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was found to be a &quot;sexually violent predator&quot; under the Registration of Sexual Offender's Act (Act), 42 Pa.

A modified 18 months to life sentence was then imposed, and defendant's second post-sentence motion was denied. On review, defendant argued that the Act was unconstitutional because &sect; 9794(b) placed the burden of persuasion on a defendant to rebut the presumption that he was a &quot;sexually violent predator.&quot; The court disagreed, but noted that it was bound by a previous en banc decision which determined that &sect; 9794(b) of the Act was unconstitutional. However, the court vehemently disagreed with the previous majority decision because it ignored the presumption of a statute's constitutionality. The court noted that &sect; 9794(b) was no different than placing the burden of mitigation in sentencing on a defendant and reasoned that &sect; 9794(b) did not violate due process of law. Nonetheless, in accordance with established precedent, the case was remanded for resentencing absent application of the provisions of the Act.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At the home of relatives, appellant was discovered in a closet with his head near the exposed genitals of a minor. Appellant was convicted and sentenced for involuntary deviate sexual intercourse, indecent assault, corruption of minors, and endangering the welfare of children. The trial court conducted procedures under the Registration of Sexual Offenders Act, 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 9791-9799.6 (the Act), and held that appellant did not rebut the presumption of the Act and was a &quot;sexually violent predator.&quot; Appellant sought review. The court reversed the trial court's judgment in part, and vacated and remanded in part. The court concluded that the commonwealth had failed in its burden of proving that appellant was supervising the children at the time of the assault, and accordingly reversed the conviction for endangering the welfare of children. The court found that the provisions of the Act which required an offender to rebut a presumption if he had been convicted of certain enumerated crimes violated the right to due process under U.S. Const. amend.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant husband and wife challenged the constitutionality of the judgment from the Court of Common Pleas of Montgomery County, Civil Division (Pennsylvania), that awarded to appellee psychologist his fees for services rendered to appellant wife, and found that appellant husband, despite his incarceration, was jointly responsible for the outstanding professional bill under the law of necessaries expressed in 23 Pa.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant husband and wife sought review of the judgment entered against them for psychological services rendered by appellee psychologist to appellant wife. The trial court determined that appellant husband, despite his incarceration, was jointly responsible for the outstanding professional bill under the law of necessaries expressed in 23 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. &sect; 4102. On review, appellants argued that &sect; 4102 violated U.S. Const. amend. XIV because appellant husband did not consent nor have any knowledge of the services rendered to appellant wife, and he was not responsible for the debt given that appellants were separated when appellant wife incurred the debt. The appellate court found that appellant husband did not advance any arguments nor cite any authority to support a showing as to how &sect; 4102 failed to rationally relate to a legitimate state objective, and consequently, found that the issue had been waived. The appellate court affirmed the trial court's judgment because there was no evidence that appellant wife specifically agreed to be solely liable on the debt and the mere fact of appellants' separation did not suspend the duty of spousal support under &sect; 4102.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court affirmed the judgment in favor of appellee psychologist because the fact that appellant husband and wife were separated when a debt to appellee was incurred did not suspend the duty of spousal support in the statutory law of necessaries, there was no evidence that appellant wife agreed to be solely liable on the debt, and as appellants failed to show a violation of the Due Process Clause, the issue was waived.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant parents were convicted of involuntary manslaughter and endangering the welfare of a child. The trial court sentenced appellants to two and a half years to five years of incarceration. Appellants challenged their convictions and sentences, and the court affirmed. The court held that appellants were not denied effective assistance of counsel. The court also held that appellants had a duty to their minor child to override her own religious beliefs and obtain medical treatment for her when her illness became life threatening. There was no conflicted between the Child Protective Services Act, 23 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 6303 (b)(3), and the involuntary manslaughter statute,&nbsp;18 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 2504. An act that did not qualify as child abuse could still have been done in a manner that caused death and qualified as involuntary manslaughter. The court further held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it refused to instruct the jury on appellants' defense of mistake of fact. Finally, the court held that the sentence ordered was well justified, and was not an abuse of discretion even though it was above the range in the sentencing guidelines.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of his conviction of possession, possession with intent to deliver a controlled substance, and possession of drug paraphernalia from the Court of Common Pleas of Perry County (Pennsylvania). Appellant challenged his conviction based on whether Pa. Const. art. I, &sect; 8 proscribed the issuance of anticipatory search warrants.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A trooper, pursuant to a warrant, found information regarding an individual's drug trafficking activity. The individual chose to cooperate in order to receive more lenient treatment at sentencing, and explained the meaning of his drug trafficking records, which included appellant's name. Based on the information he possessed, the trooper set up a reverse sting operation and obtained an anticipatory search warrant, defined as a warrant based upon an affidavit showing probable cause that at some future time certain evidence of crime would be located at a specified place. Appellant fell for the sting operation, and was arrested. He moved for a motion to suppress based on the alleged unconstitutionality of the anticipatory search warrant. The trial court denied the motion to suppress, and appellant was convicted of possession, possession with intent to deliver a controlled substance, and possession of drug paraphernalia. Appellant argued the constitutionality of the anticipatory search warrant on appeal. The court affirmed concluding that anticipatory warrants passed constitutional muster under Pa. Const. art. I, &sect; 8, so long as they were not executed prematurely.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Having found no merit to either of appellant's issues, the court affirmed because no prejudicial error in the proceedings before the sentencing court took place, the mandatory minimum provision after conviction and before sentencing was properly invoked, and the court provided appellant with an opportunity to respond.</SPAN></P>

The petition was entered on the docket on the same date. The PCRA court dismissed the petition because it was not filed within one year of the effective date of the amendments to the act. Appellant sought reversal. The commonwealth argued that the PCRA court correctly dismissed appellant's petition because appellant had over three years to seek collateral relief. The court reversed the PCRA court's dismissal of appellant's petition and held that the prisoner mailbox rule applied to petitions filed pursuant to the PCRA, and that the trial court erred in dismissing appellant's petition without consideration of the prisoner mailbox rule.</SPAN></P>

He challenged his conviction, alleging that &sect; 4117 was unconstitutional.

Appellant also argued that the evidence was insufficient to support the verdict. The court affirmed the conviction and held that the required neutrality that applied to officials performing judicial or quasi-judicial functions was not applicable to prosecutors. The court found that the evidence was sufficient to sustain the conviction. Appellant admitted making false statements to the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation that he could have only made to induce it to grant him a registration sticker for his vehicle. The court found that it strained reason to suggest any purpose for the submission of false insurance information other than to affect the department's determination in approving or disapproving a motor vehicle insurance transaction.</SPAN></P>

Appellant bottle club owner claimed that he should not have been held accountable for the actions of the dancers, who were not his employees but were independent contractors. On appeal, the court found that because the conduct complained of would be improper whether performed in a licensed establishment, at a charitable function or a &quot;bottle club&quot; regulated by &sect; 7329(a), as applied the statute was not violative of equal protection. Further finding that appellant dancers were employees of appellant bottle club owner because he clearly controlled some of their activities in the club, the court affirmed appellants' convictions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court, finding that because the conduct complained of would be improper wherever it was performed, its prohibition was not violative of equal protection. The court also found that the dancers at the bottle club were employees because the owner received compensation for certain of the dancers' activities and for patrons' access to the establishment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a judgment of sentence of the Court of Common Pleas of Erie County, Criminal Division (Pennsylvania), following defendant's conviction for sexual abuse of children, 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. &sect; 6312.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was noticed covertly videotaping children in a changing area of a state park. Defendant was approached by a park ranger and questioned as to his activities, and defendant made inculpatory statements and admitted that nude persons could be seen on his videotape. Defendant was convicted of sexual abuse of children for videotaping nude children for the purpose of sexual stimulation or gratification. Defendant appealed alleging that the statute was unconstitutionally vague, that the physical evidence and his inculpatory statements should have been suppressed, and that his sentencing was improper. On review, the court affirmed. The court noted that statutes were presumed to be constitutional. The court found that a person of common intelligence would grasp that covertly videotaping infant, adolescent and pubescent nude girls was prohibited by 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann &sect; 6312, if the videotapes were made for purposes of sexual gratification or stimulation of the videotaper. The court further held that defendant made his inculpatory statements pursuant to a lawful investigatory stop. Finally, the court found that defendant waived his objections to alleged sentencing errors.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of sentence because the court found that defendant, as a person of common intelligence, would understand that the covert taping of nude children for the purposes of the sexual gratification or stimulation of his person was prohibited by the statute. Additionally, the court found that the statements and evidence provided by defendant were made pursuant to a brief and lawful investigatory stop.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted and sentenced to 9 to 23 months after the trial court denied his motion to suppress drugs found during a search by the police. The trial court rejected defendant's Post Conviction Relief Act (P.C.R.A.) petition for being untimely, but the trial court granted defendant leave to appeal nunc pro tunc. Defendant appealed the judgment of sentence and the commonwealth filed a counter appeal challenging the order granting defendant nunc pro tunc appellate rights. The court affirmed the trial court's order granting defendant the right to appeal nunc pro tunc. The court held that even though the P.C.R.A. was intended to be the sole means for seeking to obtain collateral relief after final judgment and direct appeal, there was authority in case law to support granting defendant the right to seek a delinquent appeal right outside of the framework of the P.C.R.A. The court also affirmed the judgment of sentence because the trial court did not err in denying the illegal search suppression order. The court found that defendant's refusal to remove his hand from his pocket gave the officer a reasonable suspicion that he might be armed and justified the pat down search.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>

The court concluded that a statute would not be struck down for unconstitutionality unless it clearly and plainly violated the U.S. Constitution and the Pennsylvania Constitution. The court concluded that &sect; 4943 was not unconstitutional because it provided defendant fair notice that the contemplated conduct was forbidden by the statute.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment from the Court of Common Pleas of Bucks County, Criminal Division (Pennsylvania). The trial court convicted defendant of driving under the influence of alcohol in violation of 75 Pa. Cons. Stat.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After an officer observed defendant driving erratically, defendant was charged with driving under the influence of alcohol and driving while his blood alcohol content (BAC) was above the statutory limit. The trial court denied defendant's motion to suppress the evidence, and defendant was convicted as charged. The court affirmed. The trial court did not err in denying defendant's motion to suppress evidence of his BAC. The officer had sufficient justification for making an investigatory traffic stop based on how defendant was driving, and the officer had probable cause to arrest defendant when defendant failed four sobriety tests. The trial court did not err in admitting evidence of defendant's BAC to support his conviction under 75 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. &sect; 3731(a)(4). The commonwealth was not required to present expert relation-back testimony in support of this charge because defendant's BAC was significantly higher than the statutory limit, and the time between driving and administering the blood test was relatively short. Evidence of defendant's erratic driving and failed sobriety tests was sufficient to support his conviction under 75 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. &sect; 3731(a)(1).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant corporation and individual challenged a trial court order, which dismissed their petition to strike or open a confession of judgment in favor of appellee consultant.

Appellants' counsel was mailed a copy of the judgment and notice that the judgment was entered on November 5, 1996, pursuant to Pa. R. Civ. P. 236.

In March 1997, appellants filed a petition to strike the confessed judgment. In May 1997, appellee filed a notice of judgment and execution. In June 1997, appellants filed a second petition. On appeal, the court held that the trial court erred in finding that judgment notice issued under Pa. R. Civ. P. 236, and was sufficient to run the timeliness clock. The court found that Pa. R. Civ.

However, the police informed defendant that they had received a tip that he was selling stolen parts and that they were there to check vehicle information.

Ann. &sect; 6803(c) as a pretext to gather evidence of criminal activity, that the search was not a routine inspection, and that the Fourth Amendment warrant requirements applied.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of a judgment of the Court of Common Pleas of Lancaster County (Pennsylvania) that convicted appellant of six counts of armed robbery and two counts of criminal conspiracy.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was adjudicated as an adult on six counts of armed robbery and two counts of criminal conspiracy. Appellant filed a motion to transfer the case to the juvenile court and filed a writ of habeas corpus that the 1995 amendments to the Juvenile Act (the Act), 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. &sect; 6301 et seq., was unconstitutional. On appeal, the court affirmed the lower court and held that the Act was not unconstitutionally vague because it provided adequate notice of the meaning of &quot;a public interest&quot; at and sufficient guidance to the court presented with the question of transfer. The court also held that due process was not violated by transferring the burden to the juvenile when attempting to change venue from criminal court to juvenile court. The court reasoned that the shifting of the burden did not violate the maxim that the commonwealth had met its burden of proving each element of the crimes charged beyond a reasonable doubt and was thus constitutional.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from the order of the Court of Common Pleas of Armstrong County, Criminal Division (Pennsylvania), which denied without prejudice defendant's motion for extraordinary relief that challenged the constitutionality of the sexually violent predator provisions of Pennsylvania's Megan's Law, 42 Pa.C.S. &sect; 9791 et seq.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with eight counts of involuntary deviate sexual intercourse committed on three boys under the age of 11, and pleaded guilty to four of the counts. Defendant challenged Pennsylvania's Megan's Law, 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 9791 et seq., that required him to register as a sex offender, and automatically presumed that he was a sexually violent predator. A hearing was scheduled to allow defendant to rebut the statutory presumption. The trial court denied defendant's a motion for extraordinary relief that challenged Megan's Law and requested a bar to a second prosecution for the same offense. Defendant's application to enforce automatic stay was granted before the contested hearing took place. On appeal, the court affirmed the order denying extraordinary relief, and held that the adjudicatory hearing to overcome the presumption was not an unconstitutional second trial in violation of the double jeopardy clause, that there was no evidentiary hearing requirement for presentencing motions for extraordinary relief, and there was no requirement to prove that defendant was a sexually violent predator in order to prove involuntary deviate sexual intercourse with a minor.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the order denying defendant's written motion for extraordinary relief without a hearing because no hearing was required under the rules of criminal procedure. There was a presumption under Pennsylvania's Megan's Law that appellant was a sexually violent predator because the victim of the offense was a minor, and the hearing to dispute that presumption was not a second trial in violation of the double jeopardy clause.</SPAN></P>

His petition under the Post-Conviction Relief Act (PCRA), 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 9541 et seq., was denied. On appeal, the court determined that appellant's claim of after-discovered evidence that co-defendant killed the victim for personal reasons unrelated to the robbery was cognizable under the PCRA. However, because appellant waited six years to file his petition, the case was remanded to determine whether commonwealth would be prejudiced if it retried appellant. On remand, the PCRA court determined that commonwealth would be prejudiced because of the unavailability of the drug dealer and other witnesses. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that commonwealth, without its key eyewitness, would be hampered in its ability to rebut appellant's theory, which was untested at the original trial. The court concluded that the PCRA was not designed to afford appellant an opportunity to present a new defense unanswerable due to the passage of time.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged his conviction by the Court of Common Pleas of Erie County (Pennsylvania), for possession of marijuana.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of possession of marijuana and manufacture of a controlled substance, and took an appeal nunc pro tunc. The main issue was whether the search warrant was legal where probable cause was based upon information provided by an informant and the results from an infrared thermal detection device aimed at appellant's house. The court vacated the judgment of sentence and reversed the denial of appellant's pretrial motion to suppress. The court found that the lower court erred in failing to suppress the results of the search. The court concluded that the use of the infrared thermal detection device violated the U.S. Const. amend. IV, and accordingly, that portion of the search warrant affidavit which relied upon its use was invalid. The court also concluded that the information in the affidavit, which was provided by a confidential informant, did not establish probable cause for issuance of the search warrant because it was not properly supported by other evidence or proof of the reliability of the informant, and thus, the search warrant was not supported by probable cause.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of the judgment of the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County (Pennsylvania), which convicted him of third-degree murder and sentenced him to life in prison, pursuant to 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 9715. Appellant contended that he acted in self-defense and that the statute was not intended to apply when the crime triggering the statute occurred subsequent to the crime for which the life sentence was imposed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was found guilty of third degree murder for a Pennsylvania murder.

The court affirmed the conviction and the sentence after it found that the evidence supported the verdict. The court did not substitute its judgment for that of the fact-finder. The court also found that appellant did not act in self-defense because the evidence easily supported a finding that appellant neither reasonably nor actually believed that deadly force was necessary when he struck his unarmed victim at least 12 times with a sledgehammer. The court found that the trial judge also easily found malice because of the number of times appellant hit the victim.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the conviction for third-degree murder and the life sentence imposed upon appellant for the murder of a victim. The court found that the statutorily mandated life imprisonment sentence was appropriate, as the statute clearly stated that it applied if appellant was convicted of murder more than once. The court also found that there was no merit in the self-defense claim because the evidence supported the finding of malice.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of nine counts of wiretapping and was sentenced to county imprisonment and a fine. The sentence was affirmed on direct appeal. Appellant was sent after 20 months to a state institution to serve a concurrent sentence of 11 to 23 years for fraudulent real estate transactions. Appellant filed a petition for relief under the Post Conviction Relief Act (PCRA), 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 9541 et seq., and the commonwealth filed a motion to dismiss on the ground that appellant had completed serving his sentence. The trial court ordered the petition dismissed. The court affirmed the order of the trial court because it found that the PCRA only afforded relief to those who were currently serving a sentence of imprisonment, probation, or parole for the crime pursuant to 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 9543(a)(1). Even though appellant had the potential to be punished for contempt if he was able to pay his fines, but did not, he was not eligible for post-conviction relief pursuant to the PCRA.</SPAN></P>

Cons. Stat. &sect; 3731. Defendant contended that his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to make a motion to suppress the results of a blood test on the grounds that 75 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 1547(e), which made a refusal to submit to a blood test admissible at trial, violated his right not to incriminate himself under U.S. Const. amend. V. Defendant alleged that the underlying consent to the test was coerced because it was given out of fear that a refusal would be introduced at trial. The court on appeal affirmed, holding that defendant failed to establish a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel because he could not demonstrate that his motion to suppress had arguable merit. Defendant had no constitutional right to refuse the blood test and thus &sect; 1547(e) did not burden his constitutional rights by allowing evidence of his refusal to consent to be admitted at trial. The consent was therefore valid.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was granted a right to direct appeal nunc pro tunc and appealed the judgment of sentence nunc pro tunc. The court vacated the judgment of sentence and remanded, holding that it was error to impose the deadly weapon enhancement under 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9712(a) because defendant received a guidelines sentence which required that the weapon be in his possession or immediate control for the enhancement to apply. The court also found that defendant received ineffective assistance because counsel improperly commingled her attack on the sufficiency of the evidence with defendant's challenge to the weight of the evidence. However, the court held that the method of juror selection was not unconstitutional because the county used non-discriminatory driver's license and voter registration lists. Further, the evidence was sufficient to show that defendant conspired to commit robbery.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his convictions for driving while under the influence of alcohol under 75 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. &sect; 3731(a)(1), and homicide by vehicle while driving under the influence under 75 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. &sect; 3735. Defendant argued that the Commonwealth was required to introduce expert testimony to relate back the blood alcohol content to the time he was driving. The court affirmed and held that no expert relation back testimony was needed in defendant's prosecution pursuant to &sect; 3731(a)(1). Under &sect; 3731(a)(1), defendant could be convicted despite the fact that his blood alcohol level could not be related back to the time of his driving. In prosecutions under &sect; 3731(a)(1) the delay between the operation of the motor vehicle and when the blood was drawn goes only to the weight of the evidence and not its admissibility. Thus, there was no error in admitting defendant's blood alcohol content without expert relation back testimony.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought en banc review of a judgment of the Court of Common Pleas of Huntingdon County (Pennsylvania), which sentenced appellant to imprisonment for 30 days to 23 months on his conviction for driving under the influence of alcohol in violation of 75 Pa.

Appellant argued that he was not timely sentenced under Rule 1405(A), and that under Commonwealth v. Thomas, 449 Pa. Super. 646, 674 A.2d 1119 (1996), the proper remedy for a Rule 1405(A) violation was discharge. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment, holding that although the trial court did not timely sentence appellant under Rule 1405(A) because it provided no explanation on the record for the delay, discharge was not the appropriate remedy. The court expressly overruled Thomas to the extent it held that discharge was an appropriate remedy for a Rule 1405(A) violation, because Rule 1405(A) provided no remedy for its violation, much less the ultimate remedy of discharge, and because the case conflicted with the framework developed for analyzing claims of untimely sentencing.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of a judgment from the Court of Common Pleas of Centre County (Pennsylvania), which convicted appellant of failing to pay $ 1.25 per month on his telephone bill for 911 emergency services and imposed an aggregate fine in the amount of $ 6,591.25.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged a judgment from the trial court, which found him guilty of nonpayment of 911 fees. On appeal, the court affirmed appellant's conviction, but reversed the trial court's judgment as to the amount fined. The court found sufficient evidence was presented to sustain appellant's conviction but found that the fines imposed by the trial court were extremely excessive in light of the de minimus nature of the violation. Specifically, appellant was found guilty of not paying $ 1.25 per month from the period of March 1993 through December 1995, which amounted to $ 28.75. However, the trial court imposed an additional penalty of $ 6,550, which was the equivalent of more than 430 years of unpaid 911 charges. The court held that a fine should be sufficient enough to discourage the conduct, but not so excessive as to be punitive in nature and that here the fine was unreasonable and excessive. The court remanded to the trial court for reimposition of a fine more in line with the violation and directed the trial court to make an on-the-record determination regarding appellant's financial resources and his ability to pay the imposed fine.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed appellant's conviction for failure to pay 911 fees, but vacated the trial court's judgment and remanded for reimposition of fines, because the fine in excess of $ 6,000 was unreasonable and excessive in light of the $ 1.25 monthly fee and the fact that it amounted to 430 years of unpaid 911 charges.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from an order of the Court of Common Pleas of Westmoreland County (Pennsylvania), which accepted his plea of guilty for burglary and theft by unlawful taking and denied defendant's petition for relief pursuant to the Post Conviction Relief Act, 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9541.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of burglary and theft by unlawful taking after entering a plea of guilty. Defendant sought review of a trial court order which denied his petition for relief pursuant to the Post Conviction Relief Act, 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9541. Defendant alleged that he was unlawfully induced to enter a plea agreement because he was not aware of the consequences of his plea. On review, the court affirmed. The court found that defendant had no constitutional right to parole and thus rejected defendant's claim that his plea was involuntary because changes in parole board rules had allegedly increased his effective minimum sentence. The court held that the trial court need not advise a defendant pleading guilty of the rules of the Pennsylvania Board of Probation and Parole and/or the possibility of parole upon expiration of a minimum period of incarceration. The court defined eligibility for parole as a collateral consequence of defendant's plea, and not a constitutional right. The court found that a constitutional issue would only arise if the parole statute provided an expectation of release, and the Pennsylvania statute did not create any such expectation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the order of the trial court, which denied defendant's requested relief pursuant to the Post Conviction Relief Act, because the court found that defendant's guilty plea was knowing and voluntary, despite the trial court's failure to advise defendant of the circumstances affecting parole and the changes in release rules of the parole board after defendant was sentenced.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from judgment entered, in the Court of Common Pleas, Lancaster County (Pennsylvania), after a jury found him guilty of three counts of homicide by vehicle, under 75 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 3732, and the trial court found him guilty of one count each of failing to drive his vehicle at safe speed, violating 75 Pa. Cons.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant caused the deaths of three people by driving a tractor-trailer into their car, which was stopped in traffic. He was convicted of homicide by vehicle, failing to drive at a safe speed, and careless driving. He appealed, and the court affirmed, finding sufficient evidence to support the verdict. The court held while police could have inspected a book and two bags found in his truck after the accident, their warrantless seizure was improper, and the items should have been suppressed. Other items, such as a radar detector, were in plain view, and properly seized. Due to the totality of evidence, the court held that the denial below of the suppression motion was harmless error. The court also approved of rulings concerning the admission of the radar detector, as it went to intent to violate speed restrictions; sustained the exclusion of evidence concerning road signs, and the qualification of an expert witness, as not an abuse of the lower court's discretion; and sustained rulings relating to use of accident scene photographs at trial, because defendant failed to include the photographs in the record, and the court could not assess his claim concerning them.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the verdict convicting defendant of homicide by vehicle, failing to drive at a safe speed, and careless driving. There was sufficient evidence to support the verdict, and lower court rulings concerning admission of items seized from defendant's truck after the accident, were either correct or, if erroneous, resulted in harmless error.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was prosecuted for theft by failure to make required disposition of funds received under 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 3927(a) for his failure to remit taxes on a corporation's behalf. He challenged the conviction. Although defendant obtained the funds in another county, because the Department of Revenue was due taxes, subject matter jurisdiction and venue were proper in the county wherein the department was located. The court held that &sect; 3927(a) was not void for vagueness, as the statute sufficiently set forth the elements, and the statute did not unconstitutionally shift burdens, as it required the state to prove the elements beyond a reasonable doubt. The court held defendant could be charged under the general provision of &sect; 3927 instead of the specific provision of the Tax Reform Code, 72 P.S. &sect; 7268(b), as the contrast between the two was obvious and thus the rule to not permit prosecutions under general provisions when there are special provisions available did not apply. The court held that defendant failed to demonstrate a substantial question with regard to his sentence, and thus declined to address the claims. The court affirmed defendant's conviction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged an order of the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County (Pennsylvania), convicting him of driving while under the influence of alcohol.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that the results of his breathalyzer test should have been suppressed, as the machine used to test his alcohol level had registered a variance while testing previous subjects, and that the subsequent calibration and testing of the machine, without any adjustments or repairs, was insufficient to show that his breath test was done in accordance with the procedures prescribed in 67 Pa. Code &sect;&sect; 77.21-77.27. Defendant also asserted that his conviction for driving while under the influence, pursuant to 75 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 3731(a)(5), was unconstitutional. The court affirmed the denial of defendant's motion to suppress, holding that because the breathalyzer machine passed the accuracy and calibration tests, it was not necessary for the machine to be serviced, repaired, or adjusted. The court vacated the portion of defendant's conviction under 75 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 3731(a)(5), because that statute had previously been declared unconstitutional by the supreme court. However, because the trial court had only imposed a penalty for defendant's conviction under 75 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 3731(a)(4), the court held that it was unnecessary the case to be remanded for resentencing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the denial of defendant's motion to suppress his breathalyzer test results, holding that because the breathalyzer machine had passed accuracy and calibration tests, the test on defendant complied with the requirements of both the statute and regulations. However, the court vacated one portion of defendant's conviction, because part of the drunk driving statute had previously been held unconstitutional by the supreme court.</SPAN></P>

The court found that all three prongs of the test for a proper judgment of non pros had been met: appellant offered no reason for the delay in process, appellant was unable to prove that it acted with due diligence, and there was an unexplained period of docket inactivity in excess of two years leading to the presumption of prejudice to appellees that was not rebutted by a show of lack of actual prejudice.

The court vacated the judgment of sentence, reversed the conviction and discharged appellant.

During the sentencing hearing, defendant's Maryland driving record, which included three convictions for driving under the influence, was admitted into evidence. Defendant was sentenced, as a repeat offender, to imprisonment and fined $ 500 on the driving under the influence charge. On appeal, defendant contended that the trial court erred in sentencing him as a recidivist because his prior Maryland offenses were not equivalent to the Pennsylvania offenses. The court affirmed, finding that because the elements, prohibited conduct, and underlying public policy of the Maryland and Pennsylvania offenses were substantially identical, the trial court did not err in treating the offenses as equivalent for the purposes of sentencing defendant.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from the judgment of the Court of Common Pleas of Centre County (Pennsylvania), which convicted defendant of indirect criminal contempt for harassing and/or stalking his former girlfriend in violation of a protection of abuse order placed against defendant.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's former girlfriend had a protection from abuse order in place against defendant. One day the victim observed defendant following her on his motorcycle. The victim called the police, defendant was told to stay away from the victim, but he drove by her again. Defendant was convicted of indirect criminal contempt for stalking and/or harassing the victim in violation of 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2709. The appellate court affirmed. The sufficiency of the evidence supported the judgment. The appellate court could not reweigh the evidence and test whether defendant's actions lacked the required intent. The statute could sustain a conviction where defendant merely intended to harass or annoy. The fact that defendant did not physically harm the victim was of no import. Defendant may have had a chance encounter with the victim once, but wherein he made contact five times supported the judgment. There was no constitutional right to travel within the county. That right applied to travel to another state. Section 2709 was not overly broad or vague because it clearly laid out the elements of the crime and the required criminal intent.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's conviction for indirect criminal contempt for stalking and/or harassing the victim was affirmed. The trial court could not reweigh his testimony that he lacked the required intent. Intent was established by intent to harass or annoy, not intent to harm. Defendant's encounter with the victim five times in the same day established intent. The stalking statute was not unconstitutionally vague or overly broad.</SPAN></P>

The court determined that the statute was ambiguous as to whether it meant to create a substantive crime or a sentencing enhancement to other crimes. The court reviewed the legislative history, and held that the legislature had intended to create a substantive crime. The court held that the statute was void for vagueness because the statute's contradictions caused it to fail to give fair notice of the prohibited conduct, in violation of the due process clause of U.S. Const. amend.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant company filed suit against appellees, multiple companies and associations, for breach of contract and tortious interference with contract. After a period in excess of two years in which no docket entries were made, appellees filed a joint motion for judgment of non pros, which the trial court granted. Appellant filed a petition for relief from judgment of non pros, which was denied on the ground that appellant had failed to meet the second prong of the test under Pa. R. Civ. P. 3051(b) by failing to establish a reasonable explanation for the inactivity. The court affirmed and held that the trial court had properly presumed that the delay was prejudicial. Although appellant pointed to non-docketed discovery activity, the court held that prejudice could be presumed if there was no evidence of docketed activity for a period in excess of two years. The court recognized that a trial court could still consider the other prongs of the test for granting of a non pros, whether there was a compelling reason for the delay and whether there was an absence of due diligence in the prosecution, but held that the party responsible for delay could not negate the presumption of prejudice.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's order, which denied appellant company's petition for relief from a judgment of non pros. Because appellant failed to establish that there was a reasonable explanation or legitimate excuse for the inactivity on the docket, it was unable to satisfy the necessary elements for opening a judgment of non pros, and so the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the relief.</SPAN></P>

The trial court permitted the admission of blood alcohol test results that were made with blood serum and which applied a middle range conversion factor.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of driving under the influence to a degree rendering one incapable of safe driving, under 75 Pa.

The court affirmed the conviction under &sect; 3731(a)(1) because the blood alcohol tests were neither unfair nor arbitrary. The court found that the testing with blood serum and the use of a middle range conversion factor properly complied with acceptable standards, and the admission of this evidence did not cause a verdict against the weight of the evidence. The court reversed the conviction under &sect; 3731(a)(5)(i) because the statute was found unconstitutional as vague and overbroad and thus required the conviction to be vacated. The court found no abuse of discretion in the trial court's refusal to strike a juror for cause who was allegedly within the arresting officer's chain of command because defendant failed to include relevant portions of the record for the court's review of the claim and failed to provide an alternative to a transcript, as provided under Pa.

The court however reversed the conviction for driving while blood alcohol content is above .10 percent within three hours after driving because that statute had been found unconstitutional due to its vagueness and overbreadth. The court therefore found that the conviction under that statute must be vacated.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant mother challenged an order of the Court of Common Pleas of Dauphin County (Pennsylvania), which ordered her to pay support arrearages and uninsured medical and dental costs, pursuant to 23 P.S. &sect; 4327(a). Appellant's daughter by appellee father was a college student.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant mother and appellee father were divorced, and appellant was ordered to pay child support. The daughter had received an $ 8,000 fund from her grandmother for college expenses. Pursuant to 23 P.S. &sect; 4327(a), appellant was ordered to pay a certain portion of the college expenses; she fell into arrears. A lawsuit followed, and appellant was ordered to continue the payments and pay the arrearage. While the appeal was pending, &sect; 4327(a) was declared unconstitutional. On appeal, the court affirmed the child support award because retrospective application of the rule was a matter of judicial discretion to be exercised on a case by case basis. The court reasoned that blanket retroactive application would involve repayment of funds advanced under the unconstitutional statute and would unfairly encumber children of broken families with obligations not borne by children of intact families, as &sect; 4327(a) did not apply to children of intact families; therefore, retroactive application would be violative of equal protection guaranteed by U. S. Const. amend. XIV.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the award which obligated appellant mother to pay child support while her daughter was in college even though the supporting statute had been declared unconstitutional because retroactive application of the new rule would place an unfair burden on children of broken families, who might be obligated to repay funds advanced pursuant to the statute.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants sought review of orders by Philadelphia Courts of Common Pleas (Pennsylvania), which denied them relief under the Post Conviction Relief Act (PCRA), 42 Pa.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants were denied relief under the Post Conviction Relief Act (PCRA), 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 9541 et seq. The court affirmed the orders of the lower courts. In order to make its decision, the court had to interpret the language of the statute, which granted eligibility for relief to a person currently serving a sentence of imprisonment, probation, or parole. The court held that the &quot;currently serving&quot; language within PCRA &sect; 9543(a)(1)(i) referred to the time the petition for relief under the statute was filed rather than the time the petition was ultimately adjudicated. The court stated that its conclusion that the &quot;currently serving&quot; requirement necessary for jurisdiction was to be determined at the time the petition was filed did not preclude the possibility that the petition could thereafter become moot. The court then held that appellants' petitions were moot. The court held that upon unconditional release from custody, all cognizable harm necessarily ended and a pending petition, regardless of when it was filed, became moot.</SPAN></P>

Appellee pled guilty to possession of a controlled substance and possession with intent to deliver but was granted the right to withdraw that plea. The trial court granted appellee's motion to suppress the cocaine after finding that the constable lacked the authority to arrest appellee. On appeal, the court remanded, holding that the constable possessed the common law power to make a warrantless arrest for felony drug law violations. The court found no statutory provision abrogating that power, and since appellee's possession of a controlled substance with intent to deliver constituted a felony under 35 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 780-113(f)(1), the constable was empowered to make the arrest. However, the fact that the constable had the power to arrest did not make the arrest legal unless probable cause existed. Thus, the court remanded for a determination of probable cause.</SPAN></P>

The court found that appellant was stopped by the police for a faulty headlight and that parole officers had instructed the police to hold appellant until they could search him. The court found that the initial stop by the police was proper, but that the continued detention of appellant elevated to an investigatory stop for which the officers needed an articulable and reasonable basis. The court held that the officers did not have reasonable suspicion based on the fact that appellant had a pager and was present in a high crime area. The court concluded that there was no reasonable basis to suspect appellant was connected with any criminal activity and the search of appellant's person was the product of an illegal detention. The court held that the evidence seized from appellant's person should have been suppressed because it was fruit of the poisonous tree.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Court of Common Pleas, Greene County (Pennsylvania), finding him guilty of cruelty to animals (gamecocks) under 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 5511(h.1)(3) and sentencing him to 54 months probation, a $ 1,000 fine, and ordering him to pay restitution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appealing his conviction for cruelty to animals (gamecocks), defendant argued that 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. &sect; 5511(h.1)(3), which prohibited owning animals for animal fighting, was vague and overbroad in violation of U.S. Const. amend. I and XIV. He also argued that his conduct fell within a statutory exception to the crime of cruelty to animals and that a humane society officer that testified at trial was not qualified as an expert. On appeal, the court affirmed the sentence. The court held that defendant failed to carry his burden of showing that the statute was unconstitutional. The court held that defendant's conduct fell within the scope of the statute. The court found that a trooper with a search warrant discovered individually caged roosters altered for fighting on defendant's property and that he seized 36 magazines on fighting birds and two sets of spurs. The agent that testified as an expert participated in about 100 investigations involving cockfighting and qualified as an expert on the subject in 20 court cases. Thus, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting his testimony.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction of cruelty to animals (gamecocks) and the sentence imposed by the trial court. The court held that defendant did not show that the statute was unconstitutionally overbroad and found that defendant's conduct was prohibited by the statute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of an order from the Court of Common Pleas of Chester County, Criminal Division (Pennsylvania), which denied his petition for writ of habeas corpus in connection with appellant's conviction and accompanying sentence for three violations of the Wiretapping and Electronic Surveillance Control Act, 19 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 5701 et. seq.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, appellant contended that his conduct had not violated the Wiretapping and Electronic Surveillance Control Act (Act), 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 5701 et. seq., because none of appellant's conversations with the stopped motorists constituted an &quot;oral communication&quot; as defined under the Act. The court noted that the definition of &quot;original communication&quot; required a specific expectation of non-interception, justified under the circumstances, in order to bring the communication within the ambit of the Act. The court then found that under the circumstances of the instant case, while the stopped motorists had no expectation of privacy with respect to appellant, the police officer who had stopped them, the motorists had a very real expectation of non-interception. The court accordingly held that intercepts conducted by appellant constituted oral communications within the meaning of the Act. The court affirmed, rejecting appellant's assertion that his participant monitoring had been legal under the exception contained in 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 5704(2)(i) where appellant had failed to obtain the requisite approval and supervisor prior to making the intercepts in question.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the denial of the petition for writ of habeas corpus, finding that intercepts of the stopped motorists' statements qualified as &quot;oral communications&quot; under the Wiretapping and Electronic Surveillance Control Act (Act) where the motorists had a justifiable expectation of non-interception during the traffic stop. Appellant's monitoring was not exempt under the Act where he failed to obtain the requisite approval and supervision.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, an incompetent and her guardian parents, challenged an order of the Court of Common Pleas, Montgomery County, (Pennsylvania), Civil Division. The question on appeal was whether the immunity provision of the Mental Health Procedures Act applied to a health care provider who was not trained in the field of mental health, and who treated a patient's physical ailments, not a mental illness.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, an incompetent daughter and her parents, sought review of a trial court order that denied their motion for a new trial and entered judgment for appellee hospital and appellee physician. Appellant daughter was diagnosed as mentally retarded with psychosis after an adverse reaction to medication and also suffered physical ailments, including fever, dehydration, and a possible urinary tract infection. Appellants brought suit against the appellees to recover for appellant daughter's injuries and for derivative claims. Appellees filed a joint motion in limine requesting a ruling as to whether the Mental Health Procedures Act (MHPA), 50 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 7101, et seq., was controlling contending the MHPA afforded them limited immunity absent willful misconduct or gross negligence. The trial court granted the motion. Appellant sought review on interlocutory appeal which was denied, then pursued appeal after denial of a new trial motion. Concluding that adequate treatment with the least restrictive alternatives was the hallmark of the MHPA, the court concluded the immunity provision applied to appellees. The court reversed the trial court judgment and remanded for a new trial.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court judgment for appellee physician and appellee hospital. The court found the immunity provision of the Mental Health Procedures Act did apply to the appellees in a situation where they had provided non-psychiatric care to appellant daughter, a patient who had been diagnosed with mental health and physical health ailments. The court remanded the case back for a new trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants were congregations of Roman Catholic churches whose parishes were suppressed by appellee. Appellants then sued appellee, and the cases were dismissed in the trial courts for appellants' lack of standing. The appeals filed by appellants were consolidated. Appellants asserted that the trial courts erred in determining that they did not have standing to pursue their cases. The court held that under the church law, the effect of dismemberment was to cause the parish to cease to exist and to transfer its members to adjoining parishes. Dismemberment also deprived parish's members of all rights as members in the church property of the parish from which they were transferred. Finally, division, dismemberment, or suppression of parishes, and the effect thereof on membership were purely ecclesiastical matters, and the court did not review the merits of a decision rendered in an ecclesiastical matter by the appropriate church tribunal or official. Accordingly, the orders of the trial courts were affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Orders of dismissal of appellants' suits against appellee affirmed where because appellants sought review of the suppression of their parishes, which were purely ecclesiastical matters, the trial courts would not review those matters.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed, holding that although appellant had standing to assert a Fourth Amendment search and seizure claim, the new rule of law providing for exclusion of evidence resulting from wiretapping without probable cause did not apply. The court held that the weighing of relevant factors supported only a prospective application of the new rule of law, and found no evidence that police failed to comply with the Wiretap Act, or that their conduct was so outrageous as to constitute a violation of due process.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee contractor and engineers were hired to design and install sanitary sewers in parts of a city. During the installation of such sewers, appellees struck and damaged gas lines owned and operated by appellant gas company. Eighteen years after installation of the sewer lines, a natural gas explosion occurred and several homes were destroyed. Homeowners initiated an action against appellants and appellees. Appellees were granted judgment on the pleadings because the statute of repose, 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 5536(a), extinguished the homeowners' action. On appeal, the court affirmed the decision. The homeowners did not bring their action against appellees within 12 years of the completion of the installation of the sewer lines, so their action was barred by the statute of repose. The fact that appellant had no control over the installation was irrelevant because appellees' actions fell within the parameters of the statute of repose.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellees, motorist and passengers, were charged with multiple drug-related offenses after their vehicle was stopped by a police officer who noticed that appellees were not wearing seat belts. The trial court granted appellees' pre-trial motions to suppress all statements and physical evidence associated with the case holding that a violation of 75 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. &sect; 4581, a law requiring motorists to wear seatbelts, did not provide the officer with probable cause to stop appellees' vehicle. The court affirmed the trial court's suppression order and held that the police were not authorized to stop appellees' vehicle unless they had reasonable and articulable grounds to suspect that the motor vehicle code was being violated. The court held that appellees' non-compliance with &sect; 4581 was not a violation of the motor vehicle code because appellees were not also convicted of simultaneously violating another motor vehicle code provision. The court held that because the police had no reason to stop appellees' vehicle, the stop was illegal, and as such, all evidence accumulated pursuant to the stop constituted &quot;the fruits of a poisonous tree&quot; and was subject to being suppressed.</SPAN></P>

Appellant sought a not guilty verdict based on his insanity defense, however, he was found guilty but mentally ill on two counts of murder of the first degree and three counts of reckless endangerment of another person. Appellant's post-verdict motions were denied. Appellant challenged the judgment. The court affirmed. The court found that the jury had ample evidence upon which to judge appellant's sanity at the time of the shootings, and thus, the verdict was not against the weight of the evidence. The court also held that 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 314 was not unconstitutional, and the verdict of guilty but mentally ill did not deprive appellant of due process and equal protection.

The court found that &sect; 3731(a)(5) was not overbroad and it reflected the state's legitimate interest in controlling drunk driving; nor did it shift the burden of proof to appellant to show that he had a blood alcohol level above .10 percent within three hours of driving because that was not an element of the offense and the prosecution still had to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that his blood alcohol level was .10 percent or more.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The commonwealth sought review of a judgment of sentence from the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County, Criminal Division (Pennsylvania), which did not impose the mandatory minimum sentence on appellee due to the commonwealth's previous offer to waive the mandatory sentence during unsuccessful plea negotiations. The commonwealth's motion to reconsider was denied.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">As part of appellee's plea bargain, the commonwealth agreed that it would not seek any applicable mandatory minimum sentence. Appellee later withdrew his guilty plea and was convicted of possession of a controlled substance with intent to deliver, possession of a controlled substance, criminal conspiracy, and prohibited offensive weapons. The commonwealth intended to proceed under the mandatory sentencing provisions, but the trial court refused to impose the mandatory minimum sentence and denied the commonwealth's motion to reconsider. On appeal, the court vacated the sentence and remanded the case for resentencing. It was within the sole discretion of the commonwealth whether to invoke the mandatory minimum sentence and the trial court was required to follow the law, despite its belief that the law was flawed. The decision whether to enter into plea negotiations was a function of prosecutorial discretion and was not based on an invidious classification. The commonwealth's plea negotiation policy was not unconstitutionally infirm and was not arbitrarily or discriminatorily applied.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee's judgment of sentence was vacated and the case was remanded for resentencing. The trial court's failure to impose the mandatory minimum sentence was error because it was within the sole discretion of commonwealth to determine whether to seek a mandatory sentence and such discretion could be used in a constitutionally firm manner during plea negotiations.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment from the Court of Common Pleas, Berks County, Criminal Division (Pennsylvania), sentencing him to two consecutive terms of imprisonment after he pled guilty to two counts of homicide by motor vehicle.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pled guilty to two counts of homicide by motor vehicle after two of his passengers were killed in a crash. Defendant appealed his sentence of two consecutive terms on grounds that the multiple sentences imposed as a result of a single criminal act violated his due process and equal protection rights under the federal and state constitutions. The court noted that both U.S. Const. amend. XIV and Pa. Const. art. III, &sect; 32 mandated that statutory classifications not implicating fundamental interests or suspect classes had to bear a rational relationship to a legitimate state interest. Defendant did not clearly demonstrate unconstitutionality. The purpose of the homicide by vehicle statute was to reduce highway fatalities. Imposition of consecutive sentences served this purpose, provided punishment proportionate to criminal liability, and punished serious offenders more severely. Defendant also challenged the lower court's imposition of sentence in the aggravated range. Defendant did not properly preserve the issue for review and nevertheless failed to raise the appearance of a substantial question as to the appropriateness of sentence. The judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's sentence to two consecutive terms upon his conviction for two counts of homicide by motor vehicle was affirmed. The imposition of multiple sentences as a result of a single criminal act, the car crash which took two lives, did not violate defendant's due process or equal protection rights under the federal and state constitutions. The statute was rationally related to the state's interest to reduce highway fatalities.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant father sought review of a ruling which sustained appellee mother's exceptions to a hearing officer's recommendation that he was not responsible for college support of his two sons due to estrangement. Appellee filed a motion to cancel exceptions and terminate the order. The trial court sustained appellee's exceptions and appellant challenged the trial court's finding that the parties were not estranged. Appellant raised two issues: whether the hearing officer whose recommendations were overruled by the trial court correctly applied the law of Pennsylvania with regard to appellant's estrangement defense and whether the hearing officer whose recommendations were overruled by the trial court exceeded her scope of authority by basing her findings in part upon her observation of the parties' verbal and non-verbal conduct. The court held that the examination of the record indicated no evidence of estrangement which would relieve appellant of his duty of support. Therefore, the court agreed with the trial court's conclusion that the relationship between appellant and his sons was one of disagreement and misunderstanding, not estrangement.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant father was ordered to pay $ 109 per month to help his adult son through college. A court decision handed down a decision outlawing this type of payment, but the legislature enacted 23 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect;4327 (Act 62) creating a statutory duty for divorced parents to pay for their adult children's college education. The trial court then ordered appellant to pay $ 127, retroactive to the date of the suspension of the prior order. The court vacated and remanded the decision because Act 62 support awards had to be limited to defined educational costs. The court found that support award amount included sundries such as car insurance and cable television and appellant properly excepted to inclusion of personal expenses in the support award. Furthermore, the court held that the educational expenses were not properly documented. The only evidence submitted was one semester's tuition bill and no receipts for other defined education expenses such as books. Lastly, the court held that under Act 62 the guideline amounts, which had been formulated to reflect what parents of a particular income level would reasonable expected to spend in support of their minor children, should be used.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Trial court's judgment for support of 21-year old son and his educational expenses was vacated and remanded with instructions because support awards had to be limited to defined educational costs, and these educational cost should be carefully documented. The court further held that since the costs had been liquidated, the trial court's order could result in a money judgment, but not a support order.</SPAN></P>

The arresting officer testified that he encountered defendant approximately one hour after she reported an automobile accident.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant airline employee challenged a judgment from the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County, Criminal Division (Pennsylvania), which convicted him of indecent assault.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant airline employee challenged his conviction for indecent assault on a co-worker, contending that the trial court erred in failing to allow an in-camera review of the alleged victim's psychiatric records. Appellant also contended that the trial court erroneously failed to caution the jury, as requested, on the victim's credibility based on her failure to file a prompt complaint. Appellant also argued that the trial court erroneously admitted the testimony of two witnesses regarding appellant's prior &quot;off-color&quot; statements to them. The victim testified that the indecent assault occurred in the break room of the airline's freight dock. The victim's supervisor testified that the victim was the only female working in the air freight division with appellant and was fearful of causing trouble by reporting the incident. The appellate court affirmed conviction because psychiatric records were protected by an absolute statutory privilege and were not subject to disclosure. The appellate court held that although evidence of appellant's reputation was not admissible it became admissible because appellant placed his reputation at issue and opened the door to rebuttal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of conviction for indecent assault was affirmed because appellant's arguments lacked merit. The court held that appellant's constitutional rights were not violated by denial of access to the victim's statutorily protected psychiatric records. The court also held that appellant himself delved into what would have been objectionable testimony, which entitled appellee state to probe into the objectionable area.</SPAN></P>

Cons. Stat. &sect; 4327. The trial court rejected appellant's claims that the statute was unconstitutional under the federal and state constitutions as an ex post facto law and as a violation of equal protection.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant father was ordered to pay support for a child in college after the trial court reconsidered a support petition that had been denied under recent decisional law, that was promptly reversed by the legislature through the enactment of 23 Pa.

On appeal, the court affirmed and held that appellant had not shown either undue hardship or estrangement that would effect his support obligation. The court held that Act 62 was not penal, so it was not an ex post facto law under U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 10, cl. 1 or Pa. Const. art. I, &sect; 1. The court considered appellant's equal protection claims under U.S. Const. amend. XIV, &sect; 1 and Pa. Const. art. I, &sect; 1 and art. III, &sect; 32, under the restraint that review of equal protection was not a license for courts to judge the wisdom, fairness, or logic of legislative choices. The court found that appellant did not show that he was in a suspect or sensitive class. The court applied a rational basis test and found that the legislature had a rational basis for classifying divorced parents differently from parents in intact families, so Act 62 was constitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the order of the trial court, which held that appellant father had a duty to support his daughter in college because Act 62 was constitutional. The court held Act 62 was not penal and, therefore, not ex post facto, and it did not deny equal protection because the legislature had a rational basis creating a classification of divorced parents.</SPAN></P>

In the instant case, the prior bad acts showed defendant's intent and course of conduct, which was also admissible as an element of the crime of stalking. The court also held that the admission of evidence of the civil protection from abuse order was relevant and probative on the question of intent and course of conduct.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant employee was hired by appellee employee as a professional management consultant. The business relationship was renewed each year. A provision of the employment contract stated that employer could terminate the contract for cause and in that case there was a penalty provision for any former clients of employer who retained appellant. One of the listed causes for termination was homosexuality. After appellant went on a television representing a gay and lesbian coalition, he was terminated. Appellant opened his own office and solicited former clients. Appellee brought an action against appellant for the loss of business. In a counterclaim, appellant claimed that he had been wrongly terminated. The trial court awarded damages to appellee. On appeal, the court held that the continued relationship between the parties created the inference that the parties assented to another contract for a term of the same length and same conditions. Thus, appellant breached the contract by soliciting clients. The court held that discrimination based on sexual orientation was not actionable under any Pennsylvania statute or its constitution nor did it violate U.S. Const. amend. XIV.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, heirs and devisees, of an estate sought review of a judgment by the Court of Common Pleas of Montgomery County, Orphans' Court (Pennsylvania), which distributed stock to a life beneficiary of a trust. Appellants in consolidated appeals contested the distribution, and challenged the failure of trustees to diversify investments, the failure to disqualify opposing counsel, and the timeliness of a 1986 trust agreement.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An inter vivos trust was created for the benefit of two grandsons. Upon each grandson's death, the settlor instructed that the net income from the deceased's portion of the estate was to be paid in equal shares for the support, maintenance and education of his children. In the consolidated appeals before the court, appellants, heirs and devisees of the estate, contended that the trial court erred in distributing ordinary and extraordinary stock dividends to a life beneficiary between 1948 and 1963 pursuant to the Principal and Income Acts of 1945 and 1947, 20 P.S. &sect; 8101 et seq. The court held that the trial court correctly ruled that the dividends should be distributed to the holders of the life estate. The court held that the settlor intended to give her grandsons the stock as well as the cash dividends. The court also affirmed ruling that trustees had properly distributed extraordinary stock dividends to the life beneficiary. The court held that trustees' primary duty was to preserve the estate and that they had acted with reasonable prudence. The court reversed the holding that the 1986 trust agreement was time barred. The decree was affirmed in part, and reversed in part.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">That part of the decree of the trial court that dismissed as untimely admission of the 1986 trust agreement was reversed and the document was directed to be submitted for probate. The decree, as modified was affirmed, because in Pennsylvania, the presumption was that extraordinary stock dividends were from earning and belong to the income beneficiary.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant hospital challenged the final decrees of the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County (Pennsylvania), which dismissed appellant's exceptions to the auditing judge's amended adjudications, and affirmed the amended adjudications absolutely. Appellant's action alleged that income interests to the great-grandchildren of appellee estate's testatrix were invalid under the common law rule against perpetuities.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The will of appellee estate's testatrix established a trust to pay net income to her daughter for life. Upon her daughter's death, the net income was paid in equal shares to her daughter's children until the death of the last of testatrix's grandchildren at which time the net income would be paid to the testatrix's great-grandchildren per stirpes. Upon the death of the great-grandchildren, one-half of the principal was to be paid to appellant hospital. Appellant brought an action which alleged that the purported income interests to the testatrix's great-grandchildren were invalid under the common law rule against perpetuities. The trial court dismissed appellant's action. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that the remainder interests to the testatrix's great-grandchildren became fixed upon the death of each grandchild, and were therefore valid even though those interests did not vest upon the death of each grandchild. The court ruled that because the remainder interests were valid, they could be separated from possibly void interests under the doctrine of vertical separability, and doing so did not disturb the testatrix's overall testamentary plan.</SPAN></P>

During the new trial, appellant received information from the commonwealth which had not been disclosed prior to appellant's initial trial.

The commonwealth sought review, and the court reversed. The court found that the information which had not been disclosed by the commonwealth had been neither exculpatory nor material to appellant's defense. Therefore, the court held that the commonwealth's failure to disclose these items had not violated the Brady rule.

The court agreed with appellant the trial court had incorrectly interpreted the sentencing statute and that appellee should not have received the sentencing of probation without verdict.

The trial jury was unable to reach a verdict on the second degree murder charge and a mistrial was granted. Appellant filed post-trial motions that were denied by the court.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state served a subpoena on defendant for the purpose of seeking his testimony in the trial of his co-defendant for capital murder. Thereafter, defendant filed a motion to quash the subpoena. The trial court denied defendant's motion to quash the subpoena and compelled him to testify. When defendant refused, the court held defendant in criminal and civil contempt for his refusal to testify and sentenced him to imprisonment. On appeal, the court affirmed, finding that defendant's constitutional challenge to the legality of use immunity clearly failed. The court further found that defendant failed to cite any legal authority to support his alleged due process violations. Finally, after scrutinizing defendant's assignments of error, the court found that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in holding defendant in civil and criminal contempt.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants asbestos distributors challenged the decision of the Common Pleas of Philadelphia County (Pennsylvania), which entered a judgment against appellants, denied appellants' motion for post judgment relief, and granted appellee injured party's petition for delay damages in appellee's action to recover for injuries arising out of appellee's occupational exposure to asbestos.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee injured party brought suit to recover damages that resulted from appellee's occupational exposure to asbestos. The parties stipulated that appellants distributors' actions reduced appellee's life expectancy. The trial court determined that two of the appellants were one-sixth liable and had to pay for one-sixth of the damages. A third appellant was found to be a substantial contributing factor and was held responsible for appellee's entire damages. Appellant one filed for bankruptcy; therefore, the court stayed appellant one's appeal. Appellant two claimed that the lower court erred in failing to grant its motion for directed verdict because appellee failed to allege any damages for pain and suffering. The court agreed and reversed the trial court's judgment as to appellant two because appellee's pleural thickening and asbestosis conditions had not caused appellee any current ill health or functional impairment. The court concluded that appellant three failed to demonstrate reversible error. Accordingly, the court affirmed the trial court's decision as to appellant three.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, victim and wife, brought an action against appellee, estate for the deceased at-fault driver, for injuries sustained after an automobile accident. After a jury trial, judgment was entered in favor of appellants, in excess of appellee's insurance policy limits. Appellants then brought a petition against appellees for delay damages. The trial court denied the petition, finding that the tender of policy limits by appellee's insurer within the time period set forth in Pa. R. Civ. P. 238 precluded such damages. The appellate court reversed and remanded, holding that appellee would be liable for delay damages if it did not tender all its assets to settle the claim. On remand, the trial court was directed to hold an evidentiary hearing to determine if appellee's estate could have offered more assets. However, the appellate court declined to hold appellee's insurer liable for such damages, holding that the tender of limits was sufficient, and that the insurer was not obligated to deposit the monies with the trial court. Further, the appellate court held that appellee's challenge to the constitutionality of Pa. R. Civ. P. 238 was spurious.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged an order of the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County, Criminal Division (Pennsylvania), which convicted him of luring a child into a motor vehicle, 18 Pa.

The appellate court affirmed, holding that the evidence was sufficient to support the conviction under &sect; 901.

The appellate court also held that the evidence was sufficient to support the conviction under &sect; 2904.

The trial court granted a no-fault divorce, awarded equitable distribution of the estate, and denied appellant's other requests. In affirming, the appellate court stated that appellant waived her claims regarding equitable distribution as she failed to file a motion for post-trial relief as required by Pa. R. Civ. P. 227.1. Nonetheless, appellant's constitutional arguments with respect to the award and proceedings were meritless. It was not a violation of U.S. Const. amend.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant criminal challenged his convictions for rape and involuntary deviate sexual intercourse (IDSI). Appellant argued that the evidence of rape was insufficient because the victim submitted to the sexual acts, thus allowing no inference that there was forcible compulsion.

Appellant complained that a floor brush was improperly admitted. The court held that there was a sufficient foundation for the brush's admission. Appellant also argued that letters were improperly admitted into evidence because they were not authenticated. The court held that a witness acknowledged that he was familiar with appellant's handwriting and identified the letter, and that this was sufficient to authenticate it. The court held, however, that the trial court imposed an illegal sentence by punishing appellant twice for each act of penile penetration, in violation of the double jeopardy clause of the United States Constitution. The court vacated the sentences for IDSI imposed concurrent to the sentences for rape, and otherwise affirmed the judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The intended victim testified that he was approached by appellant and offered one thousand dollars for one-half hour of work. The intended victim also testified that appellant would not tell him the kind of work involved unless he accompanied appellant to his car. The court affirmed appellant's conviction of attempt to lure a child into a motor vehicle because the intent of appellant to lure his planned victim into his car was apparent. The court agreed with the determination of the trial court that there was evidence to prove each of the elements of attempt beyond a reasonable doubt. The court also held that the Child Luring Statute,&nbsp;18 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 2910, was constitutional and that it was not vague as applied to appellant since appellant himself had articulated to his intended victim that his behavior was criminally proscribed. Balancing the factors in the present case, the court further concluded that appellant's trial delay was not inordinate and that appellant bore the responsibility for the bulk of that delay. In the absence of a showing of prejudice, the dismissal of charges for failure to comply with Pa. R. Crim. P. 1122 was not required.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of statutory rape, indecent assault, corruption of minors, and involuntary deviate sexual intercourse (IDSI) perpetrated against his 12-year-old nephew. Appellant only challenged his conviction for IDSI, 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 3123(5). Most of his complaints were constitutional in nature. In affirming the judgment, the court held that the statutory rape statute,&nbsp;18 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 3122, was a more general statute than the IDSI statute. Second, the more general statute, statutory rape, contained an element outside of the more specific. The court held that since the general statute was not encompassed by the more specific, there was no bar against the state pursuing convictions for both offenses. Appellant next contended that the IDSI statute violated U.S. Const. amend IV, the equal protection clause, because it irrationally discriminated against unmarried, consenting couples, where one of the individuals is under the age of sixteen, homosexuals, who are unable to marry, and adolescents. Appellant had no standing to assert these claims. Even if appellant did have standing, the court found that the IDSI statute was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment that convicted appellant of statutory rape, indecent assault, corruption of minors, and involuntary deviate sexual intercourse (IDSI) because it found that there was no bar to the prosecution under the IDSI statute and the complained of statute was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant commonwealth challenged the sentence given by the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County (Pennsylvania), which convicted appellee offender of possession, and possession with intent to deliver, cocaine. The trial court refused to apply the mandatory minimum sentence, reasoning that since the first conviction did not occur before the second offense, an enhancement was improper.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After reconsidering appellee offender's sentence for possession, and possession with intent to deliver, cocaine, in a case of first impression, the court held that at the time of sentencing appellee had been convicted of another drug trafficking offense, and the trial court was required to impose the enhanced sentence. The court found the language of 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. &sect; 7508(a)(3)(i) to be unambiguous. The court explained that the legislature did not adopt the traditional look-back rule when drafting this recidivist provision, but rather made it clear that the relevant look-back period began at the time of sentencing. The court rejected the claim that the statute violated equal protection, holding that it was reasonably designed to effectuate the purpose it sought to achieve. The court also rejected the claim that potential disparate treatment caused by administrative delay rendered the statute unconstitutional, and it recommended seeking appropriate remedies if, in an isolated case, an unfairly harsh sentence were to occur. The sentence was vacated and the cause remanded for resentencing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The sentence was vacated, and the case was remanded to the trial court for imposition of a new sentence in accordance with the court's opinion. The statute was unambiguous, the relevant look-back period began at the time of sentencing, and appellee offender should have received the sentence enhancement.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant restaurant owner sought review of the judgment from the Court of Common Pleas of Venango County (Pennsylvania), which found appellant guilty of erecting a sign without the approval of the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation and which penetrated the approach to an airport runway in violation of 74 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 5701(a)-(b) in a trial de novo upon appeal from appellant's conviction in a lower court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant restaurant owner was cited for violating 74 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 5701(a)-(b) when he erected a 95 foot sign without first obtaining the approval of the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (PennDot) and which penetrated the approach area to an airport runway. After his conviction at a lower court, appellant was tried de novo before the trial court and again was found guilty. On appeal, appellant argued that the enforcement of &sect; 5701 was an unconstitutional taking of his property without just compensation in violation of U.S. Const. amend. V. in the absence of an air easement or a zoning ordinance regulating the height of signs. The court affirmed the conviction. The court held that enforcement of &sect; 5701 was not an unconstitutional taking of property because appellant was convicted for not obtaining PennDot's prior approval to erect the sign. The court held that only when PennDot refused to allow the sign would a claim for a taking arise. The court also found that &sect; 5701was a proper exercise of the state's police power to identify potential hazards and to prevent obstructions to air traffic, thereby ensuring the safe operation of airports.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment convicting appellant restaurant owner for erecting a sign which penetrated the approach to an airport runway was affirmed, because enforcement of the statute was not an unconstitutional taking where the violation was the failure to obtain approval for the sign from Pennsylvania's transportation agency and because the statute was a proper exercise of the state's police power to ensure the safety of airport operations.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The commonwealth sought review of an order of the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County, Criminal Division, Pennsylvania, which granted defendants' motion to suppress evidence resulting from a warrantless search.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, who were charged after police found stolen vehicles in their possession in an autobody shop, filed a motion to suppress based on lack of probable cause to search. The trial court granted the motion. On appeal, the court reversed, and held that police officers did not need a warrant to walk onto commercial property that was open to the public. The court explained that the U.S. Const. amend. IV protection against unreasonable searches extended to commercial property; however, an individual was required to first show that he had a legitimate expectation of privacy in the area being searched. Mere looking at that which was open to view was not a search. Defendants did not have a legitimate expectation of privacy in the garage driveway, nor were their privacy rights offended by the officer's peering through the garage's open door. The shop was open to the public, and the police arrived during regular business hours. Secondly, the court ruled that the record contained no testimony to support the inference that one of the officers entered the garage before consent to search was given. Consent was given by one in authority, and that obviated the need for a search warrant.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the grant of defendants' motion to suppress because police officers entering commercial property open to the public during regular business hours did not need a search warrant, and in any case, consent to search was given by one in authority.</SPAN></P>

Defendants contended, inter alia, that the wiretap evidence should have been suppressed because the warrants were not issued by a court of competent jurisdiction, the authorization was limited to outgoing telephone calls while the installed equipment also recorded incoming telephone calls, there was no probable cause for the surveillance, and that the Wiretapping and Electronic Surveillance Control Act, 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 5701 et seq., was unconstitutional. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that the wiretap authorizations could be issued by a judge of the court, that the equipment was properly authorized, and that there was probable cause for the wiretap orders. Furthermore, the court held that the search warrants were not overbroad, the search warrant of the garage was valid, and that the evidence was sufficient to support the gambling counts against defendant bookmaker.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, who had executed a promissory note, defaulted on the note after it had been transferred by the original holder to appellee, the assignee of the promissory note.

The judgment was transferred to Pennsylvania and writs of execution were issued directing the sale of appellants' properties. Appellants petitioned the trial court for a rule upon appellee to show cause why the execution proceeding should not be stayed or to set aside the execution, which was denied. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment and held there was no reason not to give full faith and credit to the judgment, that appellants' unjust enrichment defense could have been raised in the original action, and that appellee, as the holder in due course, took the note free of all of appellants' defenses under 13 Pa.

The court also concluded that doctrine of res judicata precludes a collateral attack by appellants.</SPAN></P>

R. Crim. P. 319(a) and defendant's nolo contendre plea was entered voluntarily; [2]-The trial court was aware that defendant was taking a drug, and defendant stated that he had no problems understanding the trial judge and at no time did he give any indication that he failed to understand the rights he was waiving by entering the plea; further, it was clear that the trial court was satisfied that the plea was made knowingly and voluntarily; [3]-As there was no evidence that defendant's intoxication was so overwhelming that it rendered him incapable of forming a specific intent to kill, trial counsel was not ineffective for failing to raise or put at issue a defense of intoxication.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged the judgment of the Court of Common Pleas, Criminal Division, Berks County (Pennsylvania), which sentenced him to life imprisonment and additional consecutive sentences for first degree murder, conspiracy to commit third degree murder, conspiracy to commit aggravated assault, and carrying a firearm without a license.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant argued that insufficient evidence sustained his convictions for first degree murder, conspiracy to commit third degree murder, conspiracy to commit aggravated assault, and carrying a firearm without a license. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded for a new trial on all charges except for conspiracy to commit third degree murder and the two counts of conspiracy to commit aggravated assault. With respect to such conspiracy charges, judgment was arrested and the charges were dismissed. Sufficient evidence supported appellant's conviction for a willful and deliberate killing, but the commonwealth failed to prove appellant's guilt of conspiring to commit the crimes of third degree murder and aggravated assault because there was no evidence of a common understanding. The trial court's error in fashioning a jury instruction according to the language of 18 Pa. Const. Stat. &sect; 6104 without qualification relieved the commonwealth of its burden of proof and was reversible error. The alleged prosecutorial misconduct did not warrant a mistrial. Appellant's co-conspirator's testimony on his plea agreement was not an attempt to comment on appellant's failure to testify at trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Subsequent to their conviction for cruelty to animals in violation of 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 5511(c), appellants claimed that the grant of police power to the Erie Humane Society, a private corporation that initiated the prosecution, was an improper delegation of governmental authority. Appellants also claimed that &sect; 5511(c) was unconstitutionally vague, and that the evidence was insufficient to support their convictions. In affirming the convictions, the court held that appellant's improper delegation claim was without merit. The court found that the society's police power to initiate criminal proceedings was circumscribed by the rules of criminal procedure. The court held that the statute was not unconstitutionally vague because persons of common intelligence could conclude that appellants' utter neglect of their horses would not be considered as activity undertaken in normal agricultural operations. Finally, the court concluded that appellants' sufficiency of the evidence claim was without merit because they failed in their burden to establish that their activities were normal agricultural operations.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed appellants' conviction for cruelty to animals.

The court also held that that the statute under which appellants were convicted was not unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of a judgment of the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County (Pennsylvania) that convicted appellant of third-degree murder, homicide by vehicle while driving under the influence, driving under the influence of alcohol or a controlled substance, aggravated assault, and recklessly endangering another person. Appellant alleged that the blood alcohol test that was administered was improper.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was the driver of a car that veered off the road, killing appellant's wife. Appellant was found guilty of third-degree murder, homicide by vehicle while driving under the influence, driving under the influence of alcohol or a controlled substance, aggravated assault and recklessly endangering another person. The court affirmed, holding that the blood alcohol test administered at the hospital was proper pursuant to 75 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. &sect; 1547(a)(1). The court held that where a police officer had reasonable grounds to believe that a person was driving under the influence of alcohol, he could require an individual to submit to a chemical test without a warrant. The court held that there was sufficient evidence to prove that appellant's actions were the direct cause of his wife's death, as causation was proved. The evidence also was sufficient to establish malice. Appellant's ineffective assistance of counsel claims failed because the evidence of appellant's intoxicated condition was overwhelming and the admission of his suspended license did not influence the verdict.</SPAN></P>

There was sufficient evidence to show that appellant acted with malice and caused his wife's death.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff mother and father challenged a decision by the Court of Common Pleas, Civil Division, of Montgomery County (Pennsylvania), which held that their wrongful birth action against defendant doctors was barred by Pennsylvania's wrongful birth statute,&nbsp;42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 8305(a). Plaintiffs further sought review of the trial court's decision to sustain defendants' demurrer to plaintiffs' complaint.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When plaintiff mother became pregnant, defendant doctors recommended amniocentesis testing to determine whether there were any fetal defects. After the test was performed, defendants advised plaintiff mother and father that plaintiff mother was carrying a normal fetus. After plaintiffs' daughter was born with severe birth defects, it was discovered that the amniotic fluid that was tested by defendants did not belong to plaintiff mother. Plaintiffs filed a wrongful birth lawsuit against defendants for failing to perform an amniocentesis test. The defendants filed preliminary objections in the nature of a demurrer in which they asserted that an action for wrongful birth was precluded by 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 8305(a). The trial court sustained defendants' demurrer. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's decision, holding that &sect; 8305(a) was not unconstitutional, because it did not impose a restriction upon a woman's right to an abortion. The court further found that &sect; 8305(a) did not violate the Equal Protection Clause of the U.S. Const. Amend. XIV, because entitlement to monetary damages because of another's negligence has never been held to be a fundamental right.</SPAN></P>

The court found that appellee mother had a contemporary sensory observance of the accident. The court held that appellee mother's observation of and reaction to the devastating injuries to appellee children supported the verdict for her estate for negligent infliction of emotional distress, and no medical evidence was needed. The court held that the denial of appellant's motion for a new trial was proper. The court found that appellee child's statement at trial about his mother's subsequent death was properly handled with a cautionary jury instruction. The court held that appellant did not offer all available funds for settlement and was properly held accountable for delay damages under Tex. R. Civ. P. 238.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant customer ordered breakfast at appellee restaurant. Appellant was dissatisfied with the state of the sausage and returned it to the kitchen. He then disputed the amount of the bill, left a portion of the outstanding balance, and departed. Appellee assistant manager contacted the police department, which sent an officer to investigate. When appellant refused to pay the balance due he was charged with theft of services, a summary offense that the district justice dismissed. Appellant then filed a civil action for malicious prosecution. At the close of appellant's case, the trial court granted appellees' motion for nonsuit. The court held that in order to prevail on a claim of malicious prosecution, plaintiff must first show that defendant initiated criminal proceedings against plaintiff without probable cause. In affirming the nonsuit, the court ruled that the trial court correctly found that the evidence was sufficient to establish probable cause based on appellant's refusal to pay the amount listed for his breakfast, thereby justifying appellees' initiation of criminal proceedings against appellant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant state challenged the order of the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County (Pennsylvania), which granted parole, aggregating the sentences imposed upon several appellees. Appellant contended that the trial court was without authority to grant early parole, under the proper interpretation of 42 Pa. Cons.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In several cases, the trial court granted parole and aggregated several appellees' sentences. Appellant state challenged the orders, and the court reversed and remanded, because the trial court was without authority to grant early parole, under the proper interpretation of 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 9757 (1982), 61 P.S. &sect;&sect; 314, 331.17. The court held that once another judge sentenced appellees on another conviction, or a &quot;back-time&quot; sentence was imposed due to a parole violation, that original sentencing court could not expect to continue to exercise parole power. The commission of subsequent crimes frustrated the original attempt of the court to rehabilitate the defendant. The court noted that an order by the sentencing judge which purported to either grant parole to a person serving a maximum sentence in excess of two years, or to deny parole to such a person, was beyond the authority of the sentencing court and was, therefore, a nullity. The court found that there was absolutely no basis in the law for applying &sect; 9757 so as to aggregate the &quot;back-time&quot; part of a county prison sentence with a subsequently imposed sentence so as to change the jurisdiction over re-parole.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant mother lived with her mother and step-father until she married.

Appellant and the child moved back to the house of appellee natural grandmother and step-grandfather, and later moved out. For over two years, appellees had little contact with the child. Then, appellees filed a petition, in a custody action commenced by the father, seeking grand-parental partial custody. The trial court issued an order adopting the custody counselor's recommendations that appellees be awarded partial physical custody of the child. The father's custody rights were not disputed. Appellant sought review, and the court affirmed the trial court's award of visitation rights to appellee natural grandmother, but reversed the order as to appellee step-grandfather, because the former had standing to bring an action, but the latter did not. The court held that the plain language of the Grandparents Visitation Act, 23 Pa. Const. Stat.

The agreement was immediately fulfilled by appellee husband's answering all questions asked of him by the police officers. Police later filed criminal complaints against appellees in disregard of the agreement. Counsel filed a motion to dismiss the charges against appellees based on the non-prosecution agreement. The trial court granted the motion and dismissed the charges. Upon appeal, the court affirmed the dismissal and concluded that the record supported the trial court's finding that a binding agreement had been entered by appellees and the police, and therefore, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in enforcing it. Appellees, in reliance on the agreement, divulged all information that the police requested, and during this process gave up the valued constitutional guarantee against self-incrimination. While the police, rather than the prosecutor, entered into this agreement, both appellees and their attorney were induced to believe that the police had full negotiating authority over the case and they detrimentally relied on that belief and the bargain that had been struck.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court reversed and remanded for a new trial because appellant was entitled to a jury instruction that appellee had the right to bring a second action if he developed future asbestos related injury. The court held that the evidence was sufficient because appellee established that he worked in the vicinity of the use of asbestos products manufactured by appellant. Because appellant waived its right to a 12 person jury under Pa. Const. art. I, &sect; 6, it consented to the procedure established by Phila., Pa., R. Civ. P. 1007.2 allowing trial to continue so long as at least 6 jurors remained in service. Thus, it was not error for the trial court to proceed with seven jurors after one of the original eight jurors was excused because of illness.

On appeal, the court affirmed the verdict and held that there was evidence that the victim's death had been caused by defendants' failure to provide the food and medical care as they agreed to do by oral contract. The court held that the evidence was sufficient for the jury to determine that this contract existed between the victim and defendants. The court held that the evidence did show that defendants' failure to provide the victim with food and medical care was willful and malicious. The court held that the trial court did not err in allowing the jury to see photographs depicting the decedent's nude body because its essential evidentiary value was greater that the likelihood of its inflaming the jury. The court held that testimony that defendants exerted political influence on the prosecuting attorney to avoid prosecution was not admitted in error because it tended to show consciousness of guilt. The court held that defendants' statement to police was correctly admitted because it was not coerced and they were not subjected to custodial interrogation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendants' conviction in the trial court because the evidence was sufficient to show that a contract existed between defendants and the victim, which obligated defendants to provide food and medical care for victim and his death was caused by defendants comply with the contract.

Money and cocaine were found in the bag, and the jury could infer defendant's control of the bag because he hid it. The court found no abuse of discretion in the trial court's refusal of the jury's request to re-read the officer's testimony, or in giving an instruction concerning the legal definition of possession instead, because the instruction was given in accordance with the standard instruction and took into account the testimonies of the officer and defendant. The court found that &sect; 7508 was not &quot;cruel and unusual&quot; on its face because the sentence and fine were proportionate to the gravity of the offense.

The court held that the constitutional issue already had been resolved.

A gas line was installed inside the premises to carry gas to the furnace. During this period appellant had exclusive control of the premises. At trial, appellant was convicted in a non-jury proceeding of one count of theft of services in violation of a local statute. On appeal, appellant challenged the sufficiency of the evidence, and a statutory presumption in the local law that a tampered measuring device created an inference that a person intended to receive utility service without compensation. On appeal, the court affirmed, finding the statute constitutional because it recognized that more that one person might be the beneficiary of service, and the evidence sufficient because of appellant's exclusive control of the premises, operation of a business thereon, and regular presence at the building.</SPAN></P>

The trial court instructed the jury that there was no relationship between the unit and the case. After an in camera review, the trial court did not let appellants' sociologist testify; he would have testified with regard to which magazines were acceptable to the average Pennsylvania adult. Appellants were convicted. The court affirmed the convictions, holding that the trial court did not err in failing to grant a mistrial, as the instruction that the case was not related to the organized crime unit would have dispelled any mistaken impressions reached by the jury, and that the trial court did not err in failing to allow the sociologist to testify, as his testimony would have provided little assistance to the jury in regard to the acceptance of the material by Pennsylvania residents.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A detainer was lodged against appellant for violation of his probation with Maryland. Appellant requested extradition, under the Uniform Interstate Agreement on Detainers, 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 9101 et seq. When appellant was not extradited, he filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus. The trial court denied the writ, finding that appellant had waived extradition as a condition of his probation in Maryland. Appellant argued that his institutional liberties were being restricted in violation of his due process rights, under the U.S. Constitution and Pa. Const. art. I, &sect; 11, and that his counsel was ineffective. The court affirmed the judgment on a different basis, holding that appellant's due process rights were not violated, as the ultimate consequence would be that the detainer based on the violation of probation charge would be replaced with a detainer on the re-imposed sentence, which would result in similar adverse effects on appellant's institutional treatment. Accordingly, appellant's counsel was not ineffective for failing to make the due process argument.</SPAN></P>

The ultimate consequence of extraditing appellant to satisfy the detainer would be the replacement of the probation detainer with a detainer for the re-imposed underlying sentence.</SPAN></P>

Appellant's challenge claimed that physical evidence was improperly seized at his business without probable cause; the action under &sect; 4730 was not commenced within the time required by 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 5553(a); the law did not permit prosecution under both a general provision and special provision prohibiting the same type of conduct; and definitions in &sect; 4107(a)(4) were unconstitutionally vague. The court vacated the summary offenses under &sect; 4730, but otherwise affirmed. There was probable cause for an officer to search appellant's business establishment, so admission of evidence seized was proper. Appellant could be prosecuted under both the general provision in &sect; 4107 and special provisions in 4730(a), as the former contained elements not in the latter. However, conviction was reversed as to summary offenses under 4730 for failure to prosecute within 30 days of discovery, as required by &sect; 5553(a).

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a lower court's dismissal of his third petition for relief under the Post Conviction Relief Act. Defendant was convicted of first degree murder and rape and sentenced to life imprisonment. Subsequent to his conviction, defendant initiated numerous post conviction proceedings. The court affirmed the lower court's dismissal of defendant's third petition for relief because it determined that under the applicable statute,&nbsp;18 P.S. &sect; 4701, repealed and recodified at 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. &sect; 1102, under the clear wording of the statute, the sentencing court could not sentence a first degree murderer to a lesser term. The court found that the applicable statute clearly and unambiguously required the sentencing court to sentence defendant to life imprisonment, notwithstanding evidence of aggravating or mitigating circumstances. The court further determined that defendant had not been denied his right to equal protection under the law because all offenders in noncapital first-degree murder cases were given the same punishment: the removal of the offender from society for the remainder of his life.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury convicted appellant parents of murder in the third degree, recklessly endangering another person, and endangering the welfare of children. All charges stemmed from the starvation death of their 14-year-old son, and the malnutrition of their 12-year-old daughter. On appeal, appellants contended that the trial court erred in permitting the prosecution to ask questions during voir dire which challenged appellants' religious beliefs on tithing. The court disagreed, finding probing necessary in order to determine whether a prospective juror was predisposed to disregard any jury instruction pertaining to potential defenses. Appellants further argued that the trial court erred in failing to instruct the jury that if the jury found the children to be of sufficient intellect and maturity and to have voluntarily refrained from eating based on their religious beliefs, then they must conclude that appellants did not have a legal duty to provide food. The court held that even if the children were considered mature enough to freely exercise their religious beliefs, this did not dispel appellants' duty to provide them with parental care, direction and sustenance. The court affirmed.</SPAN></P>

The mere fact that the trial court did not inquire into appellant's ability to pay was irrelevant to the question of whether the fine was excessive. The proper question for a violation of art. I, &sect; 13 was whether the fine was irrational or unreasonable and there was nothing within the legislature's decision to impose a mandatory fine that was irrational or unreasonable. There was no evidence to suggest that art. I, &sect; 13 was offended when those properly and justly convicted of drug dealing were sentenced to pay for the price they cost society.</SPAN></P>

The trial court granted protection from abuse orders against both appellant and appellee. When appellant's post trial motions were denied, she sought review. The court held that the trial court had no authority to grant appellee relief under the PFA Act because no hearing was set within the mandatory 10-day window of &sect; 6107(a). The trial court did not abuse its discretion by issuing an exclusion order of only two-weeks' duration against appellee because the trial court could have concluded from the conflicting testimony given by appellant and appellee that two weeks was sufficient. The court vacated that portion of the order pertaining to appellee's protection from appellant's abuse and affirmed the remainder of the order.</SPAN></P>

Cons. Stat. &sect; 1547(c)(1) and 67 Pa. Code. &sect; 74.24(d).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant pleaded guilty to two counts of homicide by motor vehicle related to driving while under the influence of alcohol in violation of 75 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 3735. The trial court entered a judgment of sentence, which appellant challenged on the grounds that the mandatory minimum sentences under the statute were unconstitutional because they deprived the prosecution of the discretion to request the court not to impose the mandatory sentence. The court held that, although it was the judiciary's function to impose sentences upon conviction, this function was not unconstitutionally violated by the mandatory sentencing provisions of &sect; 3735. The court held that it was for the legislature to establish criminal sanctions, and, as one of its options, it could prescribe a mandatory minimum term of imprisonment. The court noted that the prosecutor was vested with considerable discretion in deciding who will or will not be charged and with what. By determining in the first instance whether or not to initiate a prosecution based on &sect; 3735, the prosecutor retained his prosecutorial discretion in enforcing the criminal laws. Accordingly, there were no constitutional infirmities in &sect; 3735.</SPAN></P>

Appellant argued that the mandatory sentence violated his constitutional rights and that the lower court abused its jurisdiction by disregarding the plea bargain.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant had pleaded guilty on consolidated cases to involuntary deviate sexual intercourse, corruption of minors, and possession of obscene and other sexual material and performances. Appellant was sentenced with an aggregate term. Appellant then filed motions to withdraw his guilty plea and to modify sentence, which were both denied. The court found that appellant's claim that a mandatory minimum sentence was unconstitutional was meritless. The court found that the imposition of a mandatory five-year minimum prison term was not cruel or unusual, because of the nature of the crime involved here. Appellant then contended abuse of discretion by disregarding the plea bargain. The court affirmed rejecting this argument because the trial court had engaged in an exhaustive review of the case's mitigating and aggravating factors, as well as the applicable law. The trial court then imposed the minimum sentence prescribed by law and, in accordance with the previous agreement between the commonwealth and appellant, ran all the sentences concurrently. Thus the trial court followed the plea agreement and did not abuse its discretion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Commonwealth appealed the judgment of sentence imposed by the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County, Criminal Division (Pennsylvania), after appellee was found guilty of three counts of robbery, conspiracy and possessing an instrument of crime.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the trial court sentenced appellee, the Commonwealth appealed the judgment of sentence.

Although the trial court convicted appellee of robbery, conspiracy and possessing an instrument of crime, it attempted to avoid this verdict by failing to enhance appellee's sentence for possession of the instrument. The record supported no other conclusion than that appellee &quot;possessed&quot; a deadly weapon within the meaning of Pa. Const. Stat. &sect; 2154(b). Uncontradicted evidence established that appellee at all times either had a gun on his person or within his immediate physical control.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of a judgment of the Court of Common Pleas, Criminal Division, Philadelphia County (Pennsylvania), sentencing her to serve a five-year mandatory minimum sentence of imprisonment for attempting to kill her estranged husband with a firearm.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of aggravated assault, simple assault, possession of an instrument of crime, and reckless endangerment of another person. Appellant's own admission indicated that she had intended to kill her estranged husband by pointing a gun at his head and pulling the trigger. The issue was whether the sentence appellant received for aggravated assault violated her constitutional rights. The court affirmed appellant's five-year mandatory sentence of imprisonment because it was not so disproportionate to the crime that it constituted cruel and unusual punishment. The seriousness of the crime with which appellant was convicted could not be questioned, and the mandatory five-year minimum sentence for offenses committed with firearms had repeatedly withstood constitutional challenge. In addition, appellant's equal protection and due process challenges were without merit.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Eight defendants appealed their convictions for first-degree murder, criminal conspiracy, and possession of an instrument of crime, which arose from their involvement in La Cosa Nostra and the killing of an individual. In pertinent part the court reversed the judgments of sentence and remanded the case for a new trial because the court found that the change in plea of one of the defendants may have resulted in the Commonwealth's intrusion into the defense's strategies and that there was a very real likelihood of prejudice to the remaining defendants. The court found that evidence of Mafia relationships was so detailed as to provide that as a requirement of becoming an initiated member, one had to participate in a killing. This evidence, along with the testimony that defendants were made members was prejudicial error for certain of the defendants and lacked probative value. The court found that the trial court abused its discretion in refusing defense counsels' request for a mistrial as a result of the prosecution referring to the defendants as &quot;wolves&quot; because the comments exceeded the bounds of propriety and constituted an appeal to the passions and prejudices of the jury.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was arrested after a police officer observed behavior on the part of appellant that indicated he was involved in drug trafficking. Appellant was convicted of possession with intent to deliver cocaine and possession of cocaine. Appellant challenged the conviction contending his motion to suppress should not have been denied, there was insufficient evidence to sustain the conviction, and the trial court erred in sentencing him without allowing him to present evidence as to actual amount of possession. The court found no seizure within the U.S. Const. amend IV had taken place at the time appellant discarded the clothes containing the cocaine; therefore, the cocaine was not fruits of an unlawful seizure of appellant, which was properly admitted. The court further concluded the totality of the circumstances allowed the jury to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that appellant possessed the cocaine with the intent to deliver it. The court further concluded appellant's sentencing argument was without merit because his denial of culpability was not properly raised at sentencing stage as a jury had already convicted him of possession.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of sentence of the trial court finding that there was no seizure under the Fourth Amendment at the time when appellant discarded clothing containing cocaine and that the motion to suppress was properly denied. The jury was allowed to conclude drugs were possessed with the intent to deliver and denial of culpability to lessen sentencing minimum guidelines was inappropriate as jury had convicted him of possession.</SPAN></P>

The tapes were made through the use of an improvised interception system consisting of an electronic baby monitor and tape recorder that was surreptitiously installed by appellee's girlfriend in the apartment where she resided with appellee. The court held that the recordation of the parties' conversation in the apartment constituted an illegal interception pursuant to 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 5702 and 5703.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff widows filed a Workmen's Compensation/Occupational Disease Petition against their husbands' employer. This petition alleged that decedents were exposed to asbestos-containing products that ultimately caused the lifetime disability or death of plaintiffs' husbands. The referee determined that plaintiffs' husbands' deaths were not occupationally related. Plaintiff widows also filed a civil action against defendant manufacturers. Following the referee's decision, defendants filed a motion for summary judgment which asserted that plaintiffs were collaterally estopped from asserting their claim. The trial court granted the motion, and plaintiffs appealed. The court affirmed the decision of the trial court because the court held that the trial court did not err or commit an abuse of discretion in granting defendants' motion for summary judgment since the referee's findings in the case were entitled to collateral estoppel effect.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of possession with intent to deliver a controlled substance. Appellant challenged his three to six year sentence and asserted that the trial court erred in basing its application of the mandatory sentencing statute,&nbsp;18 P.S. &sect; 7508(a)(3)(i), on the total mixture of cocaine and other non-controlled substances found in his possession. Appellant also argued that &sect; 7508(a)(3)(i) was unconstitutional. The court affirmed because the trial court properly used the total weight of the mixture to determine whether a mandatory minimum sentence should be imposed under &sect; 7508(a)(3)(i). There was a rational basis for the classification drawn under &sect; 7508(a)(3)(i) because the legislature knew that cocaine was generally marketed in a diluted state, and an individual in possession of a larger quantity was more likely to be a dealer. Even if a statute was imprecise, a person who was given fair warning that his conduct was criminal in nature had no standing to complain that other persons who engaged in a different course of conduct may not constitutionally be prosecuted to the same extent under that statute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant employee sought review of a decision of the Court of Common Pleas of Wyoming County (Pennsylvania), which sustained appellee employer, rehabilitation services, and individuals' preliminary objections to appellant's causes of action for tortious conduct arising from her claim under the Worker's Compensation Act, 77 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. &sect; 1 et seq.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's order sustaining appellee employer and rehabilitation services' preliminary objections to appellant employee's cause of action arising from her claim under the Worker's Compensation Act (act), 77 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. &sect; 1 et seq., because the act's exclusivity provision, 77 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. &sect; 481, barred civil actions based on intentional torts which proceeded from work-related injuries. Appellant's claim was not viable under the Pennsylvania Human Relations Act, 43 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 951 et seq., because that statute covered only non-job related handicaps. The court held that it was appellant's injury and refusal to cooperate with appellee employer's unreasonable demands which resulted in the vindictive, malicious, and persecutory treatment she received, which while appalling, was job-related and, therefore, her intentional tort claims could not be raised independent of the act. Appellant's civil conspiracy claim was insufficient to satisfy the applicable standard for pleading. Finally, the fact that the act could be altered by the legislature did not affect the constitutional validity of the exclusivity provision.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's order sustaining appellee employer, rehabilitation services, and individuals' preliminary objections to appellant's causes of action for tortious conduct arising from her prior worker's compensation claim, because the exclusivity provision of the worker's compensation act precluded her assertion of those claims.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the documents were not privileged because they did not involve communication between priest and penitent.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was a religious instructor for a well known organization and assaulted young children who attended his classes. He pleaded guilty to seven counts of involuntary deviate sexual intercourse and in exchange, the commonwealth agreed to nol pros remaining charges. On review, appellant argued both that his sentence was manifestly excessive and that it violated U.S. Const. amend. VIII. The court affirmed the sentence and found that the trial court deviated from sentencing guidelines based upon the grave consequences of appellant's actions on his victims, the fact that appellant utilized his position as a religious instructor to gain access to his victims, and the continuing nature of appellant's crimes. Because the trial court had a presentence report, the court presumed that it considered each factor outlined by appellant. The court held that appellant's sentence was not disproportionate to sentences imposed for less reprehensible criminal behavior and that he did not prove other jurisdictions were more lenient and his constitutional challenged failed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged his conviction and sentence in the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County (Pennsylvania), for promoting prostitution, corrupting a minor, solicitation to commit prostitution, and solicitation to commit involuntary deviate sexual intercourse. Appellant alleged ineffective assistance of counsel, insufficiency of the evidence, and that the trial court erred in permitting the commonwealth to amend the information.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant owned and operated a bar that was a sanctuary to numerous &quot;prostitutes and pimps,&quot; including a 14-year-old prostitute arrested for soliciting a police officer. The original information charged appellant with criminal solicitation to commit prostitution under 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 5902(a), a misdemeanor of the third degree. When the commonwealth was apprised of the age of the prostitute, and the acts that appellant allegedly committed or attempted to commit with her, the information was amended to charge appellant with criminal solicitation to commit involuntary deviate sexual intercourse pursuant to 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 3123. The court held that the amendments were properly permitted by the trial court because the separate counts were predicated on the same three incidents and on the same facts; required the same proof, and the same conduct supported both charges; and that the law allowed changes that involved offenses with different elements. Appellant failed to properly preserve his challenges to the sufficiency of the evidence for appeal.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs sought review of a jury verdict from the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County (Pennsylvania), awarding plaintiffs $ 170,000 in compensatory damages and $ 50,000 for loss of consortium for personal injuries suffered by plaintiff husband due to prolonged workplace asbestos exposure. Two defendants challenged the damage award as being excessive.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs challenged the amount of damages awarded by a jury for personal injuries plaintiff husband incurred from long-term asbestos exposure at his workplace. Plaintiffs appealed the trial court's denial of their motion for delay damages and sought an additur after receiving $ 170,000 in compensatory damages and $ 50,000 for loss of consortium. Two defendants cross-appealed, arguing that the damage award was excessive and seeking a remittitur. On appeal, the court held that plaintiffs had timely filed their motion for delay damages pursuant to Pa. R. Civ. P. 238(a)-(c). The compensatory damage award, although considerably lower than plaintiffs' prayer, was a viable compromise amount and not subject to additur. Defendants were not entitled to a new trial on the issues of remittitur or delay damages because the jury award was not excessive. Because there was no evidence permitting the jury to apportion the damage award, the trial court correctly declined to instruct on the issue of comparative fault. Delay damages were appropriate on plaintiffs' loss of consortium claim. The court reversed the trial court's denial of plaintiffs' motion for delay damages but otherwise affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court's denial of plaintiffs' motion for delay damages because plaintiffs timely filed that motion within 10 days of the jury's liability finding against defendants. The court otherwise denied defendants' appeal and affirmed the jury's compensatory and loss of consortium awards, permitting delay damages but not additur or remittitur.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The commonwealth appealed an order of the Court of Common Pleas of Delaware County (Pennsylvania), which granted defendant's pretrial motion to preclude the commonwealth from proceeding with the instant murder prosecution as a capital case on the ground that the commonwealth failed to establish the existence of an aggravating circumstance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The commonwealth challenged the trial court's order granting defendant's motion to preclude the commonwealth from seeking the death penalty and holding that the commonwealth failed to establish the existence of an aggravating circumstance. The court reversed the trial court's order and remanded the cause because the trial court had no authority to make a pretrial determination of the presence or absence of aggravating circumstances in a trial for murder. The court ruled that the prosecution did not abuse its discretion in considering the aggravating circumstance enumerated in 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 9711(d)(7), that defendant created a grave risk of death to others in addition to the victim. The court held that the order was reversible also on the ground that the trial court erred in compelling a deputy district attorney to testify, without any offer of proof or legal basis from the defense, regarding procedures used by the district attorney in evaluating murder cases for presentation as capital or noncapital offenses, and in making a baseless finding concerning a lack of aggravating circumstances where no evidence was presented on that issue.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged the judgment of the Court of Common Pleas, Westmoreland County (Pennsylvania), which sentenced him following convictions for arson, 18 Pa.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of arson, risking a catastrophe, and criminal mischief for setting fire to a building where his wife was playing bingo. The commonwealth filed a challenge to the discretionary aspect of the sentence. The court affirmed and denied the commonwealth's appeal under 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 9781(b), which required a substantial question. The court found that the state merely requested the court to substitute its judgment for that of the sentencing court. The court found that defendant's argument that setting the building on fire was not an attempted violence on his spouse, who was inside the structure, was frivolous. Therefore, the trial court appropriately held that the spouse's testimony was required under 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 5913. Further, defendant's counsel was not ineffective for failure to raise the claim of spousal privilege. The trial court did not err when it admitted testimony about defendant trying to stab his son after the fire in the presence of his wife because it was indicative of malice toward the wife and defendant's state of mind that evening. Further, any prejudicial effect of the evidence was minimized by the court's cautionary instructions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the trial court sentencing defendant for arson, risking a catastrophe, and criminal mischief was affirmed because the trial court did not err in admitting testimony regarding defendant's conduct after the crime, the testimony of his spouse fell within the exception to the privilege, counsel was not ineffective, and there was sufficient evidence. The court denied the commonwealth's appeal because there was no substantial question.</SPAN></P>

The court next determined that the failure to grant appellant's motion for a change of venue or venire was not improper because this issue was within the sound discretion of the trial court and there was no abuse of discretion. The court found that there was no error in the trial court's rulings regarding qualifications or bias of jurors who served or were not excused for cause. The court found that appellant's failure to deny an allegation of impropriety was properly admitted as an implied admission of the truth. The court concluded by finding no error in the jury charge issued by the trial court and upholding the sentence imposed which included restitution to a government entity.

The trial court denied appellant's petition to reassess damages to include the additional amount, finding that appellant was precluded from amending the judgment which appellees had satisfied in full. The court affirmed the order, rejecting appellant's assertion that, based on an alleged Allegheny County custom, its letters to the sheriff were sufficient to increase the amount owed by appellees.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee was suspected of killing his wife after a nurse alerted authorities of suspicious circumstances. As a result of the tip, police obtained search warrants which resulted in the culmination of evidence against appellee, the husband. The lower court suppressed all evidence and the state sought review. On appeal, the court examined the warrants and the circumstances. The court observed that one of the search warrants was invalid because it failed to identify any crime which had been committed and it did not particularly describe the property for which the warrant had been issued. However, the court held that evidence seized from appellee's home was lawfully obtained by police pursuant to appellee's voluntary consent. The court found that evidence obtained via inspection of an electrical system, a recreation of appellee's version of his wife's death, and the taking of photos and video of the home were properly authorized by search warrants. The court did agree and affirm the suppression of certain documentary evidence which consisted of personal effects that did not constitute evidence of the commission of a crime.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant alleged father challenged an order of the Court of Common Pleas of Cambria County (Pennsylvania), that directed appellant to pay appellee mother child support for the child at issue, who was born out of wedlock.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In this proceeding for the support of a child born out of wedlock to appellee mother, the trial court entered an order directing appellant alleged father to pay support. The judgment was reversed because the record was clear that there had been neither an adjudication of paternity, nor an acknowledgement by appellant that he was the father of the child. The court held that the obligation of a parent to support his or her child was an unwavering one, and one parent was not permitted to contract away the right of his or her child to seek support from the other parent. Appellant was correct, however, that before he could be compelled to contribute to the support of the child born out of wedlock, there should have been a determination that he was the father of the child. Appellant was also correct that there had been no such determination in this case. The lump sum settlement could not be deemed a legally binding acknowledgement of paternity. Appellant had consistently denied that he was the father of the child born to appellee, and the record made at the time of the lump sum settlement contained no admission of paternity.</SPAN></P>

Appellant sought review, contending that in view of her age of 66 and of her physical ailments, including hypertension and heart and pulmonary conditions, the sentence was in effect a life sentence and constituted cruel and unusual punishment in violation of U.S. Const. amend.

It held that the incarceration of physically infirm individuals did not per se constitute cruel and unusual punishment, and that in light of the legislature's intent to impose mandatory minimum sentences for the crime of which appellant was convicted, the sentence was not disproportionate and did not constitute cruel and unusual punishment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of a sentence from the Court of Common Pleas, Montgomery County (Pennsylvania), which imposed concurrent terms for possession of controlled substances, possession of controlled substances with the intent to deliver, and conspiracy. Because the offense of possession with intent to deliver was committed within 1,000 feet of a school, the court added 12 months to the sentence pursuant to 204 Pa. Cons. Ann. &sect; 303.9(c)(2).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court convicted appellant of possession of controlled substances, 35 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. &sect; 780-113(a)(16); possession of controlled substances with the intent to deliver, 35 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. &sect; 780-113(a)(30); and conspiracy. Appellant received three concurrent sentences. The trial court found that it was compelled, pursuant to the enhancement provision of 204 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. &sect; 303.9(c)(2), to add 12 months to the sentence for possession with intent to deliver because the offense was committed within 1,000 feet of a school. On appeal, the court affirmed in part, vacated in part, and remanded for resentencing. The court held that the crimes of possession and possession with intent to deliver should have been merged for sentencing purposes. Concluding that the trial court had imposed an illegal sentence, the court vacated the sentence for possession. The court found that the trial court erred in treating the enhancement provision as mandatory. Accordingly, the court also vacated the sentence for possession with intent to deliver. The court rejected appellant's argument that tit. 204, &sect; 303.9(c)(2) required proof of intent to be within 1,000 feet of a school.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged the judgment of sentence from the Court of Common Pleas of Delaware County (Pennsylvania), Criminal Division that sentenced him for rape as a recidivist under 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9714 although he had not been convicted of the first rape when he committed the second one. Appellant claimed that his counsel was ineffective for not objecting to the enhancement of his sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant raped two different women within one hour of each other. As a result, appellant was convicted of the first rape and pled guilty to the second rape. The trial court sentenced appellant as a recidivist for the second rape under 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9714 and used the first rape in calculating appellant's sentence under the guidelines. On appeal, the court held that because appellant had not been convicted of the first rape at the time he committed his second rape, the first rape could not be used as an enhancer under &sect; 9714. However, the trial court could consider the prior rape in fashioning the sentence. Because the trial court indicated that it used the sentencing guidelines as guidance in determining appellant's sentence, the use of the first rape to calculate appellant's sentence prejudiced him. However, because there was no hearing to determine why appellant's counsel failed to object to the sentence, the court vacated the sentence and remanded the case for an evidentiary hearing on appellant's ineffective assistance of counsel claim, for a new sentencing hearing if counsel was ineffective, or reimposition of the sentence if counsel was effective.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court vacated defendant's sentence for rape and remanded the case for an evidentiary hearing to determine if appellant's counsel was effective. The court held that because appellant was not convicted of his first rape before he committed the second one, the first rape could not enhance his sentence. If appellant's counsel was found to be ineffective for not objecting to the enhancement, appellant was entitled to a new sentencing hearing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of the order from the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County (Pennsylvania), which convicted appellant of possession with intent to deliver cocaine, possession of cocaine, and possession of drug paraphernalia, and sentenced appellee to the mandatory minimum sentence of four years in prison.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee was convicted of possession with intent to deliver cocaine, possession of cocaine, and possession of drug paraphernalia. Appellee was then sentenced to the mandatory minimum sentence of four years in prison. Thereafter, appellee filed a motion to modify sentence, which the trial court granted, and sentenced appellee to one to three years in prison. Appellant sought the court's review. The court held that under 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. &sect; 7508(a)(3)(iii), which contained the mandatory sentence for drug trafficking, a person who was convicted of drug offenses, where the drug was cocaine, had to be sentenced to a mandatory minimum term of imprisonment of four years in prison. Further, there was no authority in any court to impose on an offender to which &sect; 7508 applied a lesser sentence that the sentence provided under &sect; 7508(a)(3)(iii). Here, the facts clearly revealed that appellee possessed the intent to deliver in excess of 100 grams of cocaine. Therefore, it was error for the trial court, for whatever reason, to impose a sentence less than that mandated by &sect; 7508(a)(3)(iii). Judgment of sentence vacated and case remanded for resentencing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Order imposing sentence upon appellee was reversed and the case remanded for resentencing where the trial court erred in sentencing appellee to a sentence that was less than the statutory mandatory sentence following appellee's drug trafficking conviction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The commonwealth appealed a judgment of sentence from the Court of Common Pleas, Criminal Division, Philadelphia County (Pennsylvania) that declined to apply the deadly weapon enhancement, 204 Pa. Code &sect; 303.4, to the guideline sentence range for robbery in the first-degree, where the offenses were committed at knifepoint. The commonwealth urged that &sect; 303.4 did not implicate double jeopardy, and was not discretionary.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee committed three robberies, in violation of 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 3701, using a knife. As the trial court concluded that the use of a knife elevated the robberies to first-degree felonies carrying enhanced sentences, it declined to apply the guideline enhancement for use of a deadly weapon, 204 Pa. Code &sect; 303.4, on the theory that this constituted two punishments for the same offense and violated the double jeopardy provisions of U.S. Const. amend. V and Pa. Const. art. I, &sect; 10. In vacating the sentence imposed and remanding for resentencing, the court pointed out several errors in the trial court's reasoning. The court first noted jurisdiction, holding that that the appeal complied with Pa. R. App. P. 2119(f) and 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 9781(b). On the merits, the court explained that robbery could be a first-degree felony without the use of a deadly weapon. Moreover, where a deadly weapon was used, the triggering of the &sect; 303.4 enhancement provision was not a double punishment but only a requirement that the guideline sentence range be increased. Finally, consideration of &sect; 303.4 was mandatory, not discretionary, although discretion existed to fix the ultimate sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court vacated appellee's judgment of sentence and remanded for resentencing. The trial court erred in declining to consider the deadly weapon enhancement for application to the guideline sentence range, as consideration of the enhancement was mandatory. Application of the enhancement was not double jeopardy, as it merely increased the guideline sentence range where a deadly weapon had been used.</SPAN></P>

Cons Stat. &sect; 2502(b), the court affirmed, concluding that the trial court did not err in the conviction and life sentence. Appellant asserted that was error to admit the testimony of a forensic criminologist. The court concluded that microscopic hair comparison evidence satisfied the Frye standard. The criminologist's testimony was relevant insofar as it was more probative than prejudicial. It did not mislead, prejudice or confuse the jury but gave a demonstrable accepted form of tying appellant to the crime. The court further held that prosecuting a defendant after investigative delay did not deprive him of due process even if the defense was somewhat prejudiced by the lapse of time. Also, counsel could permissibly impeach his own witness on a plea of surprise when the witness gave testimony which was contradictory to statements which the witness had made earlier and were harmful to the party calling the witness while beneficial to the opposing side. In addition, the courts were liberal in allowing a party to cross-examine his own witness when it was believed that the interests of truth and justice required it.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of a judgment rendered by the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County (Pennsylvania) that convicted him of cruelty to animals in violation of 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. &sect; 5511(h.1).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">During a search of appellant's residence, police discovered roosters in cages that were groomed for cock fighting. Appellant was convicted of cruelty to animals in violation of 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. &sect; 5511. On appeal, appellant claimed that the delegation of police power to animal welfare agents under &sect; 5511 to initiate felony proceedings, to make arrests, and to seize and destroy forfeited property was unconstitutional. The court noted that the involvement of the animal welfare agents was peripheral to an undisputedly valid search warrant. The court therefore held that appellant was without standing to complain about &sect; 5511's investigation and arrest provisions because he failed to show that he was injured. Appellant also argued that &sect; 5511 was preempted by a federal statute,&nbsp;7 U.S.C.S. &sect; 2156. The court disagreed, holding that Congress did not intend to pre-empt completely the field of animal fighting legislation. Finally, appellant asserted that &sect; 5511 was unconstitutionally vague and overbroad. The court concluded that appellant lacked standing to challenge the statute's overbreadth because his conduct clearly fell within its prohibitions. The court affirmed the judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of sentence because it held that appellant was without standing to challenge the constitutionality of a state animal cruelty statute and that the statute was not preempted by federal legislation.</SPAN></P>

Appellant contended the statute of limitations contained in 23 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. &sect; 4343(b) barred appellee alleged daughter from such samples because of a failure to take any action to establish paternity within 18 years of her birthdate. The court rejected the argument and affirmed the order. The court explained the statute of limitations for establishing paternity for purposes of child support was inapplicable to the present case where paternity would be the basis for intestate succession. The court determined the right to inherit was reserved exclusively to the Probate, Estates, and Fiduciaries Code, 20 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2101 et seq. (Supp. 1990). The court further noted the standard for proving a right to intestate succession was clear and convincing evidence and the tests might conclusively eliminate the deceased as appellee's father.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of his driving under influence conviction under Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. &sect; 3731(a), in favor of appellee state, based on numerous urged errors. The court rejected the argument that the evidence was insufficient to support the verdict when the jury was free to discredit appellant's claim that he consumed the beer that raised his blood alcohol level while waiting for aid for his broken down car. The court noted the record showed several alcohol cans in the car, appellant was found slumped over the wheel, the keys were in the ignition, and he failed a blood alcohol test forty-five minutes after he was found. The court next rejected the argument that appellee state failed to bring him to trial within speedy trial limits. The court explained that where the state despite due diligence could not bring appellant to trial because of complex pre-trial motions filed by appellant, its failure to do so did not entitle appellant to a discharge. The court noted although the record revealed trial was held over for two years, pending pre-trial defense trial motions prevented the case from being tried on time. The court found blood tests were properly admitted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed appellant's conviction, in favor of appellee state, because sufficient evidence was presented to support verdict of driving under the influence when appellant was operating the vehicle although he was not driving it, blood alcohol tests were properly admitted, and appellee's failure to bring him to trial within speedy trial limits was excused when based upon complex defense pre-trial motions.</SPAN></P>

Cons. Stat. &sect; 8305(a).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant mother brought a negligence action against appellees, hospital and doctors, asserting that if appropriate diagnostic procedures had been performed during her pregnancy, enabling her to learn that her unborn child was afflicted with Down's syndrome, she would have terminated the pregnancy and chosen not to undergo a tubal ligation. After the trial court struck portions of appellant's complaint for stating a wrongful birth claim, which was prohibited by 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 8305(a), appellant challenged. In reversing, the court held that the application of &sect; 8305(a) to appellant's claim was unconstitutional because appellant's cause of action accrued on March 8, 1984, more than four years before the promulgation and effective date of &sect; 8305(a). The court stated that because a cause of action in tort accrued on the date of the accident or injury, appellant's cause of action accrued on March 8, 1984, the date on which the allegedly wrongful birth of her son occurred. The court noted that &sect; 8305(a) could not have been applied retroactively to extinguish a right of action that had already accrued to appellant.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed and remanded the trial court's order that barred appellant mother's cause of action for wrongful birth pursuant to statutory law because the trial court's application of such law was unconstitutionally retrospective in that appellant's cause of action for wrongful birth accrued on the date of her son's birth, four years prior to the statute's effective date.</SPAN></P>

A search warrant was issued for the bookstore. The marked bills given to the dancers were recovered, along with drug paraphernalia found in one dancer's purse and the bookstore owner's briefcase. The first dancer was convicted of prostitution, the second dancer of prostitution and drug possession, and the owner of promoting prostitution and drug possession. The court reversed all the convictions relating to prostitution. The court held that self-masturbation for hire without any physical contact between performer and viewer was not the type of conduct intended to come within the purview of 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. &sect; 5902(a). However, the court affirmed the drug convictions. The court held that the search warrant was valid and based on personal observations of the police. The court held that the purse and briefcase were properly subject to search under the warrant. The court held that the drugs were in plain view in the purse and briefcase.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury convicted appellant of one count of rape. He filed timely post-trial motions which were denied and thereafter the trial court imposed sentence. Appellant sought review of the judgment of sentence, raising 10 issues for review. Upon review, the court concluded that appellant's claim, regarding the quashing of his subpoena duces tecum to a rape crisis center where the rape victim received counseling, was meritorious and required vacatur of his judgment of sentence. The court agreed with appellant's claims that it was erroneous for the trial court to refuse to conduct an in camera review of the file concerning the rape victim and for the trial court to preclude appellant from reviewing, or questioning the director of the center about, the victim's file. The court also agreed that the trial court's actions contravened the mandates of certain case law. Appellant sought only the victim's center records. The court concluded, therefore, that 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 5945.1 was inapplicable. The court vacated the judgment of sentence and remanded the case with instructions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant hospital sought review of judgment imposing delay damages under state Supreme Ct. R. 238, in favor of appellees, in a malpractice suit based on several challenges to the validity of the rule. The court affirmed the imposition of such damages. The court rejected the argument that the rule deprived a defendant of property without due process of law. The court explained a defendant was not subject to such damages unless the ultimate jury award ultimately exceeded his written settlement offer by more than 125 percent. The court reasoned the fact of whether a plaintiff refused to make a reasonable demand was irrelevant to the issue of whether a defendant's offer was adequate. The court next rejected the contention that the rule was in excess of the state supreme court's authority because it affected substantive rights. The court noted the real purpose of the rule was a procedural device to encourage prompt settlement and to unclutter the court system , yet it did nonetheless have a substantive effect on parties' rights. The court explained such incidental effect upon substantive rights could not alone render the rule unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

The court quashed her appeal of the first order as untimely and improper because it was a non-final order. The court affirmed the second order and held that the support agreement merged into the divorce decree and was subject to modification. The court noted that the support agreement was not a detailed contract; was entered into in contemplation of the divorce decree; and was silent on the issue of modification. The court was also reluctant to hold that the agreement was not modifiable where the trial court had previously used its vast powers of contempt and attachment to enforce the support order at appellant's request and cited the principle of judicial estoppel as support for denying appellant's claim.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant inmate was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to death. His sentence was subsequently vacated and a sentence of life imprisonment imposed. In a fourth petition seeking post-conviction relief appellant claimed ineffective assistance of counsel on his third post-conviction petition, claiming that counsel failed to specifically seek retroactive application of a jury instruction. The court affirmed the order of the trial court because the retroactive application of a United States Supreme Court decision to an alleged unconstitutional jury instruction had been previously litigated by appellant's counsel on his third petition for post-conviction relief. Since appellant's claim had been previously litigated, the court held that no miscarriage of justice could have occurred which would now warrant the entertainment of appellant's fourth application for post-conviction relief. The court further held that appellant's argument that he had been denied due process of law at trial was waived because appellant had never raised this issue until this review by the court.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged the constitutionality of the Court of Common Pleas of Monroe County's (Pennsylvania) judgment of sentence, which imposed a 90-day driver's license suspension based upon underaged appellant's conviction for possession of an alcoholic beverage. Appellant contended that 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 6310.4 (1990) violated his substantive due process rights and the prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, who was underaged, was convicted of possession of an alcoholic beverage under 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 6308 (1983) and the trial court suspended his driver's license for 90-days pursuant to 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 6310.4 (1990). Appellant challenged the constitutionality of &sect; 6310.4 on both substantive due process and cruel and unusual punishment grounds. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment of sentence and stated that the imposition of &sect; 6310.4 had not violated appellant's constitutional rights. The court stated that &sect; 6310.4 was rationally related to the state's goals of deterrence and punishment of underaged drinking and that the imposition of &sect; 6310.4 was a more effective deterrent than a monetary fine. Accordingly, the court found that appellant's substantive due process rights were not violated. The court also concluded that the penalty imposed pursuant to &sect; 6310.4 was not cruel and unusual punishment because the penalty was not grossly disproportionate to the underlying offense and the general public's view that underaged possession and consumption of alcohol were serious offenses that required punishment capable of deterring future violations.</SPAN></P>

There was also no error in the court of common pleas' refusal to grant immunity to appellant's co-defendant in return for testimony.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, a brewing company, and appellee, a distributor, had an ongoing exclusive distribution agreement concerning appellant's beer. The legislature amended the Liquor Code, 47 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. &sect; 4-431(d)(1), to require the termination of such a distribution agreement to be with good cause. The trial court entered an injunction preventing appellant from terminating appellee as their distributor. The court affirmed. The court held that the Liquor Code was not a generic economic regulation of the relationship between contracting parties, but, rather, was an exercise of police power for the protection of the public welfare based upon the constitutional delegation to the states of plenary power to control the sale and use of alcoholic beverages. The court held said statute to be constitutional. The court held that the statute was both reasonable and rational under the commonwealth's police power. The court also held that the statute was not retroactively applied to appellant because appellant did not have a vested right to sell alcohol and the evidence indicated that appellant intended appellee to be the primary distributor under contract.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court upheld the injunction preventing appellant from terminating a distribution contract with appellee because the statute requiring liquor distribution contracts to be terminated only for good cause was constitutional and no good cause existed for the termination of appellee's contract.</SPAN></P>

Focusing solely on sentencing, appellant contended that the trial court abused its discretion and that his counsel was ineffective for failing to put forth mitigating factors for the trial court to consider. The court held that appellant's ineffective assistance of counsel claims did not relate to ineffectiveness which so undermined the truth determining process such that no reliable adjudication of guilt or innocence could have taken place, as required under 42 Pa.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was sentenced to a term of eight to 20 years imprisonment as a result of several convictions arising from his knife point sexual assault of a 12 year old girl. As a result of the assault, the child contracted gonorrhea. On appeal, appellant's allegations of error were deemed to be without merit and the judgment below was affirmed. Among other things, the court noted that statutorily privileged confidential medical records must have been disclosed to the Commonwealth in sexual abuse cases where the presence or absence of venereal disease was relevant to an issue at trial. The court also found that standard gonorrhea tests fell within the exception to the rule that medical opinions were not admissible as business records, but instead required live testimony by a qualified medical expert. With respect to the Rape Shield Law, the court found that appellant made no proffer whatsoever of an alternate explanation for victim's infection. Moreover, the court found that even if he had do so, it would not have precluded appellant as the actual source of the infection. The probative value of such evidence was minimal and the potential prejudice was high.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment sentencing appellant for the sexual assault of a 12 year old girl was affirmed, because there was no merit to appellant's issues regarding privacy claims pertaining to medical records subpoenaed in criminal trials, the admissibility of gonorrhea results under the business records exception to the hearsay rule, and the proper application of the Rape Shield statute.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was the counsel of record in a rape charge against an accused. On the second day of trial, the trial court ordered the defense to refrain from asking questions regarding the victim's prior sexual experiences, pursuant to the Rape Shield Law, 18 Pa. Cons.

Contending that his only intent was to determine the victim's tendency to fabricate her sexual involvement with others, appellant maintained that the statute violated the accused's constitutional right to confrontation of witnesses insofar as the statute prohibited admission of evidence demonstrating bias, prejudice, or which attacks the witness's credibility. Appellant was summarily convicted of contempt of court and was fined for the three questions to the victim.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An officer stopped defendant after he had broken into a residence.

Defendant was convicted of two counts of both robbery and aggravated assault and one count each of first-degree murder, burglary, theft, receiving stolen property, and possessing an instrument of crime. The trial court sentenced him to life imprisonment. On appeal defendant challenged the constitutionality of 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 314. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment, holding that &sect; 314's distinction between defendants who presented an insanity defense and those who did not was not violative of the equal protection clause of U.S. Const. amend.

After appellee administratrix brought a successful wrongful death action, appellant won a new trial as against appellee church only to determine its percentage of liability. The jury then set appellant's liability at 31.6 percent, and damages for delay were added at a rate of 10 percent interest. Appellant sought review but the court affirmed the judgment, finding that the jury instruction on the duty of care for the owner of a swimming pool was correct where it relied on the reasonable precautions that the owner should take as to foreseeable users of the pool. The court further found that the participation by appellee administratrix in the second trial was permissible and that the improper remark made by her counsel regarding the outcome of the first trial was properly cured by the trial court.

Appellee filed an application for admission into the Accelerated Rehabilitative Disposition (ARD), which application the district attorney for appellant Commonwealth denied. The trial court found that the district attorney abused his discretion, and ordered that appellee be admitted to the ARD program. The appellate court reversed, holding that the district attorney's decision not to admit appellee to the ARD was not an abuse of discretion, as it was based upon a general policy bearing some relationship to the protection of the public. Specifically, the district attorney had a policy of withholding ARD from any person charged with drunk driving who was involved in an accident with another occupied vehicle, regardless of fault. Facts that appellee had no prior contacts with the criminal justice system, was not at fault for the accident, and was recommended for the ARD program by the investigating officer, were irrelevant.</SPAN></P>

Appellant pleaded guilty to murder, but later withdrew the plea. Appellant also waived his right to a speedy trial. Appellant was convicted on all counts and he was sentenced to life imprisonment. Appellant claimed that his right to a speedy trial was violated because the trial court did not view the withdrawal of his guilty plea as triggering the period in which the prosecution had to bring him to trial. On appeal, the court found that appellant's rights were not violated because he was not prejudiced. The court held that a detailed description of appellant's past bizarre behavior was not relevant to his alleged diminished capacity at the time of the criminal act. Additionally, the court held that appellant's incriminating statements made after a knowing and voluntary waiver of Miranda rights were admissible because there was support in the record for the trial court's finding that appellant made he statements. The court also held that appellant waived his right to challenged the array of potential jurors because his objection was not in accordance with the procedure set out in Pa. R. Crim. P. 1104.

The court affirmed the conviction on appeal. The court held that through the filing of his pre-trial motion and subsequent appeals, defendant implicitly requested that trial be delayed until the issue was resolved since a favorable decision could eliminate the necessity of a criminal trial. For purposes of calculating the 180-day period, defendant was unavailable for trial for the period of time in which the issue of whether a physician would be appointed under 35 P.S. &sect; 780-118(a) was pending before the trial court as a pretrial motion. The period of time that defendant's prior appeal was pending before the court and the supreme court was also excludable. There was no violation of defendant's due process rights under the federal and state constitutions as disposition under 35 P.S. &sect; 780-118 was not a fundamental constitutional right.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant individual sought review of the decision of the Court of Common Pleas of Berks County (Pennsylvania) which seized his vehicle pursuant to the Controlled Substances Forfeiture Act, 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect;&sect; 6801 and 6802. Appellant argued that the seizure of his vehicle and subsequent forfeiture to the commonwealth violated various federal and state constitutional rights.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant individual and a passenger in his automobile were arrested and charged with possession of cocaine and various drug paraphernalia. The Commonwealth seized appellant's vehicle pursuant to the Controlled Substances Forfeitures Act (Act), 42 Pa. Const. Stat. &sect;&sect; 6801 and 6802. Appellant argued that the seizure of his vehicle and subsequent forfeiture violated various federal and state constitutional rights. The lower court decision was affirmed. The court held that the controlled substances were in &quot;plain view&quot; of the arresting officers and thus legally confiscated. Appellant's contention that the Act violated due process was without merit because appellant never raised the issue in the lower court. Appellant was not unconstitutionally denied a jury trial because the right to a jury trial in a forfeiture proceeding did not exist at the adoption of the state constitution. The forfeiture of appellant's vehicle pursuant to the Act was not an excessive penalty. The Act provided for the forfeiture of a vehicle that was used to facilitate the transport, sale, receipt, possession or concealment of drug paraphernalia and controlled substances, without regard to amount.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The lower court decision that ordered the seizure of appellant's vehicle pursuant to the controlled substances forfeitures act was affirmed. The court held, among other things, that the controlled substances were in &quot;plain view&quot; of the arresting officers and thus legally confiscated and forfeiture was not prohibited merely because many of the drugs possessed in the vehicle had been consumed or sold prior to the seizure.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff wife appealed an order and judgment that, in a successful suit brought by her and her husband to recover damages for husband's asbestos-related injuries and her loss of consortium, limited her recovery for loss of consortium to the date of husband's death. Defendant manufacturer, by cross-appeal, argued that delay damages were improperly predicated upon the loss of consortium claim because loss of consortium was not a claim &quot;for bodily injury, death, or property damage within the meaning of Pa. R. Civ. P. 238 (rule 238). The court affirmed the judgment and order. Regarding plaintiff's claim, the court ruled that plaintiff offered no compelling reason for departing from the traditional limitation that limited recovery for harm to her interests and expense incurred between the injury and death of her husband. In response to defendant's claim, the court ruled that because the loss of consortium claim was inextricably intertwined with husband's underlying personal injury action, and because the underlying purpose of rule 238 was to prevent unreasonable refusals to pay what was owed for tortious injury, in light of defendant's refusal to settle, rule 238 damages were proper.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed a judgment and order that awarded plaintiff wife damages for loss of consortium and awarding delay damages for the portion of the verdict that represented the recovery for loss of consortium. Plaintiff's damages for loss of consortium were properly not extended beyond the date of her husband's death. Delay damages were properly awarded because loss of consortium was a claim for bodily injury, death, or property damage.</SPAN></P>
