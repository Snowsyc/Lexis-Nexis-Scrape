</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayers did not fully answer the questions in the application they filed for the reduction of the assessment. Thus, the tax officer contended that the application was vitiated under City of Yonkers, N.Y., Local Law No. 8 of 1961, which provided that failure to fully answer the questions rendered the application null and void. The court disagreed. N.Y. Const. art. IX, &sect; 12 provided that no local law could be adopted which repealed or superseded any law enacted by the legislature relating to the making and review of assessments, unless authorized by the legislature. N.Y. City Home Rule Law &sect; 11(1), as amended by 1960 N.Y. Laws ch. 260, 1961 N.Y. Laws ch. 684, allowed the adoption of local laws concerning the correction of local tax assessments. The court held that N.Y. City Home Rule Law &sect; 11(1), as amended by 1960 N.Y. Laws ch. 260, 1961 N.Y. Laws ch. 684, and N.Y. Const. art. IX, &sect; 12, did not empower the city to affect the jurisdiction of the court to entertain a proceeding to review an assessment. Thus, City of Yonkers, N.Y., Local Law No. 8 of 1961, did not divest the court of its jurisdiction on the ground that the taxpayers failed to fill out the application properly.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff county filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings in its action against defendant city seeking a declaratory judgment establishing the unconstitutionality of 1959 N.Y. Laws ch. 657, which set forth procedures for the dissolution of the city's welfare district and the takeover by the county of all public assistance and welfare programs.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Legislature of the State of New York enacted 1959 N.Y. Laws ch. 657 (welfare law), which authorized both the city and county to dissolve the city's welfare district and to authorize the county to take over all public assistance and welfare programs. Although the city council passed a resolution urging the county's board of supervisors to accept the transfer of its public welfare programs, the county neither accepted nor rejected the proposal. The county created a special committee to study and report the feasibility and advisability of the proposal, and it filed an action against the city challenging the constitutionality of the welfare law. The county filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings. The court denied the motion and dismissed the county's complaint without prejudice. The court held that declaratory relief was not appropriate under N.Y. Civ. Prac. Act &sect; 473 and N.Y. R. Civ. Prac. 212 because the welfare law was not set in motion by resolutions of both the city and the county, and there was no bona fide justiciable controversy between the parties. The court held that it would not render an advisory opinion in advance of the happening of an event.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, the City of New York Department of Air Pollution and others, sought judgment on the pleadings dismissing the complaint for insufficiency, in an action presenting a question of whether plaintiff automobile painting business was subject to regulation by the City. The automobile painting business sought judgment on the pleadings on the ground that the denials raised by the answer and amended answer were insufficient.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that definitions of dust, fumes, odor and vapor as set out in the New York City, N.Y., Admin. Code were sufficiently clear and definite to give notice thereof and constituted adequate guides and standards for the Department of Air Pollution. The court also held that the auto painting business from which vapors escaped into the outer air was within the province and jurisdiction of the City of New York Department of Air Pollution. The court further held that provisions of the city charter and administrative code and rules and regulations concerning air pollution were not unconstitutional and invalid as applied to the paint spraying operation. Moreover, the court held that a failure to provide any administrative review did not render a legislative scheme of air pollution control and its implementation unconstitutional. The court reasoned that no review by proceeding under N.Y. Civ. Prac. Act art. 78 need be provided in order to enable an aggrieved party to take advantage thereof, but no such proceeding could have been maintained in the absence of exhaustion of an administrative remedy.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted the city's motion for an order for judgment on the pleadings and denied the motion of the automobile painting business.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. In an action to declare that paint spray and vapors emanating into the outer air from plaintiff's automobile body painting business were not within the jurisdiction of the Department of Air Pollution Control established by section 1071 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">et seq</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. of the New York City Charter and section 1072-1.0 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">et seq</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. of the Administrative Code, and to declare chapter 47 of the New York City Charter (in which &sect; 1071 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">et seq</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. were contained) and the sections of the Administrative Code unconstitutional as applied to plaintiff's paint-spraying&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  operation, defendants were granted judgment on the pleadings declaring the sections valid and applicable to plaintiff's business.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The Department of Air Pollution Control was given &quot;jurisdiction to regulate and control the emission into the open air of harmful or objectionable substances, including but not limited to smoke, soot, fly ash, dust, fumes, gas, vapors, odors and any products of combustion or incomplete combustion resulting from the use of fuel burning equipment or from the heating of fuels or refuse.&quot; Jurisdiction was not limited to emissions resulting from the use of fuel-burning equipment or from the heating of fuels or refuse, but included all substances of a harmful nature and with respect to any equipment producing such emissions, including spray and fumes from plaintiff's paint-spraying operations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The charter and code supplied safeguards, standards and definitions, as a matter of law, to give notice of the particular act or action made subject of punishment in the event of violation.  While paint-spraying operations were not mentioned in the charter and code, such operations were a proper subject for continuing supervision and control.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The rules and regulations&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of the department were not shown to conflict with those of other agencies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. No review by a proceeding under article 78 of the Civil Practice Act need be provided to enable an aggrieved party to take advantage thereof, and no review by way of administrative remedy need be supplied. The failure to provide any administrative review did not render the legislative scheme and its implementation unconstitutional.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The companies were charged with having carried on the business of milk deliveries at various locations within the city without having obtained a mercantile license or permit therefor, all in violation of Long Beach, N.Y., Code, ch. 5, art. 2, &sect; 5-113. The companies contended that &sect; 5-113 was unreasonable, arbitrary, and excessive in its imposition of a $ 100 annual tax on milk dealers. The companies argued that when a municipal corporation was given the power to license useful trades or occupations, it could not use the license as a tax to raise revenue. The court sustained the companies' challenge and dismissed the informations. It was not apparent what relation existed, or could have existed, between a license fee of $ 100 and the companies' sales of their milk products. A license fee should be sufficient merely to compensate for the expense of issuing and recording the license, and by inspecting and regulating the particular business, and to secure police control of the matter licensed.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An ordinance of a city imposing a $ 100 fee for a mercantile license to carry on a milk distribution business in the city was unreasonable and informations charging defendants with violation of the ordinance were dismissed.  The grant of power to license useful trades did not authorize plaintiff to use such power as a tax to raise revenue.  No relationship existed between the license fee of $ 100 and defendants' sales of their milk products. </SPAN></P>

After an examination of the search warrant and the affidavit upon which it was granted, the court was of the opinion that the search warrant was issued on probable cause supported by a sworn affidavit describing the person, and particularly the property, and the place to be searched and the property to be seized. The property to be seized was contraband. The return indicated that the property actually seized was contraband connected with the crime for which defendant was arrested. The search warrant was legal. Defendant also sought to dismiss the indictment accusing defendant of violating N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 975 as unconstitutional.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Possession of &quot;policy&quot; slips is presumptive evidence of the crime of possession with knowledge (Penal Law, &sect; 975).  The statutory presumption is constitutional.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. &quot;Policy&quot; slips and other book-making records are contraband, like weapons or narcotics or counterfeit money.  They are not merely evidence.  A search warrant may legally issue for their seizure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The affidavit in support of a search warrant showed probable cause, based on an investigation made by the affiant by eavesdropping and recording of telephone calls to and from the defendant's premises during which he overheard conversations that persons in the residence of the defendant were keeping a place for transferring money in a game of policy.  The property and&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  place to be searched were described as the residence of this defendant, by street and house number.  The person operating the place was described as &quot;John Doe&quot;, his true name being unknown.  The property sought to be seized was equipment and paraphernalia used in playing the game of policy.  The property subsequently seized was, among other things, policy slips.  This was contraband, and it was connected with the crime for which defendant was arrested. The search and seizure were legal (U. S.  Const., 4th Amdt.) and complied with the ruling in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Mapp v. Ohio</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (367 U.S. 643); accordingly, motion to suppress the seized evidence is denied.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner policewoman initiated a N.Y. C.P.L.R. art. 78 proceeding to review a decision of respondents, a city department of personnel, its personnel director, a city civil service commission, and its chairman, denying petitioner's application to take an examination to qualify for appointment as a sergeant.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The controlling question posed by the controversy was whether New York City, N.Y., Admin. Code &sect; 434a-2.0(d) was an unconstitutional abridgment of the rights of women. Petitioner, after competitive examination, was appointed as a policewoman in the city police department, and after some 18 years of exemplary service, made application to take an examination to qualify for appointment as a sergeant. In denying her application, the commission informed petitioner that she was ineligible to take the examination because she was not permanently employed in an eligible title, because, in other words, there was no authority to promote policewomen to the rank of sergeant. The court ruled that there could be no doubt that &sect; 434a-2.0(d), as opposed to other sections of the code cited by petitioner, made policewomen ineligible for promotion as sergeants. The court ordered a hearing on the issue of whether it reasonably might be concluded that policewomen could properly perform such a number of the assignments in the police department which were currently performed by male sergeants as to warrant the promotion of at least some policewomen to the position of sergeant.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court ordered a hearing to determine the reasonableness of the legislature's judgment in regards to the constitutionality of the city administrative code at issue.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Subdivision d of section 434a-2.0 of the Administrative Code of the City of New York, which provided that there should only be one rank of policewoman within the Police Department, made policewomen ineligible for promotion to sergeants.

Before determining its constitutionality, a hearing was ordered on the issue of whether or not it reasonably may be concluded that policewomen can properly perform such a number of the assignments in the Police Department which were currently performed by male sergeants as to warrant the promotion of at&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  least some policewomen to the position of sergeant.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, a chiropractic association (association), on behalf of itself and its individual members and by an individual, brought an action against defendant, Commissioner of Health of the State of New York (Commissioner), seeking to enjoin the Commissioner and all persons acting under him or by his authority from preventing the members of the association and the individual from operating X-ray equipment in their profession.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court sufficiently quoted the individual's testimony to indicate why the court thought the individual was and had been unlawfully practicing medicine. One of the witnesses who testified on behalf of the association stated that there were fewer than 1,000 members of the association and that all of the members either used their own X-ray equipment or sent their patients out to a laboratory to have X-ray radiation applied. The court held that the members of the association and the individual were holding themselves out as competent to cure disease within the meaning of N.Y. Educ. Law &sect; 6501(4). In addition, the members of the association and the individual violated the first and second paragraphs of regulation 19 of Chapter XVI of the New York State Sanitary Code, which precluded the application of radiation to the human body unless the radiation was applied by a licensed person. The court determined that the chiropractors had never been licensed under the laws of New York to diagnose and treat disease either in New York City or New York State.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court dismissed the complaint and vacated the attempted stipulation, stayed the enforcement of the sanitary code regulation, and denied the motion to dismiss the separate defenses of the Commissioner.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Physicians and surgeons -- chiropractors -- X rays -- as chiropractors are not licensed to practice medicine or any other healing art in New York State, they are prohibited from applying radiation to persons who seek chiropractic treatment (N. Y. State Sanitary Code, ch.  XVI, reg. 19).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The individual plaintiff and witnesses for the corporate plaintiff testified that they use in their &quot;practice&quot; as chiropractors such instruments as the stethoscope, the otoscope, the ophthalmoscope and the sphygmomanometer, and that they take or prescribe X rays of nearly all persons who come to them for therapy, such X rays, in most instances, being of the entire spinal column.  The stethoscope, the otoscope, the ophthalmoscope and the sphygmomanometer are all medical instruments.  Moreover, the X-ray machine, which produces radiation described by an expert witness for defendant as having an effect upon the human body similar to that produced by the explosion of an atom bomb, is an instrumentality of medical practice.  These facts, as well as other testimony given on behalf of plaintiffs, establish that the individual plaintiff and the members of the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  corporate plaintiff were holding themselves out as competent to cure disease.  Therefore, they were practicing medicine within the meaning of the Education Law ( &sect; 6501, subd.  4) which states that a person is practicing medicine &quot;* * * who holds himself out as being able to diagnose, treat, operate or prescribe for any human disease, pain, injury, deformity or physical condition * * *&quot;.  However, as chiropractors are not licensed in this State to practice medicine or any of the other healing arts, they were practicing medicine illegally (Education Law, &sect; 6502).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The individual plaintiff and the members of the corporate plaintiff also violated regulation 19 of chapter XVI of the New York State Sanitary Code which, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">inter alia</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, prohibits the application of radiation to human beings except by, or by order of, a person licensed or otherwise authorized to practice medicine, dentistry, podiatry, or osteopathy under the provisions of the Education Law.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Accordingly, the complaint in an action to&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  enjoin defendant, the Commissioner of Health of the State of New York, and all persons acting under him, from preventing the members of plaintiff association and the individual plaintiff from operating &quot;in the practice of their profession as chiropractors [certain] X-ray equipment * * *&quot; and generally to restrain defendant from carrying out the provisions of regulation 19 of chapter XVI of the New York State Sanitary Code against plaintiffs and other chiropractors, is dismissed.  </SPAN></P>

Defendant had been stopped by police, who had no warrant but asked to see his license and registration. When defendant produced his wallet, one of the officers grabbed it and began to go through its contents, whereupon he discovered the slips. Defendant filed a motion for an order permitting him to inspect the grand jury minutes or, in the alternative, that the court inspect the minutes and that an order be thereafter granted dismissing the indictment. The court granted the motion to dismiss, holding that (1) the alleged policy slips found in the possession of defendant could not be used because they were obtained as a result of an illegal search and seizure; and (2) defendant's confession was not sufficient to warrant his conviction under N.Y.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant was arrested by police officers who halted defendant's automobile, requested to see his license and registration, and then grabbed his wallet and searched its contents, taking from it papers alleged to be policy slips.  He was then taken to his home and accompanied inside by the officers.  No warrant was ever exhibited to defendant, who was later indicted by a Grand Jury for possessing policy slips in violation of section 975 of the Penal Law. As the facts known to the police officers at the time of defendant's arrest were insufficient to engender reasonable belief that a misdemeanor was being attempted or committed in their presence, defendant's arrest&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  was illegal, and consequently the alleged policy slips were obtained by unreasonable search and seizure and cannot be used as evidence ( </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Mapp </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">v.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11"> Ohio</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 367 U.S. 643).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was indicted for a drug-related crime. Defendant moved for an order to inspect the grand jury minutes, for dismissal of the indictment, and for the suppression of certain evidence. The court noted that the exclusionary rule that applied in federal courts that barred the use of evidence procured by means of unreasonable searches and seizures was made applicable to the states by a United States Supreme Court decision. The court found that there was a preliminary hearing before a magistrate that occurred after the Supreme Court's decision was made, and because evidence was adduced that showed the illegality of a search of defendant that resulted in the seizure of three paper bags containing a narcotic drug, the magistrate should have granted defendant's motion to suppress the evidence. The court noted that the police officer who seized the evidence had no search or arrest warrant, did not know defendant, had no confidential information regarding him, and for some undisclosed reason, followed defendant for several blocks and then forcibly searched him. The court found that the district attorney did not submit further evidence that showed probable cause.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. A search and seizure can be made on probable cause, without a warrant.  Such probable cause can be proved by less than &quot;legal evidence&quot;, such as hearsay, knowledge of prior criminal activities, reasonable grounds for suspicion, or information from a reliable source.  The issues of law and of fact as to such probable cause are for the court, not the jury.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. A policeman saw defendant on the street and became suspicious of him, and accosted him and seized three paper bags containing narcotics, and arrested him.

Alco. Bev. Cont. Law &sect; 43. The town contended, among other things, that nothing in the Law preempted further regulation of the sale of alcoholic beverages.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State denied the factual basis of defendants' motion. The court noted that the factual issues of violation of the Fourth Amendment applicable to the State through the Fourteenth Amendment raised by the conflicting versions contained in affidavits could not be summarily determined. Taking testimony was required. Noting that whether the evidence should be suppressed was regarded as not immediately relevant to the question of guilt, the court said that a jury should not be called upon to focus its attention upon such a purely collateral issue and chance being diverted from its purpose for being: the determination of the guilt of defendants. The court concluded that it could both try and decide the issues of fact. The court added that the absence of any procedural statutory authorization as to how and in what manner evidence illegally obtained should be suppressed did not affect the obligation of the court to safeguard the constitutional rights of those accused through the use of such evidence. The court decided that it would therefore seem to be better to assimilate New York practice to that employed in the federal courts and determine the question in advance of trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted defendants' motion to the extent of ordering a hearing at which it would receive evidence of the parties on the questions of fact involved. In the interim the court held in abeyance the determination of the balance of the motion.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Defendants, who were indicted for criminally receiving and concealing stolen property, move to suppress evidence allegedly forcibly seized at their home and to dismiss the indictment as wholly based on such illegal evidence.  A sharp issue of fact is presented by the police officers' affidavits that the defendant who was at home consented to their entry and search.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner voters applied for an order restraining respondent Board of Elections of Putnam County from placing on the ballot for the county general election the names of candidates purported to be nominated by the Liberal party in nomination certificates filed with the Board.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Liberal party submitted five nomination certificates with the Board, which purported to nominate candidates for offices in the county. The voters objected to the placing of the candidates on the ballot, arguing that the certificates failed to comply with the requirements of N.Y. Elec. Law &sect; 131 by failing to name the offices for which each candidate would be eligible for election. The Board moved to offer outside evidence of the offices intended to be sought by the candidates, and the voters objected to the motion. The court held that the Board was entitled to offer the extrinsic evidence to clarify the offices sought. However, the court found that even in considering the outside evidence, the defects in the nomination certificates could not be cured and the evidence was insufficient to justify amending the certificates. Because the certificates were inadequate, the court ruled that the nominees could not be placed on the ballot by the Board.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted the voters' petition, denied the Board's motion to amend the nomination certificates, and determined that the members of the Liberal party could not be placed on the ballot.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Elections -- certificates of party nominations for town offices -- five certificates which fail on their face to state for which of six towns candidates are nominated are jurisdictionally defective and cannot be corrected nunc pro tunc (Election Law, &sect; 131, subd. 9) -- candidates were properly served by mail (Election Law, &sect;&sect; 330, 335).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. In these review proceedings (Election Law, &sect; 330, subd. 2) instituted by Republican party candidates and by the Republican County Committee chairman, against the Board of Elections and the respective chairmen of the Liberal and Democratic County Committees, the court directed that the Liberal party candidates and the committee on vacancies named in the nomination certificates under review for the general election to be held on November 7, be joined as necessary parties respondent and that they be served in person or by mail on or before October 14 for a hearing to be held on October 18; and such service was then properly and timelily made by mail (Election&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Law, &sect; 335; Civ. Prac. Act, &sect;&sect; 1, 5, 192, 193).  Rule 21 of the Rules of Civil Practice, to the extent that it is inconsistent with sections 330 and 335 of the Election Law, does not apply.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Putnam County has 6 towns.  The Liberal party filed 5 separate certificates of nomination of candidates for offices which the court judicially notices are town offices: namely, Supervisor, Town Clerk, Justice of the Peace, Councilman, Assessor, Tax Collector, and Superintendent of Highways.  However, none of the 5 certificates states the name of any town for whose public office any candidate is named (Election Law, &sect; 131, subd. 9); the certificates merely state that the above-mentioned offices are &quot;to be filled by the voters of Putnam County at the general election&quot;.  Each certificate gives each candidate's town of residence, but in some instances the same town thus appears on different certificates. Their registration cards merely indicate in which town they resided at the time of registration, and not at time of nomination (Town Law, &sect; 23).  Their authorizations and acceptances (Election Law, &sect; 137, subd. 4) similarly state towns of residence, but not the particular town for whose office&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the nomination was made.  Most, but not all, of the Liberal party candidates were also nominated by the Democratic party, by certificates which properly stated the town of that candidacy; but the certificates of one political party should not be open to correction by the certificates of another political party, since such practice would open the door to frauds.  Thus, these 5 Liberal party certificates of nomination are jurisdictionally defective, and cannot be corrected by a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">nunc pro tunc</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> order. The motion to amend the certificates </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">nunc pro tunc</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is denied, and the Board of Elections is directed not to place the names of those Liberal party candidates on the ballot. </SPAN></P>

Petitioner alleged that the petition that nominated respondent as a candidate for the same position was insufficient, invalid, and illegal. The challenged petition consisted of 568 signatures. Respondent Board of Elections sustained petitioner's objections to 139 signatures, which left 429 signatures. The remaining signatures were sufficient to support the nomination of respondent. The court denied petitioner's application. The court found that the signatures using initials, or abbreviations, or the title &quot;Mrs.&quot; were valid under N.Y. Elec. Law &sect; 138-a. The court found that six signatures were invalid because they were not signed in the presence of the subscribing witness. The court determined that one signature was forged. In all the court concluded that an additional 23 signatures were invalid. The court concluded that the irregular signatures did not render the entire petition invalid. The court found that petitioner failed to prove that the irregularities and fraud were so ample that the validity of the entire petition was in doubt.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. A petition in a proceeding to annul an independent nominating petition for the office of supervisor was dismissed.  The nominating petition contained 568 signatures although only 273 were required.  The Board of Elections invalidated 139 signatures, leaving 429 signatures. The court in this proceeding invalidated 24 more signatures, leaving 405 valid signatures.</SPAN></P>

Section 138-a of the Election Law provided that the use of titles, initials or abbreviations by the signers of independent nominating petitions should not invalidate the signatures provided that the identity of the signer could be established by the use of the register of voters.

The court first held that the amendments to the Act were constitutional. The Act's original form forbade the solicitation of dues from any employees that had been convicted of a felony. The legislature sought to eliminate the criminal influence in the association and to clean up corrupt conditions on the waterfront. The amendments provided exemptions in cases where the Commission determined that an exemption would not be contrary to the objectives of the Act. The fact that the amendments extended to collections from persons not subject to the Act did not render them violative of due process.

The court determined that if the members had been removed for cause under existing provisions of law, which required officials to prefer charges and conduct hearings prior to removal, the failure to provide them would have entitled the members to relief.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner's application was based upon statements, allegedly made by an assistant district attorney and a state police officer that telephones used by petitioner had been tapped. Although the motion referred to no particular case, petitioner sought an examination to determine whether the requirements of N.Y. Code Crim. Proc. &sect;&sect; 813-a, 813-b were fulfilled in order to lay the foundation for a timely motion to suppress evidence illegally obtained, if such could be maintained, before trial. In denying the motion, the court held that any order would lack certainty because petitioner asked to inspect orders, believed to exist, copies of which may have been in the possession of the several judges and the originals, if any, of which may have been in the possession of the district attorney and other law enforcement officers. Further, it was not certain whether evidence obtained in violation of Federal law and not directly unconstitutional conduct was inadmissible in a State court.</SPAN></P>

Further, the court held that having made their application for injunction, the residential property owners, even though the application was being denied, had put the property owners on notice.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Board denied the merchant's application for a peddler's license without holding a hearing on the application. In its denial, the Board stated that granting the license would not be in the best interests of the village. The merchant brought an action for an order pursuant to N.Y. Civ. Prac. Act art. 78 to direct the Board and mayor to issue him a peddler's license. The merchant also requested a declaration that his business did not require a peddler's license and that New Hyde Park, New York, Ordinance No. 1 was unconstitutional. The court did not grant the declaratory relief requested by the merchant, holding that such relief was unavailable in a proceeding under N.Y. Civ. Prac. Act art. 78. The court ruled that the Board's denial of the license application was arbitrary and capricious and ordered the Board and mayor to issue the merchant a license. The court held that N.Y.

The court noted that &sect; 1747-d(3), which prohibited the possession of material that could have been used to manufacture illegal drugs, did not violate defendant's due process rights. The court concluded that unless a statute appeared to have no substantial relation to a proper purpose, the legislature did not exceed its authority when it attempted to limit the type of paraphernalia that was allowed to be possessed by persons who were not in the medical field.

Pari-Mutuel Revenue Law &sect; 63 by construing the section to mean that a gross salary of $ 7,500 disqualified him from being licensed as a mutuel clerk. The employee took the position that the restriction imposed on public employees referred to &quot;take home pay&quot;. The court disagreed. The reasoning behind the restriction was that the number of licenses for race tracks and the share of pari-mutuel revenues available to those tracks were prescribed by law. Government created the monopoly and controlled its income. Section 63 was therefore designed to meet a unique situation which did not exist elsewhere in government. It was originally proposed to bar all municipal employees from employment at race tracks. When the salary cap was included to soften the restriction for those government employees that needed second jobs to survive, the salary amount specified was arbitrarily selected and reflected a gross, not a net, amount.</SPAN></P>

The union argued that serious issues of constitutionality were presented and that a temporary injunction was necessary to prevent the section's enforcement until the issues had been adjudicated. The court held that the union had failed to demonstrate either of the indispensable preconditions to the issuance of a preliminary injunction. No imminent threat or irreparable injury was shown because no one was prosecuting the union for violations of the law. The practice of the district attorney's office was to give notice of its intent to prosecute for a violation of &sect; 8 before actually doing so. The court also ruled that the union had failed to show a probability of ultimate success.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowner owned a property that he used as a business and as his home. The property was located in a Residence B zone and the village ordinance provided that the area could be used for a professional use as long as it was also used as a dwelling. The landowner later moved his residence out of the building and maintained his business while renting the living quarters to a third party. The landowner then filed a declaratory judgment action against the village to determine that he could maintain the professional use without living on the premises. The court found that the ordinance's provision for a business was an accessory use. The court found that the ordinance was amended after the landowner began his practice in the building. The court construed the old ordinance and concluded that the ordinance was clear in that it did not require that the practitioner reside in the building that was being used in a profession. Therefore, the court found in favor of the landowner.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The Zoning Ordinance of the Village of Hempstead (as enacted in 1955 and prior to amdt. in 1960) permits the following buildings: (1) in Residence A and BB districts, one-family and two-family dwellings, and accessory uses by professional persons of such dwellings &quot;in which practitioner resides&quot;; and (2) in Residence B districts, buildings for multiple dwellings and &quot;for any purpose permitted in a more restricted district&quot;.  This meant that, in a building in a Residence B district, the office of the doctor or dentist or other professional person need not be merely accessory to his residence there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The 1960 amendment to the zoning ordinance supplied the missing proviso as to Residence B districts; but the doctor&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and the dentist in this case had each rented out the dwelling portion of his home to a tenant, prior to the 1960 amendment; hence the doctor and the dentist each has a valid prior nonconforming use and may continue to maintain his office in his said former dwelling, though he now lives elsewhere.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The village brought an action to enjoin the businesses from maintaining a sign in violation of the ordinance. The businesses argued: (1) that the ordinance was not properly noticed for public hearing, or its enactment properly published; (2) that the village lacked power to adopt the ordinance; (3) that the defendants had a vested right to maintain the sign; and (4) the ordinance was unconstitutional. The court held that the notice was sufficient because it described the subject of the hearing in general terms, as required, and that the description of the ordinance in the notice complied with the terms of the local law calling for &quot;a brief description.&quot; The court further held that the legislature authorized the adoption of the ordinance and found that the village was empowered to determine that signs such as that maintained by the businesses had a distracting influence on motorists. The court also found that the nature of the nonconforming use of the sign did not rise to the stature of a vested right because the sign not appear to be a substantial investment and the initial variance granted to the businesses was conditioned on the compliance of all signs with the building code.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. After defendants had maintained for several years a nonconforming business use under a variance, the village adopted an ordinance (Local Laws, 1952, No. 1 of Village of Larchmont) which limited sign display in residential districts and provided for the removal of existing nonconforming signs.  A notice of the public hearing to be held describing the subject of the hearing generally was sufficient (Village Law, &sect; 90), as was a notice of adoption of the ordinance which briefly described it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The village was empowered to adopt an ordinance reasonably regulating signs, and defendants have no vested right to the maintenance of a yard sign.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with multiple crimes. He filed a demurrer to the indictment on the ground that N.Y. Jud. Law &sect; 609, which provided for the selection of grand jurors, was unconstitutional in that it was violative of N.Y. Const. art. III, &sect; 17. Section 17 prohibited the enactment of local or private legislation dealing with the selecting, drawing, summoning, or impaneling of grand or petit jurors. The court held that a demurrer was not the proper vehicle to raise the constitutional issue of the valid existence of the grand jury because it served only to raise objections which appeared upon the face of the indictment. A defect in the composition of the grand jury did not appear on the face of the indictment. Defendant's challenge to the grand jury was prohibited by N.Y. Code Crim. Proc. &sect; 231. The court held that, even if N.Y. Jud. Law &sect; 609 was private or local legislation, the indictments returned against defendant were not null and void. Because the grand jury was acting under color of law, it was a de facto grand jury and its acts were valid. Therefore, it was not necessary for the court to pass upon the constitutionality of Section 609.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In consolidated proceedings, petitioner neighbors sought judicial review under N.Y. Town Law &sect; 282 of a zoning variance given by respondent, a town planning board, on the application of respondent developer to build 49 homes on approximately 33 acres in exchange for conveyance of approximately 30 acres to the town for a public park.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The town authorized the board to make &quot;reasonable&quot; changes in zoning regulations, but it required the maintenance of the average population density and strict conformance with &sect; 281. The developer offered land for a park in exchange for a variance to develop the rest of the property. The board approval was annulled on judicial review. The board granted the reapplication. The neighbors sought judicial review. The delegation of power to the board was constitutional because the standards were capable of reasonable application and the board's powers were sufficiently limited and defined. The standards in &sect; 281 were constitutional, and there was no conflict with N.Y. Town Law &sect;&sect; 261-265. However, N.Y. Town Law &sect; 281 had not given the board the power it had attempted to exercise because the variance given to the developer affected 63 acres out of a 100 acres and was so great a change as to be considered unreasonable. The board's action was prohibited under N.Y. Town Law &sect; 265. In addition, the variance given to the developer increased the population density of the area, which exceeded the power given by the town's delegation. The board's alleged findings were unsupported conclusions.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Purportedly acting under a general resolution of the Town Board authorizing the town's Planning Board &quot;to make any reasonable change&quot; in the zoning regulation of platted lands, provided (1) that such change maintains the &quot;average density of population&quot; permitted in the zone and (2) that the appropriate use of adjoining land is reasonably safeguarded and (3) that such plan is &quot;consistent with the public welfare&quot; (Town Law, &sect; 281), the Planning Board passed a resolution accepting an offer by the owner of a plat to dedicate 37.4 acres thereof to the town for park purposes, and modifying the zoning regulations so as to permit all lots in the subdivision's remaining acres, some of which lay in an &quot;A&quot; zone requiring one acre for each building, and some of which lay in a &quot;B&quot; zone requiring only half an acre for each building, to comply merely with the &quot;B&quot; zone requirement.  The Planning Board's resolution is annulled (Town Law, &sect;&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  282).  Such a change in a large tract would in effect amend the zoning ordinance itself -- a power exercisable by the Town Board only (Town Law, &sect;&sect; 261-265, 267, 277, subd. 1).  Moreover, (1) the Planning Board's resolution necessarily increases the permitted &quot;density of population&quot;; and the Planning Board's findings under (2) and (3) above stated are mere conclusions unsupported by any facts.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The gravamen of the suit was that the challenged statute was not a general law applying to all cities alike, but was designed solely for the mayor of New York City. The court denied the taxpayer's motion for a temporary injunction and held that the statute was valid insofar as it authorized the alternative method of naming a charter commission because there was no showing that the statute's application was not alike as to the charters of all cities in the state. The court also upheld the provisions granting mayors power to appropriate city funds for the use of the mayor's commission, after 30 days of inaction by the appropriate city officials. But the court denied defendants' motions for dismissal or summary judgment and held that the new restrictive provisions of &sect;&sect; 20(3), (4)(e), which essentially choked off alternative action by the local legislature and people, were invalid as an improper delegation of legislative power, in violation of N.Y. Const. art. III, &sect; 1, the home rule policy of the state reflected by N.Y. Const. Art. XI, &sect;&sect; 11, 12, and N.Y. Mun. Home Rule Law &sect; 33.</SPAN></P>

The candidate argued that N.Y. Elec. Law &sect; 2607 was unconstitutional. The court denied the candidate's request insofar: (1) as it sought permission to designate inspectors of election because no basis was presented to declare &sect; 2607 unconstitutional; (2) as the request for permission to designate watchers was concerned because the candidate had been afforded the rights that he requested by the board; and (3) as it sought to require the institution of absentee voting procedures because there existed no provision of law that authorized the procedures. School district elections were clearly excluded from the ballot provisions of the election law.

Veh. &amp; Traf. Law &sect; 1180(1).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The People filed an action against defendant for violating &sect; 1180(1). The case was tried without a jury. Defendant moved for dismissal of the information at the close of his case on the grounds the People failed in their proof because the information was sworn to on direct knowledge and not upon information and belief. Defendant objected to the part of the information that specifically stated 40 miles per hour. The court found defendant guilty of operating his motor vehicle at a speed greater than was reasonable and prudent under the conditions and denied his motion to dismiss the action because the information was sufficient in and of itself to establish prima facie the essential elements of the violation charged against defendant. The People met their burden of proof and established the three essential elements of &sect; 1180 and that defendant operated his motor vehicle at a speed greater than was reasonable and prudent under the conditions.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. An information, used as a pleading, charged that defendant violated subdivision 3 of section 1180 of the Vehicle and Traffic Law in that he operated his vehicle at a speed greater than was reasonably prudent, in excess of 30 miles per hour, &quot;specifically 40 miles per hour, under the conditions existing, which was wet and slippery pavement resulting in his being unable to stop his vehicle without skidding and colliding with another vehicle&quot;.  The information, based in part upon an officer's personal knowledge from witnessing the accident, was sufficient to establish the essential elements of the violation.  The use of the phrase &quot;specifically 40 miles per hour&quot; was surplusage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The officer witnessed the accident and gave his opinion of defendant's speed from the moment defendant came into view and until the collision, and also testified that, following the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  accident, defendant admitted that he was traveling at 40 miles per hour.  This evidence was sufficient to show that defendant travelled (1) at a speed greater than was reasonable and prudent, (2) under the conditions existing and (3) having regard to actual and potential hazards then existing.  Defendant was found guilty.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was sitting behind the wheel of a car located on a bridge that ran over a parkway. The rear of the car contained a sign that advertised a business. A police officer noticed the car when he passed the bridge while travelling on the parkway and again on his return to the area a few minutes later. The officer cited defendant with advertising without a permit. On appeal, the court held that the evidence provided by the officer was sufficient to establish the State's case beyond a reasonable doubt. The court found that the vehicle was within the boundaries of the parkway when it parked on a bridge running over the parkway and was subject to the advertising restrictions in effect for the parkway, which prohibited the advertising without a permit, N.Y.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a N.Y. C.P.L.R. art. 78 proceeding, petitioner landowners sought an order directing respondents, members of a board of education, to discharge a notice of designation and notice of pendency of proceeding in connection with the condemnation of the landowners' property and to enjoin the members from filing any further designations affecting the property. The members filed a cross-motion to dismiss the petition as legally insufficient.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The members filed a notice and designation but an approving referendum, which was required by law because the indebtedness of the school district would exceed 10 percent of the value of its property, was defeated. The board filed a new designation, but the referendum was again defeated. The school board advised the court that it intended to file a new designation and put the same referendum up for vote a third time. The landowners contended that the Nassau County Civil Divisions Act, 1951 N.Y. Laws ch. 767, &sect; 520.4(2)(b), in providing for the liening of property without compensation was unconstitutional. The court held that the landowners could not challenge the constitutionality of the act in a N.Y. C.P.L.R. art. 78 proceeding, which was in the nature of a mandamus proceeding. Mandamus was not a substitute for an injunction in a plenary suit to prevent a violation of a law, nor was it to be used to direct nonenforcement of an law alleged to be unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Respondent Board of Education filed, pursuant to paragraph (b) of subdivision 2 of section 520.4 of the Nassau County Civil Divisions Act (L. 1951, ch. 767), a notice of designation and notice of pendency in connection with the contemplated condemnation of 52.8 acres of land owned by petitioners for a school site.  Thereafter, a referendum to approve the proposition for condemnation was defeated by the voters. Respondent board then cancelled the old designation and filed a new one again tying up petitioners' property.  A new referendum was had and again the proposition was defeated. Petitioners alleged that, in providing for the liening of property without compensation, paragraph (b) of subdivision 2 of section 520.4 was unconstitutional.&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A proceeding under article 78 of the Civil Practice Act in the nature of mandamus to direct respondent board to discharge a notice of designation and to enjoin it from filing any other further designations cannot be used to test the constitutionality of paragraph (b) of subdivision 2 of section 520.4 of the Nassau County Civil Divisions Act, nor may mandamus be used as a substitute for an injunction in a plenary suit to prevent violation of a law nor may it be used to direct nonenforcement of a law alleged to be unconstitutional.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The settlor established an irrevocable trust consisting of stock and life insurance policies on the life of her father, the trustee. The settlor provided in her will that estate and inheritance taxes on the trust corpus were to be equitably prorated and paid from the trust. Because the settlor died a resident of Connecticut and because Connecticut had an apportionment statute, the court applied Connecticut law. Connecticut had a statute that provided that the trustee was to contribute to the payment of taxes. However, the statute was not enacted until 10 years after the creation of the trust. The court found that the apportionment statute was applicable to the trust; however, totally aside from any statute, where the will clearly directed apportionment, the will would be honored. The court found that the settlor clearly and unambiguously directed that the trust pay its fair share of the taxes. Thus, apportionment was applicable to the trust.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. A Connecticut resident created an irrevocable and unalterable </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">inter vivos</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> trust, the corpus of which is located and administered in New York State.  The trust indenture is silent as to payment of estate taxes.  However, the settlor's will directed that estate and inheritance taxes on property not passing under the will should be &quot;equitably prorated and paid from the said property&quot;.  Moreover, a Connecticut apportionment statute, which New York will apply, provides for inclusion of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">inter vivos</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> transfers within a decedent's gross estate and applies to trusts created prior to its passage where the settlor died subsequent thereto.  Accordingly the subject trust should bear its proportionate&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  share of the estate taxes, which the trustee is authorized to advance directly to the taxing authorities, making proper safeguard for return of any refund to the trust corpus.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A town board enacted an ordinance reclassifying the owners' parcels from residential to research office uses. Neighbors in the residential district filed an action against the town, its board members, the owners, and a contract vendee seeking a judgment declaring the ordinance unreasonable and void. The court dismissed the complaint, which came down to a difference of opinion between the neighbors and town as to the area's proper development. The court held that the town and planning boards were within their legislative judgment in weighing the usefulness of rezoning and considering that the use of the property for education and a pre-existing laboratory under special permit was closely allied to research purposes, that the prior estate quality of the surrounding land was disintegrating, that the tax rate had increased, and that the trend among municipalities in the county was to permit highly restricted business uses on acreage of a large size. The court held that the reclassification in response to changing patterns of living was not spot zoning because there was no evidence that the town was motivated by favoritism for the owners of the large area.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court dismissed the neighbors' action against the town, board members, owners, and vendee for a declaratory judgment that the rezoning ordinance was void.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. In view of the importance of the issues involved, an action for a judgment declaring unreasonable and void a town ordinance reclassifying three parcels of real property from a Residence 4-Acre (&quot;4 A&quot;) district to a Research Office (&quot;R O&quot;) district is considered on the merits, despite doubt as to plaintiffs' standing to contest the validity of said ordinance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The burden was on plaintiffs to prove that the reclassification was invalid as &quot;spot&quot; zoning and was not a proper exercise of the powers of the Town Board, which has authority to make changes in zoning policy to adjust to changing patterns of living.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. In forming the legislative judgment the town&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  officials were justified in considering that (1) two of the subject parcels already were used for purposes similar to &quot;R O&quot; purposes; (2) the subject area bordered on a State highway, near a junction with a parkway; (3) the State had established a museum nearby; (4) the subject area was within a short distance of a settled community with railroad service; (5) there was evidence that the prior estate quality of the surrounding land was in the process of disintegration; (6) the quantity of residentially zoned land in the town far exceeded that zoned for commercial purposes; (7) the tax rates, especially for school needs, had increased sharply in recent years.  A judgment based on such considerations may not be declared arbitrary or unreasonable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The town authorities were not required to prove a change of condition to justify the reclassification.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Plaintiffs have not proved their charge of &quot;spot&quot; zoning. The subject parcel comprises 123 acres. Moreover, there is no evidence that the town authorities were motivated by favoritism for the owners of the subject area, without consideration of the welfare of the town at large.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. At best, plaintiffs make debatable the reclassification&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of the subject area; and that is insufficient to overturn the legislative judgment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. The complaint is dismissed.  </SPAN></P>

The town discontinued the road as useless. The landowners alleged that they had been unconstitutionally deprived of the use of their property without due process and that discontinuance of the portion of the road was illegal. They also claimed that the superintendent did not comply with the requirements of N.Y. High. Law &sect; 171 because consent of adjoining landowners was not obtained before the discontinuance. The superintendent argued that the landowners' property did not immediately abut the discontinued portion of the road and, thus, they were not entitled to maintain the proceeding. The court found that because the property was not adjoining and a mere inconvenience to the general public was not actionable, the landowners were not entitled to a remedy. N.Y. High.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant alleged that &sect; 986-b was unconstitutional because it was too vague and indefinite to prescribe a crime and the presumption created by the statute violated the constitutional requirement of due process of law. The law made a person who knowingly possessed a record of a bet made by a person engaged in book-making or pool-setting guilty of a misdemeanor. Defendant contended that the language in the statute was vague. Further, he alleged that the statute did not specify whether it applied to the occasional better or whether it applied only to the professional gambler. The court found the legislative intent of the statute was to make the occasional better guilty of the misdemeanor. The court found that the legislature's attempt to create a presumption in the last section of &sect; 986-b was unconstitutional and the court declared it a nullity. However the rest of the statute was lawful and enforceable. Thus, the court directed that defendant be tried upon the information.</SPAN></P>

Section 986-b of the Penal Law, which provides that any person who shall knowingly have possession of any writing, paper or document representing or being a record made by a person engaged in book-making or pool selling of a bet or wager shall be guilty of a misdemeanor, is not too vague and indefinite to prescribe a crime and is not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff taxpayers filed a complaint against defendant town board that asserted that the town board was unauthorized to expend any money in connection with the preparation of an incinerator site for construction. The town board sought a dismissal of the complaint on the ground that no bond or surety was served with the summons and complaint as provided by N.Y. Gen. Mun. Law &sect; 51.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayers filed a cross-motion for permission to file a bond nunc pro tunc and also for a temporary injunction enjoining the expenditure of funds by the town board. The taxpayers asserted that a bond was not necessary because the action was not filed under &sect; 51 but was merely one for a declaratory judgment wherein a bond was not required. The court noted that the nature of the instant action must have been determined from the complaint and prayer for relief. The court held that the action was basically an action under &sect; 51 and the filing of a bond was required. The court also concluded that the taxpayers had not shown a right to a temporary injunction. The resolution that was passed as well as a referendum authorized the issuance of bonds and capital notes. The taxpayers' allegations were merely conclusory and insufficient to authorize the granting of a temporary injunction. Finally, the court determined that the taxpayers' argument that until the prior litigation attacking the legality and constitutionality of the referendum and resolution was determined, any payments to have been made were unauthorized was without merit.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted the town board's motion to dismiss unless the taxpayers filed a bond within 10 days after service of the order. The taxpayers' cross-motion to file a bond nunc pro tunc was granted. However, the court denied the taxpayers' cross-motion for a temporary injunction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Municipal corporations -- taxpayer's action -- bond -- action seeking declaration as to validity of payments made following resolution and referendum authorizing acquisition of certain property and erection of incinerator and issuance of bonds and capital notes, and seeking return of funds, limitations of payments and injunctive relief, considered as action brought under </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">section 51 of General Municipal Law</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> -- filing of bond was necessary -- no right to temporary injunction shown -- papers insufficient to determine whether prior action to declare resolution and referendum </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">unconstitutional</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> is finally determined.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Defendant Town Board adopted a resolution authorizing the acquisition of certain property, the erection thereon of an incinerator and the issuance of bonds and capital notes of the town to pay the cost thereof.  Thereafter, at a referendum, the resolution was approved by the voters. Allegedly expenditures have been made for engineering services out of the town's surplus account.  Plaintiffs seek judgment to declare invalid the payments already made, with a direction for the return thereof, a direction&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  that any payments in connection with improvement of the incinerator site and construction thereof be limited to the funds authorized by the referendum and resolution, and to enjoin the Town Board from paying out any moneys for the purpose of the incinerator except out of the bonds and capital notes authorized by the referendum and resolution.  The action is one brought under section 51 of the General Municipal Law. It is not an action only for declaratory judgment. Plaintiffs seek not only a declaration as to the validity of payments made, but also ask for other relief specified in section 51 of the General Municipal Law -- return of funds, limitations of payments and injunctive relief. A filing of a bond was, therefore, necessary and a motion to dismiss the complaint is granted unless the bond is filed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Plaintiffs have not shown a right to a temporary injunction. Their claim that the expenditure of general or surplus town moneys for the purpose or object of the referendum and resolution is illegal and contrary to the intent of the Local Finance Law is not supported by statutory authority (cf. Local Finance Law, &sect; 165.10).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The papers in support of the instant motion are&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  insufficient for the court to determine whether or not a prior action to declare the resolution and referendum unconstitutional, null and void and contrary to law is finally determined or is still pending.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff bank sought a declaratory judgment and incidental relief against defendants, the Superintendent of Banks of the State of New York and various commercial and savings banks, in its action claiming that the Omnibus Banking Bill, 1960 N.Y. Laws ch. 237, which was described as an act to amend the banking law, in relation to bank holding companies, was void and violated N.Y. Const. art. III, &sect; 14, and N.Y. Legis.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The bank sought declaratory judgment and incidental relief against defendants, claiming that the Omnibus Banking Bill (Bill), 1960 N.Y. Laws ch. 237, was void and did not become a law because when it was called up for passage, it was not on the desks of the members of the legislature in its final form, in violation of the N.Y. Const. art. III, &sect; 14, and because the existence of the original law in the archives and in the custody of the Secretary of State was in doubt and unexplained, contrary to N.Y. Legis. Law &sect;&sect; 40, 41, 42, and 44. The court held that the Bill was invalidly passed and did not become law because according to documentary evidence and testimony from several senators, the final form of the Bill was not on the legislators' desks for three days before its passage and that despite the governor's call for an immediate vote, the Bill was required to be in its final form, even if it wasn't printed. The court found that discrepancies between the senate journal and copies of the final Bill and its certificate of the presiding officers at its passage, although presumed effective, still cast doubts on the legislative procedures followed, or not, in the Bill's enactment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted judgment in favor of the bank, holding that the Omnibus Banking Bill was invalidly passed and that defendant banks were jointly and severally enjoined from opening, occupying, and operating any branch office in two specific counties. The court further held that defendant superintendent had no legal authority or powers to permit any banks to open, occupy, or operate branches in the said counties.</SPAN></P>

Chapter 237 of the Laws of 1960 (amending the provisions of the Banking Law as to bank holding companies) is, after a trial in this action instituted by a bank in the New York Supreme Court, at which trial testimony was adduced from two State Senators and the General Clerk and the Journal Clerk of the Senate and from the State Superintendent of Banks, and there were received in evidence the originals or photostats of legislative documents including legislative journals, a stenographic transcript of the Senate proceedings on the final consideration of the bill, a mimeographed version of the bill and a different printed version of the bill each certified a month apart by the Secretary of State as the original law, declared void. This judgment is based on the grounds that (1) in spite of a certificate from the Governor to the Legislature&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  stating &quot;the facts which in his opinion necessitate an immediate vote thereon&quot;, the bill was not &quot;nevertheless * * * upon the desks of the members&quot; of the Legislature &quot;in final form * * * before its final passage&quot; (N.

Accordingly, the defendant banks are enjoined from opening any branch offices in Nassau County and Westchester County, and the State Superintendent of Banks, codefendant, is declared to have no legal authority relating to any application of any bank for permission to open such a branch.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs brought an action contesting certain regulations issued by the Commissioner. The regulations required the fingerprinting of every cabaret employee who comes in contact or is likely to come in contact with patrons of the cabaret. The regulations also required all such employees to obtain identification cards. The court denied plaintiffs' motion for judgment on the pleadings or summary judgment and granted defendants' cross motion for judgment in their favor dismissing the complaint. The court found that the regulations had previously been held to be constitutional and valid. The court held that it could not rule on the legality of service charges for the identification cards because there had been no allegations that they exceeded the cost of rendering the services for which the fee was exacted. The court held that although there was no authority for the provision in the police regulations that the fees collected be deposited to the credit of the Police Pension Fund, there had been no showing that the City of New York had been financially damaged by the regulation, nor had there been a showing of a waste of municipal funds.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner homeowners and respondent permittee appealed a decision of respondent Board of Zoning Appeals of the Town of Hempstead (board) (New York), which granted a building permit to the permittee to build a bowling alley. Both parties brought proceedings under N.Y. C.P.L.R. 78 that were consolidated for review under Hempstead, N.Y., Town Law &sect; 267(7).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The homeowners sought to annul the board's decision that affirmed the issuance of the permit. The permittee sought to annul the board's decision that reversed the building inspector's approval of a parking plan for 128 cars to only 125 cars, and modified the permit by reducing the number of alleys permitted from 32 to 31. The court dismissed both proceedings on the merits. The homeowners' contention that the existence of gasoline stations within 300 feet mandated denial of the permit was overruled. The ordinance only prohibited erection of a gasoline station within 300 feet of a place of amusement, but permitted a place of amusement to be erected within 300 feet of an existing service station. The board did not err when it visited the property though it would have been better practice for the board to make its survey in the presence of both parties. The court concluded that there was substantial evidence to support the board's conclusions, and the board's decision had a reasonable basis in law and was neither arbitrary nor capricious.</SPAN></P>

The court dismissed the complaint and held that the Statute of Frauds, N.Y. Real Prop. Law &sect; 259-a barred any recovery insofar as her father's real property was concerned. The court held that the daughter failed to prove her interest in the father's personal property when her mother could not testify about the agreement because it was through her that the daughter derived her rights. The court held that any such oral agreement needed to rest upon the clearest and most convincing evidence, lest the wise and salutary purpose of N.Y. Civ. Prac. Act &sect; 347 be frustrated. The court also held that there was proof that the second wife had worked hard to help the decedent acquire the property at issue and therefore, deserved to retain the property.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plaintiff alleges that her mother, before instituting a divorce action against plaintiff's father, orally waived all right of support for said mother and child, and that plaintiff's father thereupon orally agreed to devise and bequeath half his estate to plaintiff; and that, instead, he left all his estate to his second wife; wherefore plaintiff, as the alleged third-party beneficiary of such oral agreement, seeks to impress a trust on his estate.  The alleged oral agreement was made before the enactment of subdivision 7 of section 31 of the Personal Property Law, hence that Statute of Frauds cannot constitutionally nullify this agreement.  But the mother's testimony is barred by section 347 of the Civil Practice Act. Without the mother's testimony, plaintiff's case consists of two letters and the equivocal testimony of plaintiff's husband. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  This is not clear and convincing evidence.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner police lieutenant filed a N.Y. C.P.L.R. art. 78 proceeding, seeking to review the determination of respondents, an official and the Suffolk County Civil Service Commission, by which the Commission denied the lieutenant's request that he be granted the rank of captain in the police department.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Commission approved a resolution purporting to cover-in certain persons and listing incumbents whose names were affected. The lieutenant claimed that the omission of his name from the resolution was improper. Under the court's reading of N.Y. Const. art. V, &sect; 6 and the decisions construing it, a method of permanently creating status and tenure in the competitive class of the classified civil service of the State or any less municipal agency was specifically interdicted. The lieutenant's permanent status in the police department was that of lieutenant. His promotions thereafter were on a provisional basis only. He acquired no right of tenure either from the continuance of that provisional status beyond the statutory limit or from the failure to schedule or provide promotional examinations. Thus, the lieutenant never had claim to a permanent status beyond that of lieutenant and gained nothing by a report or any resolution implementing it. The lieutenant's transfer to the county police department as a lieutenant was in proper conformity with the provisions of the Suffolk County Charter and N.Y. Civ. Serv. Law &sect; 70, and consequently could not have been arbitrary or unreasonable.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court dismissed the lieutenant's petition.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Civil service -- reclassification -- petitioner, whose permanent rank was that of lieutenant in Islip Town Police Department, but who had been appointed provisionally as captain, was not entitled to be &quot;covered-in&quot; at provisional title in reclassification of titles and positions of civil service employees of Suffolk County.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. On January 7, 1960, the State Civil Service Commission approved a reclassification of titles and positions of civil service employees of Suffolk County whereby, with the exception of employees of the Probation Department and the County Court, all incumbents who had served in their respective positions for at least a year prior to July 1, 1956, were continued in such positions under their newly assigned titles without further examination.  On July 1, 1955, petitioner was serving in a provisional appointment as a police captain in the Islip Town Police Department and later he was provisionally appointed chief of police.  However, his permanent status was that of lieutenant. He acquired no right of tenure either from the continuance of his provisional status beyond the statutory limit or from the failure to&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  hold promotional examinations for the higher positions.  Accordingly, he was not entitled to be &quot;covered-in&quot; at the rank of captain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Petitioner's transfer to the Suffolk County Police Department as a lieutenant on January 1, 1960, when the personnel and functions of the Islip Town Police Department were transferred to the County Police Department, was in proper conformity with the provisions of the Suffolk County Charter (&sect; 1207) and the Civil Service Law ( &sect; 70) and was not arbitrary or unreasonable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Therefore, a petition to review the determination of the Suffolk County Civil Service Commission denying petitioner's request that he be granted the rank of Captain in the County Police Department is dismissed.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff member filed an action to compel defendants, a union's president and treasurer, to process and pay the death benefits due under a sick and death benefit fund contract between the parties and to impress a trust on the union's assets equal to the amount credited to the fund.

The court held that there was no requirement that an unincorporated association had to be doing business in the State in order to be sued there as long as the other requirements under N.Y. Gen. Ass'ns Law &sect; 13 were met. The court did not decline jurisdiction of the first and second causes of action, which sought the process and payment of the death benefits.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After obtaining an ex parte divorce in Florida, the ex-wife initiated a partition action to divide the marital property located in New York. The ex-wife and the ex-husband filed motions for summary judgment. The court denied the ex-wife's motion and granted the ex-husband's motion for summary judgment. The court held that the full faith and credit clause, U. S. Const., art. IV, &sect; 1, as implemented by 28 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1738 required only that a state give to the judgment of another state such force and effect as it had in the state in which it was rendered. The court found that the ex-husband's affidavit stated that he did not appear in the Florida action, therefore, the Florida court had no jurisdiction over the ex-husband's person or over the property located in New York. The court held that it was the due process clause as applied to husband's property rights that governed rather than the full faith and credit clause. The court held that under the &quot;divisible divorce&quot; doctrine, giving effect to the decree as to the marital status but denying its effect as to property, was not violative of the full faith and credit clause.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An out-of-State divorce -- Florida, in this case -- rendered after service on the defendant, is presumptively valid, even without any appearance by the defendant; and the decree is entitled to full faith and credit in New York State (U.

A tenancy by the entirety in New York realty, in which each owns the whole and each owns a right of survivorship, is not converted by such foreign decree into a tenancy in common in which each owns merely a half.  Accordingly, a partition action by the wife against the husband is dismissed (Civ. Prac. Act, &sect; 1012).  </SPAN></P>

Noting that declaratory judgments were intended as a guide to future action, the court held that a proper case for declaratory judgment was presented. However, the Act was not unconstitutional. In so ruling, the court stated the definition of &quot;strike&quot; contained in subdivision 1 of the Act was as clear and definite as any definition could reasonably be. Further, the Act did not deprive the teachers of a full and fair hearing. Although subdivision 4 provided for automatic termination, subdivision 6 entitled a teacher to request a hearing.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The so-called Condon-Wadlin Act (Civil Service Law, &sect; 108, entitled &quot;Strikes by public employees prohibited; penalties&quot;) is valid and constitutional as applied to schoolteachers.

Payment in lieu of a reservation of land was not mandatory under &sect; 227; rather, the statute vested in the town board absolute discretion to apply or not apply the condition of payment. The statute and the regulations promulgated thereunder were unconstitutional. In so ruling, the court stated that the statute compelled the developer to pay more than its proportionate share of the moneys to be spent on parks, playgrounds, and recreational facilities for the town as a whole.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff State of New York sought summary judgment and defendant optical company sought judgment on the pleadings and to strike out a reply; or, in the alternative, for summary judgment on the action and counterclaims, in the State's action commenced to annul the company's corporate charter on the grounds that it engaged in the unlawful practice of optometry and ophthalmic dispensing under N.Y. Educ. Law &sect; 7109.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The company employed optometrists to examine customers to determine whether they needed eyeglasses, what type of lenses they needed, and to prescribe lenses. Opthalmic dispensers in the company's employ made and fit eyeglasses in another part of the store. The court held that (1) N.Y. Educ. Law &sect; was aimed at regulating the sale of bargain counter reading glasses, but did not sanction the company's employment of optometrists to write prescriptions; (2) every citizen had the right to an occupation, subject however to government supervision in the interest of the public welfare; (3) seven bills that prohibited a corporation from practicing optometry directly or through a licensed optometrist failed to pass the legislature in the previous three sessions; (4) the law did not confine an optometrist employed by a corporation to the simple determination as to whether a customer should select readymade glasses because such a limitation had no relation to the protection of the health, welfare, or safety of the public; and (5) the State's allegation that the company represented to the public that it provided complete optical care raised issues of fact precluding complete summary judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied the State's motion for summary judgment, limited to the propriety of the company's employment of optometrists and opticians as a necessary incident to the sale of eyeglasses at retail. The court granted partial summary judgment to the company only to the extent of declaring that the employment of optometrists and opticians as a necessary incident to the sale of eyeglasses was not unlawful.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Though a corporation is not a person who can be licensed to practice optometry (optometrist) or ophthalmic dispensing (optician), a corporation may employ licensed optometrists for the limited purpose of examining the eyes of its customers in connection with the sale of eyeglasses at retail, and for this purpose the corporation may utilize their skill to determine the need for eyeglasses and the prescription to meet such need; and similarly, as a necessary incident to the sale of eyeglasses, the corporation may employ licensed ophthalmic dispensers (opticians) who read the optometrist's prescription and select the lens to conform with such prescription and who adapt the eyeglasses to the customer's face.  (Education Law, &sect;&sect; 7109, 7120.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.

Penal Law &sect; 1747-d(3), the conclusive presumption of illegality of use deprived him of the right to challenge the premise, denied him a fair opportunity to have been heard, and was arbitrary, unreasonable, and violative of the Due Process Clause.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, who was arrested for possession of a hypodermic syringe and needle, asserted that &sect; 1747-d(3) subjected him to penal consequences by the mere fact of possession without regard to criminal intent. The court dismissed the indictment, holding that the portion of &sect; 1747-d(3) which imposed criminal liability through the creation of a conclusive and irrebutable presumption of guilt based on mere possession of an instrument used essentially for useful and necessary purposes was an unreasonable exercise of police power and was unconstitutional as violative of the Due Process Clause. To have presumed illegality of purpose by virtue of possession alone of an inherently innocuous instrument was to have sanctioned a proposition that was predicated upon a fact whose verity ran counter to universal experience. The object was not inherently dangerous or sinister wherein there was a sufficient relationship between the fact proved and the crime presumed. The statute, which sought, without more, to conclusively equate possession of an object not inherently dangerous, noxious, or harmful with illegality of purpose was unreasonable and therefore constitutionally infirm.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff taxpayers sought an order decreeing a lien for the fair value of legal services rendered by their attorney in invalidating defendant city's real property transfer tax.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayers brought an action against the city which sought to invalidate a real property transfer tax. After successfully invalidating the tax, the taxpayers' filed a motion to assess an attorney's lien for fees against a fund allegedly created for the refunding of the invalidated tax. The court noted that ordinarily, an attorney could not recover legal fees from persons other than his client, merely because such persons were benefited by his services. However, a ground for charging a legal fee to persons who did not retain the attorney claiming the fee existed where the efforts of the attorney resulted in the creation or the distribution of a fund for the benefit of the persons sought to be charged as well as for the benefit of the client who retained the attorney. Nevertheless, the judgment here had not created any fund in which others than the taxpayers had any interest, nor was such a fund created by operation of the doctrine of stare decisis. While the judgment had established the rights of other taxpayers who paid under protest to recover the amounts of their payments as general creditors of the defendants, no fund whatsoever had resulted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied the motion of the taxpayers where no fund resulted for the payment of the attorney's fees.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Actions -- representative action -- expenses and legal fees -- judgment in action brought by individuals for return of tax payments not subject to amendment to transform it to determination of rights of all persons similarly situated -- motion for reimbursement of expenses and legal fees denied since action was not representative nor did it create fund in which others could share -- theory that recovery of expenses is justified because others will benefit under stare decisis not applicable in this case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. After successful prosecution of an action against the City of New York for the return to plaintiffs of certain Real Property Transfer Tax payments made by them, plaintiffs and their attorney applied for an order decreeing that the judgment be modified to provide that it constituted a determination of the rights of all persons who made tax payments under similar circumstances and that plaintiffs and their attorney were entitled to reimbursement for expenses and legal fees from the &quot;fund&quot; thus created by them for the benefit of persons similarly situated. Since&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the first action was not brought as a class or representative suit, nor did it directly or indirectly create a fund in which others could share, the motion must be denied and the injunction against defendants' payment of refunds and against prosecution of suits by other taxpayers must be dismissed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Mere mention in the complaint that others were affected by the tax did not transform the action into a class or representative suit, where neither the title of the action nor any of the pleadings contained a statement indicating that plaintiffs purported to sue on behalf of anyone but themselves.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff public housing tenant filed a motion for an injunction against defendant public housing authority, as well as its employees and agents, from taking any action in furtherance of a housing conversion plan pending final determination of the public housing tenant's declaratory judgment action.

The court refused to pass judgment upon the legislative policy or administrative discretion, holding that the public housing tenant had shown no illegality or fraud. The court further held that the public housing tenant had not suffered and would not suffer any irreparable injury, the harm to his children from having to change schools and injury to his furniture in transit being incident to any moving of a home from one school district to another and thus incidents of living in a populous community.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Public housing -- limited profit housing companies -- proposed leasing of low income public housing project to limited dividend housing company for operation as co-operative with occupancy by middle income tenants did not violate New York Constitution (art. XVIII, &sect; 6) or Mitchell-Lama Limited-Profit Housing Companies Law (Public Housing Law, art. 12); court will not interfere with Housing Authority's determination of what constitutes &quot;low income&quot; within statutory definition; tenant in project was not irreparably injured by relocation to another project at Authority's expense and had no cause of action to restrain and annul proposed leasing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The proposal that a State-aided public housing project constructed in Buffalo for, and restricted to occupancy by, &quot;Persons of low income&quot; (N. Y.  Const., art. XVIII, &sect; 6; Public Housing Law, &sect; 17), be converted to occupancy by middle income tenants at substantially higher rentals by the defendant Housing Authority's leasing the project to a limited dividend housing company for operation as a&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  co-operative was not unconstitutional or contrary to the Mitchell-Lama Limited-Profit Housing Companies Law (Public Housing Law, art. 12, added by L. 1955, ch. 407, as amd.), and was a scheme not to evade the law but rather to comply therewith.  The State Constitution and Public Housing Law refer to &quot;low income&quot; as distinguished from the Federal statute's reference to &quot;lowest income&quot; (U. S. Code, tit.  42, &sect; 1402), and inasmuch as standards of income and rent vary in different communities and times, the general definitions of the Legislature (Public Housing Law, &sect; 3, subds. 18, 23), leaving their application to the local authority, are constitutional.  Accordingly, the application of the Mitchell-Lama Law to a plan for public housing that appears to benefit a &quot;middle income group&quot; was not unconstitutional if their income was insufficient to pay rentals high enough to attract private industry to build adequate, safe and sanitary housing for them.  The court, which takes judicial notice of the great increase in income and building costs since World War II, will not, in the absence of fraud or illegality, judge legislative policy or administrative discretion or take from the local authority&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the power to determine what constitutes &quot;low income&quot; or &quot;low rent&quot; at a given time and place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. A tenant in the low income housing project in question has not suffered, and will not suffer, irreparable injury by the proposed conversion. As a tenant on a month-to-month term, he had no vested rights affected by the proposed lease of the project to the limited dividend housing company.  Moreover, the defendant Municipal Housing Authority will comply with the tenants' preferences for relocation at other public housing projects and will provide for such moving at its expense.  Such inconveniences to the tenant as changing his children's schools or injury to his furniture in transit are incident to any such moving and to living in a populous community.  Accordingly, the tenant was not entitled to an order enjoining acts in furtherance of the conversion plan, and his complaint stated no cause of action for a declaratory judgment against the Authority, which was entitled to summary judgment.  </SPAN></P>

The area was about 12,000 square feet. After a building inspector refused to issue a building permit, the company appealed. Invalidating the ordinance as to the property, the court said that the effect of the declaration of invalidity of the amendment was to restore the zoning applicable prior to that amendment to Residence C (10,000 sq. ft.) zoning. The enactment of a new amendment substantially the same as the nullified amendment was not effective to avoid the consequences of the judgment. Overruling the company's challenge to the procedure, the court said that the Board had jurisdiction to make the determination complained of under N.Y. Town Law, &sect; 267(2). The Board neither granted nor denied the appeal to it from the refusal to issue the permit.

Defendant refused to take a blood test. Defendant argued that N.Y. Veh. &amp; Traf. Law &sect; 1192 required that he could not be convicted after pleading not guilty unless it was shown by means of a chemical test that there was at least a minimum percentage by weight of alcohol in his blood. Defendant argued that because no chemical test was available to establish the minimum percentage of alcohol required, a dismissal had to follow. The court held that it had to dismiss the information in view of the specific language of the statute. The court stated that violators of this new section did not have a means of escaping a penalty by refusing to take a blood test. Under N.Y. Veh. &amp; Traf. Law &sect; 1194, the Commissioner of Motor Vehicles was empowered to revoke an operator's license after a hearing, and temporarily suspend it without notice pending a determination. Defendant also moved that the information be dismissed arguing that the section was unconstitutional. Because defendant's motion to dismiss was granted on other grounds, it was unnecessary for the court to pass upon the section's constitutionality.</SPAN></P>

The court held that &sect; 1143 was unconstitutional, so it reversed the judgment of conviction and dismissed the information. Section 1143 was too vague and indefinite to afford a comprehensible guide as to what a driver had to do and what had to be avoided, so that an ordinary member of society could not comply with its requirements. Section 1143(a) required vehicles about to enter or cross a highway from a private road or driveway to yield the right of way to all vehicles approaching on the highway. The use of the word &quot;all&quot; was confusing, especially because of the use of the word &quot;any&quot; in &sect; 1143(b), and &sect; 1143 did not establish a comprehensible standard of the rule to be obeyed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state appealed a judgment rendered by the magistrate's court (New York), which granted defendant's motion to dismiss the complaint and found that the New York City, N.Y., Traffic Regulation &sect; 51(a) was vague, indefinite, imprecise, and unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant made a U-turn and was charged with violation of &sect; 51(a), which prohibited turning the vehicle &quot;so as to proceed&quot; in the opposite direction upon any street in a &quot;business district.&quot; The trial court granted defendant's motion to dismiss, and found that the regulation was vague and unconstitutional. The trial court found that &quot;business district&quot; was not defined, and &quot;so as to proceed&quot; denoted purpose. It was possible, the trial court found, that defendant turned to park or for some purpose other than to proceed. The court dismissed the appeal and found that anybody would have been aware that the area where the turn was made was a business district. The court also held that it did not matter what the purpose of the turn was. The court dismissed the appeal because the motion to dismiss filed in the trial court was on the merits, and contended that the state failed to prove its case. The state did not have a right of appeal from that judgment. The court found that subjecting defendant to a new trial would have placed him in double jeopardy.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court dismissed the state's appeal of the dismissal of the charges against defendant for making a U-turn because the state had no right of appeal.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Subdivision (a) of section 51 of the New York City Traffic Regulations, which provides that &quot;the driver of any vehicle shall not turn such vehicle so as to proceed in the opposite direction upon any street in a business district&quot;, is valid and constitutional in an area which is visibly a business district (Vehicle and Traffic Law, &sect; 105; cf. &sect;&sect; 1640, 1642), even in the absence of any sign prohibiting U-turns, and even if the driver's object were merely to park and not to proceed in the opposite direction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. In this case, after a full trial, the Magistrates' Court of the City of New York granted a motion which defendant had made for a dismissal on the ground that guilt had not been proved beyond a reasonable doubt, and acquitted the defendant, with an opinion which erroneously held that subdivision (a) of section 51 of the New York City Traffic Regulations is so vague&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  as to be unconstitutional.  Since this ruling was made at the end of the entire case, with an acquittal, this appellate court -- the Appellate Part of the Court of Special Sessions of the City of New York -- cannot grant a new trial (Code Crim. Pro., &sect; 9) and cannot entertain this appeal by the People from the judgment of acquittal (Code Crim. Pro., &sect;&sect; 326, 518, subd. 3).  Therefore, in spite of the erroneous ruling of law below, this appeal by the People is dismissed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The county wanted to demolish the hotel owner's parking garage to build a free public library. The loss of those parking facilities would destroy a large segment of its hotel business and its public parking business, No compensation had yet been to the hotel owner for the proposed taking.

Laws 758 was unconstitutional because at any time prior to the granting of the final decree and the vesting of title to the lands in the county, the county board of supervisors could, by unilateral resolution, order the discontinuance or abandonment of the proceeding, leaving the hotel without power to collect any &quot;damages&quot; as a result of the temporary taking; in other words, the hotel owner contended that the expression used in 1937 N.Y. Laws 758 &sect; 9, namely, &quot;reasonable and necessary expenses and disbursements incurred by each person who has appeared in the proceeding,&quot; did not include or cover the &quot;damages&quot; sustained by such person.

The trial court granted the motion and dismissed the information. The State appealed. The court reversed. The case law decisions were distinguishable because in those cases the statute had completely prohibited or destroyed an otherwise lawful business, whereas N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 436-d was a reasonable regulation that prevented fraud on the public. Section 436-d contained no restriction on the publishing, distribution, or sale of any magazine, but reasonably restricted the sale of published and distributed magazines without covers in order to combat an evil found to exist in the fraudulent sale of magazines owned by publishers following a recall.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The applicants formed an association and applied for incorporation. The Attorney-General examined one of the incorporators under oath and gave notice that he would oppose approval of the certificate, but refused to provide a copy of the examination transcript or provide the basis of his objection. The applicants tendered a revised certificate on judicial review. The Attorney-General opposed the application on the basis it violated the anti-trust provisions of N.Y. Gen. Bus. Law &sect; 340 and agreed to provide the court, but not the applicants, a copy of his records on basis that N.Y. Gen. Bus. Law &sect; 343 prevented disclosure to the applicants. Because the only persons involved in the hearing were the applicants, the policy of &sect; 343 was not detrimentally affected by the disclosure to the applicants. Without the facts contained in the Attorney-General's records, the court was unable to exercise its semi-administrative discretion to arrive at its own conclusion. The offer to provide the court but not the applicants a copy of the record was unfair.

C.P.L.R. art. 78, which denied the college's application for a special exception, as provided by Village of Old Westbury, N.Y., Zoning Ordinance &sect; 401(11), to alter a residence into student housing. Intervenors, neighborhood association and adjacent property owners, excepted to portions of the college's petition.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The college sought a license for the construction of student housing for an experimental college in a zoning district that normally allowed single family residences on two-acre parcels. The board denied the permit on the grounds that the parcel subject to the college itself could have accommodated up to 5,000 students and that population density was against the public health and welfare. On the college's petition for judicial review, the court refused to consider whether the college had been discriminated against by the board's denial. On the college's challenge to the constitutional validity of Zoning Ordinance &sect; 401, the court held that the board had improperly construed certain ordinance subdivisions against the college. The existence of more suitable sites was irrelevant. The board's conclusion that the low local proportion of enrollment in the college would have been unaltered was without basis. The board improperly considered the maximum occupancy of the college as opposed to the college's asserted plan. Denial of the permit was arbitrary and unreasonable, but the board was entitled to assurances of as to the maximum student population allowed by the college.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the board's determination and held that the reasons given by the board were insufficient for the denial of the use permit to the college.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Municipal corporations -- zoning -- determination of Board of Zoning Appeals denying special exception use permit to establish small experimental college reversed and matter remanded to board -- findings of board unauthorized -- only standards constitutionally applicable to petitioner are whether use will be hazardous to health or safety or detrimental to public welfare -- further application necessary before exceeding stated limits of use -- application subject to subsequent amendment to zoning ordinance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Petitioner applied for a special exception use permit under the zoning ordinance of defendant village to establish in a Residence BB district of the village a small experimental college in connection with the parent institution.  The Board of Zoning Appeals denied the application.  The question whether petitioner is discriminated against by the requirement that it obtain a use permit is not one that may properly be presented for determination, since there is before the court no respondent who could be directed to issue a permit were the court to conclude that the ordinance is discriminatory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. In this proceeding the court may consider the constitutionality of the standards&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  applied by the Board of Zoning Appeals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The provisions of the zoning ordinance which require the zoning board to consider traffic problems and accessibility of fire and police protection to the property pertain to applications made under subdivisions 1, 4, 14, 17 and 18 of section 1002 of the ordinance. Since the application in question was made under subdivision 15, the board was not authorized to consider such factors in connection with its determination.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. In denying the application, the board stated that there were other areas in the Residence BB district which might be suitable for college purposes.  The ordinance, however, requires the board to find that the proposed use &quot;will not be feasible or practical in a less restricted district&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. The board's finding that only nine students residing in the village presently attend petitioner's classes is both unauthorized and a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">non sequitur</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, for this finding does not necessitate the conclusion that a similarly small proportion will be part of the 120 to 600 students attending the experimental college.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. Notwithstanding that the plan of the village is for a low population density, the board improperly reasoned that the density&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  concentrated on the property in question would be almost three times that of the population of the whole village, since the Village Board has legislatively determined that a density in excess of the present village norm is consistent with the general welfare.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. In considering a college application, the only standards set forth in subdivision 24 of section 1002 of the ordinance that may constitutionally be applied are that the proposed use will not create a hazard to health or safety or otherwise be detrimental to public welfare.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. Petitioner must make a further application before it can exceed the stated outside limits of the use presently proposed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. Petitioner's application was made prior to December, 1959.  On December 14, 1959 the ordinance was amended to provide that uses under special exception permits are limited to those set forth in a statement accompanying the application.  The application is subject to that amendment, for the court must decide the proceeding according to the law existing at the time of its decision.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">10. The matter is remanded to the board with directions (1) to consider what, if any, modifications of the height restrictions and marginal roadway requirements&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  need be granted, and then to issue a use permit valid for at least 10 years, or (2) if the board so sees fit, to require that the college file the additional data required to bring its application within subdivision 15 of section 1002 of the ordinance, as amended, in which event the board should consider the application anew.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The accident victims alleged that they were injured by the state's negligent maintenance of a stretch of highway upon which the accident occurred. The state argued that the claims were not filed within the statutory time limit, that an enabling act (act) conferring jurisdiction on the court to hear claimants' case violated N.Y. Const. art. III, &sect; 19, and that claimants failed to establish the state's negligence, their freedom from contributory negligence, and the proximate cause of the accident. The court dismissed the wrongful death claim and rendered judgment for the accident victims on their personal injury and medical expense claims. The act was unconstitutional as to the wrongful death claim because its effect was to provide a period of two years and six months in which to file the action against the state whereas such an action between citizens of the state had to be filed within two years of the date of death. The act did not contravene the state constitution as to the other claims because its effect was to extend the period of time for filing the action to two years and six months whereas a three-year period was available for such actions between citizens.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Chapter 246 of the Laws of 1958, which was enacted to permit claimants to sue the State for damages resulting when a motor vehicle was involved in an accident, is unconstitutional as to the claim for damages for wrongful death. Section 19 of article III of the New York State Constitution provides that: &quot;No claim against the state shall be audited, allowed or paid which, as between citizens of the state, could be barred by lapse of time.&quot; The enabling act, in providing for an additional six months in which to file a claim to recover for the wrongful death after claimant had already had available to it a tribunal for the enforcement of the right for a period of two years ( Court of Claims Act, &sect; 10), provides a period of two years and six months for the bringing of this claim, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  whereas such an action as between citizens of the State must be filed within two years of the date of death (Decedent Estate Law, &sect; 130).  The claim for wrongful death is dismissed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The statute is not unconstitutional as to the claims for personal injuries since the applicable Statute of Limitations as between citizens of the State is three years (Civ. Prac. Act, &sect; 49), and the effect of the enabling act was to extend the period for filing the claims to two years and six months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. As an automobile driven by decedent and owned by her husband, and in which the other claimants were passengers, rounded a left curve on a highway, it skidded out of control on the wet, slippery pavement and struck some trees on the shoulder of the road.  Concededly, the District Safety Engineer had recommended that the curve have a warning sign of 35 miles per hour as a safe speed, but there was no such warning sign and no sign of a curve. The road was not only slippery but it was rough.  The sole proximate cause of the accident was the negligence of the State in the failure to adequately place signs at a known dangerous condition and to use ordinary care in the maintenance of the highway.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Awards&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  are made to claimants. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff town sought an injunction preventing defendant business, a sand and gravel pit, from continuing unless it complied with a new zoning ordinance regarding nonconforming uses. The town moved for summary judgment. The sand and gravel business sought to have the zoning ordinance declared unconstitutional as applied to its property.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The sand and gravel business had operated for years before any zoning. The business had invested substantial value in lands, plant, and structures. In 1945 the town adopted its first zoning ordinance, placing the property in a residential zone but containing a provision for nonconforming uses. The ordinance was amended several times. Amendments discontinued nonconforming use for &quot;natural products uses,&quot; meaning sand and gravel pits. At the expiration of a short period, the nonconforming use must be discontinued. In a prior suit, this amendment was held unconstitutional as applied to the subject property. In 1959, the town enacted an entire new zoning ordinance. Again, the right to absolute continuance of nonconforming uses was preserved except for the sand and gravel pit, which was given five years upon application before it would be forced to relocate. The business ignored the ordinance. The town sued and sought summary judgment. The motion was denied. The ancient rule in New York was that nonconforming uses could not be terminated if there was a substantial investment in them. Whether that rule still applied was an issue needing clarification and precluding summary judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The town's motion for summary judgment was denied.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowners were owner occupants of certain residential properties located in an area known as the Flatlands area of Brooklyn, which was designated by the city planning commission as a predominantly vacant area characterized by certain of the blighting conditions specified in &sect; 72-n. Such a designation was a requisite preliminary step to the city's condemnation of the area for clearance and redevelopment purposes. The landowners filed their action, and the court granted the city's motion for judgment on the pleadings. Section 72-n provided for taking of private property for public use. Eminent domain was one of the powers inherent in the state. A purpose for the acquisition of land, designated to facilitate other projects such as slum clearance, was in the public interest even though the property taken might ultimately be sold to private interests. The landowners did not meet their onerous burden of overcoming the presumption that the legislative enactment was presumed to be constitutional and supported by facts known to the legislative body.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under article XVIII of the State Constitution and section 72-n of the General Municipal Law, a city validly designated a predominantly vacant but partially improved area, which was not a slum and which was &quot;without tangible physical blight&quot;, as &quot;blighted&quot;, in that the area had such irregular subdivisions and such poorly designed street patterns and such scattered improvements as to render the area incapable of effective development ( General Municipal Law, &sect; 72-n, subd. 1, par. a, cls.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The hotel owner's premises had not been subject to rent control because it had been operated as a hotel. A proceeding was instituted by the administrator, which resulted in an order determining that the premises was no longer a hotel. The administrator exercised control over those tenants whose occupancy was continuous. The administrator fixed a maximum rent on the basis of comparable accommodations and reduced the rents by approximately fifty percent. The court held that hotels were excepted from rent control by Section 2 of the State Residential Rent Law, but not &quot;pseudo hotels&quot; that were in reality rooming houses with hotel names. The court held that the &quot;pseudo hotel&quot; situation might require correction and regulation by the administrator. However, the hotel owner's premises had never been under rent control and there was no evidence that it was a &quot;pseudo hotel.&quot; The language of the State Residential Rent Law provided only for the &quot;recontrol&quot; of premises that at some earlier time had already been under rent control.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owners alleged that the zoning ordinance was unconstitutional, illegal, and invalid as not being passed for the purpose of public, health, safety, and morals as required by Camillus, N.Y. Town Law &sect; 263. They also alleged that it constituted a violation of Camillus, N.Y. Town Laws &sect; 261-263. The property owners alleged that it granted a zoning change upon conditions or agreements, which was an unauthorized delegation of legislative power. There was some doubt as to whether the zoning ordinance was enacted pursuant to any comprehensive plan. The court did not pass on the legality or illegality of a covenant to run with the land. The court felt that sufficient issues of fact had been raised regarding the alleged illegality of the proceeding under Camillus, N.Y. Town Law art. 16 that to grant summary judgment on affidavits would be an abuse of discretion. The property owners alleged that the theatre's application, the notice of public hearing, and the notice of the amendment of the zoning ordinance were all defective.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner bus driver applied for an order under N.Y. C.P.L.R. art. 78 directing respondent Commissioner of Motor Vehicles to cancel and annul the revocation of the bus driver's license to operate a motor vehicle. The bus driver was required to submit to a re-examination after being involved in three accidents in 18 months. The bus driver passed the written test, English test, and eye test, but failed the road test.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The examiner that failed the bus driver stated that the bus driver failed to keep to the right, used poor judgment in traffic and in approaching intersections, and swung wide on right turns and short on left turns. The bus driver denied that he made the mistakes charged to him and asserted that the Commissioner's action in revoking his license was arbitrary and unreasonable, that N.Y. Veh. &amp; Traf. Law &sect; 20(8) was unconstitutional in that there was no clear and reasonable norms established for the guidance of the Commissioner, and that &sect; 20(8) denied the bus driver the equal protection of the laws because it deprived him of the means of earning a livelihood. The court found that there was no need to decide the constitutionality question raised by the bus driver because the court held that the action of the Commissioner was arbitrary and unreasonable. The court found that the bus driver was a member in good standing of a bus driver association and had not been involved in any accident in which he was at fault. The court further found that the bus driver's employer had never charged him with negligence and that even the most inconsequential accidents required reporting.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court annulled the order of the Commissioner revoking the bus driver's motor vehicle operator's license and directed the Commissioner to re-examine the bus driver within 30 days.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Petitioner, a bus driver, was involved in three accidents within 18 months and was ordered to submit to a re-examination. He did not pass the road test and his license was revoked.  At a subsequent hearing held to determine whether such revocation was arbitrary, capricious and unreasonable, the president of the bus drivers' union of which petitioner is a member testified that petitioner is a &quot;very good operator&quot;, that he has not been involved in any accident in which he was at fault and that he has not been charged with negligence by his employer.  The facts also developed, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">inter alia</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, that when petitioner appeared for re-examination the license examiner refused to permit the use of the automobile in which he planned to take the test, for failure&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to display an inspection stamp, although his friend, who had just purchased the car, displayed the registration certificate stamped with a motor vehicle stamp that it was registered and inspected. Petitioner was forced to procure another car immediately, was re-examined, and of the nine persons re-examined that day, he was the only one failed.  On the basis of the facts, respondent's action is held to be arbitrary and unreasonable, the order of revocation is annulled, and respondent is directed to re-examine petitioner within 30 days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. In view of the above determination, the question of constitutionality of the statute (Vehicle and Traffic Law, &sect; 20, subd. 8) [providing in respect to the &quot;reexamination of licensees in certain cases and action thereon&quot;], if it is applied to an operator who became involved in three accidents within 18 months without any fault on his part, is not passed upon.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff complained that the statutory provisions regarding incorporating a village afforded them no method of challenge or right to vote in the incorporation proceedings. The court held that it lacked power to impose new requirements or change requirements already imposed by the legislature in the discharge of its legislative functions and that the legislature had not in its enactment of the Village Law given persons in the position of plaintiffs a right to stay incorporation. The court further held that failure of the legislature to give persons such as plaintiffs such a right did not render the law unconstitutional. The court further found that no meritorious cause of action was stated to warrant the issuance of a temporary injunction as well as that plaintiffs failed to show any irreparable harm. Rather, the court found that plaintiffs' greatest fears and objections were that the disputed area was, as part of an incorporated village, subject to undue, disproportionate, and burdensome taxation and regulation. There was no evidentiary showing that the village authorities would engage in unlawful acts.</SPAN></P>

Defendant challenged his conviction on the ground that the statute was unconstitutional, and the court affirmed the conviction. The court held that the statute was not vague or uncertain because its language was sufficiently definite to apprise the persons to whom it was addressed of the nature of the acts that were prohibited. There was no arbitrary discrimination that rendered the statute unconstitutional because the age provision was based on differences that were reasonably related to the purposes of the statute.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants established control of the hotel owner's premises in an administrative proceeding. The hotel owner claimed that its premises had never been subject to rent control and that its status as a hotel free of rent control could not be changed. The hotel owner filed a protest to the control of its premises by defendants, and then filed suit for a declaratory judgment. In its lawsuit, the hotel owner directly challenged the constitutionality of &sect;&sect; 2(b)(2), 4(b)(2). Defendants consented to the hotel owner's application for a temporary injunction. The court denied defendants' ensuing motion to dismiss the complaint. Because the hotel owner challenged the constitutionality and construction of &sect;&sect; 2(b)(2), 4(b)(2), administrative review and judicial review under N.Y. Civ. Prac. Act art. 78 was inadequate.

The councilman contended that such amendment was to be submitted to a referendum of the voters of the city at the next general election and was not to become effective unless and until approved by the general voters. The court denied the councilman's application and dismissed the proceeding. The court concluded that the disqualification of ineligibility contained in &sect; 62 when it was first enacted related to no lack of personal qualifications such as age, ability, experience, and integrity of a mayor. The court found that it was predicated upon the assumption that the mayor might have, through his appointive power, built up political &quot;rings&quot; and &quot;blocs&quot; and perpetuated himself in office.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Section 62 of the Charter of the City of Buffalo formerly provided that: &quot;Any mayor elected as such under this act for a full term of four years shall be ineligible for the next term after the termination of his office.&quot; Local Law No. 1 (1960), adopted by the Common Council of the City of Buffalo and approved by the Mayor, amended that section to provide: &quot;Any mayor heretofore or hereafter elected as such under this act shall be eligible for re-election.&quot; Said Local Law need not be submitted to a referendum of the voters of the City of Buffalo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Section 15 (subds. 3, 4) of the City Home Rule Law provides in part that a local law shall be subject to mandatory referendum if it changes the law of succession to the mayoralty if the office of Mayor is an elective&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  office. The Local Law changes the law of succession to the office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. However, section 1 of article I of the State Constitution provides that: &quot;No member of this state shall be disfranchised, or deprived of any of the rights or privileges secured to any citizen thereof, unless by the law of the land, or the judgment of his peers&quot;.  Section 1 of article XIII, after providing for the form of the oath of office to be taken by State officers, provides: &quot;and no other oath, declaration or test shall be required as a qualification for any office or public trust&quot;.  Under the Constitution, a statute may not be validly enacted containing arbitrary and unreasonable grounds of disqualification to hold office.  The disqualification of ineligibility contained in the prior section 62 relates to no lack of personal qualification such as age, ability, experience and integrity of a Mayor, but is predicated upon the assumption that he might through his appointive power build up political &quot;rings&quot; or &quot;blocs&quot; and perpetuate himself in office.  While this assumption was no doubt the basis of the original section 62, it has been shown that these conditions no longer exist.  The provision making a Mayor&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ineligible to succeed himself, under the present conditions, is arbitrary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. It is unnecessary to decide whether section 62 was or was not constitutional when it was adopted in 1927.  An act constitutional when adopted may become invalid by a change in the conditions to which it applies.  Conditions surrounding the office of Mayor have substantially changed since 1927.  </SPAN></P>

A substantial percentage of the children accepted for treatment had been characterized as &quot;psychotic&quot; or having such tendencies. The school was not a &quot;school&quot; in the accepted sense of that term; it was basically corrective in nature. It had been established and maintained for the care, custody, and treatment of children who were psychotic and the conduct of classes, while probably required by law and certainly beneficial to the welfare of the children, was, nevertheless, incidental to the basic purposes of the school. The municipality could have controlled the type of institution that sought to make its home in the community if the legislation did not violate state or federal constitutional provisions.

Petitioner, a private corporation established to care for boys who are, or are in danger of becoming, neglected or delinquent, appeals from a determination of respondent Town Building Inspector, denying petitioner's application for a permit to erect a school on property owned by it in a residential area.

In 1956, the insurer sought to acquire the stock of another Connecticut insurance company, which was engaged in the business of fire insurance. The insurer planned to operate the acquisition as a subsidiary. The commissioner advised the insurer that to do so would have resulted in revocation of its license to do business in New York. The court held that the legislature had not intended to permit a foreign insurer to conduct any other kind of insurance business through a subsidiary. The court noted that the legislature had liberalized N.Y. Ins. Law &sect; 90, which dealt with the type of investment a life insurance company could have made. By that time, the issue between the parties was well known to those interested. Nevertheless, the legislature had not changed or clarified N.Y. Ins. Law &sect; 42.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff landlord filed a declaratory judgment action challenging the constitutionality of New York City, N.Y., Local Laws No. 80 (1957), which prohibited property owners from denying accommodations on the basis of race, color or religion. The landlord asserted he had an inviolable right to rent his property to whomever he chose. The landlord and defendant New York City (New York) both filed summary judgment motions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On principle, the landlord objected to the anti-discrimination ordinance. He argued that if he only wished to rent to redheaded women, he had the inalienable right to do so. In granting the City's summary judgment motion, the court noted that it was unchallenged that governments had the power to enact regulations with regard to rental housing. Restrictions imposed with regard to the size, area, type of construction, window space, and sanitary facilities required for rental properties had all been unsuccessfully challenged in the past. Similarly, laws prohibiting racial discrimination with regard to employment were also found not to be constitutionally objectionable. The legislature had the power to decide what was in the public good of the community and to enact ordinances to promote that public good. The landlord had to yield to the legislative authority's determination that discrimination by landlords was not in the community's best interest.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied the landlord's motion for summary judgment. It granted the City's cross-motion for summary judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff residents and plaintiff association brought an actio against defendant town and defendant beach club, seeking a judgment declaring certain zoning ordinance amendments, enacted by the town's board, unconstitutional and invalid.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1953, the town rezoned an area from residential and business to business only. Under this amendment, beside other business uses, multiple dwellings were also permitted. Approximately four years later, the town at the request of the beach club amended the building zone ordinance again to allow multi-family dwellings. In response, the residents and the association brought their action, claiming the latter amendment was illegal spot zoning, both the 1953 and the latter amendments were zoning by contract and, therefore, void, and they were adversely affected. The court dismissed the complaint because the residents and the association failed to prove any damage or detriment to them, and thus, they were not aggrieved parties. In addition, the court found the association and residents failed to establish unconstitutionality beyond fair debate or beyond reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court dismissed the complaint filed by the association and the residents against the beach club and the town.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Municipal corporations -- zoning -- rezoning according to plan and restrictive covenants is not spot zoning or zoning by contract; besides, plaintiffs are not damaged; action to invalidate rezoning dismissed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. A rezoning amendment which is part of a comprehensive plan cannot be deemed illegal &quot;spot zoning&quot;.  Possible depreciation in the value of the plaintiffs' properties near the subject property is not of great significance, since the pecuniary profits of an individual are secondary to the public welfare.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Rezoning amendments which were unconditional cannot be deemed illegal &quot;zoning by contract&quot;.  The Town Board's requirement that the petitioning landowners execute and record a declaration of restrictions was within the board's governmental powers and in the town's best interests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Furthermore, an amendment to a zoning ordinance is a legislative act. Therefore, this act by the Town Board, as recorded in its journal, may not be attacked collaterally, and the courts may not inquire into the motives of the board or go behind the duly enacted legislation of the board in an attempt to seek its motive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Besides, in this action to declare the rezoning illegal and void, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the plaintiffs have failed to prove any damage or detriment to them, and hence they are not &quot;aggrieved&quot; parties.  Most of them are so far from the subject premises that they fail to show how they are affected by the rezoning; and the evidence offered to establish a lessening of their residence values is innocuous.  The civic association plaintiffs have no standing to maintain this action; they own no property which could be affected adversely by the zoning amendments.  The action is dismissed.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with a violation of N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 1141 on allegations that he did display and he did offer for sale several obscene magazines at his bookstore.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Several hundred magazines were confiscated from defendant's store, 12 of which formed the basis of the allegations against defendant. In dismissing the charges against defendant, the court first ruled that, despite defendant's exhibits in which he sought to establish that the magazines were not obscene based upon his proof of contemporary accepted standards in the community, the 12 magazines were obscene. The average person, applying contemporary community standards, would find that the dominant theme of the magazines taken as a whole appealed to prurient interest. The court ruled, however, that the record did not indicate that defendant had knowledge that the magazines were obscene. Under &sect; 1141, knowledge or scienter war required on the part of defendant as to the obscene material and content of the material in his possession for sale or distribution. Without a finding of knowledge on defendant's part, there could be no finding of guilty. Because the magazines were obscene, the court ordered that they be confiscated and destroyed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court discharged defendant, dismissed the charge against him, and ordered the magazines to be destroyed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- obscene books -- materials which form subject of charge of violation of section 1141 of Penal Law are obscene -- however, absent finding of knowledge by defendant of their obscene character, he is found not guilty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Defendant is charged with violation of section 1141 of the Penal Law, in that he displayed and offered for sale copies of obscene magazines. Employing, as the test of obscenity, whether to the average person, applying contemporary community standards, the dominant theme of the material taken as a whole appeals to prurient interests, and taking into consideration the exhibits produced on defendant's behalf as evidence of contemporary community standards, there is no doubt but that the materials which are the subject of this action are obscene.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. However, although subdivision 4 of section 1141 raises a presumption upon proof of possession of six books or magazines, obscene in nature, that the possession is presumptive evidence of intent to sell, lend, distribute or give away, that&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  subdivision was not intended to raise a presumption of guilty without a finding of knowledge.  As there is no mention in the record herein of defendant's knowledge of the obscene nature of the magazines upon which the charge is based, he is found not guilty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Because of their obscene nature, the said magazines are to be confiscated and destroyed. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff interested parties brought an action against defendant, a property owner, the City of Troy, and others, seeking a permanent injunction and a judgment to declare void a resolution of the City Common Council that granted the owner permission to erect a slaughterhouse and to also declare void a building permit issued to the owner. Pending before the court was plaintiffs' motion for a temporary injunction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The City had an ordinance that prohibited slaughterhouses within certain wards without first receiving permission from the City's Common Council. The proposed slaughterhouse was within one of the protected wards, and the City authorized the building by resolution. Plaintiffs contended that the granting of permission was a legislative act requiring an ordinance, rather than a resolution, and that the City failed to comply with N.Y. Second Class Cities Law &sect; 35. The court found that the granting of permission was an administrative act requiring only a resolution. Further, the permit was not void because the owner's property was never classified under the zoning ordinance and zoning laws could not be extended by implication. An affidavit of the City stated that all proceedings taken by the Council were in accordance with the rules of the Council. Therefore, plaintiffs failed to establish by clear and convincing evidence that the official action was illegal, that plaintiffs' rights were certain as to the law and the facts, and that there was a clear violation of law.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. By resolution of the Common Council, defendant was granted permission to erect a slaughterhouse in the City of Troy.  The plaintiffs are not entitled to a temporary injunction pending determination of the rights of the parties since they have not established a clear violation of the law which would authorize such action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The resolution of the council was an administrative act and therefore not subject to the requirements of section 35 of the Second Class Cities Law, which regulates legislative acts.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff car owner filed suit against defendant another car owner for damages sustained to plaintiff's automobile. Plaintiff alleged that defendant was negligent for having left his car unattended with the motor running in violation of N.Y. Veh. &amp; Traf. Law &sect; 1210(a). The matter was before the court upon the parties' cross-motions for summary judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After midnight, in the early morning hours of a winter day, defendant, who had attended a function, left to get he car which he had parked about a block and a half from the building in which the function was held. He drove his automobile back to the building intending to pick up his friend who was waiting for him. The building fronted on a boulevard, which had a vehicular service lane immediately adjacent to the sidewalk curb. Defendant got out of the passenger side door, leaving it open, in order to get his friend's attention. An unknown assailant then knocked down defendant. The assailant then jumped into defendant's car and drove it down the service road, running into and damaging several parked automobiles, one of which was plaintiff's. Defendant contended that the enactment of &sect; 1210(a) could not be so distorted in meaning as plaintiff suggested. The court concluded that, based upon the record before it, it could not, as a matter of law, grant a summary judgment to either party. The court determined that a material issue of fact existed as to whether defendant allowed the automobile to stand &quot;unattended&quot; as that term was used in the statute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied both parties' motions for summary judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Motor vehicles -- negligence -- leaving automobile unattended -- section 1210 (subd. [a]) of Vehicle and Traffic Law provides that motor vehicle shall not be left unattended without stopping engine, locking ignition, removing key and setting brake -- when defendant stepped out of automobile he was struck by assailant, who then drove automobile and damaged parked automobiles, one of which was plaintiff's -- motions for summary judgment denied -- questions of fact presented including whether automobile was left &quot;unattended&quot; and whether defendant was required to foresee what happened.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Section 1210 (subd. [a]) of the Vehicle and Traffic Law, effective July 1, 1958, provided that &quot;No person driving or in charge of a motor vehicle shall permit it to stand unattended without first stopping the engine, locking the ignition, removing the key, and effectively setting the brake thereon and, when standing upon any grade, turning the front wheels to the curb or side of the highway.&quot; Defendant had double parked his automobile and remained inside awaiting a friend.  When the friend came out of the building and did not see defendant, defendant got&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  out on the right-hand side of his automobile and motioned to his friend, leaving the right-hand door of the car open.  He was standing between the car and the car next to which he had double parked. At that time he was knocked forward by a stranger and, by the time he had recovered, his automobile was in motion going down the street.  The unknown assailant jumped into the automobile and drove it down the road, running into and damaging several parked automobiles, one of which was plaintiff's.  Plaintiff alleges defendant was negligent for having left his automobile unattended with the motor running in violation of the Vehicle and Traffic Law. A motion by plaintiff for summary judgment and a cross motion by defendant for a summary judgment are denied.  The statute was enacted both as a safety measure and to prevent theft. A question is presented as to whether the automobile was allowed to stand &quot;unattended&quot;.  If it were so unattended, a finding might be made of negligence.  On the other hand, if the presence of defendant under the circumstances did not deteriorate into lack of care or attention to the automobile, then the automobile stood &quot;attended&quot; within the meaning of the statute.&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Questions of fact are presented, including the question whether defendant was required to foresee the possibility of what happened. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant filed a motion to dismiss his indictment for the crime of violating N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 1141 in relation to his distribution of a magazine entitled &quot;1958 Annual Sunshine and Health etc.&quot;</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After defendant was arrested for a violation of &sect; 1141, he sought a full preliminary hearing in the court of special sessions. Subsequently an information was filed, defendant's motion to dismiss was denied, and defendant obtained a certificate pursuant to N.Y. City Crim. Ct. Act &sect; 31. When defendant was directed be prosecuted by indictment, the grand jury found the indictment, and defendant filed a motion to dismiss. The court denied the motion, holding that by applying for a jury trial pursuant to &sect; 31, defendant subjected himself to whatever charges the grand jury found to be established by the proof. Moreover, the district attorney had the discretion in proceeding under either N.Y. Crim. Proc. Code &sect; 22-a or under N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 1141. Defendant's prosecution under &sect; 1141 did not violate U.S. Const. amend. XIV on its face, as construed, or as applied. Although freedom of the press was a cherished constitutional guarantee, obscenity was not within the area of constitutionally protected speech. Further, prior decisions that found the magazine in issue not to be obscene did not apply to defendant's indictment because each issue was regarded as a separate publication.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- obscene periodical -- section 1141 of Penal Law is not </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">unconstitutional</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> restraint on publication of periodicals -- Post Office approval of publication does not bind District Attorney or Grand Jury -- United States Supreme Court's approval of 1955 issue of periodical does not adjudge purity of much more lascivious 1958 issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. An information in the New York City Court of Special Sessions charged that defendant possessed an obscene magazine with intent to sell it (Penal Law, &sect; 1141).  He obtained a certificate and an order that the charge be prosecuted by indictment ( N. Y. City Crim. Cts. Act, &sect; 31) and thus be tried by jury.  A Grand Jury then handed up an indictment which properly charged more acts (under Penal Law, &sect; 1141) than were originally charged in the information.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The indictment was properly signed by the assistant foreman of the Grand Jury (Code Crim. Pro., &sect; 268).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. A District Attorney need not first apply for an injunction (Code Crim. Pro., &sect; 22-a) before prosecuting by action (Penal Law, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &sect; 1141).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4.  Section 1141 of the Penal Law, when applied to periodicals, does not in effect constitute a prior restraint on publication, in violation of the United States Constitution (14th Amdt.).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. A letter from the United States Post Office Department stating that this 1958 issue of this magazine -- the issue for which this indictment was handed up -- is not obscene, does not bind this court; nor does a similar opinion, if any, of the District Attorney of a nearby county.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. A decision of the United States Supreme Court that a 1955 issue of this magazine was not obscene is not </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">res judicata</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> or carte blanche for all subsequent issues of the magazine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. Moreover, this 1958 issue contains many more possibly obscene pictures than did the 1955 issue, and 10 of them are full-page in color. The dominant theme of this 1958 issue is such that a petit jury could legally find defendant guilty under section 1141 of the Penal Law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. The Grand Jury minutes show that the Grand Jury had sufficient legal evidence before it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. Accordingly, defendant's motion for an inspection of the Grand Jury minutes and a dismissal of the indictment is denied.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The retailer operated many grocery stores in the state. Aspirin tablets were sold at these stores along with other over the counter medicines. After the state agencies required the retailer to obtain registration certificates to sell aspirin tablets, the retailed filed a declaratory judgment action to determine whether such registration was required. Both sides moved for summary judgment, and the court granted the retailer's motion. The court first determined that the aspirin at issue was a proprietary medicine which was excepted from the statutory registration requirement. The court then held that regulation of the sale of aspirin tablets was not a proper exercise of the state's police power because such regulation was not necessary for the protection of public health or welfare. The state could not, under the guise of protecting the public, arbitrarily interfere with private business or prohibit lawful occupations or impose unreasonable and unnecessary restrictions upon them.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The claimant's land was taken by the city as part of a redevelopment program. As part of the redevelopment program, the city first took land adjacent to the land of the claimant and several months later took the claimant's land. The claimant's expert witness testified that the value of the property increased as a result of the taking of the adjacent property and the proposed redevelopment. The claimant contended that the court should have considered the impact of the first taking on the value of the claimant's property in awarding damages and sought for reconsideration of the court's decision. The claimant also requested that the court take additional testimony and that it render a new decision. The court denied the claimant's motion because the expert's testimony as to the impact of the first taking on the value of the claimant's property was speculative where there was no guarantee that his property would be taken or that the redevelopment program would be completed. The court also determined that the claimant was not entitled to have the court take additional testimony where claimant should have been aware of such evidence at the time of the original hearing.</SPAN></P>

This motion by the claimants for a reconsideration of the testimony and the law and for the taking of additional testimony is denied.  The law was not misunderstood.

Defendant petitioned for resentence on the ground that he was not a fourth felony offender under N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 1942 and that the statute was unconstitutional when an adjudication under that section was based on &quot;foreign&quot; convictions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of burglary and sentenced as a fourth felony offender. Defendant had been charged with 12 prior convictions outside of the state, and defendant was resentenced as a 12-felony offender. Defendant sought resentencing on the grounds that he was not a fourth-felony offender under N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 1942 and that &sect; 1942 was unconstitutional. The court reviewed 12 charges against defendant and determined that three of the crimes should not have been counted because they either would not have been felonies in New York or they had been withdrawn.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.  Section 1942 of the Penal Law, requiring increased punishment of a defendant who is four times convicted, either in this State or in any other State or nation, of felonies in New York or of crimes in other States or nations which would be felonies if committed in New York, is constitutional.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Defendant was convicted in New York State of the felony of burglary, second degree, and was sentenced, as being at least a fourth felony offender, under section 1942 of the Penal Law. The court found that this defendant, who was charged with 12 prior out-of-State felony convictions, had been thus convicted previously, at least 8 times, in other States -- Kansas, Texas, and Massachusetts -- of crimes which, if committed in this State, would be felonies. In so finding, the court examined the statutes of those States defining the crimes for which defendant was convicted, and examined the operative allegations&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and findings of the indictments or informations and judgments under such of those statutes as disjunctively defined both a felony and a misdemeanor ( </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">People </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">v.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11"> Olah</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 300 N.

The court thus counted as prior felony convictions 1 burglary conviction in Kansas, 1 burglary conviction in Texas, 1 larceny conviction in Massachusetts, and 5 convictions in Massachusetts of breaking and entering in the daytime with intent to commit a felony. The court concluded that, even if the court were to count as only one conviction those of the out-of-State convictions which were rendered at the same time on defendant's pleas of guilty, there would still be 4 out-of-State felony convictions prior to defendant's fifth felony conviction, the one in New York State.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant alleged that his conviction for improperly passing over the center line was in error because the statute was unconstitutional as being too vague and indefinite to constitute a sufficient definition of criminal conduct, and contained no sufficient standard whereby such conduct could be tested. Defendant also argued that the prosecution failed to prove his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. The court reversed defendant's conviction. Section 1124 was unconstitutional because it was not clear, concise, and positive enough to give a definite and unequivocal definition from which either a citizen or the police could have any criteria on which to base what the law required. As for the evidentiary challenge, the court held that the evidence adduced by the prosecution was insufficient under the vague wording of the statute to sustain a conviction. The testimony was conflicting and confusing as to distances and speed. There was insufficient evidence to show incomplete or complete passing; sufficiency or insufficiency of distance; clear visibility; and interference or noninterference with safe operation.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to N.Y. C.P.L.R. 78, petitioner corporation sought to compel respondent New York Harness Racing Commission to reimburse federal income taxes as required by &sect; 45-a(10) of the Pari-Mutuel Revenue Law (Revenue Law) (amend. 1959), notwithstanding ch. 8, &sect; 7 of the Laws of 1959, which had deleted the federal income tax credit.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Upon finishing improvements to its horse racing track, the corporation sought reimbursement for federal income taxes, pursuant to &sect; 45-a(10) of the Revenue Law (amend. 1959). After the Commission refused to reimburse the taxes, the corporation sought review. However, while the appeal was pending, the legislature passed ch. 8, &sect; 7 of the Laws of 1959, which deleted the federal income tax credit. In reversing, the court held that the Revenue Law had been completely free from ambiguity and that the Commission had acted as if there was no reference in the Revenue Law to include taxes. Moreover, the court held that because the Revenue Law had been so clearly opposite of the 1959 amendment, the 1959 amendment could not be given effect retroactively. The court held that because the legislature had intended to give credit for federal income taxes under the Revenue Law, the 1959 amendment could not change the Revenue Law's intent. Finally, the court held that because the state had granted the corporation a statutory privilege and the corporation had relied on this privilege, a contract had been created, the obligation of which could not be impaired by subsequent legislation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court ordered the Commission to reimburse the corporation for federal income taxes as required by the Revenue Law.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional law -- impairment of statutory contract -- </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">statute</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> pursuant to which race track corporation spent large sum on capital improvement, from which State would derive revenues, cannot be amended so as to repeal statutory promise to permit corporation to reimburse itself, out of its income, not only for cost of improvement, but for Federal income taxes which corporation will pay on such part of income.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The Pari-Mutuel Revenue Law (L. 1940, ch. 254, as amd.) was further amended (L. 1956, ch. 837) so as to add a section 45-a whereby harness race track corporations would be induced to make large capital improvements which would increase attendance and thereby increase the State's revenues.  The inducement offered to said corporations was that they could deposit income in special &quot;construction accounts&quot; and that the State Harness Racing Commission would authorize them to repay, out of such special accounts, not only the cost of such an improvement but to reimburse themselves for Federal income taxes which they had paid on such income (&sect; 45-a, subd. 10).  These statutory provisions were clear and unambiguous; and when petitioner&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  corporation, in reliance thereon, spent $ 19,517,469.92 for a capital improvement authorized by the commission, and then deposited income in such a special account, a contract was created with the State which the Legislature could not constitutionally, subsequently impair.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Accordingly, when the commission authorized petitioner to withdraw $ 2,858,495.38 from the special account towards repayment of petitioner's expenditure of $ 19,517,469.92, the commission became obligated further to authorize petitioner to reimburse itself out of said special account for $ 1,404,664.63 which petitioner paid to the United States as income tax on said $ 2,858,495.38.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. When the commission refused, petitioner commenced this proceeding (Civ. Prac. Act, art. 78).  While this proceeding was pending, the Legislature (L. 1959, ch. 881) purported to amend said subdivision 10 of section 45-a, by stating its &quot;intent * * * to clarify what was its intent&quot; and so as to delete the provision for Federal income tax reimbursement and so as to state expressly that no such tax payments shall be reimbursed, &quot;whether paid before or after the effective date of this section.&quot; Such a statute cannot constitutionally, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  retroactively apply to this duly authorized and completed $ 19,517,469.92 capital improvement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The commission is ordered (1) to correct its records and its reports to the Secretary of State so as to credit the balance due petitioner with said $ 1,404,664.63, and (2) in future to credit the balances due petitioner with any and all Federal income taxes paid or hereafter paid by petitioner on any sums which are hereafter transferred from petitioner's construction account to petitioner's general funds.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff landlord sued defendant tenant, alleging the tenant was holding over after the expiration of his term and seeking to recover possession of the office occupied by the tenant. The landlord did not allege any statutory grounds for the removal of the tenant. The tenant was protected by the Business Rent Law, 1945 N.Y. Laws ch. 314, as amended by 1959 N.Y. Laws ch. 809, &sect; 4. The landlord challenged the constitutionality of this law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1955, the court of appeals upheld the constitutionality of this law in a case involving the same parties. The landlord argued that conditions had changed since that date to such an extent that there was now a free market in office space. Thus, it argued there was no longer a rational basis for the law. The court held the landlord had failed to sustain its burden of showing that the law was unconstitutional. The evidence offered at trial did not establish the change in conditions claimed by the landlord. Further, the landlord ignored the fact that the statute under attack was not the same as the legislation in effect in 1955. In each year, commencing with the 1956 extension of the act, amendments were inserted permitting landlords to decontrol space by offering two-year leases to statutory tenants, upon the expiration of which time the space occupied by such tenants would be decontrolled. If the tenant refused or failed to sign such lease his space became decontrolled within six months. These amendments plainly indicated a desire to end this emergency legislation gradually and without disrupting the economy of the state.</SPAN></P>

The abutting property owners filed a certiorari proceeding for review of the Board's determination. The Board and the property owner filed motions to vacate the order of certiorari, to dismiss the petition, and to affirm the Board's determination, which were granted.

Defendant was charged with a violation of N.Y. Veh. &amp; Traf. Law &sect; 1129a, which was not a criminal offense but to which the rules of criminal law applied pursuant to N.Y. Veh. &amp; Traf.

The court held that, for N.Y. Veh. &amp; Traf. Law &sect; 1129a to create criminal liability, it should be possible to ascertain the standard of conduct required prior to any consequences.

City Crim. Ct. Act &sect; 31(1). He contended that he was illegally detained under a void judgment of conviction rendered by the county court. The relator plead guilty to the misdemeanor violation of knowingly possessing or having under his control any illicit alcoholic beverages under N.Y. Alco. Bev. Cont. Law &sect; 151.</SPAN></P>

He later claimed that the court lacked jurisdiction since the crime, being a misdemeanor committed in the City of New York, had to be tried in the Court of Special Sessions pursuant to N.Y. City Crim. Ct. Act &sect; 31(1). The court stated that N.Y. Crim. Proc.

The landowners claimed that defendants sought to take their land for an unconstitutional use. Defendants filed motions to dismiss the action, which the court granted. The court held that the fact that the property to be taken would have been used by defendants to benefit a middle income group, rather than a low-income group, did not make the taking unconstitutional. The court found that the state constitution and the statutes authorized defendants to take property for the purpose of building affordable housing for groups that were found to be unable to afford existing or planned private housing. Those provisions, the court said, did not define the income levels of persons eligible for such housing and left the definition open. The court found that, in this instance, the project attacked by the landowners was designed for those who had been found by the appropriate public agency to be persons falling within the legislative definition of persons of low income. Therefore, the court said, the taking fell within constitutional mandates.</SPAN></P>

Laws 369 and New York City, N.Y., Local Law No. 47 (1959) were unconstitutional and permanently restraining defendants, city and associated entities, from imposing and collecting the taxicab tax. Defendants filed a motion to dismiss the complaint.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">1959 N.Y. Laws 369 provided for a tax of up to 10 cents per trip, fare, or use of a taxicab, to be paid by the passenger. Plaintiff argued that the tax was levied on intangible personal property of the hirer in violation of N.Y. Const. art. XVI, &sect; 3, because no orderly person could be refused conveyance at his request unless the taxicab was previously engaged, pursuant to New York City, N.Y., Admin. Code &sect; 436-2.0(b)(24)(b), and, thus, the passenger had a contract of value and intangible personal property involving his personal rights and relationship with the operator. The court held that N.Y. Const. art. XVI, &sect; 3 was intended to avoid taxation of large quantities of saleable assets of substantial monetary value simply because of their presence and possession within the state and that when such intangible property was put to use in the flow of trade and commerce, excise tax became imposable. The court further held that a person's right to use a taxicab had no monetary value because there was nothing to sell and that it was taxable when availed of. The tax was not an ad valorem tax because it was invariable and fixed before determination of the ultimate total charge.</SPAN></P>

The court observed that the law-abiding motorist on the highway at night had many rules to carry in mind while operating his motor vehicle and that to require him, in addition, to gauge the quality of the lighting and the quantity of the traffic, and to determine whether constantly changing lighting or the erratic flow of traffic rendered his high headlight beam &quot;unnecessary&quot; or &quot;impracticable,&quot; would result in a heavy burden indeed. The court stated that the motorist would look in vain to &sect; 15(3) for any unequivocal warning of the rules which he was expected to obey.

Moreover, in those communities where there has been no such referendum or where a referendum has been held but defeated, the people of that community were entitled to play free or entertainment bingo.

The landowner then filed an action against the city and alleged that the provision was unconstitutional. The court found that the law was valid. Furthermore, the court found that the law was constitutional even though it distinguished between rent controlled and decontrolled buildings. The court reasoned that the law was not discriminatory because statutory distinctions were permissible and there was reasonable grounds to support them. The court also found that prior to the law landlords who were subject to rent control had little inducement to improve their buildings because they could not get a return for their investment.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Pursuant to legislative authority (N. Y. Const., art. IX, &sect; 9; Tax Law, &sect; 5-h), the City of New York enacted a local law, effective in 1956 (Administrative Code of City of New York, &sect; J41-2.4), authorizing the granting of 12 years' tax abatement to owners of substandard multiple dwellings who made substantial improvements therein.  It subsequently developed that landlords of rent-decontrolled multiple dwellings (Residential Rent Law, L. 1946, ch. 274, as amd.), as distinguished from controlled ones, did not need such inducement. Therefore, the Legislature amended section 5-h of the Tax Law so as to withdraw such tax abatement after July 1, 1958 from rent-decontrolled dwellings (L. 1958, ch. 901, &sect; 1) and so as to authorize municipalities, until June 1, 1959, &quot;to adopt and amend local laws&quot; accordingly (L. 1958, ch. 901, &sect; 2).  The City of New York adopted an amendment accordingly on January 19, 1959 (Local Laws, 1959, No. 14 of City of New York [Administrative Code of City&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of New York, &sect; J41-2.4, subd. k]).  However, the amendment had not been on the city councilmen's desks for at least seven days (New York City Charter, &sect; 37; General Construction Law, &sect; 110).  The city validly and constitutionally cured this irregularity on September 22, 1959 (after June 1, 1959) by properly enacting a local law which gave full force and effect to the earlier local law as of its original date (Local Laws, 1959, No. 408 of City of New York).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Petitioners, owners of substandard but rent-decontrolled multiple dwellings, made substantial improvements therein, and the city's department of buildings certified on January 7, 1959 that the work complied with the local law (Administrative Code of City of New York, &sect; J41-2.4) and was entitled to an annual tax exemption on the sum of $ 25,222.  But when petitioners applied for the tax abatement on May 6, 1959, the city's tax commission validly refused, because of the amendment which the city had irregularly enacted on January 19, 1959 (&sect; J41-2.4, subd. k) and because of the curative Local Law No. 408 which the city validly enacted thereafter on September 22, 1959.  Accordingly, petitioners' proceedings to review the denial&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of tax abatements (Civ. Prac. Act, art. 78) are dismissed, after trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. There was no contract between the city and petitioners, nor were petitioners denied the equal protection of the laws as to any vested right.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Petitioners asked the Temporary State Housing Rent Commission to place their buildings under rent control again, and the commission refused; but this is immaterial to the issue of constitutionality of the local law amendments denying tax-abatement to rent-decontrolled dwellings. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, who was accused in a 21 count indictment of perjury and contempt, filed a motion to dismiss the indictment on the ground that the grand jury violated his rights under N.Y. Const. art. I, &sect; 6 and the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution when it subpoenaed him and administered the oath to him.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In response to a subpoena, defendant testified before the grand jury on 12 separate occasions. He was sworn on November 13, 1958, and before any questions were put to him, he was advised that the grand jury was investigating whether there was a conspiracy of a criminal nature to commit the crimes of bribery and taking of unlawful fees. The Assistant District Attorney thereupon warned him that he could be a defendant in criminal proceedings resulting from the investigation. The crimes of perjury and contempt with which defendant was charged in the indictment arose from testimony given by him before the grand jury and were alleged to have been committed on dates subsequent to the grant of immunity on November 13, 1958. The court found that under N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 2447, defendant was not entitled to remain silent because he obtained full and complete immunity from prosecution. However, under &sect; 2447, despite the grant of immunity, he could be prosecuted for any perjury or contempt committed in answering, failing to answer, or in producing or failing to produce evidence. Defendant was examined merely as a witness whose testimony was sought to be used against others.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied defendant's motion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Witnesses -- immunity -- even though witness might have been prospective defendant, if he is given complete immunity from prosecution as to matters on which he testifies he can be indicted for perjury or contempt in his answers (Penal Law, &sect;&sect; 2447, 584; N. Y. Const., art. I, &sect; 6).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. When a Grand Jury or other &quot;competent authority&quot; gives a witness complete immunity from prosecution &quot;for or on account of any * * * matter * * * concerning which&quot; he shall give answer or produce evidence, &quot;he may nevertheless be prosecuted * * * for any perjury or contempt committed in answering, or failing to answer, or in producing or failing to produce evidence&quot; (Penal Law, &sect;&sect; 2447, 584, as amd. by L. 1953, ch. 891).  Such a complete grant of immunity is fully coextensive with his constitutional privilege against self incrimination (N. Y. Const., art. I, &sect; 6); hence it is immaterial that, otherwise, the witness might have been a prospective defendant in the investigation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Accordingly, his motion to dismiss a subsequent indictment against him for perjury and contempt in his immune testimony is denied.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The United States Constitution (14th Amdt.) has&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  no application.  The privilege against self incrimination is not one of &quot;the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Although a defendant must go through a trial before he can appeal from an order such as this one denying his motion to dismiss the indictment, whereas the People now have a statutory right of appeal from such an order of dismissal of the indictment, these considerations are for the Legislature, not the courts.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs argued that the legislation was unconstitutional insofar as it required installation of central heating and hot-water equipment in tenement properties containing more than 10 apartments and contended that the enactment acted to deprive the owners of property without due process, that it did not actually promote the public health and safety of the tenants, and that it was in conflict with the N.Y. Mult. Dwell. Law. The court found that the city council held hearings prior to the enactment of the sections in question and made findings which sufficiently set forth the legislative purpose. The court felt that this was a reasonable use of police power because there was a close relationship between this use of the power and the evil sought to be remedied and there was no requirement of unreasonable expenditure when considered in the light of the objective to be accomplished. The court also held that the provisions in the enactment under attack were not inconsistent with N.Y. Mult. Dwell.

Although the town alleged that the map was freely available, there was no incorporation of it by reference in the ordinance and the map was not attached or included. The court granted the property owners their requested relief, holding the ordinance invalid. The State law was to be strictly enforced in all cases. The use districts were not described in the text of the ordinance.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff lessor moved for judgment on the pleadings against defendant city in an action seeking a declaratory judgment that New York City, N.Y., Admin. Code &sect; D 26-3.1 was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The lessor alleged that regulation of multiple dwellings was a state affair and that the State of New York had pre-empted the field when it enacted the N.Y. Multiple Dwelling Law. The lessor alleged that the local ordinance was inconsistent with the state law. The local ordinance (1) required owners to pay a registration fee, whereas the N.Y. Multiple Dwelling Law did not provide for the payment of a fee; (2) required corporations owning multiple dwellings to file the names and addresses of their officers; and (3) fixed heavier penalties for failure to register than those prescribed in the N.Y. Multiple Dwelling Law. The court upheld the local ordinance, awarding judgment to the city. The court found that the fee requirement was not inconsistent with state law. The name and address requirement had been added to state law in 1959. Finally, the heavier penalties should be determined in criminal court where the lessor was already being prosecuted for his second violation. The court found that a declaratory judgment action was an improper avenue to obtain a collateral attack on a criminal judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied the lessor's motion for judgement. The court granted judgment on pleadings to the city.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. In this action for a judgment declaring that the &quot;Multiple Dwelling Code, particularly Section D 26-3.1&quot; is unconstitutional, null and void, in that the City of New York had no authority to enact measures relating to multiple dwellings which are inconsistent with the State's Multiple Dwelling Law, plaintiff's motion for judgment on the pleadings is denied.  A local law is not inconsistent with a State statute merely because it provides for higher penalties, or requires a registration fee while the State statute does not.  Moreover, sections 3 and 365 of the Multiple Dwelling Law authorize a city to adopt and enforce more restrictive measures than those provided in the State law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Plaintiff, who has been convicted of a second violation of the local law, also attacks the validity of a provision permitting a fine up to $ 1,000 and imprisonment&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  up to one year in the event of a second conviction.  As the purpose of a declaratory judgment is to obtain a guide for future action, ordinarily an action for such a judgment will not be entertained where there is an adequate legal remedy.  The remedies of this plaintiff were or are adequate in the criminal court or appellate tribunal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Judgment on the pleadings is granted to defendant.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff landlord brought an action against defendant tenant for rent and insurance premiums. The tenant filed a motion to dismiss the complaint, relying on N.Y. R. Civ. Prac. 301(5) (1953) and claiming that res judicata barred the action because the landlord brought two previous actions that were voluntarily dismissed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landlord's first action for rent was dismissed for lack of jurisdiction by a justice of the peace. The landlord discontinued the second action after a discussion between the parties about the invalidity of the service of process. In considering the matter, the court ruled that in view of the drastic consequences of a discontinuance filed in the early stages of an action, N.Y. R. Civ. Prac. 301(5) did not apply to a second and voluntary discontinuance of an action that was brought in a court without jurisdiction to hear the case on the merits. The court further ruled that a party was barred from proceeding again only when he brought an action a second time, without reference to the first, in a court with jurisdiction and then discontinued the action. The court determined that in the prior action in the same court, there was no jurisdiction over the tenant. The discontinuance of that action, therefore, merely anticipated the tenant's motion to dismiss. The tenant also prevented the matter from being heard by appearing only specially to contest jurisdiction. The court thus concluded that the landlord had not had the second opportunity given him by the rule to prove his case.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Rule 301 (subd. 5) of the Rules of Civil Practice, providing that a discontinuance shall be regarded as on the merits, does not apply to a second and voluntary discontinuance of an action brought in a court which did not have jurisdiction to hear the case on the merits.  Here, the second discontinuance followed a special appearance by defendant to set aside service as invalid where the court did not have jurisdiction of the person of defendant.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant resigned from public office. He was called before the grand jury, was sworn, and testified in an investigation entitled &quot;People of the State of New York against John Doe.&quot; The grand jury indicted defendant for conspiracy, larceny, and other crimes. Defendant filed a motion to dismiss the indictment, pursuant to N.Y. Const. art. I, &sect; 6 and the Fifth Amendment, on grounds that he had been compelled to testify against himself.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant refused to sign a waiver of immunity before the grand jury and on certain matters, he refused to testify on constitutional grounds. The grand jury indicted defendant. Defendant filed a motion to dismiss the indictment. The State contended that defendant had not been indicted in connection with any matter on which he had testified, and that what testimony he had given in no way furnished any link in the chain of evidence that resulted in the indictment. The court held that defendant had been compelled to testify against himself. From a reading of the record, there was little doubt that the investigation had been specifically directed against defendant. While defendant had refused to answer some questions, the very form of a question put to defendant that asked him whether he had committed an improper act, followed by his refusal to answer, might have prejudiced defendant in the eyes of the grand jury, and so have contributed to the finding of the indictment. Certainly, defendant had been sworn and had testified, both generally and specifically, as to the matters under investigation and affecting him, which violated N.Y. Const. art. I, &sect; 6 and the Fifth Amendment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court dismissed the indictment.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- privilege against self incrimination -- defendant, who was target of investigation, was called and examined before Grand Jury -- indictment followed -- privilege against self incrimination was violated -- protection from indictment and use of incriminating testimony automatically results -- indictment dismissed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The day after defendant resigned as Commissioner of Public Welfare of the County of Schenectady he was called before the Grand Jury as a witness in an investigation dealing with the conduct of the office of the Commissioner of Public Welfare of said county and with his actions while holding that office.  He was sworn and testified, both generally and specifically, as to the matters under investigation and affecting him.  He thus became a witness against himself.  Following his testimony an indictment against him was found by the Grand Jury which heard him testify.  Where one who is a target of an investigation is called and examined before a Grand Jury has constitutionally conferred privilege against self incrimination is violated and protection from indictment and from use of any incriminating testimony&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  given by him automatically results.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, the owner and operator of a dump, filed an action seeking an adjudication declaring that Cornwall-on-Hudson, N.Y., Ordinance Regulating Dumps (1959) was unconstitutional and void, and an injunction restraining the enforcement of said ordinance, against defendant town, which moved to dismiss the complaint for legal insufficiency.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner contended that the ordinance was not a proper, reasonable, and valid exercise of the town's police power; that it was vague, indefinite, and speculative in its terms and provisions; that in applying the test of future possibilities in the operation of the ordinance, the town was permitted to act in such an arbitrary and unreasonable manner as to violate the constitutional rights of the owner and others similarly situated in the conduct of his and their business of maintaining refuse and garbage dumps; and that &sect; V of the ordinance violated the requirements of due process. The court found the first three arguments to have been without merit, but sustained the fourth. The court found &sect; V of the ordinance violated the rule against presumptive devices in criminal enactments where it provided that the holder of a permit would be personally responsible for the condition of the dump site or any condition created elsewhere as a result of the condition of the dump site, and that it would be conclusively presumed that the holder of a permit had knowledge of any condition that was noxious or offensive within 24 hours after its occurrence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted the town a judgment on the merits, but without costs, and declared that the ordinance was valid in all respects except for the provisions of &sect; V thereof which were declared invalid.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Municipal corporations -- ordinance regulating dumps -- respondent town had authority, in exercise of police power and pursuant to subdivision 6 of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">section 130 of Town Law</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">, to adopt ordinance regulating disposition of garbage -- provisions are sufficiently clear, definite and certain -- provision that board may impose &quot;reasonable and necessary&quot; additional conditions in granting permit sets up proper standard for conduct of board -- section V of ordinance, providing that holder of permit shall be conclusively presumed to have knowledge of existence of noxious or offensive conditions at, or caused by, dump, violates due process requirement and is </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">unconstitutional</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> -- section V excluded as invalid -- balance of subject ordinance sustained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Respondent town had the authority, in the exercise of its police power, to adopt an ordinance regulating the collection and disposition of refuse and garbage (Town Law, &sect; 130, subd. 6).  Where, as here, the ordinance has a substantial relationship to a threat to public health and safety, the regulations contained therein may not be said to&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  be unreasonable, arbitrary, capricious, discriminatory or oppressive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The licensing provisions and purposes of the subject ordinance are sufficiently clear, definite and certain to afford a comprehensible guide as to what must be done or avoided to comply with the requirements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. A provision that the board, in passing upon a permit for the maintenance of a dump, may impose such additional terms and conditions as it deems &quot;necessary and proper&quot; sets up a proper standard for the conduct of the board.  Even were no standard set down, unfair and unreasonable action is subject to judicial review (Civ. Prac. Act, art. 78).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. However, section V of the ordinance of defendant town &quot;regulating dumps&quot;, providing that the holder of such a permit shall be personally responsible for the condition of such dump site and shall be conclusively presumed to have knowledge of noxious or offensive conditions at, or caused by, said dump site, would deprive an alleged violator of due process of law.  As the ordinance provides criminal, as well as civil, penalties, said provision is unconstitutional and is excluded from the ordinance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. In view of the foregoing, the motion to dismiss the complaint&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  for legal insufficiency is neither granted nor denied.  Judgment is granted in favor of defendant, declaring the challenged ordinance valid in all respects except that said section V is declared invalid. Defendant may not be enjoined from enforcing said ordinance; the stay contained in the order to show cause herein is vacated; and plaintiff is given 21 days in which to apply for the necessary permit.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The voter went to the same polling place where she had voted the previous year. The board told the voter that she was not permitted to vote because her name was not on the list and that she had to get a court order before it would permit her to vote.

The court also held that the voter was not required to pay the fees set forth in N.Y. Civ. Prac. Act &sect; 1557-a(III). The court held that N.Y. Const. art.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner landowner sought review, by initiating a proceeding under N.Y. Civ. Prac. Act art. 78, of a decision by respondents, members of the Town Board of the Town of Eden, which denied the landowner's application to have his property rezoned and for permission to erect a business sign.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowner owned a farm where his son incidentally sold and repaired farm equipment for almost 20 years. The landowner applied to the town to have his property rezoned for business use and for permission to erect a business sign, and the town denied both of his applications on the basis that the landowner's property was in an agricultural district and his request was for spot zoning to business in an area that was destined to become residential pursuant to a master plan for future development. The landowner appealed and claimed that the zoning ordinance that prohibited non-conforming uses was unconstitutional. On appeal, the court dismissed the landowner's petition. The court found that the landowner improperly placed the burden on the town to prove that the zoning ordinance was published and posted in accordance with the law because the landowner, as the petitioner in a proceeding under article 78, had the burden of proving that the ordinance was not justified under the police power of the state. The court found that the landowner's incidental sale of used farm equipment did not justify spot zoning and the commercial sign was prohibited by the valid ordinance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court dismissed the landowner's petition, without costs, and found that the town's refusals to rezone and to issue a permit to the landowner were proper.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Municipal corporations -- zoning -- as question of constitutionality of Town Zoning Ordinance could not be determined by Town Board, Supreme Court had jurisdiction of entire controversy -- refusals of Town Board to rezone petitioner's property from agricultural to business district, and issue permit for public sign thereon, were proper -- petitioner failed to prove that enforcement of ordinance would preclude him from using premises for any purpose to which reasonably adapted -- incidental sale of used farm equipment does not justify spot zoning from agricultural to business -- commercial sign in agricultural district prohibited by valid ordinance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Petitioner seeks to rezone a portion of his property from an agricultural to a business district, and contends that the section of the Town Zoning Ordinance entitled &quot;Farmland or Agricultural Districts&quot; is unconstitutional.  As the question of constitutionality cannot be determined by the Town Board, the Supreme Court has jurisdiction of the entire controversy, despite the fact that petitioner claims a valid, nonconforming use.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The town had the right to enact a zoning&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ordinance, which is presumed to be constitutional.  Unless the petitioner is affected by the alleged unconstitutionality of the statute in a specific way, he cannot complain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Petitioner has failed to sustain his burden of proof by showing that enforcement of the ordinance will preclude him from using his property for any purpose to which it is reasonably adapted. Farming is still conducted on his premises as a primary function. The incidental sale of used farm equipment does not justify spot zoning from agricultural to business so as to allow petitioner to conduct a new business selling new farm equipment after enactment of the ordinance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The commercial sign for which petitioner seeks a permit is prohibited by the valid ordinance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Respondents' refusals to rezone the property and issue a permit for the sign were proper.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. Overlooking petitioner's omission to serve a reply, as in an action, the court's conclusion remains the same.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. The proceedings are dismissed on the merits.  </SPAN></P>

The court dismissed the indictment, holding that N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 1141 was contrary to the letter and spirit of the Fourteenth Amendment and N.Y. Const. art. I, &sect; 8. The court determined that any test for obscenity that turned on what was offensive to the community's standards was too loose, too capricious, too destructive of freedom of expression to be squared with the First Amendment, and that every utterance which did not infringe upon another's person or property was protected by the First Amendment. The court further held that the expression did not need to have the slightest redeeming social importance in order to be protected.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owner filed an action against defendants, among others. The property owner had sought declaratory and injunctive relief related to the allegedly illegal appropriation of the property owner's lands pursuant to the exercise of defendants' eminent domain power. Defendants filed a motion to dismiss the property owner's second amended complaint. The court denied defendants' motion. The court held in part that: (1) defendants' motion to dismiss the property owner's complaint on the basis of legal insufficiency was without merit, as the ultimate facts alleged in the property owner's complaint presented a legally sufficient showing that the purported appropriation of the property owner's lands was for an unauthorized private use; and that (2) defendants' motion to dismiss the property owner's complaint on the basis of the court's lack of subject matter jurisdiction was without merit, as the court had subject matter jurisdiction over a claim of an alleged unauthorized and illegal appropriation of real property by defendants.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. An action for a declaratory judgment and injunction may be maintained in the Supreme Court by a property owner who alleges facts showing that defendant State of New York and defendant State Thruway Authority appropriated a strip of land which bisects plaintiff's property, not for any public or Thruway or Thruway access purpose, but only (1) to provide a means of access to and from another street, for the benefit of defendant owner of another adjoining property, which adjoining property would otherwise be landlocked by a prior Thruway appropriation, and (2) to&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  accommodate electric power lines recently erected by defendant utility company to service said adjoining property owner. Motion to dismiss (Rules Civ. Prac., rule 106, subds. 1, 4) is denied.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Before commencing this action, plaintiff, in order to prevent the Statute of Limitations on an appropriation claim against the State from running out, filed a claim in the Court of Claims for damages for this appropriation; and he has prosecuted said claim to the point of submitting proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law to the Court of Claims.  The Court of Claims would have no jurisdiction of an action such as this one in the Supreme Court for a declaratory judgment and injunction (Court of Claims Act, &sect; 9); in any event, no such action is pending in that court.  If defendants wish to assert that plaintiff has elected his remedy, that would constitute an affirmative defense, which cannot be the basis for this motion to dismiss on defendants' asserted ground that there is another action pending (Rules Civ.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The board granted the dentist's petition for a special exception and permitted him to use his former residence as a dentistry office on the condition that the premises could not be used for residential purposes by any persons other than the dentist himself together with his immediate family. The dentist contended that the board's condition, which prohibited him from renting the remaining portion of the premises to a tenant, was arbitrary, capricious, and unreasonable. The court dismissed the dentist's petition upon finding that he failed to sustain his burden of proving that the zoning ordinance was unconstitutional. The town board had the right to deny the dentist's application, and, in having the right to deny, it also had the right to grant the application subject to reasonable conditions. The restriction regarding the limitation of the premises for use of office space only applied to areas of the office where patients would be interviewed or treated.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a condemnation proceeding, claimant property owners moved to incorporate in the final decree a provision for an allowance calculated on the basis of the court's finding of the respective annual net rental values of the several acquired premises prorated according to time, or, in the event such relief was denied, then interest at a rate of six percent.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The provision sought by the property owners was in lieu of interest on the awards at four percent annum from the date of taking to the date the awards were ready for payment, which was the usual provision in final decrees regarding condemnation proceedings. In determining that the property owners' request for relief should be rejected, the court noted that N.Y. Gen. Mun. Law &sect; 3-a(2) required that interest on any accrued claim against a municipal corporation arising out of condemnation proceedings was not to exceed four percent per annum. There was no constitutional requirement that just compensation for delay in making payment had to be exactly equal to the fair rate of interest for the use of money in the open money market in New York City where money was borrowed without collateral and where the lender did not receive income tax benefit. Regardless of the fact that six percent was the &quot;proper rate&quot; of interest to be paid by a nonpublic debtor, the court held that the statutorily-mandated four percent rate was appropriate in the instant proceeding.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court directed that the final decree should recite claimants' application, as set forth in their moving papers, and provide that their application was denied, and that interest on the award was allowed at the rate of four percent per annum from the date of the taking to the date of payment.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Several claimants in this condemnation proceeding have moved to incorporate in the final decrees, in lieu of interest at 4% per annum from the date of taking to the date the awards are ready for payment, a provision for an allowance based on the court's&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  finding of the respective annual net rental values of the acquired premises, or interest at the rate of 6% per annum. The rate of 4% provided for in the General Municipal Law ( &sect; 3-a, subd. 2) is not so unreasonably low as to deprive the claimants of just compensation, although the General Business Law ( &sect; 370) prescribes 6% as the maximum general rate, and even though 6% may be the fair rate for use of money in the open market in New York City.  There is no constitutional requirement that just compensation for delay in making payment in condemnation proceedings must be exactly equal to such rate.  The motion is, therefore, denied.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The Corporation Counsel's objection that the motion is premature and that after the final decree fixes the interest at 4% claimants may attempt to enforce payment of the higher rate by ways of a motion to compel the Comptroller to pay such higher rate, or by way of appeal from the final decree is overruled.  Interest at a proper rate is an integral part of the compensation to which claimants are entitled and the final decree should adjudicate on the merits what such proper rate is.  Claimants would then have an adjudication of unquestioned finality&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  which they can carry to the Court of Appeals, if so advised, and if appeal is taken from the principal amount of any award, the proper rate of interest can be disposed of on the same appeal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The final decree should recite claimants' application, that it was denied, and that interest on the award is allowed at the rate of 4% per annum from February 28, 1958 to the date of payment. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The relief sought by petitioners was to reduce to the 1958-1959 level the real estate assessments for the year 1959-1960 of the individual petitioners, of all those 32,000 property owners who filed protests against the current increase, and the 250,000 home owners and taxpayers of the Borough of Queens that were similarly situated. The ground for such relief was that the increase was erroneous, illegal, excessive, and unconstitutional. The court found that the named petitioners refered to nothing but a section, block, and lot number. Each appeared to be in widely separated, divergent, and various areas, streets, and locations. The court found that the averment as to inequality was a mere unsupported conclusion. No comparative properties or figures were set forth. The petitioners seemed to claim that increasing the assessment over the prior year was evidence of overvaluation. The court held that each year was separate and distinct from every other year. In no sense could the value fixed by the assessors for one year, or by a court on review, have any application to the issue of value in recurring assessments or proceedings to review them.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent city officials filed a motion to dismiss a complaint brought by petitioner building owners in an action in which the building owners challenged a determination made by a city tax commission that denied their application for tax exemption and abatement.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The building owners filed an action pursuant to N.Y. Civ. Practice Act. art. 78, seeking to set aside a determination made by a city tax commission, which denied their application for tax exemption and abatement. Respondents filed a motion seeking dismissal of the petition. The court denied the motion to dismiss. The court properly brought the proceeding under Article 78 insofar as it sought tax abatement because there was no other statutory provision that afforded a remedy for a denial of tax abatement. The court held that an amendment to the tax laws, N.Y. Admin. Code &sect; J41-2.4, was not unconstitutional where the prior tax exemption that had been accorded to the building owners was revocable because there was no evidence the city had entered into a irrevocable contract with the building owners. The court noted that statutes granting tax exemptions were revocable at the will of the legislature in the absence of a contract. The court determined the city could not be held to have contracted with those who altered and approved their dwellings in reliance upon the tax exemption because the exemption was not a private one, but instead was available to the general public.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied respondents' motion to dismiss, and granted leave to answer within 10 days from the service of a copy of the order.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Municipal corporations -- local laws -- requirement that &quot;No local law shall be passed until it shall have been in its final form and upon the desks of the councilmen at least seven calendar days, exclusive of Sundays, prior to its final passage&quot; (New York City Charter, &sect; 37) was allegedly violated by passing on December 23 bill which was not in final form until December 17 -- but local law granting tax exemption and tax abatement (Administrative Code of City of New York, &sect; J41-2.4) may be repealed or modified (Local Law No. 14 of 1959 of City of New York) even as to those who have spent money in reliance on it -- proceeding under article 78 of Civil Practice Act proper; landlords not relegated to remedies for reviewing assessments (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Tax Law, &sect; 290</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> et seq.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">; New York City Charter, &sect;&sect; 163-166; Administrative Code of City of New York, &sect; 166-1.0).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The New York City Charter (&sect; 37) provides, in part, that &quot;No local&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  law shall be passed until it shall have been in its final form and upon the desks of the councilmen at least seven calendar days, exclusive of Sundays, prior to its final passage&quot;.  In this proceeding under article 78 of the Civil Practice Act, the petition sufficiently alleges that a local law bill was &quot;for the first time&quot; placed &quot;in its final form&quot; on the desks of the city councilmen on December 17, 1958 and was passed on December 23, 1958, and was therefore void.  Even if both December 17 and December 23 are both included in the count to make seven days -- such a count seems to be contrary to section 20 of the General Construction Law -- one of the seven days would still be a Sunday.  There is nothing in the petition to show that the bill was on the councilmen's desks in unprinted but final form before December 17.  On this motion to dismiss the petition as legally insufficient, the petition must be deemed true and must be liberally construed.  The motion is denied.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The petition of landlords alleges that they spent large sums to renovate their unsanitary and hazardous dwellings, in reliance on the local law provision for tax abatements and tax exemptions for such renovation&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  (Administrative Code of City of New York, &sect; J41-2.4), and that the city thereafter amended said local law (by Local Law No. 14 of 1959 of City of New York) so as to withdraw its benefits from rent-decontrolled or uncontrolled dwellings, and that the city's Tax Commission therefore refused to grant them a tax abatement or tax exemption. That part of the petition which alleges that the amendment violated contract rights and was unconstitutional is legally insufficient.  Statutes granting tax exemption and similar statutes are, in the absence of a contract to continue the exemptions or other privileges granted, revocable at the legislative will; and this is so notwithstanding the fact that persons may have performed acts or expended money in reliance upon such statutes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Petition for tax abatement, involving a question of law rather than one of fact, is properly brought under article 78 of the Civil Practice Act; and it is unnecessary to determine whether the proceeding is also maintainable, concurrently with the remedy formerly denominated certiorari, in order to obtain tax exemption. Petitioners are not relegated to the remedy provided in section 290 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">et seq</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. of the Tax Law, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  sections 163-166 of the New York City Charter, and section 166-1.0 of the Administrative Code of the City of New York.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff police sought a determination as to whether defendants, landowner and landowner's lessees, had violated Village of Lloyd Harbor, N.Y., Ordinance 2, &sect; 1, regulating parking, by allowing the landowner's lessees to leave automobiles in the vicinity of the landowner's residence while mooring boats on the landowner's property.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowner owned property bordered by a public street on one side, and a harbor on the other. The landowner operated a business in which he leased mooring rights to individuals seeking to launch boats on the harbor. The landowner and his lessees parked automobiles on the public street in front of the landowner's property. The village in which the landowner resided had enacted an ordinance prohibiting all parking on public streets. The police sought convictions against the landowner and the landowner's lessees for violation of the ordinance. The court convicted all defendants except one, who was a guest of the landowner. The court held that N.Y.  Veh. &amp; Traf. Code &sect; 1640(a)(6) permitted the village to regulate parking on its streets and that the village had clearly and suitably marked the restrictions by placing general signs in the town. The court finally held that the mere fact that the landowner owned property abutting the street did not entitle him to more parking privileges than any other member of the public.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court convicted all but one defendant of violation of a village ordinance for parking on a street where parking was prohibited.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Section 1 of Ordinance No. 2 of the Village of Lloyd Harbor provides: &quot;No person shall leave any vehicle standing or parked, nor shall any person picnic or trespass upon any portion of the public streets, highways, roads, lanes or other public places in the Village of Lloyd Harbor, except such as may be necessary or incidental to the transaction of business with or visits to residents of the Village or such as may be due to accidental or temporary disability.&quot; One of the defendants, developing a business consisting of leasing moorings, charges owners of pleasure boats rental for the moorings. His patrons have been parking in an area within the public right of way.  Some of the customers have parked at a place where the village had erected a fence in 1954 to enforce the village ordinance. The automobiles were parked within a 50-foot right of way, on which the paved portion was 16&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  feet wide, leaving an area 17 feet wide on each side of the pavement. A defense, common to all defendants that they did not park their automobiles on any part of the road that is &quot;intended for vehicular traffic&quot;, is without merit under the revision of the Vehicle and Traffic Law made by chapter 698 of the Laws of 1957.  The village is authorized by the State to prohibit, restrict or limit parking on all roads of the village and the village ordinance validly extends not only to parking on the travelled portion of such roads but also to &quot;the entire width between the boundary lines&quot; ( Vehicle and Traffic Law, &sect; 118) of every such road.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.  Section 1683 of the Vehicle and Traffic Law provides that no ordinance limiting or prohibiting the stopping, standing or parking of vehicles shall be effective until signs giving notice thereof are posted. Signs measuring four feet by one foot are conspicuously posted at the side of each four roads entering the village. Additional signs are posted at points along the village roads, all saying that no parking is permitted at any time.  Five signs are posted in the vicinity of defendant's residence.  The posted signs are more than sufficient to give&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  notice of the ordinance as required by section 1683.</SPAN></P>

In the absence of any evidence tending to establish that the ordinance is an unreasonable, arbitrary, capricious or discriminatory exercise of the power granted the village by section 1640 (subd. [a], par. 6) of the Vehicle and Traffic Law to prohibit, restrict or limit the parking of vehicles within the village, it cannot be maintained that the ordinance offends the due process clause.  On the contrary the ordinance could have been enacted in the reasonable belief that it was necessary for the preservation of good order and public morals.  Defendants, as members of the public, have no just complaint against the terms of the ordinance, and the individual defendant who leases the moorings has no special ground for complaint.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Said latter defendant is not entitled to the exception made in the ordinance for parking that is &quot;necessary or incidental to the transaction of business with or visits to residents of the village&quot;.  The other defendants were not visiting with him in the sense intended by the statute.  Moreover, the defendants had completed their &quot;transaction of business&quot; when they entered into leases of their moorings&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and when they went to the premises they did not do so for the purpose of transacting business but of exercising their rights as lessees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. One of the defendants parked her automobile as an incident to a visit to two people who had leased premises from the lessor. She could reasonably assume that they were rightfully enjoying a portion of his rights.  As a guest she is entitled to the same privileges that the parking ordinance would accord a guest of the lessor. She is, accordingly, found not guilty.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>

He also stated that defendant's vehicle did not stop to yield the right of way upon entering the roadway, thus endangering said users of the roadway. He further stated that defendant swerved and skidded the tires of his vehicle on the dry pavement after turning off from the driveway onto the street in front of the patrolman's vehicle. At this time, there was no sidewalk along the relevant side of the street. Also, it was not alleged that any pedestrians were in the immediate vicinity of defendant's car as it was alleged to have been driven onto the highway without first stopping. Defendant was subsequently convicted of &sect; 1173. He later sought review of his judgment of conviction. The court reversed the judgment, by holding that &sect; 1173, was too vague and indefinite to be enforced and was unconstitutional because it did not set up a guide, rule, or standard for the operation of a motor vehicle when entering a roadway, a deviation from which could properly be made the basis for a criminal prosecution.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, a peddler who was licensed by the county as a veteran, filed a motion for an injunction against the enforcement of an ordinance restricting the occupation of peddling during certain hours on certain highways in defendant town. The main action sought a declaration that the ordinance was unconstitutional and invalid and asked that its enforcement be perpetually enjoined.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">By seeking a perpetual injunction on the motion, the court held that the peddler had mistaken his remedy. To grant a perpetual injunction would have given the peddler all the relief he sought in his main action; therefore, the court considered the motion as one seeking a temporary injunction. The ordinance's stated purpose was to avoid traffic hazards incident to the stopping of automobiles for trade during the hours of heavy traffic. The peddler argued that ordinances restricting peddling should not be favored by the courts. The ordinance aimed at the peddler who remained stationary at the side of the road attracting the travellers on the highway. The court found that such use was more in the class of a market use which use the town could prohibit on a public street in the exercise of its police power. The court also held that the peddler's claim that the ordinance was vague could not be determined preliminarily and had to await the trial.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. In an action for an injunction against the enforcement of an ordinance restricting the occupation of peddling during certain hours on certain highways in defendant town, a motion by plaintiff for a temporary injunction is denied.  The ordinance states that its purpose is to avoid traffic hazards incident to the stopping of automobiles for trade during the hours of heavy traffic. It aims not at the itinerant peddler but at the peddler who remains stationary at the side of the road attracting travellers on the highway.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant filed a motion to dismiss a charge of making an illegal U-turn on several grounds, including that the traffic regulation, New York City, N.Y., Traf. Reg. &sect; 51(a) (1958) was invalid because it was vague, indefinite, and imprecise; and that the People failed to prove a prima facie case.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Section 51(a) prohibited a driver from turning his vehicle so as to proceed in the opposite direction upon any street in a business district.

Law &sect; 105, as contended by the State, and there was no proof that the point at which the infraction allegedly occurred was within a business district as so defined; (2) there was no evidence that defendant made the U-turn in order to proceed in the other direction or, for example, to park; (3) the fact that the court was a magistrate's court did not lessen defendant's right not to be subjected to vague or unclear laws; and (4) although the court was required to interpret a statute that was reasonably susceptible of two constructions so as to preserve its constitutionality, &sect; 51(a) was not so susceptible.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Motor vehicles -- traffic infractions -- section 51 (subd.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defendant was charged with violating section 51 (subd. [a]) of the New York City Traffic Regulations which prohibits the driver of a vehicle from turning such vehicle &quot;so as to proceed in the opposite direction upon any street in a business district.&quot; The record does not show that the U-turn complained of was made in a &quot;business district&quot;, nor whether in was made &quot;so as to proceed in the opposite direction&quot; or for some other purpose, nor that the defendant &quot;proceeded&quot; after making the turn, nor does the complaint apprise the defendant that &quot;business district&quot; as used in the regulation is &quot;defined&quot; in section 105 of the Vehicle and Traffic Law. The regulation in question is penal in nature and should be informative on its face, but the definition of &quot;business district&quot; in section 105 of the Vehicle and Traffic Law is not referred to in section 51 (subd. [a]) of the Traffic Regulations. Moreover, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the fact that a definition of the term was necessary was proof that the words &quot;business district&quot; in the regulation are vague, indefinite, imprecise and equivocal. Furthermore, the &quot;definition&quot; itself, as found in the Vehicle and Traffic Law, lacks clarity. Section 51 (subd. [a]) of the New York City Traffic Regulations is unconstitutional because it is vague, indefinite and imprecise, and the complaint is dismissed.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner parents brought an action in New York against respondent school board (Board) seeking an order in the nature of mandamus, directing the board to discontinue use of a daily prayer in its school district. The board filed a motion to dismiss the action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parents alleged that the board by resolution directed that the prayer be said as a daily procedure and that it is being said aloud each day in the schools of the district, that the saying of the prayer and the manner and setting in which was said were contrary to the religious practices of the parents and their children who were believers and contrary to the beliefs concerning religion of those parents and their children who were nonbelievers, and that demand had been made for discontinuance of the prayer and refused by the board. The court held that while the board was entitled to authorize the daily prayer, it was not entitled to require the saying of the prayer in question. The court held that if the board did authorize the prayer, it had to bring the authorization to the attention of parents of children in the schools, establish a procedure for excusing non-participants not only from saying the prayer but from the room, if they so elected, and take affirmative steps to protect the religious freedom of both non-participants and participants.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The petition as amended, was held legally sufficient, the board's defenses were held insufficient and were dismissed. The parents' demand for a jury trial was denied for the reason that there is no triable issue of material fact, and the request for mandamus was, as a matter of discretion, denied but the matter was remanded to the board for further proceedings not inconsistent with the court's order.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional law -- prayer in public school -- Federal and State Constitutions do not prohibit noncompulsory saying of prayer in public school as part of daily procedure -- Board of Education may authorize, but not require, saying of prayer -- board must bring matter to attention of parents, establish procedure for excusing nonparticipants from prayer and from room, and take affirmative steps to protect religious freedom of both participants and nonparticipants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. A board of education directed that, as a daily procedure, following the salute to the flag, the following prayer should be said in its schools: &quot;Almighty God, we acknowledge our dependence upon Thee, and we beg Thy blessings upon us, our parents, our teachers and our Country&quot;.  The Federal and State Constitutions do not prohibit the noncompulsory saying of the prayer. However, the board must take affirmative steps to protect the rights of those who, for whatever reason, choose not to participate.  While the board may authorize, it may not require, the saying of the prayer but, if it does, it must bring the authorization to the attention of the parents of children in the schools, establish a procedure for excusing&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  nonparticipants not only from saying the prayer but from the room, if they so elect, and take affirmative steps to protect the religious freedom of both nonparticipants and participants.  The resolution should be modified to establish a procedure whereby the parents of each child are advised of the adoption of the resolution calling for the saying of the prayer, of the wording of the prayer and of the procedure to be followed when it is said, and requested to indicate whether the child shall or shall not participate in the exercise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The proceeding being in the nature of mandamus to compel performance of a duty specifically enjoined by law, it was not necessary to appeal to the Commissioner of Education.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Although the resolution of the Board of Education was adopted more than four months before the commencement of this proceeding, since what is charged is a continuing failure to obey the requirements of the Federal and State Constitutions, and the proceeding was commenced within four months after the demand for discontinuance, it was brought within the time allowed by section 1286 of the Civil Practice Act.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The application being one involving performance of constitutional&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  duty, the question is properly raised in a proceeding under article 78 of the Civil Practice Act.  The fact that relief might be granted in the nature of a mandatory injunction does not put the proceeding outside the scope of an article 78 proceeding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. The petition will be amended to include a statement that all of the schools referred to in the petition are within Union Free School District Number Nine and under the jurisdiction and control of respondents, although such fact would be judicially noticed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. The petition, which alleges violations of a constitutional duty in that the board has required, rather than authorized, the daily use of the prayer and the manner of its being said does not protect the rights of nonbelievers or the religious scruples of all of the believers, states a cause of action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. There are no factual questions requiring a jury trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. Petitioners, parents of children who are currently attending the schools subject to the program, have standing to sue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. The board's resolution, though referring to and inspired by the Board of Regents' statements, was voluntary.  The Regents' policy and program are involved in this decision only insofar as they form&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the background for and are referred to in the action of the board.  The question is the power of the board, unsupported by any administrative, legislative or constitutional requirement that it adopt the resolution.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">N.Y. R.R. Law &sect; 307, as originally enacted, bestowed on certain railroads the power to increase passenger fares, which increases would not be subject to suspension by the Public Service Commission prior to a determination of unreasonableness. Then 1958 N.Y. Laws ch. 358 amended N.Y. R.R. Law &sect; 307 to require prior application to and approval by the Commission before a fare increase could be effected. The railroad sought a declaratory judgment that the 1958 law was unconstitutional. The State moved for a judgment that the law was constitutional. The court entered judgment in favor of the State. The court held that the statute in question was a general incorporation act and not a private or local bill that would violate N.Y. Const. art. III, &sect; 17 or N.Y. Const. art. XVI, &sect; 1. The statute was not a contract between the State and the railroad and the State had the reserved power to amend or repeal it.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer contended that N.Y. Educ. Law &sect; 2023, the authority for adopting an austerity budget, was unconstitutional in that it provided for a delegation of the taxing power to the school board after an unfavorable vote, without providing any method for review of the board's actions. The court disagreed that this was the case, finding that the general review provision, N.Y. Educ. Law &sect; 310(7), provided for grievances to be heard by the Commissioner of Education. The taxpayer then alleged that, assuming the law to be valid, the action of the board in submitting and then resubmitting the same budget without change, followed by the precipitate adoption of a stripped down budget of essentials only, was arbitrary and capricious. The court was sympathetic to the taxpayer but found that the school board had acted within its lawful capacity. Questions of good judgment were not for the court to decide.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff taxicab owners filed a motion for an injunction pendente lite to restrain the enforcement of New York City, N.Y., Local Law No. 343 (1959) and for the collection of the 10 cents per trip tax imposed by the Local Law. The owners sought a judgment declaring that the Local Law and the State Enabling Act, 1959 N.Y. Laws 359, &sect; 5, pursuant to which the Local Law was adopted, were unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owners claimed that the Enabling Act was enacted without a city home rule request. The court concluded that an enabling act that delegated to a city the power to impose a local tax did not relate to the &quot;property, affairs, or government of a city&quot; within the meaning of the home rule provisions in N.Y. Const. art. IX, &sect; 12. The court held that a home rule request was not required before the enactment of an enabling act involving solely the delegation to a city of authority to impose local taxes for its general revenue purposes. According, the Enabling Act did not contravene the home rule provisions and the Local Law was validly adopted pursuant to the Enabling Act. The owners argued that the tax was discriminatory in taxing users of taxicabs while leaving untaxed the users of other means of public transportation. The court could not say that the legislature was wholly unjustified in making such a classification. The flat tax of 10 cents per trip was justified because the taximeter recorded the number of trips; further, the tax equally affected the riders. As a result, the tax did not violate the Equal Protection Clauses of the United States and New York Constitutions.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowner bought a large tract of land that was zoned for residential use. It sold part of the land, which was developed as residential property. Another part of the land was sold to the county for a storm drainage sump. In their action responding to the town's rezoning of their property, plaintiffs provided evidence that it was unnecessary for the property to be rezoned because there was sufficient land already zoned for industrial use and expert testimony that the land had little value as industrial property. The court found that plaintiffs had met their burden of proof by establishing that the property had no reasonable possibilities for industrial uses and that the ordinance precluded the use for which it was adapted. Under such circumstances, the ordinance as it related to the landowner's property was so unreasonable and arbitrary that it was an invasion of property rights contrary to the constitutional due process clause. Therefore, it was void. The ordinance did not unconstitutionally impair the mortgage because the ordinance did not act on that contract, did not affect its terms, and did not impair the obligation to perform or remedies available under the contract.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer filed a complaint alleging that her property tax assessment was defective because the assessors failed to personally examine each property in the city as required by New York City, N.Y.

The court took judicial notice of the fact that on its face the tax record complied with the statutory mandate for examination of properties. The court determined that the taxpayer could not collaterally attack the assessor's jurisdiction to assess the property, whether or not the property had been personally inspected. The court concluded that, because the taxpayer was in effect attacking the city's tax assessment of her property, she was restricted to the statutory remedies for contesting the levy of an &quot;illegal&quot; property tax provided in N.Y.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A real estate taxpayer's sole remedy for asserted illegality of assessments because of (1) the alleged failure of the tax assessors to examine personally each and every house and parcel of taxable realty in the city (Administrative Code of City of New York, &sect; 155b-1.0), despite the assessors' oath, which is attached to the assessment record, that they have indeed &quot;personally examined each and every house, building, lot, pier and other taxable property&quot;, and (2) alleged inequality of assessed valuations, is a review proceeding (Tax Law, art. 13, &sect; 290 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">et seq</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.; New York City Charter, &sect;&sect; 163-166; Administrative Code of City of New York, &sect; 166-1.0).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff town filed an action to enjoin defendant landowners from mining and dredging a sand pit until the landowners obtained a permit required by Town of Hempstead, N.Y., Ordinance No. 16 (ordinance), and until violations of the ordinance were cured.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The sand pit had been used for commercial mining for almost 20 years when the ordinance was passed. The landowners claimed res judicata, due process, equal protection, and the motives of town officials as defenses. Finding for the town, the court held that the action was not subject to the doctrine of res judicata because a previous action against the landowners, in which a trial court found that the landowners were entitled to a nonconforming use, was brought under a zoning ordinance and, as such, involved different issues and rights. The court found that the prior nonconforming use did not make the landowners immune against the ordinance. The court held that the landowners failed to sustain their burden of proof that the ordinance was unconstitutional as applied to them as there was little evidence to show unreasonableness and the ordinance was within the town's police power. The court found that because the ordinance and its enforcement were lawful, the motives of the town officials in enforcing the ordinance were not relevant.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found that the ordinance and its enforcement were valid exercises of the town's police power and gave judgment to the town against the landowners.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. A town which has grown in the past 32 years from a sparsely populated area to a densely populated area is granted judgment after trial enjoining ( Town Law, &sect; 135) the owner and operator of a 38-acre sand pit which has been used for the past 32 years for the mining of sand and gravel, and in which pit there is now a 20-acre artificial lake 25 feet deep, from any further dredging or mining, until said defendants comply with a recently enacted town ordinance which (1) declares the town's policy &quot;to prevent all manner of excavations which create pits, holes, or hollows in the earth, leaving it in a hazardous or dangerous state, or cause soil erosion * * * to remove the danger to health and life caused by deep excavations remaining in the ground * * * which ordinance will promote the safety, health and general welfare of the people of the Town&quot;, and (2) prohibits any pit excavation within 20 feet of any property line, or lower than 2 feet above the maximum ground water level at the site, or lower than 10 feet below the grade of the nearest street or highway unless the excavation&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  has retaining walls or its sides are kept at less than a specified incline, and (3) prohibits removal of earth which weakens the support of, or interferes with the orderly development of, or depreciates the value of, other properties, and (4) requires, when earth has been removed from any part of the excavation to the maximum extent above allowable, that such part be refilled and the premises graded to the levels of the nearest streets or roads, and (5) requires the pit to be surrounded with a 6-foot-high chain link fence or its equivalent, set into 18 inches of concrete, so as to prevent access through or under the fence, and (6) requires an excavation permit from the Town Board, which shall refuse such permit if the proposed excavation will violate any of the above provisions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. About two years before the present suit, the town had sued these same defendants for an injunction under the town's zoning ordinance. Said suit had been dismissed on the ground that defendants had a prior nonconforming use. That judgment is not </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">res judicata</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> as to the present ordinance. The present ordinance is a proper exercise of the town's police power against the maintenance of nuisances and for&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the regulation of businesses.  Against such an ordinance, a prior nonconforming use is no defense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The present ordinance, unlike a zoning ordinance, is intended to and does control existing excavations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Furthermore, a motion by these defendants to dismiss, on the ground of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">res judicata</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, a complaint filed by the town three years ago similar to the present complaint, was denied.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. The ordinance is presumed to be constitutional and nonconfiscatory.  It is obviously designed, among other things, to protect children and the public against the real and serious perils of falls, cave-ins and drownings.  Defendants have not shown that any provisions of the ordinance are unreasonable or that they cannot conform to its provisions or what it would cost them to conform.  It cannot be said that the ordinance unconstitutionally deprives them of property without due process of law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. The town's instituting this action against these defendants does not unconstitutionally deprive these defendants of the equal protection of the laws.  Within the town there are other excavations, some dry and some water-filled, which do not comply with this ordinance; but defendants have not shown whether&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  or not these are privately owned; one of them is an unfenced reservoir owned by the City of New York.  Throughout the county there are about 300 water drain basins or sumps owned or operated by the county, many of which do not meet the standards of this town's ordinance; but the ordinance validly and constitutionally excepts excavations for public uses.  There are perhaps another 100 privately owned sumps throughout the county; but defendants have not shown whether any of these are in operation and to what extent if any they fail to meet the standards of this town's ordinance. In sum, defendants have not shown a pattern of oppression against them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. The motives of the town's officials, in instituting this suit, are irrelevant.  Long-continued inaction of public officials cannot constitute a waiver by the public.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Ex post facto</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is not a defense; the town is not prosecuting defendants criminally, but is only pursuing its civil remedy of injunction ( Town Law, &sect; 135).  </SPAN></P>

The court rejected the arguments of the school districts and towns and held that the Commissioner's orders were final and conclusive under N.Y. Educ.

Finally, the court concluded that orders did not violate the state constitution, which permitted the state legislature to provide for the expenditure of public funds for the transportation of children to and from any school, and the use of public funds for transportation to nonpublic schools under case law was a constitutional expenditure which did not violate the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the federal constitution.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a proceeding under N.Y. Civ. Prac. Act art. 78, petitioners, a group of school teachers, against respondent, the Board of Education of New York, the movant sought an order relieving him from the terms of a stipulation, and further requested that the stipulation be vacated insofar as it applied to him.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A group of teachers were terminated under the provisions of New York City, N.Y., Charter &sect; 903 because they refused to answer questions about their affiliation with the Communist party posed by the Committee on Judiciary of the United States Senate. There was also pending a separate proceeding involving college personnel. During the pendency of the proceedings, the movant and five others were terminated for the same reasons. These individuals entered into a stipulation by which they agreed to be bound by the outcome of the pending litigation. Meanwhile, one individual's case had been severed when he chose to retain different counsel. In this individual's case, the United State's Supreme Court declared that &sect; 903 was unconstitutional. During the stipulants' appeal to the Commissioner of Education, the movant's appeal was severed to permit a substitution of counsel. The Commissioner refused to accept jurisdiction because the stipulants had elected their remedy and had chosen the court's as their forum. The court denied the motion because setting aside the stipulation would not have permitted the movant's appeal to go forward considering the Commissioner's decision.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although the United States Supreme Court has held, on an appeal to it by one New York City schoolteacher, that a discharge pursuant to section 903 of the New York City Charter is unconstitutional and invalid, said court has also refused to review a denial by the New York Court of Appeals of a motion by a group of other schoolteachers for a reversal by the Court of Appeals of its earlier contrary decision in their cases (350 U.

This denial&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  by the Court of Appeals included still another group of schoolteachers who had stipulated to be bound by the result of that group decision.  Thereafter, the State Commissioner of Education refused to accept jurisdiction of an appeal (Education Law, &sect; 310) by one of said stipulants for reinstatement in his position.  The New York Supreme Court now denies a motion by said stipulant for an order relieving him of his stipulation; however, if within a reasonable time the Commissioner of Education indicates in writing that he is willing to reconsider this stipulant's appeal, then this stipulant may renew his motion.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff wife filed an action for separation against defendant husband. The husband contended that a divorce had been granted in Florida and the wife amended her complaint and added a second cause of action for a judgment declaring the invalidity of the Florida divorce.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The husband contended that Florida divorce was valid, alleging that his domicile was in Florida. The court disagreed, finding that the parties had lived in New York and spent a few months each year in Florida, and that the husband started to build homes in Florida. The court found that the testimony failed to show the husband's residence in Florida for six months preceding the filing of the bill of complaint in the Florida proceeding. Thus the Florida court did not have jurisdiction over the subject matter. The wife then contended that she was entitled to a separation on the grounds of abandonment and nonsupport. The court agreed, finding that the wife had been in Florida with the husband and with his permission and consent she returned to New York and that the husband failed to furnish her with any funds or to communicate with her. The court further found that the husband's subsequent commencement of Florida divorce proceedings without notifying the wife was evidence of abandonment. Thus the court granted the wife a judgment of separation, alimony, and counsel fees, however, counsel fee for a Florida attorney was denied.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted the wife a judgment of separation, and awarded her alimony and counsel fees for her New York attorney.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Husband and wife -- Florida divorce void, since short of six months' domicile -- judgment of separation awarded, on ground of abandonment -- alimony and counsel fee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. A judgment of separation is conclusive that a valid marriage exists, and hence such a judgment makes it unnecessary to render a declaratory judgment as to the invalidity of a prior foreign divorce.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The obtaining of an ex parte foreign divorce is not cruelty, and, where the parties have previously been living apart, is not abandonment warranting a separation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Therefore, a plaintiff may properly plead and prove two causes of action: one for separation on the grounds of abandonment and nonsupport, and one for judgment declaring defendant's ex parte foreign divorce void.  However, if the trial court finds the foreign divorce void, and also finds that plaintiff is entitled to a separation on other grounds, the court should (1) decree separation and (2) dismiss the declaratory judgment cause of action as unnecessary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. This husband was domiciled in Florida when he commenced suit there for divorce and when that summons for divorce was mailed to his wife; but this New York court finds that his domicile there&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  had commenced only three days before he commenced suit, and not, as required by the Florida Annotated Statutes (&sect; 65.02), six months immediately prior to commencement of suit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Florida decisional law allows a defendant in an ex parte proceeding to have a decree set aside at any time where the record does not contain corroborated proof of domicile, not merely residence, for the required period.  The full faith and credit clause of the United States Constitution (art. IV, &sect; 1) and section 1738 of title 28 of the United States Code, enacted in pursuance thereof, permit collateral attack in another State if such attack would be permitted in the rendering State.  No principle of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">res judicata</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> or rule of comity mandates recognition of such a decree by the courts of New York.  Since New York will permit collateral attack upon its own divorce judgments, whether voidable only or absolutely void, no unconstitutional discrimination (U. S. Const., art. IV, &sect; 2) occurs when New York permits such a Florida decree to be collaterally attacked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. Furthermore, the uncontested Florida decree in this case did not contain any express finding of residence; and this New York court finds that the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  transcript of the testimony on which the decree was rendered fails to establish that the husband's domicile had been established in Florida for at least six months prior to the commencement of suit (Florida Ann. Stat., &sect; 65.02).  The Florida decree is therefore without jurisdiction; it is invalid; and it is not a bar to the wife's cause of action in New York for a judgment of separation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. Concomitantly with his Florida suit, the husband abandoned his wife and failed to support her.  The evidence supports her contention that her return to New York from Florida was with his acquiescence.  He has not shown any misconduct on her part sufficiently grave to justify him in abandoning and not supporting her (Civ. Prac. Act, &sect; 1163).  She is granted a judgment of separation on the grounds of abandonment and nonsupport.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. He was 69, she 55, when they married. Each had been previously married. She had long been used to working for her living.  This marriage lasted 4 1/2 years, when he abandoned and stopped supporting her and commenced suit in Florida.  He had been giving her $ 50 a week for the table, plus additional moneys when needed.  He owns real property and a 1954 Cadillac car&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and is in the building construction business.  His Federal tax returns during the years of their marriage showed adjusted gross incomes of $ 14,300, $ 12,575.26, $ 5,125, $ 3,912.83, and $ 380.68.  Taking into consideration the age of the parties, the length of their marriage, their standard of living, the fact that defendant has been drawing on capital, and the present physical condition and requirements of both parties, the trial court fixes alimony in the amount of $ 100 a week, and directs that such payments commence on the return date of the motion for temporary alimony and counsel fees which had been referred to this trial court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. For the services of plaintiff's counsel, including his out-of-pocket expenses, in investigating the facts and the Florida law, in preparing the complaint and amended complaint, in preparing and arguing the motions for alimony, injunction, sequestration and to amend the complaint, in arguing an appeal, and in the preparation and six-day trial of the instant action, counsel fee is fixed at $ 2,500.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">10. Plaintiff's request that a separate fee be allowed for a Florida attorney is denied.  Although the Civil Practice Act ( &sect; 1169-a) authorizes a separate&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  allowance for the making of a factual investigation with respect to the Florida divorce or for an expert witness on Florida law, under the head of &quot;sums of money necessary to enable the wife, to carry on * * * the action&quot;, the Florida attorney did not testify as an expert and there is nothing in the record to show what services he rendered in investigating the facts.  </SPAN></P>

After the neighbors tried to restrain the business, the owners sued for a declaratory judgment that the zoning ordinance was unconstitutional and invalid. The owners argued that because the zoning ordinance only applied to a portion of the Town, it was not part of a comprehensive plan as required by N.Y. Town Law &sect;&sect; 260-284. The court entered judgment in favor of defendants. A decision to zone part of the Town and not the rest of it was in effect a comprehensive plan.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Zoning Ordinance of the Town of Granby, adopted in 1938, limited the use of an area about a mile long and a half mile in depth to residential and agricultural purposes.  The town is about 10 miles long and about 8 miles wide.  The requirement of section 263 of the Town Law that zoning regulations &quot;shall be made in accordance with a comprehensive plan&quot; was not violated.  The ordinance declared a comprehensive zoning plan and was not illegal &quot;spot zoning&quot;.  Absent a showing that the remainder of the town should be zoned or that the ordinance is unreasonable or arbitrary, it is valid.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff oil company brought an action seeking to declare certain amendments to the Building Zone Ordinance of defendant Incorporated Village of Valley Stream ineffective, unconstitutional, and void as to the use of the company's property. The oil company sought an order adjudging that it was entitled to a permit for the erection, maintenance, and operation of a gasoline service station.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The company entered into a lease of the premises conditioned upon the obtaining of a special use permit. Defendant Board of Trustees amended the ordinance by repealing and eliminating in a C-I district the granting of a special permit for gasoline stations and by adding to permitted uses in an industrial district, the use of gasoline service stations. The Board denied the application of the company for a special use permit. The court determined that Valley Stream, N.Y., Building Zone Ordinance &sect; 12-a required no notice to the company of the proposed amendment. The court explained that N.Y. Village Law &sect; 95 did not require personal service of the amendment to validate the same. The court noted that N.Y. Village Law &sect; 175 gave the Board the power to regulate and restrict the location and use of buildings, structures, and land for trade, industry, residence, or other purposes. The court concluded that the actions of the Board were a reasonable exercise of the powers granted under the Village Law and were not arbitrary, discriminatory, or confiscatory.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Municipal corporations -- zoning -- amendment to village zoning ordinance requiring special use permits for gasoline service stations in commercial districts not </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">unconstitutional</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> for failing to provide standards or safeguards on which to base granting or denial of applications -- plaintiffs not entitled to notice of proposed amendment limiting such stations to industrial districts, nor to personal service of copy of amendment (Village Law, &sect; 95) -- village has authority to enact zoning </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">legislation</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> (Village Law, &sect; 175) -- study of zoning map indicates orderly arrangement of use districts -- legality of ordinance not affected by fact that greater return might be realized by operator of gasoline service station than is now realized -- actions of Village Board were reasonable exercise of its powers and were not arbitrary, discriminatory or confiscatory -- complaint dismissed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. An amendment to the Building Zone Ordinance of the Village of Valley Stream requiring permits for gasoline service stations as a special use in commercial districts was not unconstitutional for failure to provide standards&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  or safeguards on which to base the granting or denial of applications.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. A subsequent amendment limiting gasoline service stations to industrial districts was not invalid for failure of the Board of Trustees to give plaintiffs notice of the proposed amendment. Notice is required only as to change of classification of a particular parcel of land, rather than to a change of the uses in a given district, and to owners of property outside, rather than within, the area of proposed change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Although action on plaintiffs' application for a permit was reserved until after adoption of the latter amendment, even if it had been granted, adoption of the amendment before actual investment by plaintiffs in construction would have prevented the use.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Personal service of amendments is only required to accelerate the effective date (Village Law, &sect; 95).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. The challenged amendments are not unconstitutional.  The right of a municipality to enact zoning legislation may not be interfered with by a court unless it is exercised in an arbitrary, unreasonable, discriminatory or confiscatory manner.  A study of the zoning map of defendant village indicates an orderly arrangement of use districts&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  which, defendant claims, were adopted after considerable study and are the result of a valid dedication of all the areas in the village to the most appropriate use of the land.  The fact that a greater return could be realized by the operator of a gasoline service station than is now realized does not affect the legality of the ordinance (Village Law, &sect; 175).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. The actions of the Village Board were a reasonable exercise of its powers and were not arbitrary, discriminatory or confiscatory. The complaint is dismissed.  </SPAN></P>

The employee filed an application pursuant to N.Y. C.P.L.R. art. 78 to review the determination of the commission in affirming the transit authority's decision. On appeal, the employee argued that the administrative finding of reasonable grounds for belief, concerning his doubtful trust and reliability, offended due process. However, the court determined that it was the employee's lack of candor and his refusal to respond to questioning that provided the evidence of his doubtful trust and reliability. Further, the court held that there was no factual basis for the employee's claim that he was at any time charged by the transit authority with having been a member of the Communist party or that he was discharged for that reason.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The association operated a training program to prepare psychologists and other qualified persons to practice or teach psychoanalysis.

Plaintiffs contended that the statute violated due process and equal protection principles. The court declared that the statute was constitutional. By the terms of the statute, the individual members were prohibited from representing themselves as psychologists. In its decision, the court held that the State had the power to regulate psychoanalysis and psychotherapy because they were occupations that affected the public health or welfare. Further, plaintiffs had not overcome the presumption of constitutionality of the statute. In addition, the fact that the statute did not define the term &quot;psychology&quot; had no effect on its validity because it was immaterial whether a person was a psychologist, as the relevant test was whether a person was holding himself out to the public as a psychologist.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Article 153 (&sect;&sect; 7601-7614) of the Education Law is constitutional.  It prohibits anyone from representing himself to be a &quot;psychologist&quot; unless he is registered and certified by the Regents-appointed Board of Examiners of Psychologists as having met their standards of education, training, experience, character, age and citizenship. It also provides for suspension and revocation of certificates, and for judicial&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  review of such action and of refusal to issue or renew certificates. It also provides for confidential communications between registered psychologist and client.  The statute is designed for the protection of the public from charlatans. The statute does not attempt to define the broad term &quot;psychology&quot;; it does not prohibit anyone from practicing &quot;psychology&quot;; it merely prohibits unqualified persons from representing themselves to be &quot;psychologists&quot;.  In this respect, it is similar to article 149 of the Education Law, which does not prohibit anyone from practicing &quot;accountancy&quot;, but does prohibit unqualified persons from using the title &quot;C. P. A.&quot; Somewhat similar is article 131, which regulates &quot;osteopathy&quot; under the supervision of the Regents, without attempting to define the term.  The power of the Regents and of the Board of Examiners of Psychologists to make rules and regulations (&sect;&sect; 7603, 7613) is necessarily subject to the standards set forth in article 153 (&sect; 7605 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">et seq</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.); and the article provides for an advisory council to be broadly representative of the whole field of psychology (&sect; 7604).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant brought an application in the form of a writ of error coram nobis to review his sentence under N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 1048 for murder in the second degree for shooting another man during an altercation between them.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, who had been imprisoned for 21 years, argued that the sentence imposed, 55 years to life, was so grossly excessive that it constituted an illegal and unconstitutional sentence. The State contended that the writ of error coram nobis was not available and that defendant's remedy was to apply for executive clemency. The court imposed a new sentence. The court noted that the punishment for murder in the second degree was an indeterminate sentence, the minimum not less than 20 years and the maximum not more than life. The court stated that under N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 1048 it was mandatory that the sentence be not fixed or predetermined and not lead to a definite end or result. The court observed that the sentence imposed was just as effective in confining defendant for the remainder of his life as though the minimum had been 100 or 200 years. The court stated that a clear injustice had been perpetrated and that the courts could not claim to be courts of justice if the only remedy was holding the court powerless and surrendering its mistake to the executive branch of government. The court pointed out that a pardon or a reprieve was based upon mercy, not upon justice.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court imposed a new sentence that defendant be confined for an indeterminate sentence, the minimum of which should be 25 years and the maximum of which should be for his natural life.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Twenty-one years ago defendant, then 29 years old and without criminal record, got into an argument with his rooming companion after drinking on Independence Day and shot and killed him.  After trial defendant was convicted of murder in the second degree. The permissible sentence is &quot;an indeterminate sentence&quot; of 20 years to life (Penal Law, &sect; 1048).  The court, without any presentence investigation or questioning, sentenced him to 55 years to life. But defendant's expectation of life, according to actuarial tables, was only 35.15 years.  In effect it was a straight life sentence, contrary to the legislative intent. Defendant's </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">coram nobis</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> application is granted and he is resentenced to an indeterminate sentence of 25 years to life.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant filed a motion to dismiss a two-count information, which charged him with illegal possession of narcotic drugs and illegal possession of a hypodermic syringe and a hypodermic needle. Defendant alleged that N.Y. Penal Law &sect;&sect; 1751-a and 1747-d(3) were unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant alleged that N.Y. Penal Law &sect;&sect; 1751-a, which makes it a misdemeanor to illegally possess narcotic drugs, and 1747-d(3), which makes it a misdemeanor to illegally possess narcotic implements, were unconstitutional. As to the count alleging illegal possession of narcotic drugs, the court found that no constitutional question was presented as to that count. In considering the challenge to constitutionality of &sect; 1747-d(3), the court found that the statute had a definite relation between the narcotic evil and the purported cure or prevention offered by the statute. The legislature was within its power in making possession of narcotic implements without a prescription a crime. Further, the legislature also possessed the power to declare that on and after April 16, 1956, such possession was illegal. Finally, the court concluded that because the legislature had cause to become alarmed at the increased number of narcotic addicts and the effect of such addiction on the public health and welfare, &sect; 1747-d(3) was part of the police power of the State. Thus, &sect; 1747-d(3) was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

After trial, the trial court found that defendant did stop, but did not thereafter proceed with caution so as not to interfere with or endanger traffic. On appeal, the court reversed the conviction, remitted the fine, and dismissed the information. The court held that &sect; 95-d was vague and indefinite, as it did not set up a sufficiently definite standard of conduct and was not sufficiently explicit to inform those who may become subject to its penalty as to what conduct on their part would not be an interference with or an endangering of traffic. The court noted that a new statute,&nbsp;N.Y. Veh. &amp; Traf. Law &sect; 1172, set up a definite standard of conduct.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff landowner filed suit against defendants, a city and city officials, to declare an amendment to a city zoning ordinance unconstitutional as it affected plaintiff's property. Plaintiff also sought a declaration that she had a vested right to develop her property in accordance with the provisions of the R-1A district zone of the city zoning ordinance. Plaintiff also sought injunctive relief. The matter was referred to a referee.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After extensive study, the city adopted a comprehensive zoning ordinance, in which plaintiff's property was placed in an R-1A district, the highest residence district at that time. The school district requested plaintiff to give it 13 acres of her property to be used for the erection of an elementary school, with its surrounding recreational area. Plaintiff was willing to make the gift of land on condition that the school parcel conform to the overall development of her property, which could only mean a development in accordance with the zoning ordinance as it then existed. By reason of the city's approval of plaintiff's plat plan, when she completed the conveyance to the school district, plaintiff had a vested right to develop her remaining land in accordance with her plan, as approved by the planning board. The vested right thus acquired gave plaintiff the right to make and develop the subdivision in accordance with the approved plat plan and the zoning ordinance that was in effect at the time of the conveyance. Having the vested right, the referee ruled that the upzoning of her premises by the city council was illegal and without effect as applied to plaintiff's property.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1955 the City of New Rochelle adopted a Zoning Ordinance by which plaintiff's property was placed in a residence district which provided that lots must contain 10,000 square feet, with a 100-foot frontage at the building line. In 1956 the New Rochelle City School District requested plaintiff to give it 13.3 acres of her property, to be used for the erection of an elementary school, with its surrounding recreational area.  Plaintiff was willing to make this gift of land, constituting more than 20% of her property&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and admittedly worth $ 140,000, on condition that the school parcel conform to the overall development of her property, which could only mean a development in accord with the Zoning Ordinance as it then existed.  Plaintiff had a plat plan of her entire property prepared.  At a meeting of the City Planning Board held on December 10, 1956, the board approved the subdivision as shown on plaintiff's plan upon certain stated conditions, all of which were met.  The plat plan provided a benefit to the city in that no lots faced on two important highways, and, further, that land was provided for the widening and straightening of those roads without cost to the city.  Plaintiff was notified in writing by the Planning Board of the approval of the subdivision map and of the conditions imposed.  By deeds dated December 29, 1956 and January 8, 1957, plaintiff conveyed the school site to the Board of Education.  The Planning Board met on January 14, 1957, after plaintiff had delivered her deeds, and at this meeting the board deleted one of the conditions, disapproved the subdivision map, and recommended to the Common Council that the Zoning Ordinance be amended by placing the undeveloped areas of&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the city in a new district, where 20,000-square-foot lots, with a width of 150 feet at the building line, would be required.  By ordinances dated May 15, 1957, August 19, 1957 and September 11, 1957, the Common Council followed this recommendation to upzone, with the result that plaintiff's property was placed in the new district. There is no statutory authority for a planning board, having once approved a plat plan, later to disapprove it.  When plaintiff completed the conveyance, she had a vested right to develop her remaining land in accord with her plan as approved by the Planning Board. The upzoning of her premises was illegal and without effect.  The zoning amendment should not be set aside as wholly invalid, but it is not applicable to the plaintiff's property.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In an action before the Supreme Court of New York, Special and Trial Term, New York County, plaintiff employment agency requested injunctive relief preventing the state from enforcing N.Y. Gen. Bus. Law &sect; 185(9)(1), which reduced the percentage that an agency could charge an employer. The employment agency claimed this newly enacted provision was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employment agency sought a declaratory judgment determining that the particular provisions of &sect; 185 which reduced fees which could be charged by nurses' registries for private duty placement of was unconstitutional and void. The issue, thus, was whether a statute limiting fees chargeable by employment agencies for placing nurses in private duty to five percent of the salary or wages received each week by the nurse (for the first 10 weeks of employment) was unreasonable and invalid. The court held that such a limitation was completely proper where closely related to the protection of state citizens. Because the legislature's valid exercise of police power was deemed valid, the court dismissed the employment agency's action.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The Employment Agency Act (General Business Law, art. 11), as amended (L. 1958, ch. 893), insofar as it reduces the fees which may be charged by employment agencies or registries for placing nurses in private duty (General Business Law, &sect; 185, subd. 9, par.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The fact that the enactment of a statute results in reduced income, or diminishes property value, or makes it impossible for some people to continue in business, does not establish a denial of constitutional due process or equal protection under the law.  Public welfare is a broad and inclusive concept.  Legislation regulating an entire group is valid even though some members of the group may suffer economic losses not shared by others of the group.  Courts may not sit as superlegislatures to weigh the wisdom of each enactment or to decide whether the legislative policy offends the welfare of a particular&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  group.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of violating N.Y. Veh. &amp; Traf. Law &sect; 1214, which prohibited the sudden opening of a car door or leaving a car door open on the side available to moving traffic. Defendant was fined. Defendant appealed. On appeal, the court reversed the conviction and remitted the fine to defendant. The court held that the weight of the evidence favored the finding of innocence and that the benefit of the doubt should have been resolved in defendant's favor. According to the court, there was a sharp conflict in the testimony of the complainant and defendant, and a disinterested witness testified that there was no traffic moving at the time of the accident. In addition, the court also declared &sect; 1214&nbsp;unconstitutional. According to the court, the law left many questions of interpretation open and susceptible to extensive variations of understanding. The court concluded that the law was too vague and indefinite in its wording to guide operators of motor vehicles and enforcement officers and that it lacked clarity and definition for courts in interpreting and carrying out its provisions.</SPAN></P>

The trial court dismissed the charge against defendant because &sect; 1210, subd. a was unconstitutionally vague. Section 1210, subd. a provided that no person driving or in charge of a motor vehicle leave it unattended without first stopping the engine, locking the ignition, removing the key, and effectively setting the brake. The court found that the provision &quot;removing the key&quot; was vague because its only direction was removing the key from the ignition. It did not provide enough information to warn a person in advance whether his act was criminal or not. The court stated that if the statute was intended to require a person to completely remove the key from the vehicle, it should have so stated.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant filed a motion to dismiss his criminal indictment on the grounds that he was denied a speedy trial. Defendant asserted that N.Y. Code Crim. Proc. &sect; 673, the statute that formed the basis for his indictment, unconstitutionally deprived him of his right to a speedy trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was indicted on criminal charges. His original indictment was dismissed on the grounds that prejudicial delay had denied defendant his right to a speedy trial. The state then reindicted defendant for the same crimes pursuant to N.Y. Code Crim. Proc. &sect; 673. The court denied defendant's motion to dismiss his reindictment. Although the court expressed doubts as to the wisdom of the statutory scheme created by &sect; 673, it felt constrained to abide by state law, which dictated that undue delay was measured from the time that the indictment to which the motion of dismissal was addressed was found.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defendant originally was indicted by an indictment filed January 7, 1955.  The Appellate Division dismissed the indictment for failure to prosecute (Code Crim. Pro., &sect; 668) without prejudice to the right of the District Attorney to proceed as permitted in section 673 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.  The District Attorney thereafter did so proceed and defendant was indicted by indictment filed November 3, 1958.  A motion by defendant for an order dismissing the indictment on the grounds that he has been denied a speedy trial is denied.  The law of this State measures the undue delay in such a case from the time the particular indictment to which the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  motion is addressed was found.  Such a dismissal does not bar the District Attorney from proceeding to obtain a new indictment under section 673 of the Code of Criminal Procedure if the offense charged, as in this case, be a felony. Because of the statutory provisions, the court may not consider on this motion the delay which was found by the Appellate Division to be fatal to the first indictment. There is no claim here by the defendant that he has been denied a speedy trial since the new indictment was found.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the search warrant used by officers was improper and incompetent. The court affirmed and found that the proof amply substantiated the finding that the defendant was conducting a gambling operation as a business. Defendant personally handed papers to police officers containing notations of bets and other numerical listings allegedly connected with policy numbers. The actual exhibits were not submitted to the court for examination. The court found testimony describing defendant's activities convincing. The court rejected defendant's objection to a telephone tap and held that the information received by the tap could be used against defendant even though obtained in the course of intercepting another's phone. Defendant was tied to the conversations by the identification of his voice. Thus defendant was present in effect and the calls were binding upon him. The court found no reason to exclude a tape recording because although somewhat muted, it appeared that defendant's voice was recorded and satisfactorily identified. The court held that there was no double punishment for a single crime.</SPAN></P>

The court concluded that the changes made by Local Law No. 1 (1959) in the boundaries of the wards of the city clearly changed the mode of selection or methods of nominating and electing ward supervisors of the city, in violation of the constitutional and statutory prohibitions.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The agents bought chicken coops which were not returned to them by the purchasers. The fiscal officers imposed a sales tax on the purchase price of the coops, contending that the agents rented the coops and that in some way they were returned to the lessor. The agents sought a declaratory judgment to the effect that sales taxes were improperly imposed and an injunction prohibiting the tax collection and further hearings regarding it. The agents contended that relegating them to appeal from an adverse administrative finding by way of N.Y. C.P.L.R. art. 78 would involve a hardship because they would have to post a bond in the amount of the tax assessed, and that the fiscal officers should be estopped from imposing the tax. The court granted the fiscal officers' motion to dismiss, finding that the agents had not shown that the amount of the tax was confiscatory, and that the fact that the agents' books had been periodically audited by the city authorities without any tax being assessed did not create an estoppel. Thus, the court concluded that the agents should be relegated to the usual procedure in tax matters and discretion should not be exercised to entertain the action.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Taxation -- declaratory judgments -- despite tax statute's provision that review proceeding (Civ. Prac. Act, art. 78) is exclusive remedy (Administrative Code of City of New York, &sect; N41-7.0), action for declaratory judgment is proper in case of wide public interest or to declare </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">unconstitutionality</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> or inapplicability -- tax statute's requirement for bond in amount of tax in order to institute review proceeding (Civ. Prac. Act, art. 78) is not inequitable unless confiscatory -- city is not estopped to impose sales tax for past years merely because of its past years' audits of taxpayer's books -- if questions of fact are involved, remedy is administrative hearings rather than court hearings -- taxpayers claim that chicken coops are used up in sales of live poultry, whereas city claims that coops are sales-taxable; administrative hearings have already consumed 300 pages; action for declaratory judgment and injunction dismissed (Rules Civ. Prac., rule 212).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Despite a tax statute's provision (Administrative Code of City of New York, &sect; N41-7.0) that the exclusive method of review is a proceeding under article 78 of the Civil Practice Act, an action for a&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  declaratory judgment may be proper (1) where the constitutionality of the taxing statute is questioned, or (2) where imposition of the tax is claimed to be inapplicable to the situation, or (3) where the decision will affect a great many other people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. A tax statute's provision that, in order to obtain review by a proceeding under article 78 of the Civil Practice Act, the taxpayer must post a bond in the amount of the tax assessed, is not an inequitable hardship, unless the amount of the tax is confiscatory or so substantial as to preclude the possibility of advantage from such right of review.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Where a tax review involves substantial questions of fact, such questions should be resolved in administrative hearings, rather than in court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The city is not estopped to impose a sales tax for past years merely because, in the past, it periodically audited the taxpayer's books and did not impose a tax on this particular kind of sale, so that now, asserts the taxpayer, it would be a hardship to pay a tax on sales on which no tax was originally collected by the seller.  He does not allege that any departmental ruling or interpretation was ever made on which he relied.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. The taxpayers&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  are poultry agents, who put the live birds in coops and sell the birds to slaughterhouses. The taxpayers claim that the coops are practically used up in delivery, whereas the city claims that the taxpayers rent the coops and that in some way the coops are returned to the lessors and that a sales tax is payable thereon.  Administrative hearings are pending, and over 300 pages have already been devoted to the city auditors' procedures.  Clearly, the question of estoppel involves disputed issues of fact.  Accordingly, the taxpayers should be relegated to the usual procedure and review in tax matters.  The court declines to entertain this action for a declaratory judgment and injunction, and dismisses the complaint (Rules Civ. Prac., rule 212).  </SPAN></P>

The information charged defendant with &quot;sideswiping&quot; a car, going &quot;to the left side&quot; and driving so as to endanger others. Defendant pleaded guilty to both charges and was convicted by the trial court. On appeal, the court reversed and held that N.Y. Veh. &amp; Traf.

The court found that even if &sect; 56(1) was not invalid, the information was defective because it failed to show circumstances that could have differentiated an ordinary accident and civil negligence from criminal liability despite the plea of guilty. The court noted that defendant did not waive his objection that the information did not charge a crime when he pleaded guilty. The court held that defendant's conviction under N.Y.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The subject property was bound on three of its four sides by residences.

The due process clauses of the Constitutions do not require that a landowner be afforded the best use of his property; they merely require that he be afforded reasonable use. What is a reasonable use, for zoning purposes, is a legislative matter.  The party assailing legislation must show its unconstitutionality beyond a reasonable doubt. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The licensees asserted that new Hospital Code and Regulations which required each hospital room to have at least 70 square feet and certain footage between beds was in violation of the Federal and State Constitutions in that they are in deprivation of property without due process of law. The court dismissed their petition, holding that they failed to allege facts which may establish the Board's determination and refusal as arbitrary, capricious or unreasonable. They had no vested right in the continuation of their hospital on a 50-bed basis. For the Board to grant a variance they were required to show unique circumstances or that they suffered a singular disadvantage or unnecessary hardship through the operation of the amended code and regulations.

Said hospital's application to the city's Hospital Board for a variance on the ground of hardship or unique circumstances was denied.  In this review proceeding (Civ. Prac.

The property owner argued that the city and its agencies, in granting the variance or the permission to extend the nonconforming use, acted illegally because there had been no notice to residents and because no evidence was taken upon which the council's conclusions of law and fact were made. In granting the temporary injunction, the court found that, although the city could take actions permitted by the zoning ordinance and by N.Y. Gen.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff supply company filed an action for a declaratory judgment in which it sought to hold a 1955 rezoning ordinance of defendant Village of Scarsdale, N.Y., unconstitutional. It also sought a declaration that the ordinance was confiscatory and void insofar as it affected its property, which had been reclassified from a business district to a residence district. The supply company continued to operate its supply yard on the property.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In October 1955, by amendment to the zoning ordinance, the property was placed in the newly created residence district, which no longer permitted the operation of a building supply yard. The court first noted that the use had becoming a nonconforming use and that no one was questioning the fact that the supply company now lawfully used and could continue to operate the supply yard. The supply company contended that in adopting the 1955 rezoning, the village failed to comply with N.Y. Village Law &sect; 179. The court found the contention to be without merit. The rezoning was subsequently made effective by the enactment of a new village code in 1957 that specifically repealed all previously enacted ordinances and enacted new ones, including the zoning provisions applicable to the supply company's property. The court also found that it was difficult to see how the supply company was presently aggrieved or deprived in any manner of the use of its property. Before the court could consider whether the Village could restrict, without compensation, the use of the property, there should be proof that the 1957 village code diminished the value of the present property rights.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Finding that the supply company had failed to prove the allegations of its complaint by a fair preponderance of the credible evidence, the court dismissed the complaint.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Municipal corporations -- zoning -- property which concededly has prior nonconforming use cannot attack constitutionality of zoning reclassification from business use to residential use.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. A property owner who concededly has the right to continue his pre-existing nonconforming use of his property and buildings as a building supply yard cannot maintain an action against the village for a judgment declaring that an amendment to the zoning ordinance and an entirely new zoning ordinance have unreasonably, confiscatorily and unconstitutionally reclassified his property from a business district to a residence district.  The village does not question his right to continue to use his property as a building supply yard. He has shown that, under the former business zone classification, he could also have profitably converted his property to use as a shopping or retail store center; but he has not shown any present intent to undertake any such conversion.  Nor is there any proof that the village contemplates using its power to enact legislation requiring nonconforming uses to be discontinued within a reasonable and nonconfiscatory time.  In short, there is no present controversy, and&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the complaint is dismissed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. In 1955, by amendment to its zoning ordinance, the village placed plaintiff's property in a newly created residence district, instead of its former business district.  Section 179 of the Village Law, as it then read, required that, in case of protest against a proposed change in zoning signed by the owners of 20% or more of the area of the land included in the proposed change, &quot;such amendment shall not become effective except by the favorable vote of all the members of the board of trustees&quot; Plaintiff had filed a written protest, and plaintiff's property constituted more than 20% of the area involved by the creation of the new residence district.  The amendment was adopted by a merely 5-to-2 vote of the village's Board of Trustees. However, shortly before adopting the amendment, the village had enacted a local law (Local Laws, 1955, No. 4 of Village of Scarsdale) substituting a requirement for a merely two-thirds vote instead of the unanimity required by section 179 of the Village Law. This local law may have been authorized by the Village Home Rule Law (&sect; 11, subd. 4).  Incidentally, section 179 of the Village Law was amended in 1956 (L. 1956, ch. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  759) to require only a three-fourths vote of a board of trustees. In any event, in 1957 the village Board of Trustees by unanimous vote repealed the zoning ordinance and its amendments and enacted a new zoning ordinance (Scarsdale Village Code, 1957) placing plaintiff's property in a residence district.  This new, unanimous ordinance is unquestionably valid.  The rights of plaintiff must be determined by the valid law as it exists today.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, operators of nonpublic kindergartens, filed a motion for summary judgment in their action seeking to declare as unconstitutional &sect; 195 of the &quot;Regulations of the Commissioner,&quot; adopted by defendant, the Board of Regents of the State of New York on March 1, 1957. Defendants, the Board and the Commissioner of Education of the State of New York, filed a cross-motion for summary judgment dismissing the complaint.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Section 195 provided for the registration of nonpublic kindergartens. The operators alleged that the registration program was designed to influence the public not to deal with unregistered schools. The court found that a provision in a bulletin concerning the admission of children from registered programs into first grade unlawfully discriminated against children from unregistered programs. Accordingly, the operators were entitled to partial summary judgment. The court held, however, that it was within the power of the Board and Commissioner to enact the remainder of the rules of the Board and the &quot;general regulations&quot; of the Commissioner. Section 195 furnished adequate standards for the Commissioner put into effect the educational policies of the State. N.Y. Educ. Law &sect; 207 was sufficiently broad to encompass the institution by the Board of a noncompulsory registration program. The court determined that the rules and regulations were not arbitrary or capricious, or improper, but rather, were reasonable. The operators were not so aggrieved to maintain the action as they had not shown that their legal rights were infringed or that they were denied equal protection.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted partial summary judgment in favor of the operators to the extent that the Commissioner's direction, which gave a preference to children from registered private kindergartens in admission to the first grade of a public school, was discriminatory, improper, and a violation of the constitutional rights of others. The court granted summary judgment to the Board and the Commissioner dismissing every other portion of the complaint.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Schools -- registration of private kindergartens -- Board of Regents adopted section 195 of Regulations of Commissioner providing that nonpublic kindergartens might be registered by Education Department upon compliance with stated conditions -- in action by operators of private kindergartens for judgment declaring such section and implementing regulations of Education Commissioner </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">unconstitutional,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> plaintiffs were awarded summary judgment declaring that direction of Commissioner, which gave preference in admission to first grade in public schools to children who attended registered private kindergartens, was </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">unconstitutional</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> and defendants were awarded summary judgment dismissing balance of complaint.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The Board of Regents adopted, on March 1, 1957, section 195 of the Regulations of the Commissioner of Education, and on the same day the Commissioner of Education adopted &quot;General Regulations&quot; to implement section 195.  Section 195 provided that a nonpublic nursery school and/or kindergarten might be registered, on a voluntary&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  basis, by the Education Department if it should present evidence of compliance with stated conditions relating to buildings and equipment, personnel, curriculum, teacher-pupil ratio, etc.  The Regulations of the Commissioner set up the mechanism of registration, supplemented the Regulations of the Board of Regents and provided that when a school had been registered it should receive from the Education Department, a &quot;Certificate of Approval&quot; which might be displayed on its premises as long as it was valid.  A bulletin of the Commissioner of Education dated August 1958, as interpreted by the court, provided that local public school authorities must admit to the first grade any child who attended and satisfactorily completed a full year's work at a registered nonpublic kindergarten, if it were 5 years, 8 months or more on September 1st, upon entering the first grade and that they might not admit a child of the same age to first grade upon completion of a full year at an unregistered nonpublic kindergarten unless and until they determined that such unregistered kindergarten provided instruction substantially equivalent to that of the local public school.  If such kindergarten did provide&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  such instruction, &quot;the child should be placed in the first grade.&quot; In this action by operators of nursery schools and kindergartens for judgment declaring section 195 of the Regulations of the Commissioner and the General Regulations unconstitutional, summary judgment was granted plaintiffs to the extent of declaring that the direction of defendant Commissioner of Education which gave preference to children from registered private kindergartens in admission to the first grade of a public school was unconstitutional, and summary judgment was granted defendants dismissing every other portion of the complaint.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.  Section 207 of the Education Law conferred upon defendant Board of Regents power to &quot;exercise legislative functions concerning the educational system of the state, determine its educational policies, and, except, as to the judicial functions of the commissioner of education, establish rules for carrying into effect the laws and policies of the state, relating to education, and the functions, powers, duties and trusts conferred or charged upon the university and the education department.&quot; Such broad delegation of power furnished authority for the enactment of section 195 of the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Regulations of the Commissioner of Education.  Section 207 of the Education Law was not directly attacked in the complaint, and was presumed to be valid.  Its constitutionality may not be passed upon when the issue had not been raised by the pleadings.  Having failed to do so, plaintiffs could not question it by memorandum of law or by oral argument.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The statute was sufficiently broad to encompass the institution by the Board of Regents of a noncompulsory registration program for private nursery schools and kindergartens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Section 195 provided both general and specific standards to limit and define the powers and duties of the Commissioner of Education.  He adopted a set of rules to carry out the intent of the Board of Regents as expressed in that enactment.  These rules, with the exception of the provision concerning admission to first grade from nonpublic kindergartens, were a proper implementation of section 195 by the executive officer charged with its administration.  Both the delegation of authority and the exercise of that authority were warranted under the circumstances.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. The rules and regulations were a reasonable exercise of defendants' powers to determine and put&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  into effect the educational policies of the State and were not arbitrary or capricious.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. Plaintiffs have not been denied the equal protection of the law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. The registration program was purely voluntary.  The complaint contained no factual allegations to support the charge that the rules were designed to coerce plaintiffs into conformity with the department's standards, or to place in a more favorable competitive position those who did comply with such standards.  In the absence of positive proof it might not be presumed the motives of part of the Department of Education were improper.  If, conceivably, some parents might misinterpret the absence of a Department of Education certificate as evidence of inferiority, defendants could not be held legally responsible for this false conclusion.  Plaintiffs were free to correct this error by any proper means they choose.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. No illegal force, coercion or duress was applied.  No discrimination was shown nor did it appear that any other constitutional right of these plaintiffs was violated.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff landlord brought an action to evict defendant tenant from a three-room basement apartment. The department of housing and buildings placed a violation against the premises because of the occupancy of the apartment by the tenant, who was a person other than a janitor and his family as limited by the provisions of N.Y. Mult. Dwell. Law &sect; 216(2)(e). The tenant filed an answer.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The tenant's defense was that the provisions of &sect; 216 limiting occupancy of the basement apartment solely to a janitor and his family was discriminatory and unconstitutional. The court found no difficulty in holding that the general purpose of &sect; 216 and its subdivisions dealing with the proper housing safeguards, sanitation, and light were in furtherance of legislative aims to protect the public welfare. However, the specific provision of &sect; 216(2)(e) limiting the use of such a basement apartment solely to a janitor and his family presented another problem. The court found that the only proper consideration was the safety and welfare of the occupants regardless of their occupation. It was obvious that the apartment adequately met proper housing standards for human habitation. Considering the present shortage of apartments and the fact that a final order issued in favor of the landlord would of necessity direct the issuance of a warrant evicting the tenant, the court declared that so much of &sect; 216(2)(e) as directed that the basement apartment created thereunder should be occupied by a superintendent and his family only was discriminatory and unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner board of education charged respondent parents with neglect of their children, alleging that the children lacked proper guardianship because the parents refused to send the children to their assigned schools or to provide substitute teaching in compliance with the law. The parents defended on the ground that the children were denied equal education opportunities in violation of U.S. Const. amend XIV.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In response to petitions filed by the school board for alleged neglect, the parents asserted, in justification of their refusal to send their children to assigned schools, that the schools offered educationally inferior opportunities as a result of de facto racial segregation and discriminatory teacher staffing. The court dismissed the petitions, holding that N.Y. Educ. Law &sect; 310 was not a bar to a judicial determination of whether the board of education violated legal rights, whatever their origin and the defense of inferior educational opportunities in the schools by reason of racial discrimination was established and barred an adjudication of neglect. The record sustained the parents' contention that the children had inferior educational opportunities where the schools were attended predominantly by minority children who were taught by less qualified teachers. The separation of children by race, whether the result of governmental action or private housing segregation, created factors inimical to full and equal educational opportunities. Further, teachers who exercised the board of education's power for teacher assignments were not acting in matters of merely private concern.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court dismissed the petitions by the board of education against the parents.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Schools -- racial segregation -- parents cannot constitutionally be compelled to send their children to schools which are racially segregated and relatively poorly staffed, even if school segregation is result of neighborhood segregation not caused by governmental action, and even if equal staffing would necessitate large sums and efforts by city.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Board of Education of the City of New York cannot constitutionally invoke the sanctions of the courts against Negro parents and against Puerto Rican parents who refuse to send their children to two schools in which there are no white children and in which half of the teachers are not regularly licensed teachers but are substitute teachers with relatively inferior qualifications and educational attainments.  There is no evidence in this case that the racial segregation in these schools is caused by any circumstances other than residential segregation in the city which is not attributable to any governmental action.  Nevertheless, children are entitled to equal educational opportunities, and they and their parents are entitled to the &quot;equal protection of the laws&quot; (U. S. Const., 14th Amdt.), even&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  if the establishment of such equal opportunities would require large expenditures of money and effort by the city.  In view of this provision of the Constitution, the parents need not obtain for their children the &quot;required instruction elsewhere&quot; (Education Law, &sect; 3212, subd. 2, par. d), although the parents in this case have in fact arranged for some private tutoring; nor can the parents be relegated to proceeding before the State Commissioner of Education (Education Law, &sect; 310).  The court will not adjudge that the children are &quot;neglected&quot; or are &quot;unlawfully kept out of school&quot;, and the court will not sanction proceedings which might result in imprisonment of the parents therefor (N. Y. City Dom. Rel. Ct. Act, &sect; 2, subd. [17]; &sect; 61, subd. 1; &sect; 83).  These two proceedings by the Board of Education are dismissed.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff taxpayers brought a lawsuit against defendant school board seeking a declaratory judgment and an injunction prohibiting the display of a nativity scene on school property during the school's Christmas vacation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayers filed a lawsuit against the board to prevent the erection of a nativity scene on school grounds by a multi-denominational religious group. The taxpayers sought a permanent injunction and declaratory judgment. On hearing, the court dismissed the taxpayers' complaint, with costs, and found that only one taxpayer, the only one whose child actually attended the school at issue, had standing to maintain the action against the board. As to the one legitimate claimant, the court found no danger of irreparable injury, no evidence of public financing, and no evidence of increased cost to the school or to any taxpayer. The court held that the board's actions in allowing the religious symbols were a mere accommodation, not unlike accommodations made for other religious and non-religious groups, and that those actions were not unconstitutional under the First Amendment. The court found that religious symbols are inescapable during the Christmas season and that no greater religious influence was imposed upon students by the display during the school vacation on public property than that imposed by the religious symbols displayed on private property at that time of year.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court dismissed the taxpayers' lawsuit, with costs, after considering the request for declaratory judgment and denied the injunctive relief for lack of any proof of permanent harm or damage. The court found that the board's approval of the display was a mere accommodation and not a constitutional violation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Schools -- Nativity Scene exhibit on lawn at Christmas -- action for declaratory judgment and injunction against school board's permitting private committee to erect and display Nativity Scene on school lawn during Christmas holidays, without involving school funds or personnel, is dismissed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. An action to restrain a school board from permitting a Nativity Scene to be erected and displayed on the lawn of the high school during the Christmas holidays, on the ground that such permission violates the State Constitution (art. I, &sect; 3) and the United States Constitution (First Amdt. and Fourteenth Amdt.), is maintainable only by a person who is not only a taxpayer of the school district but is also the parent of a child attending this particular high school at the time of the act complained of.  A general taxpayer's action (General Municipal Law, &sect; 51) is not maintainable against a board of education.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Only one of the plaintiffs in this suit is thus a proper plaintiff, and he has failed to show irreparable injury, hence the suit should be dismissed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Moreover, the Nativity Scene or Creche has been removed, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and no application for another display is pending before the school board; hence there is nothing to enjoin and the complaint should be dismissed for that reason.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. However, the court will consider the complaint on the merits insofar as it seeks a declaratory judgment, since the controversy appears to be renewed on Christmas after Christmas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. The evidence establishes that no public funds or time of public employees were expended, and that even the electricity was paid for by a private committee; and, furthermore, the display was on view during school holidays only, and no school instruction was given at any time as to the meaning of the display. The accommodation or permission granted by the school board to the private Creche committee did not violate constitutional provisions (N. Y. Const., art. I, &sect; 3; U. S. Const., First and Fourteenth Amdts.).  The complaint is dismissed.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner licensee filed a petition under N.Y. Civ. Prac.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the licensee pleaded guilty to operating a motor vehicle upon a public highway at a speed of in excess of 95 miles per hour, the Commissioner temporarily suspended the licensee's operator's license pending a hearing. The court dismissed the licensee's petition to set aside the Commissioner's order, holding that: (1) the temporary suspension was reviewable under N.Y. Civ. Prac. Act art. 78 because it was a final determination of the right of the licensee to operate his automobile during the period of the temporary suspension and N.Y. Veh. &amp; Traf. Law &sect; 71(6) provided that suspension was an administrative act reviewable by a New York supreme court; (2) &sect; 71(3)(e), which authorized the temporary suspension pending a hearing, was not unconstitutional because the licensee was not deprived of his license without due process of law where relief was available under N.Y. Civ. Prac. Act art. 78; and (3) the Commissioner's action was not arbitrary or capricious because the restriction of 26 days imposed upon the licensee was not unreasonable and the record contained ample evidence to justify temporary suspension pending the scheduled hearing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court dismissed the licensee's petition to set aside the Commissioner's order.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Motor vehicles -- temporary suspension of license -- order of temporary suspension is reviewable as final order -- authority of commissioner to suspend license pending hearing is constitutional as reasonable regulation of highways -- unreasonably long temporary suspension would be arbitrary but 26 days in this case was not unreasonable (Vehicle and Traffic Law, &sect; 71, subd. 3, par. [e]; subd. 6).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Petitioner was arrested for violation of the Vehicle and Traffic Law on August 27, 1958, and pleaded guilty. On November 14, 1958, he received a notice from respondent State Commissioner of Motor Vehicles that a hearing was scheduled for December 10, 1958, and that his license was suspended pending the hearing, according to the Vehicle and Traffic Law ( &sect; 71, subd. 3, par. [e]), which authorizes such temporary suspensions without notice pending a hearing for gross negligence. This temporary suspension may be reviewed both because of section 71 (subd. 6) under which revocation or suspension is deemed a reviewable administrative act and also because the determination is a final one of the rights of petitioner to operate&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  his automobile during the temporary period.  However, the suspension was amply justified in this case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The statute is constitutional, in authorizing suspension without notice pending a hearing, as a reasonable regulation of the highways. As the court will interpret the section to mean that a temporary suspension be for a reasonable time, the provision is not unconstitutional merely because it does not contain a specific time limit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. An unreasonably long temporary suspension may be attacked as arbitrary and capricious, but the 26-day period in this case was not unreasonable, and the petition to set aside the order is therefore dismissed.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner refining company brought a proceeding under N.Y. Civ. Prac. Act art. 78 for an order granting review of the determination of respondent village zoning board of appeals. The board denied the company's appeal from a decision of a village board denying it permission to erect a gasoline service station in the village.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The company brought an action challenging the board's decision that declined to review the village zoning board's denial of permission to build a service station in the village. The board responded that the company was not a person aggrieved, the board had no jurisdiction to hear the appeal, the appeal was not timely, and the decision by the village zoning board was proper. The court found the only issue was whether the board's determination was prejudiced, arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. The court found that the company had no permit to build the station. Thus, the company had no vested right to the station. The village zoning board's determination was entitled to a presumption of correctness, and the company did not overcome that presumption. The company was allowed two separate hearings to present all evidence necessary to support its allegations, and it failed to fulfill its burden of proof. Therefore, the decision of the board to refuse to review the decision of the village zoning board was proper.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Municipal corporations -- zoning -- even after commencement of proceeding (Civ. Prac. Act, art. 78) to review denial of permit for garage and filling station in zone in which such permit was required, village could validly amend zoning ordinance so as to exclude any garage or filling station in such zone; contract vendee has no rights superior to village's power to amend its zoning ordinance; review proceeding dismissed -- although no record of any village zoning commission or ordinance under 1923 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">statute</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> (Village Law, &sect; 179-a), zoning ordinance in 1953 and amendment in 1958 are presumed valid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. A contract vendee of real property in a zone in which the village's 1953 zoning ordinance permitted &quot;garages and filling stations, subject to such conditions and safeguards as deemed appropriate by the Board of Trustees&quot; of the village, applied for such a permit in 1958.  The Board of Trustees denied the application, and the village's Zoning Board of Appeals denied an appeal to it.  The property owner commenced a review proceeding (Civ. Prac. Act, art. 78); and, shortly thereafter, the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  village amended its zoning ordinance so as not to allow any garages or filling stations in such zones. The court must decide the review proceeding upon the law as amended.  Although a contract vendee may be &quot;a person aggrieved&quot; (Village Law, &sect; 179-b), this one has no lawful grievance, since the zoning ordinance was validly amended.  There were no vested rights here which were superior to the village's power to amend its zoning ordinance; nor was this applicant inequitably and prejudicially delayed by any official inaction.  The review proceeding is dismissed on the merits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.  Section 179-a of the Village Law (first added in 1923) required the board of trustees of a village to appoint a zoning commission to recommend the boundaries and uses of zones, before the village enacted any zoning ordinance. Petitioner, as a contract vendee of realty, avers that it searched the village records and found no record of any zoning ordinance enacted prior to 1923 and no record of any zoning commission, and that the first zoning ordinance and map was enacted by the village in 1953 and was therefore void.  However, said 1953 zoning ordinance was enacted after a public hearing, and it expressly and&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  validly repealed all former zoning ordinances. The zoning ordinance of 1953, and its 1958 amendment, are presumed valid, despite the failure to find any record of a zoning commission or of an earlier ordinance. </SPAN></P>

The court determined that Chapters 806-809 were to be read together and that the permission granted to the construct the bridge, which was the State's concern, was separate from the decision regarding the location of the expressway that was planned to join the bridge, which was a local matter for the City to determine under the provisions of N.Y.

Rather, the right to absolute preference for veterans, which was provided under a 1948 version of the constitution, was constitutionally withdrawn by a later 1950 amendment.

[b]), or by not applying for discharge, or by accepting promotions in military service; he was rightly given additional points and put No. 1 on general promotion list, but was not legally entitled to promotion as against No. 6; his application for order (Civ. Prac. Act, art. 78) is denied.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The New York State Constitution (art. V, &sect; 6) provides that appointments and promotions in civil service shall be made pursuant to competitive examinations as far as practicable.  This was amended in 1945 (eff. Jan. 1, 1946) to provide, however, that disabled, honorably discharged veterans &quot;shall be appointed or promoted before any other appointments or promotions are made, without regard to his or her standing on&quot; the eligible list. This proviso was changed on January 1, 1950 to provide that, after January 1, 1951, honorably discharged veterans should receive certain additional points on&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  examinations, and that eligible lists in existence on January 1, 1951 should be revised by adding such points to veterans' grades on such lists.  The Civil Service Law ( &sect; 14) provides that appointments shall be made &quot;from among those graded highest in * * * examinations&quot;; and this provision has been validly concretized by the Rules of the New York City Civil Service Commission (rule V, &sect;&sect; VII, VIII) to provide that an appointment shall be made from among the three eligibles who are highest after any prior eligibles on the list have declined appointment. An assistant court clerk in the New York City Municipal Court, who was also a member of the New York National Guard, was in active military service from October 1940 to October 1941, and then from 1942 to 1955 during which time he was promoted to Major.  He was honorably discharged as a disabled veteran on August 31, 1955, and was restored the next day to his position as a deputy clerk. Meantime, two promotion examinations for positions of clerks of district courts of the New York City Municipal Court had been held and eligible lists established in 1948 and 1953.  This returned veteran was given a comparable examination (Military&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Law, &sect; 243, subd. 5), on which he earned 76.25 points.  With 5 additional points by reason of being a disabled veteran (N. Y. Const., art. V, &sect; 6, as amd. eff. Jan. 1, 1950) he was thus given 81.25 points, and with this mark he was placed highest on the 1953 list.  In 1957 a vacancy occurred in the position of clerk of one of the Manhattan district courts of the Municipal Court.  All of the 7 persons on this 1953 eligible list declined appointment, except this veteran and the person who stood sixth on the list.  The appointing Justices of the Municipal Court validly appointed eligible No. 6 to the position.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The constitutional amendment in 1950 (N. Y. Const., art. V, &sect; 6) validly and constitutionally revoked the absolute preference which had been given to disabled veterans by the constitutional amendment of said section in 1945, and instead thereof it gave to veterans certain additional points on examinations, and provided that eligible lists in existence on January 1, 1951 should be revised by adding such points to the grades of veterans on such lists.  Thus, the City Civil Service Commission no longer had power to grade this returned veteran as having an &quot;absolute preference&quot; &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  for appointment on a special promotion list bearing this veteran's name only, which it established in 1956 as of 1948 as a result of his attaining a mark of 76.25 on an examination comparable to that given in 1948 (Military Law, &sect; 243, subd. 5).  The Military Law provision gave him no vested rights as against a subsequent constitutional amendment. His grade of &quot;absolute preference&quot; on this list is void.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Before making this promotion, the appointing Justices of the Municipal Court canvassed all the eligibles on the list and personally interviewed them.  The budgetary requisition was dated February 15, 1957, and the 1953 list was certified by the City Civil Service Commission to the Justices on February 18, and the Justices' appointment of eligible No. 6 was dated February 15.  Said civil service commission has specified that promotions may be dated as of the date of the budget certification. Moreover, the &quot;notice of appointment and disposition of certification&quot; was dated March 1, 1957.  The appointment was not made prematurely.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. As a result of the comparable examination, the City Civil Service Commission also established a special promotion list as of 1953, on which this veteran&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  was the sole eligible, and on which the commission gave him a grade of 76.25+5=81.25.  But, since this list had less than 3 names, the appointing authority had the power to disregard it and to use the regular 1953 list, which bore 7 names.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Although the Military Law ( &sect; 243, subd. 5) mentions &quot;special&quot; lists, the Legislature did not intend to deny to veterans the privileges of regular lists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. Although only 2 names remained on this regular eligible list after 5 eligibles declined, the appointing authority still had the power to make an appointment from this list.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. This returned veteran was restored to his position of deputy clerk on September 1, 1955, and he filed an application on October 31, 1955 to take a &quot;comparable&quot; promotion examination (Military Law, &sect; 243, subd. 5).  This was the 60th day and was timely (General Construction Law, &sect; 20).  His request was granted by the official authorities having jurisdiction, and such grant is presumed to be regular.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. This veteran's status as an honorably discharged, disabled veteran was shown by his official certification (Military Law, &sect; 243, subd. 17), and no evidence to the contrary was offered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. In this proceeding by this&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  veteran, under article 78 of the Civil Practice Act, the answer of eligible No. 6 alleges that he, too, is a disabled veteran. However, it does not appear that he requested the City Civil Service Commission to change his standing on the list in any way.  He was not certified as an eligible veteran.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">10. The Military Law ( &sect; 243, subd. 1, par. [b]) excepts from its privileges military service &quot;entered upon voluntarily&quot; on or after January 1, 1947 and before June 25, 1950.  This veteran was in military service from 1940 to 1941, and then again from 1942 to 1955.  He was a sergeant from January 1942 to August 1942, when he became a lieutenant in the United States Army Reserve, on active duty. World War II began in 1941 and, according to Presidential proclamations, did not officially terminate until 1952, and by that time the Korean conflict of 1950 was in progress, and during all that time a reserve officer had no right to a discharge (U. S. Code, tit. 10, &sect; 3492; 66 U. S. Stat. 330).  His appointment as a captain on October 9, 1945 extended his term as an officer until October 9, 1950.  He could have asked for a discharge from military service; but the above-quoted exception in&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the Military Law is as to service &quot;entered upon&quot; during certain dates, not as to service continued in during those dates.  His remaining in the military service for many years, and his promotions from the ranks to lieutenant and then to captain and then to major, did not subject him to the penalty of losing his civil service rights.  Those rights were reaffirmed by the appointing Justices of the Municipal Court (N. Y. City Mun. Ct. Code, &sect; 7-a, subd. 1) by their reinstatement of him in 1955 in his former position of deputy clerk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">11. It is alleged that, after this veteran was reinstated, he declined an offer of promotion to the position of clerk of one of the Bronx district courts of the Municipal Court.  Such declination did not affect his right to apply subsequently for appointment to such a clerkship in a Manhattan district of the court; indeed, such offer shows that the City Civil Service Commission and the appointing Justices recognized that he had been validly reinstated and was validly entitled to apply for promotion. They themselves decided the question of fact -- whether this veteran had impliedly resigned from civil service -- in his favor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">12.  This veteran's institution&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***9]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of this review proceeding under article 78 of the Civil Practice Act was the proper remedy; but he has not shown that he is entitled to the promotion as a matter of law or that eligible No. 6 was not legally promoted; hence this veteran's application is denied.  </SPAN></P>

The landlord contended that the tenant refused to accept and execute a new lease, that six months had elapsed subsequent to the offer of such lease, and that the landlord had given notice to the tenant to vacate the premises. The court granted a final order to the tenant dismissing the landlord's eviction action on grounds that the landlord's proffered lease was not substantially similar in terms and conditions as the existing lease or tenancy. The court held that the landlord was required to comply with the Business Rent Law by offering the tenant a lease on substantially the same terms and conditions, and the tenant was not obligated to state his reasons for rejecting the lease until the landlord complied with such statute. The new lease imposed a greater obligation on the tenant in that it should comply with all laws and orders at its sole expense.</SPAN></P>

The tenant refused to enter into such a lease, giving as his reason the desire for a long-term lease. After the expiration of six months, the landlord served a statutory 30-day notice to dispossess the tenant pursuant to subdivision gg of section 8 of the Business Rent Law, which authorizes eviction under these circumstances&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  if the proffered (and rejected) lease was on substantially similar terms and conditions as the existing tenancy. As the tenant was under no obligation to state his grounds for rejecting the proffered lease and as he cannot waive the provisions of the Business Rent Law, the ground given by him for rejecting the lease does not limit him to that ground, and the landlord is not entitled to evict if, in fact, the terms of the proffered lease were not substantially similar to those of the existing tenancy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The landlord must show as part of his prima facie case that the proffered lease was substantially similar to the former lease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. As the new lease contained a number of terms and conditions which enlarged upon the obligations of the tenant and put a greater onus upon him than did the terms of the prior lease, substantial differences do exist.  Accordingly, the petition to dispossess the tenant is dismissed.  </SPAN></P>

The landlord filed an application for his tenant's four-room apartment, asserting that his daughter was pregnant, that the mother wanted to be near the daughter to take care of her, that the premises did not contain a janitor, and that the son-in-law and daughter both worked and could not properly care for the property. The Administrator denied the landlord's application for failure to establish an immediate and compelling necessity. On appeal, the court held that the Administrator's determination was supported by the record and was not arbitrary or capricious. The court rejected the argument that &sect; 55 of the State Rent and Eviction Regulations was unconstitutional by distinguishing multiple family housing from one or two-family homes.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The secretary rejected numerous signatures on the voters' petitions for various reasons including that the voter signed an abbreviated version of his name and that the subscribing witness witnesses' notarized statement had been altered. The court reversed the secretary's determination. Although the court concluded that in some instances the secretary had been correct in invalidating certain signatures, when the total number of invalidated signatures was calculated, the petitions contained enough valid signatures to be deemed legally acceptable. The court concluded that an abbreviated signature was permissible under N.Y. Elec. Law &sect; 138-a. The court determined that the change of address shown by deleting the typed address and inserting a writing address and the deletion of a numeral designation for the month followed by the insertion of the month spelled out alphabetically were not material alterations and were not fatal to the validity of the petitions.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Petitions for independent State-wide nominations require the signatures of at least 12,000 voters, of whom at least 50 must reside in each county of the State ( Election Law, &sect; 138, subd. 5, par. [a]).  The signatures must be acknowledged before a notary, or must be authenticated by a &quot;Statement of Witness&quot; in the form set forth in the Election Law ( &sect; 138, subd. 3) with the blanks in such witness' statement&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  properly filled in.  Such a &quot;Statement&quot;, reading that the witness resides at 98 Attorney St., in the City and County of New York in New York State, and &quot;was last registered for the general election in the year 1957 from same [a line is drawn through the word &quot;same&quot;] 98 Attorney St. in the City of N. Y. in the county of New York in such state&quot; is valid.  The striking out of &quot;same&quot; and substituting therefor its obvious meaning &quot;98 Attorney St.&quot; was not a material alteration, and no fraud was proved.  Similarly, in another witness' &quot;Statement&quot;, an alteration consisting of striking &quot;N. Y.&quot; and substituting therefor &quot;New York&quot; is not material, and this &quot;Statement&quot;, too, is valid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Another witness resided at all times in the 4th Assembly District in New York City at one address, but in 1956 that address was changed from the 55th Election District in said Assembly District to the 52d Election District in said Assembly District, effective about October 1, 1957.  This witness' &quot;Statement of Witness&quot; erroneously gave her election district as the 55th; but this error was not prejudicial, and her &quot;Statement&quot; is valid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. However, another &quot;Statement of Witness&quot;, in which the number of signatures&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  thereby authenticated was stated to be &quot;6&quot; and in which this figure was then struck out and the figure &quot;10&quot; substituted, is materially altered and entirely invalid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Similarly entirely invalid is another &quot;Statement of Witness&quot; to authenticate &quot;6&quot; signatures, where &quot;6&quot; was struck out and &quot;5&quot; was inserted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. A signature on an independent nominating petition may be abbreviated ( Election Law, &sect; 138-a).  Accordingly, on this independent nominating petition, the signature &quot;Bert Funk&quot; for the registered name Bertram Funk is valid, as is the signature &quot;G. R. Smith&quot; for the registered name Gordon G. R. Smith, as is the signature &quot;Rose Amlin&quot; for Rosetta Amlin, and as is the signature &quot;Ted Pierce&quot; for Theodore Pierce.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. Signatures where the county of the address is written as &quot;Schoharie&quot; above the abbreviation &quot;Scho&quot; are valid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. Subdivision 6 of section 138 of the Election Law, providing that &quot;The name of a person signing such a petition for an election for which voters are required to be registered shall not be counted if such person was not registered at the time of the last preceding general election as a qualified voter&quot;, is constitutional and valid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. In rural election districts, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  personal registration is not required, and the voter is not required to appear prior to election day ( Election Law, &sect;&sect; 157, 166-a).  In such districts, the name of the voter is copied from year to year by the inspectors of election, because the voter voted at the previous election or because the inspectors know that he still resides within that election district. The books of registration in districts in Schoharie County in this case showed that in many instances no address was inserted and in some instances ditto marks were used to designate the address; and it is apparent that the voter himself did not furnish the address as reported by the inspectors of election. The only time when a voter in such a district is required to sign his name is at the time of voting, and the only use of such signature is for a primary election ( Election Law, &sect; 198).  Accordingly, on this independent nominating petition, signatures with incomplete addresses are valid, where such addresses are addresses used by persons residing within such election district and where the signers are found to have been registered and where there is nothing to show that these signers had any knowledge of the addresses&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  contained in the registration book, or where the registration book contains no addresses for these names.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. Accordingly, the Secretary of State erred in rejecting this independent nominating petition, and he is directed to accept it.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner signers of a certain petition filed an application to compel submission to the electorate of a local law for the creation of a commission to draft a new charter. Respondent city clerk opposed the submission based on a rule that the petition could not be submitted in an even-numbered year and that the proposed local law was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The proposed local law was to permit political city committees to appoint 9 out of 11 members of the charter commission. The court held that N.Y. Const. art. IX, &sect; 15 regarding the election of city officers in odd-numbered years was clear and that only by extending its meaning could referenda in even-numbered years be prohibited. The court found that the appointing body would be as observant of the requirements of N.Y. Pub. Off. Law as would the mayor or city council. The court dismissed the petition, ruling that unless it was shown that a city committee was actually provided for by party rules and that there was some regulation over its management, the power of appointment of the commission members was subject to no regulation at all. The court noted that an enactment of legislation that made for such a situation was not within the framework of the New York Constitution. On appeal, the court concluded that the signers had supplied the allegation and proof of the existence of city committees. The court indicated that the objections urged as to the validity of the local law could be raised when and if the law were adopted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted the signers' petition to compel submission to the electorate of the local law.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Elections -- referenda -- referendum of municipal question involving creation of commission to draft new charter may be had in even-numbered year -- proposed law permitting appointment of some members of proposed charter commission by city committees not invalid when provision for such committees and their management by party rules is shown -- objections regarding validity of proposed law can be raised when and if law is adopted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. A local law for creation of a commission to draft a new charter was initiated by petition under subdivision 2 of section 20 of the City Home Rule Law. Section 15 of article IX of the New York Constitution requires election of all city officers in odd-numbered years.  It is no objection that this referendum is sought in an even-numbered year.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The proposed law would permit city committees to appoint some of the members of the proposed commission.  Since section 10 of the Election Law affords no status to political city committees in the absence of rules of the party and since section 15 of the Election Law deprives such committees&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of power to adopt their own rules for management, the proposed law would be invalid as not within the framework of the constitution unless the city committees are actually provided for by party rules and there is some regulation over their management.  However, as petitioners have supplied the allegations and proof of the existence of city committees, this petition to compel submission to the electorate will be granted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Objections as to the validity of the local law can be raised when and if the law is adopted.  </SPAN></P>

N.Y. Ins. Law &sect; 250(1) (1957) provided that medical expense indemnity consisted of reimbursement for medical care provided through duly licensed physicians, dental care provided through duly licensed dentists, podiatrical care provided through duly licensed podiatrists, nursing service, and of furnishing necessary appliances, drugs, medicines, and supplies. It also consisted of reimbursement for bio-analytical or clinical laboratory examinations and reports thereof reported to a physician, osteopath, dentist, or podiatrist made by any privately operated bio-analytical or clinical laboratory.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The City of New York instituted an action under New York City, N.Y., Admin. Code ch. 32, tit. B. art. 28, seeking to permanently restrain a corporation from advertising in a manner suggesting that it would close down upon disposing of its stock. The court granted the city's application and restrained the corporation in the desired manner. The court found that ch. 32, tit. B. art. 28 was constitutional in that it represented a lawful exercise of police power. Statutory laws that regulated business to protect the public welfare and penalized refusals to comply thereto were constitutional. In its decision, the court noted that the corporation's advertisements were deceptive in the sense that they tended to cause the public to draw false conclusions.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A corporation which conducted a men's retail haberdashery was granted a license to conduct for 30 days a so-called &quot;forced-out-of-business sale&quot; (Administrative Code of City of New York, &sect; B32-205.0).

The corporation's review proceeding (Civ. Prac. Act, art. 78) and its action for a judgment declaring the law unconstitutional were dismissed.  Nevertheless it persisted in advertising and placarding a &quot;forced-out-of-business&quot; or &quot;close-out&quot; or &quot;final&quot; or &quot;loss of lease&quot; sale.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant demurred to an indictment charging him and four others with one count of obscene prints and articles, pursuant to N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 1141, and one count of conspiracy, pursuant to N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 850. The indictment was drafted pursuant to N.Y. Code of Crim. Proc. &sect;&sect; 295-a to 295-l (1929 N.Y. Laws 176), which governed simplified forms of indictment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant and others were charged with one count of obscene prints and articles, pursuant to N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 1141, and one count of conspiracy, pursuant to N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 850. Defendant demurred to the simplified indictment, and the court allowed the demurrer, holding that the indictment could not be sustained under N.Y. Code of Crim. Proc. &sect; 275 because defendant was neither advised of the nature of the charges against him nor of the facts which might have been proved at trial, and the indictment failed to recite the time, date, or place of the commission of the crimes charged. The court found that N.Y. Code of Crim. Proc. &sect;&sect; 295-a to 295-l intended that after an indictment, the People would supply by a bill of particulars the information required in long-form indictments by N.Y. Code of Crim. Proc. &sect; 275, but that even if defendant had demanded such a bill, it could not have met the requirements of procedural due process because there was no certainty that the crime described in the indictment was the same crime for which the grand jury indicted defendant. The court concluded, however, that the objections on which the demurrer was allowed could be avoided on a new indictment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court allowed defendant's demurrer to the indictment in all respects and found that the objections on which the demurrer was allowed could be avoided on a new indictment. The court directed the district attorney to resubmit to the same or another grand jury.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- simplified indictment -- demurrer allowed to simplified indictment for obscenity and conspiracy; District Attorney is directed to resubmit matter to Grand Jury ( Penal Law, &sect;&sect; 1141, 580; Code Crim. Pro., &sect;&sect; 295-a to 295-1, 323, 327; N. Y. Const., art. I, &sect; 6) -- if criminal </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">statute</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> may be violated in several ways, and evidence before Grand Jury supports more than one way, simplified indictment cannot be used constitutionally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. A demurrer is allowed to the following simplified form of indictment (Code Crim. Pro., &sect;&sect; 295-a to 295-1), and the District Attorney is directed to resubmit the matter to the same Grand Jury or to another Grand Jury (Code Crim. Pro., &sect;&sect; 323, 327): &quot;First Count.  The Grand Jury * * * accuse the defendants, each aiding and abetting the other, of the crime of obscene prints and articles, contrary to Penal Law section 1141.  Second Count.  The Grand Jury * * * accuse the defendants of the crime of conspiracy, contrary to Penal Law section 580.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The statute authorizing simplified indictments (Code Crim. Pro., &sect;&sect; 295-a to 295-1) requires the People to furnish a bill of particulars as to dates, times and places of commission of crimes, and as&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to the nature of defendant's violation of the provisions of criminal statute, and as to the facts which constitute such a violation or violations.  But only a Grand Jury can indict (N. Y. Const., art. I, &sect; 6); and a Grand Jury's indictment must fulfill the constitutional requirements of due process, by sufficiently informing the defendant of the nature of the charge against him so as to enable him to prepare his defense and to protect him adequately against possible double jeopardy. A District Attorney cannot indict by drawing a bill of particulars; that is, a defendant cannot constitutionally be subjected, by means of a District Attorney's bill of particulars, to danger of trial on a charge on which he was not indicted. A simplified indictment is constitutional in a situation where the court can be certain that a bill of particulars of the indictment will describe the same crime as charged in the indictment. Where a statute defines a crime which may be charged in several different ways, and the evidence presented before the Grand Jury can support more than one of the charges, the simplified form should not be used.  When a simplified indictment is used in such a situation, the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  trial court finds it difficult to charge the trial jury intelligently, and the same difficulty confronts the District Attorney in his summation to the jury, and the constitutional question can be raised during the trial and will then survive a judgment of conviction and will be ground for an appeal; so, in the interest of finality of judgment, the simplified form of indictment should not be used in such a situation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. In this case, on the argument of the demurrer, sufficient facts were presented to convince the court that, even if the court were to direct the District Attorney to furnish the court with the Grand Jury minutes and with the District Attorney's proposed bill of particulars, still the court would be unable to determine (1) whether the Grand Jury indicted the defendants (under Penal Law, &sect; 1141) (a) for distribution or for possession with intent to sell or for mere possession, and (b) whether, of the many articles introduced in evidence, the Grand Jury deemed books or magazines or newspapers or photographs or motion pictures or recordings or paintings to be obscene, and (2) whether the Grand Jury indicted the defendants (under Penal Law, &sect; 580) (a) for conspiracy to&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  commit the substantive crimes of publishing, or printing, or selling, or possessing ( Penal Law, &sect; 580, subd. 1) or (b) for conspiracy to commit an act injurious to public morals ( Penal Law, &sect; 580, subd. 6).  Therefore, demurrer is allowed.  </SPAN></P>

The Sanitary Code provisions, that the dating requirements &quot;shall not apply to one-third quart or one-half pint containers or bottles when such containers or bottles are dispensed through mechanically operated dispensing machines&quot; (&sect; 156, reg. 155, subd. 8), do not unconstitutionally discriminate against stores and in favor of automatic&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  vending machines. The legislative body was rationally impressed with the continuous refrigeration provided by the automatic vending machines; and at the same time the legislative body rationally saw fit to limit the machines' advantage to small sizes, since larger quantities in the hands of a consumer would be likely to deteriorate during the longer period of consumption.  </SPAN></P>

The officers filed a motion to dismiss. The court dismissed the complaint. The court held that the owners were not permitted to maintain the action when their objection to it necessarily was that it could affect someone else. The owners owned trailer camps within the state, but neither of them demonstrated any financial interest in any property within the town. The court found that plaintiffs had no standing to attack the constitutionality of the statute because they did not prove that they sustained or were even threatened with any damage or loss by reason of it.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, three sand and gravel companies, motioned for summary judgment on their counterclaims and for judgment dismissing the complaint of plaintiff Town of North Hempstead (town), which had instituted an action against defendants who had been engaged in mining sand and gravel within the unincorporated area of the town.

Town of Hempstead, N.Y., Ordinance Relating to Sand Bank and Pit, Topsoil Removal and Other Excavations (Jan. 8, 1946). Upon review, the court held that as a regulatory measure the town's license fee was restricted to an amount which would have compensated for having issued and having recorded the license and for having paid for inspection to see to the enforcing of the license provisions. Thus, as defendants appeared to be the only operators in the unincorporated area of the town, the town ordinance's levy of a charge of one cent on every cubic yard of sand or gravel removed was arbitrary, unreasonable, exorbitant and invalid. The court held that judgment on defendants' counterclaim was limited to the declaration that only that section that levied such charges was invalid and unenforceable as to defendants because the fee fixed therein was grossly excessive. The remainder of the ordinance was unaffected and was binding upon defendants.</SPAN></P>

Prac.), and plaintiff has not moved for summary judgment, court grants summary judgment on defendants' counterclaim to extent of invalidating license fee, and awards to town summary judgment enjoining defendants from excavating without license.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Under the Town Law ( &sect; 130, subd. 23; cf.  Village Law, &sect; 89, subd. 67) the Town of North Hempstead in Nassau County validly enacted the following ordinance: &sect; 1. &quot;It is hereby declared to be the policy of the Town * * * to prevent * * * excavations which create pits, holes or hollows in the earth, leaving it in a hazardous or dangerous state, or cause soil erosion which depletes the land of its natural vegetative cover&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and supply of organic material, renders such land unproductive and unsuitable for agricultural purposes and undesirable for building homes, resulting in lower land values * * * danger of health and life * * * damage to agricultural crops through dust storms * * * wind action, and * * * pools of water, which ordinance will promote the safety, health and general welfare of the people of the Town.&quot; &sect; 2.  &quot;No excavation for purposes other than the construction of a wall, driveway, sidewalk, building or part thereof * * * shall be commenced except in conformity with the provisions of this article.&quot; &sect; 3. &quot;Before any excavation be commenced * * * the owner, lessee or agent of the premises shall obtain a written permit therefor from the Town Board.&quot; &sect; 4. &quot;No such excavation shall be made: (a) Within Twenty (20) feet of any property line and must not be greater than 10 feet below the established grade, unless the sidewalls remain at an incline of at least 45 degrees or are supported by retaining equipment equal to that spcified for building excavations, except in the case of bank excavations same may begin at the property line.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The town is granted summary judgment enjoining the three&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  corporate defendants, who appear to be the only sand and gravel mining operators in the unincorporated area of the town, from continuing their operations unless they obtain a permit from the Town Board.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. But section 7 of the ordinance, which imposes a license fee of &quot;$ 200 for an excavation volume not to exceed 20,000 cu. yds. * * * plus one cent for each additional cu. yd.&quot;, is exorbitant and invalid. The affidavits and the pretrial examination of the town supervisor show that the license fee was intended, not as a tax, but as compensation for the town's expense of inspections and administration.  The town estimates such expense at $ 6,100 a year; the defendants estimate it at $ 1,500 a year.  At one cent a cubic yard on defendants' average yearly operations, the license fees would amount to about $ 34,000.  As a regulatory measure, a license fee must be limited to an amount which will compensate for issuing, inspecting and enforcing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. However, the invalid section can be excised without affecting the valid sections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. It is immaterial that the defendants have been operating in this town for years before the enactment of the ordinance and assertedly have made no excavations&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  which violate section 4 of the ordinance. They must get a permit for any further excavations, including bank excavations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. Likewise immaterial is the fact that the town's Board of Appeals, after the enactment of this ordinance, granted to defendants' predecessor a variance for the mining of sand and gravel on certain premises for 15 years.  The ordinance in suit is not a zoning ordinance (under Town Law, &sect; 261) but a regulatory ordinance (under &sect; 130, subd. 23).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. On defendants' motion for summary judgment under rule 113 of the Rules of Civil Practice the court may and does grant summary judgment to plaintiff even without a cross motion therefor.  Although an action for an injunction is not one of those actions enumerated in rule 113, such procedure in this instance is allowable.  The town is granted summary judgment of injunction, and the defendants are granted summary judgment on their counterclaim, declaring the invalidity of section 7.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, who was convicted of manslaughter on the first degree, applied for an order directing the delivery to him of a copy of the stenographic minutes of his trial without cost for use in his appeal. The appeals court had granted defendant leave to appeal as a poor person.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant had been granted leave to appeal his manslaughter conviction as a poor person, and he sought a free transcript of his proceedings. The transcript had also been filed in the office of the county clerk. Defendant's attorney had not been paid and had expended substantial out-of-pocket sums, and obtaining the recorded transcript would impose an additional burden because the county clerk was 40 miles away. The court held that it had the discretionary authority to order that a transcript be provided to indigent defendants at public expense. However, the court held that such power was only to be exercised where there was satisfactory proof that defendant was completely without funds, that defendant's attorney had not been and would not be compensated in any way for the services that he rendered, and that the appeals court had granted leave to defendant to appeal as a poor person.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- right to minutes of trial without cost -- defendant, who was convicted of manslaughter in first degree and has been granted leave to appeal to Appellate Division as poor person, is entitled to receive copy of stenographic minutes without cost -- original minutes were filed and right of defendant to appeal has not been defeated but, unless minutes are furnished free of cost, defendant would be unable to make effective use of right to appeal -- court has inherent power to grant relief -- power should be exercised where defendant is without funds, his attorney will not be compensated, Appellate Division has granted leave to appeal as poor person, and substantial questions are involved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Defendant was convicted of manslaughter in the first degree and is now serving an indeterminate term in prison. From the conviction and sentence he has been granted leave to appeal by the Appellate Division as a poor person. His present attorney has received no compensation and is regarded as if he were an assigned counsel. A motion by defendant for an order directing the delivery to him of a copy of the stenographic&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  minutes of the trial without cost is granted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The original minutes of the trial had been filed in the County Clerk's office, and the right of defendant to appeal has not been defeated by the failure to file the record.  Accordingly, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Griffin </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">v.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11"> Illinois</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (351 U.S. 12) and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">People </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">v.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11"> Pride</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (3 N Y 2d 545) do not require the granting of the requested relief.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. On the other hand, unless defendant is furnished the minutes free, defendant will be unable to make effective use of the right to appeal. Defendant has no funds and is at present in prison and unable personally to inspect the minutes. It would be a great hardship on his attorney to undertake the task of making copies of the minutes. The court has inherent power to grant the relief sought in a proper case as an incident to the duty of the court to provide defendant in a criminal case with effective means to obtain ultimate justice.  The provisions in section 308 of the Code of Criminal Procedure making the exercise of this power mandatory in a first degree murder case do not deprive the courts of their inherent powers in other cases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The exercise of this power should be limited to a case where there is proof&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  that defendant is without funds, that defendant's attorney was not, has not been and will not be compensated for the services which he has rendered, and that the Appellate Division shall have granted leave to defendant to appeal as a poor person. It should also appear that there are substantial questions involved in the appeal, and that the record cannot be made available to defendant except at public expense. The present application meets that test.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff landowners brought a declaratory judgment against defendants, a village and other interested parties, seeking to declare the village's zoning unconstitutional to the extent that it zoned the landowners' property residential.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowners' had historically used their property at the intersection of two roads as a hotel and a gasoline station. However, the village, over the objections of the landowners, zoned their property as residential. Property near that owned by the landowners was both residential and commercial. The landowners claimed that their property could not be used as an apartment house and that the residential zoning decreased the value of their property by over 90 percent. The court dismissed the landowners' complaint. It held that zoning regulations were permitted to decrease the value of property. The court ruled that the landowners were factually wrong when they claimed that they could not construct an apartment building under the residential zoning because the setback that governed the landowners' parcel did enable the landowners to construct an apartment. Thus, the landowners had failed to establish by a fair preponderance of the credible evidence that the zoning determination of the village was arbitrary, capricious or unreasonable.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Plaintiffs failed to demonstrate by credible evidence that their land could not reasonably and profitably be used in conformity with a village zoning ordinance placing their property in a &quot;Residence C&quot; district, and in plaintiffs' action for a judgment declaring the statute unconstitutional and void insofar as it restricted their property to the uses allowed in such a district, the complaint was dismissed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Zoning is a legislative function and a zoning ordinance or an amendment thereto is presumed to be valid.  The burden of proving the invalidity of a zoning ordinance or an amendment thereto is upon the party who assails its validity, and that party must show by a fair preponderance of the credible evidence that the zoning determination of the legislative body was arbitrary, capricious or unreasonable.  If the validity of the legislative classification&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  for zoning purposes is fairly debatable, the judgment of the legislative body is conclusive and beyond interference by the courts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. A municipality is not required to zone property so as to produce the highest return for the owner.  Evidence that property zoned for residential use would be worth a great deal more if zoned for business did not establish the unreasonableness of the zoning ordinance. All zoning regulations may depreciate property values. </SPAN></P>

The court found that the property owner failed to allege facts showing that the property could not be reasonably used for residential purposes or that the property could not be successfully sold as residential property.

The court determined that there was insufficient proof to establish that defendants knew that the magazine was obscene.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff tow car operators filed an action against defendant town to have a town ordinance governing the operation of tow cars declared unconstitutional and void and for an injunction to prohibit enforcement of the ordinance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The tow car operators argued that an ordinance that prevented them from going to the scene of an accident to solicit business was unconstitutional. The court disagreed. The court held that the ordinance did not prohibit the use of public streets to tow cars nor did it prohibit all solicitation of towing work. It prohibited unregulated solicitation that interfered with the free choice by the damaged car owner to properly protect himself from tow car operators racing to the scene of an accident to solicit business and the resultant interference traffic and police investigations. The court rejected the tow car operators' claim of unconstitutionality to portions of the ordinance that did not affect them. They were not aggrieved. The provision prohibiting transfer of the tow car operators' licenses was constitutional because the city had the right to know and to determine who the licensees would be. Provisions requiring disclosure of convictions were valid because a mechanism for due process was included in the ordinance. The tow car operators' attacks on other provisions of the ordinance were likewise rejected. The court held that the ordinance was valid and constitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that the tow car operators failed to sustain their burden of proof to show that a town ordinance governing tow car operators was unconstitutional and invalid. The court sustained the ordinance as reasonable and constitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Motor vehicles -- constitutionality of ordinance licensing and regulating tow-car business -- town ordinance requiring tow-car operators to apply for licenses and to report summonses, arrests and convictions, and to file schedule of fees, and prohibiting them from refusing request to tow at those fees, and forbidding them to solicit business at scene of accident, or to make immediate agreement for repair of vehicle of hospitalized owner, or to remove vehicle unless so authorized on prescribed form by owner or person in charge, or to remove vehicle in which death or injury occurred unless police authorize removal, and prohibiting transfers of licenses and requiring surrender of license if tow car is disposed of, all constitutional.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. An ordinance is presumed to be supported by facts known to the legislative body, as is any legislation.  The legislation must be reasonably related to some reasonably apprehended evil, but any unconstitutionality must be demonstrated beyond a reasonable doubt, and a court will strike down a legislative enactment only as a last resort.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Plaintiffs are licensed tow-car owners and operators in the Town of Hempstead, Nassau County.  On the average&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  in Hempstead, five or six competing tow cars arrive at the scene of an accident, each with a crew of two or three men.  Sometimes 15 operators mill around the scene and try to solicit the dazed or emotionally upset motorist who has just suffered an accident.  They interfere with the policeman who is trying to gather the evidence at the scene. They often race to the scene and violate speed laws, and often interfere with traffic at the scene. Plaintiffs concede that legislative regulation is needed.  The town has enacted Ordinance No. 40, which declares the background facts (&sect; 1.0) and which validly and reasonably provides as follows: (&sect; 12.0) &quot;It shall be unlawful for any person to drive along any street or bridge in the Town of Hempstead and solicit towing work.  Solicitation of towing work by the operator or other occupant of a tow car while parked on any street or bridge is also prohibited.  A tow car operator shall not proceed to the scene of a disabled motor vehicle without having been requested or notified to do so by the owner or his authorized representative or the Police.  Responding to a call, merely upon notification from gas station attendants, taxicab drivers or other&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  unauthorized persons shall be considered in violation of this provision&quot;; and (&sect; 12.1) &quot;The owner or driver of any disabled motor vehicle shall have the right to require the services of any available tow car and it shall be unlawful for any owner or driver, or helper of any tow car to refuse to render such services if such owner or driver of such disabled motor vehicle is able and willing to pay the fee prescribed in the schedule of prices filed by the owner of such tow car with the Town Clerk provided, however, that it is physically possible for such tow car to tow such disabled motor vehicle and that such tow car is not already going to or returning from a job.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Of course, ordinances of the town do not apply to the incorporated villages or to the cities; but that does not render this ordinance discriminatory and unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The fact that a better ordinance could have been drafted does not render the one enacted unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Similar ordinances in cities of Texas and Tennessee have been held constitutional by the highest courts of those States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. The licensing requirements of the ordinance (&sect;&sect; 3.2, 3.5, 3.6, 3.8, 3.9, 4.2, 4.4, 5.0) and the provisions for&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  suspension or revocation (&sect;&sect; 9.0, 9.1) and the requirement that summonses and arrests be reported to the town clerk (&sect; 11.2) are reasonable, constitutional, and authorized by the Town Law ( &sect; 137), which empowers a town clerk to refuse to issue a license to a person who has been convicted of felony or misdemeanor or whom he deems undesirable or incapable to carry on the licensed business, and provides for a hearing and review of such refusal by the town board and then for review by the court by a proceeding under article 78 of the Civil Practice Act.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. The ordinance (&sect; 3.13), like the Town Law ( &sect; 137), validly makes a license nontransferable.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants sought review of judgments of the Manhattan District Magistrates' Courts of the City of New York (New York), which convicted them of acting as sightseeing guides without being licensed as such by the commissioner of licenses of the City of New York.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were Pennsylvania residents who worked for a Pennsylvania tour company. During a trip that started and ended in Pennsylvania, defendants conducted a tour in New York City without a license. Defendants were convicted of acting as sightseeing guides without being licensed by the City, and the court reversed their convictions. The court held that New York City, N.Y., Admin. Code art. 12, ch. 32, &sect;&sect; B32-75.0, -76.0, -77.0, did not constitute an undue burden on interstate commerce because the interstate character of the tour was interrupted by the purely local side trip. The court found that the local regulation was not preempted by federal legislation. The court held that the licensing of sightseeing guides fell within the police powers of the local government. The court concluded that the City had the power to license the guides and to prescribe reasonable standards and qualifications as prerequisites to the granting of the licenses. The court held that the two-year residence requirement of &sect; B32-77.0 was invalid because it discriminated against nonresidents of the City and residence had little relationship to a detailed knowledge of local physical and historical geography.</SPAN></P>

The interstate character of the tour was interrupted upon its arrival at Battery Park, where passengers left the busses to view local points of interest, and in any event the requirement that all sightseeing guides in New York City be licensed was not an undue interference with interstate commerce.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff union shop stewards brought an action that sought to permanently restrain defendants, the union, its executive board, and other union members, from permitting a special meeting for the purpose of electing new shop stewards on a company-wide basis because it contravened the union's constitution and by-laws. Several union members had proposed the special meeting and the executive board had implicitly condoned it.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The union's constitution and by-laws provided that there must be a steward for each barn within the company and that said steward was to be appointed by the union. Prior to the dispute, the union's practice had always been to elect each barn's shop steward from the union employees that worked in that barn. On review, the court held for the union shop stewards and restrained defendants from the company-wide elections. The court found that the threatened company-wide elections were a change in constitutional practice which required an amendment to the constitution that had not been accomplished. The court held that it would look to the union and its members' conduct with regard to the election procedures because the constitution did not contain specific procedures or requirements for elections. The court found that the practice was clearly to elect the shop stewards from the barn which they represented, and not to have company-wide elections. The court also held that the union shop stewards were not required to exhaust all remedies within the union before seeking equitable relief because the union had not acted within the scope of its powers under the union constitution and by-laws.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found for the union shop stewards and permanently restrained defendants from having company-wide elections unless and until appropriate amendment was made to the union constitution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Labor unions -- rights of members under union's constitution -- union's constitution is contract equitably enforcible by member -- union's constitution provides for &quot;steward for each barn&quot; of any employer and that stewards have seniority in case of layoffs; practical construction for many years has been for executive board to appoint 18 shop stewards, one from among each of employer's 18 barns, and to require seniority provision for them in union's collective bargaining agreement with employer; bargaining committee, with acquiescence of executive board, is calling special meeting of all union members to elect shop stewards on company-wide basis; 4 present shop stewards, plaintiffs, are granted permanent injunction against such violation of union's constitution, unless and until such constitution is properly amended.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The constitution and by-laws of an unincorporated labor union are a binding contract between the union and its members and among its members, and members of the union may seek a decree in equity against the union or against other members so as to enforce their rights under such constitution and by-laws.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The constitution and by-laws of defendant local union&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  provide that &quot;there must be a steward for each barn [of an employer], said steward to be appointed by the local Union&quot;.  The document is silent as to the manner of appointment. But its practical construction is shown by the uniform course of conduct of the union for many years.  The local union's executive board has always appointed a shop steward for each of the employer's separate barns, and, in each case, from the ranks of the employees in the particular barn. The union constitution provides that the &quot;steward shall be the last man to be laid off&quot;; and this seniority is reaffirmed in the union's collective bargaining agreement with the employer.  The constitution further empowers only the executive board to call special meetings of the union's members, and to transact all necessary union business between meetings.  Nevertheless, the individual defendants, who are not on the executive board but who merely comprise a collective bargaining negotiating committee, recently posted in all the barns a notice calling for a special meeting of the union's members employed by a certain employer, for the purpose of electing shop stewards on a company-wide basis, instead of, as heretofore, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  a steward in and for each of this employer's 18 barns. Plaintiffs are 4 of the present 18 stewards, and they sue individually and on behalf of all others similarly situated, for an injunction against any such special meeting or election. After trial, plaintiffs are granted such a permanent injunction, unless and until the union's constitution is amended by the amendment procedures therein provided so as to allow such company-wide election of shop stewards.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. It is not necessary for a union member first to exhaust his remedies within the union, if the union is acting in violation of its own constitution.  However, plaintiffs did protest orally and in writing to the local union's executive board and to the president of the union's joint council and to the vice-president of the international union, but received only noncommittal answers and the information that the union was paying for this meeting hall and that similar notices had been posted in the barns of other employers with whom the union had contracts, and that company-wide stewards had already been elected in such other companies in place of the former separate stewards for each separate barn. It appears further that the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  present notice falsely states that a recently concluded contract with this employer requires that shop stewards be elected on a company-wide basis.  It is evident that plaintiffs have exhausted all reasonable efforts and that further appeals to defendant union's officials would be fruitless.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Plaintiffs have a property right for which they have no adequate remedy at law.  Only an injunction in equity will prevent irreparable injury to their right.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5.  This intra-union dispute is not a labor dispute within section 876-a of the Civil Practice Act. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged under New York City, N.Y., Admin. Code &sect; B32-207.0 with publicizing and conducting a &quot;forced out of business sale&quot; without a license. Though he had applied for a license, it was denied, and the denial was upheld on appeal. In defense, he claimed that &sect; B32-207.0 was an improper exercise of police power, violated his constitutional rights to free speech, equal protection, and due process, and violated N.Y. Const. art. I, &sect; 6.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After defendant was denied a license for a &quot;forced out of business sale,&quot; and after the supreme court rejected an appeal of the denial, defendant proceeded to advertise and hold the sale anyway. When cited with nine violations of Admin. Code &sect; B32-207.0, he sought dismissal of the charges on claims that &sect; B32-207.0 was unconstitutional under federal and state constitutions. The court rejected all of his arguments and entered convictions on eight of the nine citations, dismissing the ninth for lack of sufficient evidence. The court held that the regulation constituted a valid exercise of the city's police power because its object was the prevention of fraud on the public. Because it was a valid exercise of police power, it followed that its enforcement did not deprive defendant of any constitutionally cognizable property interest and therefore did not violate state or federal due process clauses. The court also rejected claims that defendant was denied equal protection because all persons except those acting under court orders and auctioneers (who were subject to special licensing) were covered. Defendant's freedom of speech claim was given short shrift and rejected as well.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court convicted defendant of eight violations of the regulation.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Defendant is convicted on seven of eight summonses of violating section B32-207.0 of the Administrative Code of the City of New York in that it unlawfully published and conducted a &quot;forced out of business sale&quot; without a license.</SPAN></P>

The proof on the eighth summons consisted of testimony that an advertisement had appeared in a New York newspaper bearing the name and address of the defendant, and advertising a &quot;forced out of business sale&quot;.  No proof was offered as to who placed the advertisement or who paid for it.  The proof on this violation was insufficient.</SPAN></P>

The license fee imposed was a reasonable charge for the cost of investigation.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff electricians brought an action against defendant city seeking an injunction and a declaration that New York City, N.Y., Admin.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city enacted New York City, N.Y., Admin. Code &sect; B30-14 that charged a licensing fee to electricians. The fee was to compensate the licensing authority for issuing and recording the license and pay for inspections to see to the enforcing of the license provisions. A group of electricians sought a declaration that the statute was unconstitutional and sought an injunction. Both parties moved for judgment on the pleadings. The court found that the statute was unconstitutional but dismissed that portion of the complaint seeking an injunction. The court found that the inspections referred to had nothing to do with licensing. The inspections were for the purpose of protecting the city's inhabitants from inferior workmanship. The court found that this expense would have been precisely the same whether the artisans doing the work were licensed or not. The court found that an electrical contractor with business in the millions paid exactly the same for the inspection of his work as a shop proprietor who grossed a few thousands. The court held that there was no constitutional warrant for putting the expense of regulating the business of electricians in the guise of a license fee.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Plaintiffs seek a declaration of unconstitutionality of Local Law No. 3 of 1957 of the City of New York, which provides for the licensing of electricians and for a fee of $ 250, and of the prior section which provides a fee of $ 100.  This is not a revenue statute.  The fee which may be charged for the issuance of a license is such as will compensate the licensing authority for issuing and recording the license and pay for inspection to see to the enforcing of the license provisions.  The cost in 1956 for the inspection of all electrical installments was $ 892,365.50, while the license revenue was $ 234,600.  Under the $ 250 fee the return would still be less than the cost, but these figures are irrelevant.  The inspections are for the purpose of protecting the city's inhabitants from the dangers of inferior workmanship. This expense would be the same and equally&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  necessary whether the electricians were licensed or not.  A large electrical contractor pays exactly the same for the inspection of his work as a small contractor. There is no constitutional warrant for putting the expense of regulating the business of electricians in the guise of a license fee. The statute is unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The court will not fix the fee or limit the Legislature in advance.  When a fee is fixed, if challenged, it must be passed on but in advance there is no judicial authority.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Plantiffs' motion is granted but only to the extent that it seeks a declaration. The portion of the complaint which seeks an injunction is dismissed.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged in a seven-count information with violating N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 964-a and with making a false statement in writing for the purpose of procuring property and credit. He demurred to the charges, seeking their dismissal on various grounds, including on the grounds that &sect; 964-a violated U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 10, U.S Const. amend XIV, and N.Y. Const. art. I, &sect; 11, art. III, &sect; 1, and art. III, &sect; 17.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with having held himself out as an employee of the United Nations in connection with a credit purchase of an encyclopedia. He sought dismissal, claiming that N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 964-a violated sundry state and federal constitutional provisions. Applying the rule that an inferior court was not to declare a statute unconstitutional unless its flaws were clear, the court rejected the attacks on &sect;964-a and held that it was constitutional. In specific, the court found no violation of the federal constitutional treaty provision because the statute did not require the State to enter into an agreement with a foreign power. Nor was there any basis to the claim that it violated the federal or state constitution due process or equal protection clauses. The court rejected a defense claim that the legislature had unlawfully delegated authority to the Secretary General of the United Nations for the use of the name &quot;United Nations&quot; or that it had granted an exclusive privilege or franchise to a private individual. The court also found that the language of the seventh count was perfectly adequate because it followed the specific language of N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 1293-b, subd. 1.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied defendant's motion to dismiss all seven charges brought against him in connection with his use of the name of the &quot;United Nations&quot; in connection with a commercial undertaking.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- unauthorized use of name of &quot;United Nations&quot; -- Penal Law ( &sect; 964-a) which makes it misdemeanor to use name &quot;United Nations&quot; without authority of Secretary General thereof is constitutional.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.  Section 964-a of the Penal Law, which makes it a misdemeanor to adopt and use the name &quot;United Nations&quot; or any abbreviation thereof without express authority from the Secretary General of the United Nations is constitutional.  There is nothing in section 964-a which requires the making of any agreement or treaty between the State of New York and the United Nations, and, therefore, the consent of the Congress was unnecessary.  Defendant, who was charged with violating the section, was not denied the equal protection of the laws or deprived of his property without due process of law. That the statute requires that authority for the use of the name &quot;United Nations&quot; be obtained from the Secretary General of that body, does not constitute delegation of legislative power to him.  It is the statute, enacted by the Legislature, which defines the unauthorized use of the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  name as a misdemeanor. Accordingly, defendant's motion to dismiss the first six counts of the information which charged him with violating section 964-a was denied.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The seventh count charged defendant with having falsely represented that he was employed by the Secretary General of the United Nations when in fact he was not so employed and obtained credit by such false statement. Such count followed the specific language of subdivision 1 of section 1293-b of the Penal Law. It was not necessary that the information set forth each and every element of the crime charged. It was sufficient to follow the statutory language if it contained all that was essential to constitute the crime and apprise the accused of the nature of the crime so that his conviction or acquittal would prevent a subsequent charge for the same offense.  The motion to dismiss the seventh count of the information was also denied.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff Commissioner of Agriculture and Markets of the State of New York instituted an action against defendants, a manufacturer and two of its officers, seeking to enjoin the manufacture and sale of a product known as Instantwhip topping on the theory that it was a violation of N.Y. Agric. &amp; Mkts. Law &sect; 68-a.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Commissioner's action was based on the fact that in the manufacture of such topping defendant used dry buttermilk powder that was a dairy product. Thus, the Commissioner was seeking to restrain the manufacture, not because the topping was in semblance of or in imitation of instant whipped cream, but because a certain percentage of its total ingredients was a dairy product. The court dismissed the action. The burden was upon the Commissioner to prove that defendants in manufacturing and selling Instantwhip topping, were guilty of a designed and intentional imitation or resemblance of instant whipped cream, which did not result from the inherent characteristics of the ingredients used. By statutory definition whipped cream contained nothing but cream, sugar, and flavoring and must have been aerated by whipping. Defendants' product contained not only cream, sugar, and flavoring but also skimmed milk, whole milk and a stabilizer. Thus the ingredients of Instantwhip and whipped cream were different, and Instantwhip was a frozen dessert and not a milk or dairy product. Thus, the Commissioner failed to sustain its burden of proof.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The Agriculture and Markets Law ( &sect; 46) defines whipped cream as cream &quot;which has been aerated by whipping. There may be added thereto only sugar or flavoring, or both.&quot; Section 68-a of said law, in five unnumbered paragraphs, regulates the sale of instant whipped cream. Unnumbered paragraphs 3 and 4 of said section 68-a permit certain substitutes for instant whipped cream; and unnumbered paragraph 2 prohibits any &quot;imitation of instant whipped cream manufactured by any process by which fat or oil other than that of milk has been added to or mixed or blended with a dairy product in such a manner that the resultant product is an imitation of or resembles instant whipped cream.&quot; Defendant corporation manufactures two products: &quot;Instantwhip&quot;, principally from cream; and&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;Instantwhip Topping&quot;, principally from vegetable fat, but with dry buttermilk powder added.  It sells said &quot;Topping&quot; in two separate forms: one under gas pressure which, when dispensed from the pressurized container, as is Instantwhip, resembles whipped cream; and another form not under gas pressure, sold to bakers and confectioners in bulk form, having no resemblance to whipped cream, and which is whipped or gassed by the baker or confectioner. It is quite possible that this &quot;Topping&quot; is not a &quot;dairy product&quot; at all (within the meaning of Agriculture and Markets Law, art. 4, &sect; 68-a) but is merely a &quot;frozen dessert&quot; (under art. 4-a).  In any event, it is an inherent characteristic of the ingredients of this &quot;Topping&quot; that they can be aerated (&quot;whipped&quot;) into a fluffy white texture resembling whipped cream. It cannot be said that such a resemblance is a designed or intentional imitation; and therefore this action by the State Commissioner of Agriculture and Markets to enjoin the manufacture and sale of &quot;Instantwhip Topping&quot; is dismissed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The commissioner failed to sustain the burden of proving a designed, intentional imitation not resulting from the inherent characteristics&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of the ingredients. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowners made an application to the city water department for the necessary supply of water for the operation of its commercial laundry. No notice was ever issued to the landowners that they had defaulted in payment of the water bills. The unpaid water bills owed by the landowner's tenant were assessed as part of the general city tax upon the premises of the landowner. The landowner sought a declaratory judgment that the assessment was null and void. The city filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings. In granting the motion, the court held that it would not invoke the right to grant special dispensation through the equitable relief of a declaratory judgment when an adequate remedy to the taxpayer was granted by statute. Where an adequate remedy at law was provided, the reason for granting equitable relief disappeared. Because the landowner had an adequate remedy at law against the tenant, the court refused to grant the landowner's request for equitable relief.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner's station wagon was a private passenger motor vehicle bought and used for such purposes. The owner alleged that he applied for renewal of registration and tendered $ 17 as provided by the rate set forth in N.Y. Veh. &amp; Traf. &sect; 11(6). When the Commissioner of Motor Vehicles rejected the application and informed the owner that the fee for renewal would be $ 25.50, the owner resubmitted his application and paid under protest the fee of $ 25.50. He argued that the law unfairly and arbitrarily discriminated and was unconstitutional and void: &sect; 11(7), in prescribing a higher rate for station wagons than for private passenger vehicles and &sect; 11(5), in providing a shorter period of time for registering and re-registering station wagons. The court disagreed. The court found that there was a substantial distinction, clearly cognizable, between a station wagon and a passenger motor vehicle and that these vehicles were capable of a special and extraordinary use. The court found that the distinction in the statute, which seemed initially a matter of identification, was logically based upon conservation and safety.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Provisions of the Vehicle and Traffic Law which prescribe higher registration fees for station wagons than for private passenger motor vehicles, and a shorter period of time for registering and re-registering station wagons, are not unreasonable, confiscatory and discriminatory as to one who operates his station wagon as a private passenger vehicle, nor do those provisions deprive such an owner of equal protection of the laws (Vehicle and Traffic Law, &sect; 11, subds. 5, 7).  In an action for a judgment declaring the invalidity, on constitutional grounds, of such provisions, defendants' motion for judgment on the pleadings was granted.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner maintained a rooming house of 19 separate units in a building that was once a single family dwelling. Section 194 required the owner and others like him to maintain sprinkler heads in every room of a non-fireproof converted dwelling. The owner alleged that the law was unconstitutional. In dismissing the petition, the court stated that it would have been loath to condemn as unconstitutional any statute, enacted for the protection of life, unless its invalidity was so manifest that the court had no alternative. The court noted that housing accommodations for low, moderate, and middle income groups in New York City were woefully inadequate. The court also noted that there had been a wave of serious fires in rooming houses in recent years due to overcrowding. The court stated that if the public could not invest the dwelling places of the underprivileged with dignity, it could at least insist by statute and public opinion, that they be kept secure.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, a 16-year-old, sought to waive his right for a trial by jury after a county court denied his application for severance of his criminal trial from the trial of five other co-defendants for first-degree assault, several counts of second-degree assault, and a violation of the Sullivan Law, N.Y.

The other co-defendants were also separately indicted for other offenses that arose from a separate incident.

The court held that: (1) defendant should be aided in the proceeding by a guardian ad litem or a special guardian and that the court would make an appointment nunc pro tunc without prejudice upon an application; and (2) approval of a waiver of a jury trial was to follow where a judge has ascertained that defendant was fully aware of the nature and consequence of the request and defendant signed a written statement in open court.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Jury -- waiver in criminal case -- constitutional right of defendant in criminal case to waive jury trial (N. Y. Const., art. I, &sect; 2) is subject to court's approval merely as to whether defendant understands what he is signing; court has no right or discretion to withhold approval on ground that defendant is really seeking severance of his trial and that such motion for severance had been previously denied -- matter of such waiver by 16-year-old defendant is remitted to County Court, which may wish to confer with defendant's relatives, counsel and guardian to be appointed in this proceeding in nature of prohibition and mandamus (Civ. Prac. Act, art. 78).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The New York State Constitution (art. I, &sect; 2, as amd. in 1938) provides: &quot;Trial by jury in all cases in which it has heretofore been guaranteed by constitutional provision shall remain inviolate forever * * *.  A jury trial may be waived by the defendant in all criminal cases, except those in which the crime charged may be punishable by death, by a written instrument signed by the defendant in person in open court before and with the approval of a judge or justice of a court having jurisdiction to try the offense.  The&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  legislature may enact laws, not inconsistent herewith, governing the form, content, manner and time of presentation of the instrument effectuating such waiver.&quot; As shown by the proceedings of the 1938 Constitutional Convention, the intent was to give a defendant an absolute right to waive a jury trial, and the only function of the court is to make sure that the defendant is aware of the nature and consequences of his waiver.  The court does not have discretionary power to refuse to approve the waiver.  Here, indictments against this defendant and five other defendants were directed by the County Court to be tried jointly.  Then this defendant moved for a severance and separate trial, and his motion was denied.  Then this defendant sought, by a written instrument in open court, to waive jury trial. The County Court denied his application, solely on the ground that a waiver would accomplish indirectly the very severance which defendant had been denied.  This was error.  The judge may withhold approval only if he determines that the defendant does not adequately understand the nature and consequences of his waiver.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. In this proceeding in the Supreme Court under article 78 of the Civil&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Practice Act in the nature of a joint writ of prohibition and mandamus, the court remands the matter to the County Court so that that court may ascertain whether the defendant is fully aware of the nature and consequences of his waiver.  The County Court may wish to confer with the defendant, who is 16 years old, and with, among others, his parents or nearest relatives, and his counsel, and his guardian ad litem or special guardian to be appointed in this proceeding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Application should be made, in this article 78 proceeding, for the appointment of a guardian ad litem or special guardian for this infant (Civ. Prac. Act, &sect;&sect; 202, 207), and such an appointment will be made </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">nunc pro tunc</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. This special proceeding in the nature both of prohibition and of mandamus (Civ. Prac. Act, art. 78) is an appropriate remedy.  It is not in the nature of a writ of certiorari; nor is it intended &quot;to review a determination&quot; &quot;made in a criminal matter&quot; (Civ. Prac. Act, &sect; 1285, subd. 2) nor, since petitioner cannot raise bail, is the determination one which can be &quot;adequately&quot; reviewed by an appeal (Civ. Prac. Act, &sect; 1285, subd. 4).  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Before the court was the motion to dismiss filed by defendants, statutory tenant, State Rent Administrator, and Attorney General, in an action brought by plaintiff landlord under N.Y. Civ. Prac. Act art. 83 to evict the statutory tenant from the apartment in order to secure possession for the landlord's use.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Before attempting to exhaust his administrative remedies, the landlord commenced an eviction action against the statutory tenant. The landlord alleged that the N.Y. State Residential Rent Law ch. 755 was unconstitutional in that no emergency existed to justify it. The landlord argued that he did not have to exhaust the administrative remedies available before challenging the constitutionality of the N.Y. State Residential Rent Law ch. 755. The State Rent Administrator was authorized to intervene by stipulation of the landlord and the tenant. Under N.Y. Exec. Law &sect; 71 the Attorney General was required to appear in support of the constitutionality of the emergency housing rent control laws. Defendants filed a motion to dismiss the landlord's petition. The court found that the landlord's petition was insufficient and dismissed it. The court determined that defendant had to exhaust his administrative remedies and could not by-pass or circumvent the rent control law. The court concluded that prior to exhausting his administrative remedies the landlord was not an aggrieved person, and thus was not in a position to attack the constitutionality of N.Y. State Residential Rent Law ch. 755.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional law -- rent regulation -- State Residential Rent Law, as extended to June 30, 1959 (L. 1957, ch. 755) is constitutional -- in any event landlord must first apply for certificate of eviction (State Rent and Eviction Regulations, &sect; 54) before he can challenge constitutionality of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">statute</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> as aggrieved person.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The State Residential Rent Law (L. 1946, ch. 274, as last amd. by L. 1957, ch. 755 and extended to June 30, 1959) is constitutional and valid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. In any event, this summary dispossess proceeding in the Municipal Court is not the proper forum for a declaratory judgment; furthermore, a court of limited jurisdiction should not treat a statute as null and void unless the statute is obviously so.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Furthermore, this landlord is not an aggrieved party, since he has not exhausted his administrative remedies for obtaining a certificate authorizing eviction under section 54 of the State Rent and Eviction Regulations in cases where &quot;the requested removal or eviction is not inconsistent with the purposes of the Act or these Regulations and would not be likely to result&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  in the circumvention or evasion thereof.&quot; Landlord alleges, merely on the asserted statement of an unnamed representative of the State Rent Administrator, that it would be futile to apply for such a certificate. However, it appears that the tenant now owns a residential cooperative apartment which is comparable in all respects with the premises involved in this dispossess proceeding, and hence it may very well be that the State Rent Administrator would issue a certificate of eviction if the landlord made application therefor under section 54 of the regulations (see Administrator's Opinion No. 118; see, also, provisions for decontrol set forth in L. 1957, ch. 755).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Accordingly, this summary dispossess proceeding is dismissed.  </SPAN></P>

The application of N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 1141 was central to the dispute among the parties.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants' affidavits established that only isolated passages of the book were submitted to the grand jury. The court granted the motions to inspect the grand jury minutes. It held that in order to be convicted of publishing or distributing obscene material pursuant to &sect; 1141, the publication as a whole, as opposed to isolated passages, had to be considered. The court ruled that the test for determining whether a publication was obscene was whether to the average person, applying contemporary community standards, the dominant theme of the material taken as a whole appealed to a prurient interest. The court also held that a motion to inspect the grand jury's minutes could be granted if the facts shown demonstrated that there was a reason to believe that the evidence before the grand jury was insufficient or illegal.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Indictments against the distributor and the publisher of an allegedly obscene novel must be dismissed if the Grand Jury minutes show that the only proofs submitted to the Grand Jury were isolated passages from the book (Penal Law, &sect; 1141; Code Crim.

Consideration must be given to the estimation of approved critics.  Legitimate works of literature must not be interfered with.  On these motions by the publisher and by the distributor of the novel &quot;Ten North Frederick&quot;, to inspect the Grand Jury minutes, Special Term has read the Grand Jury minutes and now grants the motions for inspection. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On the ground that N.Y. Mental Hyg. Law &sect; 74 was unconstitutional and violated the due process provisions of the federal and state constitutions, plaintiff patient filed a motion to vacate the order of certification in the Monroe County Court (New York), which admitted her to the state hospital for treatment of mental illness. She also sought to vacate the subsequent certificate of the medical officer that she remain admitted in the hospital.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to N.Y Mental Hyg. Law &sect; 74, the patient, by order of certification of a county court, was admitted to a state hospital for observation and treatment for specified period. Before the expiration of the period a medical officer of the institution executed a certificate that he considered the patient to be in need of continued care and treatment. The order of certification automatically became a final order in accordance with &sect; 74 upon the filing of the certificate. The patient filed a motion to vacate the order of certification and the certificate of the medical officer on the ground that the &sect; 74 was unconstitutional and violative of the constitutional due process provisions. The court denied her motion. The findings of the medical officer did not constitute a &quot;judicial proceeding,&quot; and there was no statutory right to notice at that stage of the proceedings. The court concluded that the rights to hearing, review, and habeas corpus contained in N.Y. Mental Hyg. Law &sect;&sect; 74, 76, 204 adequately protected the patient. Thus, her constitutional rights were not violated.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied the patient's motion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Insane and other incompetent persons -- commitment procedure -- constitutionality of provision for keeping patient in institution on medical certificate that patient needs continued treatment -- patient's application for jury trial of issue of her mental illness was denied since made more than 30 days after State hospital had filed certificate that she needed continued care and treatment (Mental Hygiene Law, &sect; 74); said </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">statute</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> affords due process and is constitutional.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By an order of a County Judge or other court of record, notice to an alleged mentally ill person of an application to certify her for admission to an authorized institution may be dispensed with, and the court may make an order certifying that such patient be admitted to such institution for observation and treatment for a period not exceeding 60 days (Mental Hygiene Law, &sect; 74).  Nevertheless, if the director of the institution believes that the patient is not mentally ill, he may refuse to receive the patient or he may discharge the patient (&sect; 74, subd. 8).  Or, the judge, on his own motion or on demand of a relative or friend of the patient, may hold&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  a hearing (&sect; 74, subd. 5).  Or, within 60 days after the date of the order of certification, the superintendent or other duly designated medical officer of the institution may file in the County Clerk's office his certificate that the patient needs continued care and treatment; and such filing makes the order of certification a final order (&sect; 74, subd. 7).  Within 30 days after such final order, the patient or any relative or friend may petition a Justice of the Supreme Court, who shall order a jury trial of the issue of mental illness (&sect; 76).  Or a writ of habeas corpus may be sued out (&sect; 204).  Taken together, these provisions afford due process.  In this case, the court's orders certifying the patient and dispensing with notice were dated April 17, 1957, and the medical officer's certificate of the patient's need for continued treatment was filed on May 3, 1957; hence the patient's petition on June 17, 1957 for a jury trial was too late and was therefore denied.  The patient's present petition, to vacate the orders and certificate on the ground that section 74 is unconstitutional, is denied.  </SPAN></P>
