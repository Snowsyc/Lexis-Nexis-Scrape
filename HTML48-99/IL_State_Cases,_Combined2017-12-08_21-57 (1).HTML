</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court allowed direct appeals by both defendant and the Director of Mental Health and Developmental Disabilities (department) from an order of the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois). The order directed the department to establish a treatment plan for defendant and to publish regulations for custody, care, and control of patients committed under the Illinois Unified Code of Corrections, Ill. Rev. Stat. 1975, ch. 38, para. 1005-2-4.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was acquitted of murder by reason of insanity, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 115-3 (1977). In a hearing pursuant to Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 1005-2-4(a) (1977), he was found in need of mental treatment and remanded to the department, which placed him at a mental health center for treatment. In apparent response to the department's consideration of off-grounds privileges, which were later denied, the state requested a hearing under Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 1005-2-4(d) (1977), and defendant petitioned for discharge or release. After an evidentiary hearing, the circuit court ordered establishment of a specific treatment plan for defendant, and publication of procedures and regulations for processing patients committed under Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 1005-2-4 (1977). On appeal, the court affirmed the order as to the treatment plan, but vacated that part of the order directing the department to publish general procedures applicable to commitments under para. 1005-2-4. The court held that the circuit court improperly addressed the department's general practices and procedures when the issue before it was the adequacy of defendant's course of treatment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the circuit court's order in part with respect to the issues raised by defendant regarding release from involuntary commitment. The court vacated that part of the order directing the department to issue a memorandum, and in all other respects affirmed the order of the circuit court.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the issue was whether the appellate court was correct in holding that the appointment of the superintendent of the commission was an appointment by a private body and invalid, and whether the discharge of a secretary of the commission was to be governed by rules or guidelines of the commission or of the board. The court found that the commission was not a private body or group. The court found that the Illinois General Assembly did not exceed its constitutional limitations in granting the commission authority to select the superintendent under Ill. Const. art. VII, &sect; 8. The court affirmed the appellate court's judgment because the superintendent had the implied authority to discharge.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A city ordinance required that persons in control of property fronting or abutting on paved sidewalks had to remove snow and ice from the sidewalks within 24 hours of the precipitation. An Illinois statute, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 24, para. 11-80-13 (1977), allowed the city to require the owner or occupant of any premises to keep the sidewalks abutting the premises free from snow or other obstructions. The city's complaint against a property owner for violating the ordinance was dismissed, on the basis that the statute and ordinance were invalid, and the city appealed. The court reversed and held that the statute and ordinance were valid. The court ruled that, based on the development and scope of police power, two related decisions were invalid and not binding upon the court. The court held that keeping sidewalks free from snow and ice was closely related to and in furtherance of the public's welfare and that the city was entitled to undertake by ordinance the requirement to keep the sidewalks clear in the interest of public safety. The means were not arbitrary or unreasonable nor was the burden manifestly disproportional or unrelated to a legitimate classification.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After defendant was found guilty of murder, aggravated kidnapping, and armed robbery, the trial court held that Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 9-1(d) (1977), allowing the prosecutor to request a proceeding to determine whether the death penalty should be imposed, was unconstitutional. Petitioner State sought a writ of mandamus to direct respondent trial court to expunge its order and to conduct a sentencing proceeding.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted the writ of mandamus. It held that the statute did not violate the separation of powers provision of the Illinois Constitution, rejecting the argument that because whether a death penalty sentencing proceeding took place depended on whether the prosecutor requested such a proceeding, the prosecutor was in essence participating in the sentencing process. It stated that there were many occasions in a criminal trial where a judicial ruling adverse to a defendant would not be made unless requested by the prosecution. It held that the statute did not violate the Eighth Amendment, noting that the United States Supreme Court had held in a similar case that the fact that a prosecutor had the discretion whether to seek the death penalty did not mean that there were no standards to guide the prosecutor's decision. Considering the argument that a defendant would be unable to make an intelligent plea decision unless he knew in advance of trial whether the state would seek the death penalty, it held that this argument did not provide a basis for denying the writ, writing that it could not be resolved without the determination of factual matters on which the record was silent.</SPAN></P>

The corporations challenged two categories of exemptions to the tax as having been unreasonable, arbitrary, and unrelated to the purposes of the ordinance. The court held that the corporations failed to establish the invalidity of the classifications contained in the ordinance. The court found that the exemptions contained in the city's ordinance was limited to entities that benefited and improved the community. The court noted that the ordinance placed a burden on the corporations to collect and hold the tax for the city and imposed a cost of collection on the corporations. The court pointed out that the classification system that exempted public entities from the cost of collecting the tax freed them to spend their money to benefit the public.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Illinois legislature, after abolishing ad valorem personal property taxes, enacted the Illinois replacement tax act (act), Pub. Act 81 --1SS--1 to replace lost taxes. The replacement tax targeted corporations, trusts, and partnerships, and invested capital. In a consolidated action, petitioner taxpayers sought declaratory judgments and injunctions against respondent revenue officials, seeking to have the act declared invalid.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found that none of the taxpayers' claims against the act established it was invalid, so that the revenue officials should be enjoined for enforcing it. First, the court established that, because the act replaced a tax, but did not create a new tax, it was within the gubernatorial amendatory veto power, provided by Ill. Const. art. IV, &sect; 9(e). Although the replacement tax would raise more than the abolished ad valorem tax did, it was not a new tax on that basis and, so, it was not a prohibited revenue-generating measure. The tax under the act also did not violate a class-imposition restriction under Ill. Const. art. IX, &sect; 5(c), because the corporations and partnerships affected by the income tax under the act, correlated to the classes subject to the ad valorem property tax. Moreover, partnerships were not excluded from tax liability under the act. Further, the act did not impose double taxation by taxing partners on partnership income and individual income. Nor did it double tax corporations whose main corporate asset was real property, because the income tax under the act was directed at the business aspect of the invested capital, not at its identity as real property.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied the taxpayers' petitions for an injunction against the act and declined to hold it constitutionally invalid.</SPAN></P>

The state also appealed from the judgment of the Circuit Court of Sangamon County (Illinois) allowing the motion of defendant to dismiss similar charges.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants in both cases filed a motion to dismiss the charge of harassment by telephone. The trial courts granted the motions on the basis that the Illinois telephone harassment act was unconstitutional. Defendants contended that, when a statute, which was susceptible of application to conduct protected by the First Amendment presented the danger of a chilling effect, it was unconstitutionally overbroad. They argued that the telephone harassment statute was impermissibly vague because no standard of conduct was specified. The court, in reversing the judgments of the trial courts, held that the statute was neither vague nor overbroad. In the phrase, &quot;with the intent to abuse, threaten, or harass any person,&quot; the words &quot;abuse&quot; and &quot;harass&quot; took color from the word &quot;threaten&quot; and acquired more restricted meanings. The statute did not attempt to particularize all conduct that fell within the statute because it would have been a futile effort to enumerate all methods of harassing someone over the telephone.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgments of the trial court, which had dismissed the charges against defendants for harassment by telephone.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The administrator of the Attorney Registration and Disciplinary Commission filed a complaint against respondent attorney with unprofessional conduct.

Code of Prof'l Responsibility DR 2-106 (1970). The Hearing Board made a recommendation that the appropriate measure of discipline was censure. On appeal, the court adopted the Hearing Board's recommendation for censure. The court held that an attorney-client fixed-fee agreement could form the basis for disciplinary action against an attorney. Further, respondent's receipt of a $ 5,000 fee constituted an excessive fee under Ill. Code of Prof'l Responsibility DR 2-106 (1970). The court found that respondent's violation of the disciplinary rule did warrant discipline, and it found that censure was the appropriate sanction to impose.</SPAN></P>

Defendants appealed the circuit court's interlocutory order directing defendant telephone company to segregate and sequester that portion of the message tax alleged by plaintiff to be excessive. The court affirmed the circuit court's order because having paid the tax, plaintiff was entitled to the benefit of the rule that taxing laws were to be strictly construed and that they were not to be extended beyond the clear import of the language used. The court determined that the rule's application would proscribe the construction of the statute, which would result in an increase both in the amount of the tax paid to defendant city and the &quot;costs of accounting&quot; permitted to be charged by the nominal taxpayer.

If the court had jurisdiction, it was empowered to make either a correct or an erroneous decision and the fact that the statute or ordinance upon which the decision was based was void did not serve to deprive it of jurisdiction.

The appellate court affirmed the trial court's judgment. On further appeal, the court reversed the judgments below an held that the tape recordings were obtained in compliance with the then-existing statutory requirements for electronic surveillance and, therefore, were not subject to the exclusionary rule. The court found that, under Ill. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The probationers were sentenced under &sect; 10 of the Cannabis Control Act, Ill. Rev.

Both complaints were premises on new case law which held that fines and costs were not reasonable terms and conditions of probation as that term was used in &sect; 10 of the Cannabis Control Act and that, therefore, the imposition of fines and costs were not authorized by statute. The government contended that amendatory acts to the stated statutes expressly authorized the imposition of fines and costs as conditions of probation. The court reversed the order of the circuit court striking and dismissing the probationers' complaints on the basis of the amendments to the Cannabis Control Act and the Illinois Controlled Substances Act, and remanded the matter.

Stat. 1977, ch. 83, para. 22.1, which provided for a special limitation period for plaintiff patients' medical malpractice actions against defendants, physicians and hospital. One panel of the Fourth District Appellate Court (Illinois) held &sect; 21.1 to be constitutional.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff patients contended that &sect; 21.1was unconstitutional for several reasons. The patients claimed that &sect; 21.1 violated the due process and equal protection clauses of both the Federal and State constitutions. The plaintiffs' primary contention was, however, that &sect; 21.1 violated Ill. Const. art. IV, &sect; 13 (1970) in that it was special legislation because it (1) set medical malpractice apart from all other professional malpractice and (2) conferred a special privilege upon only two classes of medical health providers, physicians and hospitals. The court found no due process violation, noting that it had not been demonstrated that the legislative action in establishing the four-year outer limit within which to file a complaint for medical malpractice was unreasonable. The court concluded that &sect; 21.1 was a reasonable attempt to remedy what the legislature perceived to be a medical malpractice insurance crisis. The court further concluded that there was a reasonable basis for differentiating between physicians and hospitals and other members of the general class of health-care providers for the purpose of &sect; 21.1. The court also held that &sect; 21.1 was not special legislation.</SPAN></P>

The bidder's former president, who still owned a controlling interest in the bidder, had been convicted of bribery in the past. The bidder's proposal, which was the only one received, was rejected because of the application of para. 132.10.1 due to of the bribery conviction. The bidder filed an action for declaratory judgment and argued that para. 132.10.1 violated its due process rights. The circuit court granted the state's motion for summary judgment, but the appellate court reversed. The state appealed. The court reversed and held that the bidder did not have a protectable property interest in the award of a contract within the meaning of the due process clause because the bidder did not have a legitimate claim of entitlement to the award. There was no recognized property right in a future government contract. The Act was not unconstitutionally vague, and it did not invalidly delegate legislative power to administrative officials. The Act was not applied retroactively to the bidder, and it was not a bill of attainder.</SPAN></P>

The trial court found a constitutional violation and entered the injunction sought by the taxpayer. The recorder of deeds and county treasurer appealed and the court affirmed. The constitutional provision prohibited compensation of officers from fees collected and prohibited fees from being based on taxes collected. Because the portion of the tax to be retained was to kept as a fee, it violated the prohibition against fees being based on amounts collected. This was true even though the officials' compensation was not based on the fees they collected. The court noted that later amendments deleting the reference to amount to be retained as being a fee did not reflect on the original intent of the statute. In fact, the court looked at prior history and determined that compensation and fees had historically been based on the amounts collected, which was specifically what the constitutional provision was designed to prevent.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the administrator for the mother's estate argued that application of the tolling provisions applied to residents but not nonresidents were unconstitutional. The court reversed the appellate court's order because the mother had a money judgment payable in periodic installments. Therefore, the statute of limitations began to run on each installment as it became due. However, the running of the statute was tolled during defendant's absence from the forum state. The court held that tolling provisions applicable only to residents was unconstitutional because it violated the Equal Protection Clause. Therefore, the mother's action to enforce two foreign support orders should not have been dismissed.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant state challenged the judgment of the Appellate Court for the Fourth District (Illinois), which reversed the trial court's determination that the two prerequisites for a class action set forth in Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 110, par. 57.2 (1977), were not present in the claims of appellee convict and others purported to be in the class.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee convict brought an action to enforce the court's prior holdings in People v. McCabe (1971), 49 Ill. 2d 338, and People v. Meyerowitz (1975), 61 Ill. 2d 200, through a class action. The trial court dismissed the action, and the appellate court reversed. On further challenge by appellant state, the court held that the appellate misapprehended its role and misapplied the governing principles with regard to the holding of the trial court that the two prerequisites to a class action were not present in the case. Under Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 110, par. 57.2 (1977), these prerequisites must be established by the proponents of the class action. Although the trial court considered the size of the class and the fairness of a class action to the members of the class, The court held that there were no questions of law or fact common to the members of the class to be litigated in a class action and that the class action would not result in any increased efficiency to the court or to the litigants in the adjudication of the claims. The court held that the determination of the trial court as to the absence of these two criteria did not constitute an abuse of discretion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the former student instituted an action against the private school, the school filed a motion to dismiss the complaint because notice had not been given as provided in the Local Government and Governmental Employees Tort Immunity Act (Act). In affirming a decision denying the private school's motion to dismiss, the court stated that a review of the statutory language and purpose of the Act clearly indicated that it did not apply to private schools. While private schools served the public good by educating children, the performance of that beneficial function did not transform such schools from private into public entities. Cases did not require equal treatment of public and private schools beyond the application of the tort liability provisions of the School Code. The General Assembly was free to treat public schools differently from private schools by including only public schools in the provisions of the Act.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employer was a company in the home-improvement business. Much of its business was generated through the efforts of salesmen and canvassers.

The employer made the payment but later filed a claim for refund, which was denied. The employer filed a protest, and the determination was affirmed after a hearing. The employer filed a complaint for administrative review, and the decision was affirmed again there and by the appellate court. The employer sought review, arguing that the services were exempt under the independent contractors exemption of &sect; 212 of the Act. The court affirmed, holding that the employer failed to prove that the salesman at issue and the canvassers were free from its control, so it failed to satisfy &sect; 212(a) of the Act. The exemption required that the salesman and canvassers were free from control, the service was outside the usual course of business or performed outside all the places of business of the enterprise, and the individual was engaged in an independently established trade or occupation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The corporation was representative of a certified class of plaintiffs alleging that the assessor's attempt to collect personal property tax in 1979 on shares of capital stock owned in 1978 was unconstitutional.&nbsp;Ill. Const. art. IX, &sect; 5(c) abolished previous ad valorem personal property tax for corporations after 1979 and instilled a real property taxation scheme to replace the revenue lost. However, the general assembly had not yet passed legislation implementing this provision. The circuit court granted the assessor's motion to dismiss. On appeal, the court reversed. The court held that the constitutional convention implementing the constitutional provision sought to abolish the ad valorem taxation system. The language of &sect; 5(c) constituted a limitation on the power to tax after January 1, 1979 and not a mandate. Therefore, the courts were entitled to enforce the limitation. Nonetheless, the corporations were still required to pay the 1978 ad valorem taxes because the owner of personal property is liable for taxes on that property on April 1 of the tax year. The court concluded that the general assembly had a continuing mandate to implement the constitutional provision.</SPAN></P>

The trial court granted the business entities' declaratory judgment relief and determined that the rule promulgated by the government official was unconstitutionally vague under the due process clause of both the state and federal constitutions. On appeal, the government official contended that the rule had sufficient certainty to afford the business entities' due process. The court agreed with the government official. The court pointed out that administrative rules and regulations had the force and effect of law and were to be construed under the same standards, which governed the construction of statutes. The court noted that the administrative rule at issue in this case carried a presumption of validity. On review of the challenged language within the rule, the court concluded that the rule sufficiently informed the business entities of the records they were required to keep and thus they were not denied due process of law.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, pharmacist and the Department of Registration and Education (Department), and appellees, pharmacists and the Department, challenged decisions by the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois), which decided if the pharmacists' convictions under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1396h(b)(1) constituted gross immorality under the Pharmacy Practice Act (Act), Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 111, para. 4019 (1977), and provided grounds to revoke their licenses.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The pharmacists were convicted of violating &sect; 1396h(b)(1) for he offering or making of a kickback or bribe in connection with furnishing of drugs and pharmaceutical services for which payment was made in whole or part out of federal funds under an approved state medical assistance plan. The Department followed the recommendations of the State Board of Pharmacy and revoked the pharmacists' licenses. The trial court affirmed two revocations and reversed one revocation. The court reversed the two decisions affirming the revocations and affirmed the decision reversing the revocation. The court determined that violation of &sect; 1396h(b)(1) was not concerned with the exercise of the professional skill of a pharmacist. It was extraneous to the central concern of the Act, the protection of public health, safety, and welfare through the regulation of the practice of pharmacy. A misdemeanor conviction for the payment of kickbacks or bribes was not gross immorality for the purposes of pharmacy license revocations.</SPAN></P>

The court held that even if the investigation reports fell within the definition of public records under the Local Records Act, it did not follow that they were subject to public disclosure. The court held that in the absence of factors supporting disclosure other than a general policy of openness in government and the individuals and community groups' interest in the condition of buildings, and in the face of strong countervailing factors, investigative reports were not open to public access.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The county assessed real estate taxes on the taxpayer's leasehold interest in property owned by the authority. The taxpayer and the authority paid the taxes under protest and filed objections. The portion of the circuit court's decree that held that the leasehold interest was exempt from taxation and that enjoined the county from assessing the tax was vacated on the collector's motion. The authority appealed. The appellate court found that an amendment to Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 121, para. 100-22, which abolished an exemption from taxation of highway property if the property was leased for certain purposes, impaired a valid, existing contract. On appeal by the collector, the court reversed the appellate court and affirmed the circuit court. A taxpayer had no vested right in the continued existence of a taxing statute. The statute that created the exemption contained no language that would serve to form a contract that the grant of exemption would remain in force. The contention that the property was exempt because it was state property was without merit because the property sought to be taxed was the taxpayer's leasehold interest.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court found that, in light of the history of dispute over the ordinance, the university had fully exhausted its remedies before the city zoning authorities.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The university sought an amendment and a variation of the city's zoning ordinance, which forbid professional sports. While that action was pending, the university then sought declaratory relief that the zoning ordinance was unconstitutional. The circuit court dismissed the complaint for failure to exhaust local and administrative remedies. The appellate court reversed. On appeal, the court reversed the appellate court's judgment and affirmed the trial court's order dismissing the complaint. The court held that, if the university had challenged the validity of the city's ordinance on its face, it would not have needed to exhaust administrative remedies. However, the university did not avoid the exhaustion of remedies requirement because it merely alleged that the ordinance was unconstitutional. The university claimed that the ordinance was inherently arbitrary because it was permitted to maintain athletic facilities but prohibited from using them for professional sports. That proposition, however, was not self-evident. Whether other aspects of the differing impact of commercial versus noncommercial uses were significant required additional proof beyond the face of the ordinance.</SPAN></P>

The court found that a defendant must show an actual conflict of interest manifested at trial in order to prevail on a constitutional claim of ineffective assistance of counsel due to joint representation of co-defendants by a single attorney. The court found the evidence sufficient to support the convictions reasoning that a conviction could not be set aside merely because the evidence was contradictory and that circumstantial evidence could support a conviction as long as it produced a reasonable and moral certainty that defendant had committed the crime.

The court noted that the allocation of the burden of proof in preponderance of the evidence issues only had meaning when the evidence was in equipoise.

The circuit court held that the price for the release of the land was unconstitutional and entered an order to quiet title in the individual and issued a writ of possession in his favor. The DOT appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The DOT had acquired an easement for a public highway by virtue of a dedication and executed by the individual's predecessors in title to the land. The DOT contended that the action was in fact a suit against the state and was barred by the statute that proscribes making the state a party to an action in any court. The court held that the action could not have been maintained in any court. Since the property of the state was involved, the suit directly and adversely affected the state and the action was held by the court to have been one against the state. It was necessary for the trial court to determine whether, under the facts, there had in fact been an abandonment of the easement by the state. An abandonment of the land necessarily involved and affected an interest in property that had been conveyed to and vested in the state. Although the suit was nominally against an officer of the state, it clearly affected property of the state.</SPAN></P>

The Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) dismissed plaintiffs' action for failure to state a cause of action.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, individually and as representatives of a class of persons similarly situated, claimed that the ordinance's exemption of interstate phone calls from the tax was an unreasonable classification which denied plaintiffs equal protection of the laws and that the ordinance was, on its face, unconstitutionally vague and indefinite. The court affirmed. The court stated that the city, by distinguishing between interstate and intrastate telephone calls, might seek to favor such commerce to attract business to the city and could find that administration of a tax upon interstate calls was unduly burdensome. The court found that because plaintiffs failed to rebut either consideration in their pleadings, such pleadings failed to state a cause of action as to the distinction in question. The court further found that plaintiffs failed to plead facts establishing that the ordinance was unconstitutionally vague and therefore an unlawful delegation of the legislative authority of the city council to the city officers.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">While in office, the governor participated in the state employee retirement system.

The court affirmed the appellate court, which reversed the trial court and held that the governor was not entitled to benefits pursuant to Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 108 1/2, para. 14-199 (1975). The court held that 1) the governor's conviction of federal felonies qualified as &quot;any felony&quot; under the statute, which was otherwise clear as to the denial of benefits in such cases; 2) the phrase &quot;heretofore acquired&quot; in the statute meant benefits acquired prior to the enactment of the felony provision and was not applicable to the governor, whose pension rights vested long after the statute's effective date; and 3) rights under Ill. Const. of 1970, art.

The department had elected to stand on a motion to dismiss the circuit court had denied. The department made its appeal directly to the court pursuant to Ill. Sup. Ct. R. 302(a), 58 Ill.2d R. 302(a).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs filed two lawsuits against the department seeking to have a portion of &sect; 1 of art. VIII of the Liquor Control Act (Act), Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 43, para. 158 (1969) declared unconstitutional. Plaintiffs alleged entitlement to a credit for taxes paid between January 1968 and August 1971 because during that time distributors of wine made from grapes grown in Illinois were unconstitutionally taxed at a lower rate. The court reversed the circuit court's entry of a default judgment for plaintiffs, holding that under the principle of res judicata, plaintiffs were barred from relitigating their claim for a reimbursement of taxes. The court found that the plaintiffs were all parties in interest in a prior class action lawsuit involving the same issues for periods during 1970 and 1971. In that case, plaintiffs were denied relief because they had not borne the burden of the tax they claimed was unconstitutional. The court found that the judgment applied to the new lawsuit, thus precluding plaintiffs' claims. Although the new lawsuit claimed relief for taxes for an earlier time period, the prior decision was binding on all claims that could have been presented and decided.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A fight erupted, and a police officer was struck by defendant, who was diagnosed with alcoholism and epilepsy. At trial, a physician testified that because defendant experienced a seizure, he lacked substantial capacity to appreciate the criminality of his conduct or conform it to the law. Both parties tendered jury instructions regarding the insanity defense. The trial court charged the jury with the state's instruction, and defendant objected only to the second paragraph and the verdict forms. He was convicted at trial, but on appeal, won reversal. The state sought leave to appeal. On review, the court held that defendant proceeded at trial and on appeal solely on the theory of insanity. His objections did not preserve his right to now raise the defense of involuntary conduct. Failure to sua sponte instruct the jury on involuntary conduct did not deprive defendant of full and fair consideration as to his volitional capacity. Omission of such instruction was not substantial error requiring reversal. The verdict forms did not confuse the jury or prejudice defendant, there was no denial of equal protection, and defendant was not entitled to elect sentencing under a new act.</SPAN></P>

The circuit court asserted jurisdiction on the ground that &sect; 2 of the Act was unconstitutional and ordered temporary support.

The court held that the statutory scheme did not discriminate against the wife in defiance of equal protection because the Act required filing the action in the county where the defendant spouse resided whether the complaint was brought by the husband or by the wife. The wife's filing of an amended petition under the new law did not cure the error because the venue provisions of the Act were mandatory and jurisdictional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, transsexuals undergoing psychiatric therapy in preparation for a sex-reassignment operation, were convicted of violating &sect; 192-8 by wearing clothing of the opposite sex with the intent to conceal his or her sex. The appellate court affirmed their convictions. Reversing the judgments and remanding the case for dismissal, the court found that &sect; 192-8, as applied to defendants, was unconstitutional. While the choice of appearance was not considered a &quot;fundamental&quot; right, the state's power to regulate matters pertinent to one's choice of a life-style which had not been demonstrated to be harmful to society's health, safety or welfare was restricted. Although cross-dressing was recommended as part of their preoperative therapy program and the city offered no evidence to substantiate its reasons for infringing on defendants' choice of dress under the circumstances, the court did not find the ordinance invalid on its face. However, it did find that &sect; 192-8 as applied to defendants was an unconstitutional infringement of their liberty interest because individuals contemplating such surgery were entitled to the necessary therapy to insure that their decisions were correct.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. ch. 120, para. 585 (1975).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The finance committee of the board of commissioners recommended that the tax lists be published in defendant publisher's newspaper. Plaintiffs obtained a preliminary injunction that enjoined defendants from contracting to publish the tax lists. Plaintiffs challenged the trial court's subsequent dissolution of the preliminary injunction and the finding that &sect; 104 was unconstitutional. On appeal, the trial court vacated the order dissolving the injunction and remanded. Section 104 in no manner limited a publisher's right to publish the tax lists; it merely prescribed certain qualifications to be met in order for a publisher to be eligible to publish them for compensation. The First Amendment prohibition of the abridgement of freedom of the press was not implicated, and the provisions of &sect; 104 fell within the permissible bounds of time, place and manner restrictions on commercial speech. Also, there was no equal protection violation. Simultaneous circulation of defendant publisher's newspapers in the townships involved did not make them newspapers published within the township within the contemplation of &sect; 104. Defendant publisher was not eligible to be compensated under &sect; 104.</SPAN></P>

The circuit court also held that &sect;&sect; 2-2(b) and 2-3(d) of the Juvenile Court Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 37, paras. 702-2 and 702-3 (1975), were unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After she repeatedly ran away from home, a 14 year old juvenile was adjudged to be a minor otherwise in need of supervision and she was placed in a children's home. When the juvenile left the home without leave, the circuit court entered another order saying that any further unauthorized leave would result in a finding of contempt. When she left the home again, a show cause petition was filed. When the juvenile sought to dismiss the petition, the circuit not only found her in contempt but ruled that &sect;&sect; 2-2(b) and 2-3(d) of the Juvenile Court Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 37, paras. 702-2, 702-3 (1975), were unconstitutional. The court affirmed in part and reversed in part. The court held that the revised portions of the Juvenile Court Act, which allowed a finding of delinquency only on a finding of a violation of law, did not remove a court's inherent power of contempt. Therefore, the contempt finding was affirmed. However, the statute did prevent a court from finding a juvenile to be delinquent just because the juvenile had disobeyed the court's order. Further, the statutes in question were not unconstitutional, as they did not infringe on the court's inherent power.</SPAN></P>

The court held that an attorney was not entitled to be automatically protected from the future use of testimony given by him in a disciplinary proceeding. The court held that such protection should be afforded only where testimony had been given after respondent's assertion of a valid Fifth Amendment privilege and the court's resulting grant of immunity from the future use of that testimony or its fruits in criminal proceedings. The court held that if the testimony would incriminate the attorney, the attorney could refuse to speak and that a grant of immunity from further use of the testimony could be sought from the court should the Administrator deem the testimony essential.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's judgment. The court found that the property owner had not sustained his burden of showing that the ordinance was invalid, unauthorized, or unconstitutional. The court held that the language of Ill. Const. of 1970, art. VII, &sect; 6(m) was to be construed liberally and that the power of the city to establish the special service area was broad enough to encompass the proposed shopping mall. The court noted that the involvement of substantial assets did not prevent a mall from being a &quot;service.&quot; Further, the court noted that the fact that benefit would accrue to more than the designated area did not defeat the ordinance's validity.

The appellate court reversed the trial court's conviction of the defendant, finding that evidence discovered incident to his unlawful and warrantless arrest ought to have been suppressed. The court reversed the appellate court's decision, first finding that the arrest was not warrantless under Ill. Rev.

(2) Sections 20a -- 1 to 20a -- 3 of the Act, Ill. Rev.

The statute imposed fees for filing tax objections in counties with a population of less than 1,000,000, but imposed no fee in counties with a population of more than 1,000,000.

On appeal, defendant argued that the trial court erred in failing to follow the procedure set forth in &sect; 115-4(f), asserting that it superseded Ill. Sup. Ct. R. 234, which also related to voir dire, 58 Ill. 2d R. 234. At issue was whether Rule 234 or Ill. Code Crim. P., Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 115-4(f) (1975) regulated the method of voir dire examination of prospective jurors. The court affirmed the conviction and held that: (1) Ill. Sup. Ct. R. 234, 58 Ill. 2d R. 234, was a product of the court's supervisory and administrative responsibility; (2) the basic constitutional right to a trial by an impartial jury did not require that the parties themselves be permitted to interrogate the jurors; and (3) Ill.

The court granted the writ, holding that (1) the court had responsibility to determine whether the commission's acts were beyond its constitutional grant of authority; (2) only judicial conduct that violated the supreme court rules of judicial conduct could be the subject of a complaint before the commission; (3) the commission exceeded its authority because it applied its own contrary interpretation and construction of Ill.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State appealed a judgment of the Circuit Court of Kane County (Illinois), which granted appellee plumber's motion to dismiss the State's complaint against the plumber for violating the Plumbing License Law under Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 111 1/2, para 116.36 (1973) by installing plumbing pipe and fixtures without a license. The plumber asserted that the provisions of the Act that prevented him from taking the licensing exam were unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with the criminal offense of engaging in the plumbing trade without a license. Defendant moved to dismiss the complaint, arguing that the requirement of a 5-year apprenticeship or completion of an approved course of study was an arbitrary obstruction to the taking of the examination and bore no reasonable relation to the protection of public health. The trial court granted defendant's motion and held the statutory prerequisites for the taking of the licensing examination unconstitutional. On appeal, the court held that the requirement in the educational alternative that one enroll in a course of study equal to the time required and curricula offered by the University of Illinois lacked the specificity contemplated by the legislature when it authorized the Director to prescribe rules regarding the details of the Act's educational alternative. In light of the deficiencies in the statute, the alternative to apprenticeship that the Act purported to create was illusory. Unless properly implemented the education alternative preserved the seeds of the same monopolistic practices previously condemned in the apprentice program.</SPAN></P>

The court found that motion pictures were within the scope of protection of the free speech and press guarantees of the First and Fourteenth amendments. The court then found that &sect; 101-5 was unconstitutional because it contained no standards, and therefore, the exercise of a constitutional right was dependent upon the unfettered discretion or whim of the mayor.

Const. art. II, &sect; 1.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state legislature granted the director of insurance authority to establish a standard policy form for fire and lightning insurance. That form contained a 12-month limitations period. Defendant insurers raised this clause as an affirmative defense in plaintiffs' actions. The trial court held that the clause was invalid because it violated the separation of powers mandated by Ill. Const. art. II, &sect; 1. Defendant insurers brought interlocutory appeals which were consolidated. The court reversed and remanded the cases, holding that the limitations period was a valid delegation of legislative power. The court rejected the legislative vs. administrative distinction in favor of an analysis of the power to promulgate regulations pursuant to a comprehensive regulatory statute. The court said that the legislature, in delegating its authority, must provide sufficient identification of the persons and activities potentially subject to regulation; the harm sought to be prevented, and the general means intended to be available to the administrator to prevent the identified harm.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. ch. 114 1/2, para. 101 et seq. (1975). The court held that through the Act, the General Assembly determined that the state had the exclusive power to regulate the licensing of real estate brokers and salesmen. The court stated that para. 124 only reserved to municipalities the power to enact and enforce antidiscrimination ordinances, and that such laws could be enforced without the power to license the real estate brokers and salesmen. The court also found that the municipalities did not have the power to license brokers pursuant to the general licensing section of the Illinois Municipal Code, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 24, para. 11-42-1 (1975). The court stated that the term &quot;brokers&quot; in para. 11-42-1 did not serve to repeal the Act.</SPAN></P>

Appellee creditor filed a complaint against appellee former fireman to enforce a judgment note. The former fireman received benefits from the board. Judgment was confessed on the note, and the judgment was confirmed. The creditor caused a wage deduction summons to be issued against the board. The board filed a motion to dismiss asserting the statutory exemption from attachment. The circuit court denied the motion and held para. 6--213 unconstitutional. The board appealed. On appeal, the court held that the legislative classification created by para. 6--213 could not be considered arbitrary or unreasonable merely because private pensioners did not enjoy the same immunity. Further, para. 6--213 did not contravene the dictates of equal protection of the law under either the constitution of Illinois or the constitution of the United States. In addition,.

Rev. Stat. ch. 111 2/3, para. 341 (1973), unconstitutional in the personal injury actions brought by appellee victims. The court allowed a motion to directly take the interlocutory appeal that had been granted to the CTA.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The CTA operated mass transit systems in and around the City of Chicago. Section 41 of the Transit Act required the presentation of claims within six months of the incident. That provision also provided a one-year limitations period for actions against the CTA. By comparison, provisions of the Local Governmental and Governmental Employees Tort Immunity Act (Tort Immunity Act), Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 85, paras. 8-101--8-102 (1973), provided time periods of one and two years. The victims challenged the constitutionality of &sect; 41 in their actions against the CTA for that reason. The trial court declared &sect; 41 unconstitutional. On appeal, that judgment was reversed. The matter was remanded. While the Tort Immunity Act provided for longer time periods, that fact, by itself, did not render &sect; 41 of the Transit Act unconstitutional. Given that the sole purpose of the CTA was to operate mass transit systems, it performed a unique governmental function that could not be compared to the traditional functions of local governments. Therefore, there was a rational basis for providing shorter limitations periods. As a result, &sect; 41 of the Transit Act did not violate equal protection standards.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff food stamp recipients challenged a decision of defendant Illinois Department of Public Aid (IDPA), which increased the price of their food stamps. The Circuit Court of Vermilion County (Illinois) held in favor of the recipients, finding that the increase violated &sect; 2019(d) of the Food Stamp Act of 1964, 7 U.S.C.S. &sect; 2011 et seq., and that Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 23, par. 11 -- 8.7)(1975) and 7 U.S.C.S. &sect; 2022 were unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Aid to Families with Dependent Children program (AFDC), 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 601 et seq., exempted a portion of earned income in determining the amount of aid. However, the Food Stamp Act of 1964, 7 U.S.C.S. &sect; 2011 et seq., did not exempt any earned income. On appeal, the recipients asserted that AFDC exempt income should be disregarded in computing the cost of food stamps. They claimed that its inclusion decreased AFDC aid, thus, violating 7 U.S.C.S. &sect; 2019(d). The court reversed, holding that a reduction in AFDC aid due to an increase in food stamp price was not a decrease of a welfare grant under 7 U.S.C.S. &sect; 2019(d). The state properly made no distinction between food stamp recipients and nonrecipients. The court declined to add to the Food Stamp program an incentive for employment not included by Congress. The court also reversed the trial court's finding that Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 23, par. 11 -- 8.7 (1975) and 7 U.S.C.S. &sect; 2022 were unconstitutional. Those sections did not deny recipients the right of judicial review.

The court reviewed the records in the federal and state trials, and the records were practically alike as far as the evidence presented was concerned. Indeed, it could have been said that the two records excepting, of course, proof of use of the mails, were nearly interchangeable, even as to the reputation witnesses called by defendant. With a few minor exceptions, the testimony was the same. Viewing the question realistically and set in a practical frame, that court considered that the questions were the same. The controlling fact or question in both prosecutions was whether defendant had an intent to commit a fraud. The verdict of acquittal in the federal prosecution resolved this factual question in favor of defendant, and his conviction under the state prosecution required that the same factual question to be resolved in favor of the prosecution. Thus, relitigating this factual question was violative of the doctrine of collateral estoppel. According, the court reversed the judgment of conviction.</SPAN></P>

The circuit court dismissed the action, the appellate court affirmed, and the taxpayer appealed. The court affirmed, holding that although the taxpayer had not exhausted its administrative remedies, it would consider the merits. The court found that Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 120, para. 3 -- 304(a)(3)(B) did not make a &quot;drop-shipment&quot; sale, where both the origin and destination of the sale were outside the state and the taxpayer was not taxable in either of those states, a sale &quot;within Illinois.&quot; The court found that the General Assembly failed to take into account this type of sale, and there was a gap in &sect; 304(a)(3)(B). The court held that the supplier's selection of an out-of-state inventory from which to make shipment to an out-of-state customer did not of itself show insufficient nexus to render those sales includable, and it followed that the supplier's selection of Illinois as the place from which to make shipment did not of itself show insufficient nexus.</SPAN></P>

He moved to dismiss the action against him, alleging that the substance he was charged with illegally prescribing, diethylpropion, was not among the substances enumerated in the Act on the date of his alleged violation. The trial court dismissed the complaint, holding that the rule promulgated by the director of law enforcement adding diethylpropion to the schedule was not valid until approved by the state legislature. The court affirmed. The court first rejected the trial court's rationale, however, holding that the legislature properly delegated to the director the authority to add substances and that it had provided intelligible standards to guide the exercise of this discretion. However, defendant could not be convicted because &sect; 201 of the Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 56 1/2, para. 1201 (1973) was invalid for failing to require due notice prior to effect being given any rule which the director might issue under the delegated authority of the Act.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When plaintiff was an adolescent, defendants gave her a blood transfusion with blood that was incompatible with her own. As a result of the transfusion, plaintiff's minor child was born premature and had a variety of health problems. Plaintiff sued defendants on behalf of herself and her minor child. The trial court dismissed the action on behalf of the minor child. The appellate court reinstated the claim. Defendants sought further review. The court affirmed the reinstatement of plaintiff's claim on behalf of the minor child because the fetus did not have to be viable at the time prenatal injuries were sustained to support an action for those injuries. Further, as the risk of harm to the child was reasonably foreseeable, the delay between defendants' acts and the injury to plaintiff's minor child did not bar the action. Finally, defendants could be held liable to a person whose existence was not apparent at the time of their acts; therefore, relief was not barred simply because the child was not conceived at the time of defendants' negligent actions.</SPAN></P>

Defendant died while the appeal was pending, and her estate was substituted for her.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that the statutory cost pattern was unconstitutionally vague on its face and that the manner in which it was applied and enforced violated the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment in that it created three separate classifications of burdened individuals. Further, defendant claimed that failing to provide a hearing before imposing the costs violated procedural due process guarantees. Briefs were filed by amici curiae. The trial court held that the statutory cost scheme was unconstitutional and entered an order requiring that the bail security that was deposited be refunded to defendant. In reversing the decision, the court held that the method selected by the legislature for recouping the costs of administering the criminal justice system was not unconstitutional and that there was nothing in the statute that served to deny procedural due process. Defendant had the opportunity and did object to the People's motion at trial. Finally, the court held that the cost statutes were not invalid by reason of the manner in which they were applied. The record did not show that the statutes were unconstitutionally applied to defendant.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The citizen filed a complaint that challenged the constitutionality of bonding and finance provisions of the Regional Transportation Authority (RTA) under Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 111 2/3, para. 701.01 et seq. (1975) and a related provision which allocated to the RTA a portion of vehicle registration fees pursuant to Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 95 1/2, para. 2-119(d) (1975). The trial court granted the RTA's motion to strike and dismissed the citizen's complaint. On appeal, the court affirmed the decision of the trial court. The court held that bonding and finance provisions at issue did not create &quot;state debt&quot; under Ill. Const. art. IX, &sect; 9(a) because &quot;state debt&quot; did not include bonds or other evidences of indebtedness incurred by units of local government. The court determined that the laws did not constitute an unconstitutional delegation of power to the RTA.

Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 26-1(a)(2) (1973). The trial court granted defendants' motions to dismiss on the grounds that &sect; 26-1(a)(2) was unconstitutional. The state argued that the statute was not overly broad in that it merely regulated conduct and did not deprive citizens of their U.S. Const. amend. I freedoms. Defendants claimed that the statute deprived them of first amendment freedoms and made criminal otherwise protected conduct. The supreme court held that the legislature could not abridge one's first amendment freedoms merely to avoid slight annoyances caused to others. Section 26-1(a)(2), by its very terms, proscribed any call made with the intent to annoy, regardless of its purpose or nature. Such an unlimited intrusion on first amendment freedom was not permitted. The court concluded that &sect; 26-1(a)(2) made criminal conduct that was protected by the U.S. Const. amend. I, XIV and was therefore overly broad.</SPAN></P>

Defendant appealed and the appellate court reversed her conviction finding that the Code was not applicable to defendant because the action against her began before the effective date of the Code. On appeal, the court affirmed the appellate court's reversal of defendant's conviction and remanded the action for a new trial. The court disagreed with the appellate court that the Code did not apply, because the facts which gave rise to defendant's fitness hearing were not presented until after the effective date of the Code. However, the court determined that the Code's modification of the burden of proof in a fitness hearing to the extent that it placed on defendant the ultimate burden of proving her unfitness to stand trial was unconstitutional.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city adopted a canvassing formula, which allowed the city's purchasing agent to reduce a bid by a limited amount determined by the percentage of total hours minority workmen would have been employed on the project; thus, the recipient need not have actually been the lowest responsible bidder as required by the statute. The association filed suit and requested declaratory judgment. Finding no genuine, disputed issue of fact, the circuit court entered an order of summary judgment in favor of the association and found that the canvassing formula was invalid. The city appealed. The court found that there were two main requirements for standing to bring an action for declaratory relief. There had to be an actual controversy and the party seeking the declaration had to be interested in the controversy. The court held that the association's representational capacity alone was not enough to give it standing, absent a showing that it had a recognizable interest in the dispute, peculiar to itself and capable of being affected. Because the association did not show that it had a direct interest in the action, the association could not have maintained an action for declaratory relief.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The predecessor railroad received a special tax rate (rate) under its charter, codified at Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 102, para. 373, 374 (1975). The railroad bought the predecessor railroad's assets and used the rate. The court affirmed the decision that the railroad was unable to use the rate. The court held that the taxpayer had standing under the Act to bring the lawsuit. The amount of money spent to collect the tax was irrelevant where the taxpayer was injured by the misapplication of the funds. Under 49 U.S.C.S. &sect; 5, the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) approved the transaction between the railroads because the public interest was met. Because the state was unable to interfere with the ICC's jurisdiction and the ICC made no findings about the transfer of the rate, the purchase did not include the rate. Because the charter did not state that the rate was transferable and there was no law that transferred the rate, the rate was not transferable. The predecessor railroad was dissolved. The court modified the amount of the taxes owed to the difference between what was paid and what was owed and ordered that the tax be calculated based on each county the railroad owned property.</SPAN></P>

There was evidence that the teacher's complained-of conduct extended over a period of four school years despite numerous parental complaints culminating in discussions between the teacher and her superiors concerning her conduct.

The court then held that para. 70-51(d)(2) was not unconstitutional. The complaints charged that defendants solicited an owner of residential property after the owner had notified defendants in writing that he did not desire to sell or list his property. The court noted that the United States Supreme Court had rejected the notion that a vendor had a constitutional right to send unwanted material into the home of another. The court also found para. 70-51(d)(2) was not fatally vague because it gave defendants a fair warning and clearly set forth the prohibited conduct.</SPAN></P>

Stat. ch. 23, para. 4--1.3 and all regulations promulgated by the department thereto were invalid and unenforceable because they violated 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 602(a)(8)(A)(ii), awarded appellee benefits recipient $ 1,662, and held that the recipient was entitled to benefits in the future.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The benefits recipient filed a claim with the department for medical assistance under the state's Aid to Families With Dependent Children Related (AFDC) program. Her claim was denied on the grounds that she was ineligible for medical assistance because her husband had a full-time job and her children were not dependent within the meaning of Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 23, para. 4--1.3 (1975). On appeal, the department argued that the trial court erred in reversing its denial of benefits to the recipient. Upon review, the court agreed with the department and reversed the judgment of the trial court. The unfairness of the recipient's situation resulted in large degree from the fact that her husband was employed at a very low wage rate. It was not a constitutional requirement that the programs were structured in such a manner as to remedy the problem of inadequate wages in addition to the stated goals of those programs. The record supported the decision of the department that the dependency requirement established by state and federal law and regulations was not met, for which reason the recipient was ineligible for AFDC benefits or for medical assistance.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment of the trial court, reinstated the decision of the department, and held that the recipient failed to show that her children met the dependency requirement necessary to receive benefits under the AFDC program established by state and federal law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court found Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 11-10(a), (b) (1973) unconstitutional and reversed the aggravated incest conviction. Defendant had contended that Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 11-10(a), (b) (1973), and the female counterpart, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 11-11(a) (1973) discriminated between fathers and mothers, violating Ill. Const. of 1970 art. I, &sect; 18, which assured equal protection should not be denied or abridged on account of sex. A male was guilty of aggravated incest under Ill. Rev.

Aggravated incest carried a potential 1 to 20 years in prison and incest carried a potential 1 to 10 years in prison. The appellate court affirmed the indecent liberties conviction. On further appeal, consolidating the petitions for leave to appeal, the court held Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 11-10(a), (b) (1973) constitutional based on precedent and reversed in part the appellate court's decision in favor of the state.

The appellate court reversed the decision and remanded for a determination of defendant's eligibility under the Act. In reversing the decision and affirming the trial court's determination, the court found that the failure of defendant's probation officer to consent to treatment did not constitute an interference with judicial authority by a nonjudicial officer in violation of Ill.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The first taxpayers attacked those portions of Chicago, Ill.

The appellate court held the tax invalid. The second taxpayers challenged those provisions of the act relating to the tax on real estate transfers, alleging similar infirmities as the first taxpayers. The trial court declared the ordinance unconstitutional as applied to transfers of real property. The suits were consolidated for appeal. The court held that (1) legislative bodies had broad powers in establishing classifications defining the objects of taxation which would withstand constitutional attack so long as the classifications were reasonable, (2) the taxpayers bore the burden of proving the classifications to be unreasonable, (3) the language of Chicago, Ill. Municipal Code ch. 200.1--2(A)(5) did not create an unreasonable classification of transactions subject to tax, and (4) the complaints failed to overcome the ordinance's presumption of constitutionality.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was originally charged with the offense of theft and released on bail. After several court appearances and continuances, the case was set for trial. When defendant failed to appear in court, the trial court forfeited defendant's bond and issued a warrant for defendant's arrest. The trial court entered judgment on the bond forfeiture pursuant to &sect; 110-7(g) of the Code of Criminal Procedure of 1963, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 110-7(g) (1973). Defendant was subsequently charged by information with the offense of violation of bail bond. After waiving his right to a trial by jury, defendant was convicted in a bench trial. Defendant testified that he was incarcerated for all but eight days. The trial court found defendant guilty. The appellate court reversed and the court affirmed. The court held that the failure to prove that notice was sent did not preclude the State from proving that defendant acted willfully. However, the testimony of defendant tended to establish that defendant's failure to appear was not willful. Defendant's failure to surrender himself during the nine days he was released did not constitute sufficient proof that he was guilty of the offense.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. ch. 23, para. 11-21 (1975), the statute of limitations for which had run.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The indictments charged defendants with obtaining monies from the Illinois Department of Public Aid and various of its county affiliates by falsely representing that they had little or no income. In dismissing the indictments, the trial court ruled that because defendants' actions were specifically barred by &sect; 11-21 of the Illinois Public Aid Code, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 23, para. 11-21 (1975), the State was restricted to prosecuting defendants under it, and because its statute of limitations had expired, the indictments could not be maintained. In affirming the trial court, the appellate court agreed with its reasoning. However, on appeal, the court reversed the judgments of both the appellate and trial courts. In doing so, it found that the actions allegedly taken by defendants could be prosecuted under either the Public Aid Code or the statutory provision governing theft. Moreover, the State had discretion in deciding which statute to prosecute defendants under and it did not violate equal protection to charge them with the offense carrying the more severe penalty.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency and its director (EPA), sought review of a judgment from the Circuit Court of Sangamon County (Illinois), which granted summary judgment in favor of appellee, the Illinois Attorney General (attorney general), in a declaratory judgment action to enjoin the EPA from instituting and prosecuting enforcement actions before the Pollution Control Board (Board).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The EPA filed five separate enforcement complaints before the board. The attorney general sought a declaratory judgment that the attorney general was the only attorney empowered to institute and prosecute such actions on behalf of the State of Illinois (state) and sought to enjoin the EPA from instituting and prosecuting enforcement actions before the board. The circuit court held that &sect; 4(e) of the Environmental Protection Act (Act), Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 111 1/2, par. 1004(e) (1975), delegated authority to prosecute enforcement cases before the board to the EPA but that the delegation of prosecutorial authority violated the Attorney General Provision of the Illinois Constitution, Ill. Const. art. V. &sect; 15 (1970). The EPA claimed on appeal that proceedings before the board were administrative and not legal, and that it had independent authority to prosecute actions before the board based upon Ill. Const. art. XI, &sect; 1, 1970. The court rejected the EPA's claim. The court held that &sect; 4(e) was unconstitutional to the extent that it authorized the institution and prosecution of proceedings before the board by an officer other than the Illinois Attorney General.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. ch. 122, para. 1-1 et. seq. (1975) and Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 122, para. 18-12 (1975), which mandated reduced funding to appellee school board and its superintendent for not providing a school term of 185 days, was in violation of Ill. Const. art. X, &sect; 1.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When the school board did not have a full school term of 185 days due to a teacher's strike, the state superintendent of schools reduced its funding as required by Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 122, para. 1-1 et seq. (1975) and Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 122, para. 18-12 (1975). When the state superintendent submitted vouchers for the reduced amount to be prorated over three years, the state comptroller refused to pay them on the grounds that he had to prorate the funds within one year. Both the state and local school superintendents filed for declaratory and injunctive relief against the state comptroller, and the school board and its superintendent filed against the state superintendent challenging the reduced funding on the grounds that it violated Ill. Const. art. X, &sect; 1. The trial court limited its decision to declaring the laws unconstitutional. On review the court examined the legislative intent and the rules of statutory construction, and held that there was no constitutional proscription against conditioning state funding on a school district's compliance with minimum requirements. The statutes were found to be constitutional but the funds could be prorated over three years.</SPAN></P>

The trial court was directed to order appellant state comptroller to prorate the funds over three years.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Illinois general assembly passed legislation, subsequently signed by the governor, that provided for the conveyance by the state of 194.6 acres of land submerged in waters of Lake Michigan to the steel corporation.

The corporation contended that previous cases considered by the court regarding the legislation at issue operated as a bar under the doctrine of res judicata to the attorney general's challenge to the validity of the legislative action, but the court ruled that when a cause of action was dismissed on the ground that the plaintiff lacked standing, as in the earlier cases, the court need not have considered the substantive issues involved, amounting to an adjudication on the merits. The court affirmed the summary judgment for the attorney general that the legislation was void on the ground that it violated the public trust doctrine because the primary purpose was private and the public benefit was only incidental and remote.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The litigation concerned the explosion of a tank car leased by the petroleum company. Several actions were brought in relation to the explosion, and the petroleum company was added to one of them in the first county. The petroleum company then sought a declaration in the second county as to its general liability for the explosion. A counterclaim was then filed against the petroleum company in the first county.

The court affirmed the circuit court's judgment. 1975 Ill. Laws 2192 provided that real and personal property were to be assessed at 33 1/3 percent rather than 50 percent of the actual value as determined by the Department's assessment to sales ratio studies for the three most recent years that preceded the assessment year. The taxpayers challenged the three-year period that was established by &sect; 146 of the Act for implementing the Department's equalized assessed property values. Even though the taxpayers had to pay proportionately more than taxpayers in other counties to qualify for state assistance, &sect; 146, as amended, was constitutional.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The board member was notified by letter from the governor that he was being removed as a member of the State Board of Elections for negligent duty. The board member obtained a temporary injunction, and the governor appealed the interlocutory order under Ill. Sup. Ct. R. 307, 58 Ill. 2d R. 307. On appeal, the court held that it was plain that the legislators intended, and the public interest demanded, that board members not be amenable to political influence or discipline in the discharge of their official duties. The court held that to subject a neutral, bipartisan, and independent board to the unbridled whim of the governor under the rule that his power of removal was incident and co-extensive with his power of appointment would have destroyed its purpose and efficacy. The court held that the governor could have only removed a member of the board for cause and that the question of whether the board member's conduct was sufficient neglect of duty to have justified the removal was a question reviewable by the court. The court affirmed the issuance of the temporary injunction as the court held that the board member was entitled to have been heard.</SPAN></P>

The Circuit Court of Sangamon County (Illinois) granted the organization's motion for a judgment on the pleadings. The board and board member appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A third party had filed a complaint with the board against the organization. The instant action was subsequently filed to enjoin the board from proceeding with that other complaint.

V, &sect; 9(a). It was also alleged that the tie-breaker provisions of the art. 1A violated due process because it caused decisions to be made by lot or by chance. When a tie-vote occurred, the statute provided for the disqualification of one board member by lot. The court found that (1) members of the board were executive officers within the meaning of art. V, &sect; 9(a); (2) the legislative appointment of board members violated art. V, &sect; 9(a); (3) the tie-breaker provisions caused decisions to rest on an arbitrary basis and violated due process; and (4) the trial court erred by allowing the unconstitutionally selected board members to continue in office.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, Director of the Illinois Department of Revenue and others, sought review of the affirmance of the trial court's injunctive order by the Circuit Court of Cook (Illinois). Plaintiff cigarette purchaser brought this action challenging the applicability of the Illinois Cigarette Tax Act (Act), Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 120 para. 453.9c (1973), to individuals transporting cigarettes into Illinois for their own use and not for sale.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After his arrest for illegal transportation of 27 cartons of unstamped cigarettes into the state without a permit in violation of &sect; 9c of Act, the cigarette purchaser brought this class action seeking a permanent injunction against defendants from enforcing &sect; 9 and &sect; 18 of the Act against individuals transporting cigarettes into the state for their own use, and not for the sale to others. The trial court imposed an injunction against defendants, and the appellate court affirmed the trial court's order. The court reversed the judgments of the trial and appellate courts and held that the term &quot;transporter&quot; in &sect; 9c of the Act applied to all individuals carrying more than 2,000 cigarettes into the state, and not just to business engaged in the business of selling cigarettes. The court ruled that if the legislature intended to limit the &quot;transporter&quot; definition as suggested by the cigarette purchaser, it would have done so, as there were other exceptions enumerated in &sect; 9c. Moreover, the court held that there was no inconsistency between the purpose of the Act and the purpose of the Cigarette Use Tax Act.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgments of the appellate and trial courts. The court set aside the permanent injunction order of the trial court but held that it did so assuming that defendants would perform its duties consistent with the Illinois Cigarette Tax Act regarding the availability of application forms and the adoption of procedures for &quot;transporters&quot; under the Act.</SPAN></P>

The trial court granted defendant's motion to dismiss the complaint on the ground &sect; 12--1 of the Act was unconstitutional. The state appealed, and the court reversed and remanded. The trial court ruled that the statute was unconstitutionally vague because it did define &quot;placing out&quot; with sufficient specificity. When called upon to decide a vagueness question, the court assumed, absent contrary legislative intent, that the words of the statute had their ordinary and popularly understood meanings. The court conceded that the statute could have been more clearly drafted but it found no ambiguity which would cause men of ordinary understanding to guess as to the nature of the conduct it defined. It was obvious that the purpose of the statute was to prevent profiteering from the placement of children in &quot;baby markets.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In each of these actions, a vacancy was created for a county position by the death of the holder of that position. Further, in both cases, the political parties affiliated with the deceased holders and the county boards each appointed persons to fill the vacancy. At the time the appointments were made, the Election Code had been amended to provide for appointment by committees of the political party. In the Will County case, the trial court declared that the county board's appointment was invalid and commanded the county board to appoint the political party's appointee. In the Rock Island County case, the trial court ruled in favor of that county board's appointee and declared the appointment of the ousted appointee invalid. All parties appealed, and the court reversed and remanded as to the Will County case and affirmed as to the Rock Island County case. The power to appoint public officers was the sovereign power of the state and could not be conferred upon a private person or group but had to be delegated, if at all, to some public agency. Therefore, the amendment vesting power to make appointments in the political parties was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the constitutional provision reflected a determination by the framers of the Constitution that the collection of taxes by county officers was a county function that was to be supported by county taxes and not fees.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The town adopted an ordnance that assessed a tax of 10 cents per person attending or witnessing thoroughbred or harness race meets conducted by the racing associations at a track within the town's boundaries. The state legislature subsequently adopted a statute that expressly permitted such an ordnance. The racing associations appealed from the trial court's grant of summary judgment to the town. The court affirmed. The court determined that Ill. Const. art. VII, &sect; 6(a) (1970) granted the town, as a home rule entity, extremely broad taxing authority. The court also determined that the state had not acted, pursuant to Ill. Const. art. VII, &sect; 6(g), (h) (1970) to limit this authority. As a result, the court found that the ordnance was a valid exercise of the town's taxing authority. Additionally, the court found that the tax was not an occupation tax, which the town had only a limited authority to impose under Ill. Const. art. VII, &sect; 6(e) (1970).</SPAN></P>

Based upon legal advice from the Illinois Attorney General, defendants began arresting individuals who transported into Illinois more than 30 cartons of different brands.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant Illinois Community College Board sought review of a judgment from the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois), which found in favor of plaintiff residents in their declaratory judgment action and determined that &sect; 6-6.1 of the Public Community College Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 122, para. 1-6-6.1 (1973), was unconstitutional and enjoined the Board from organizing a new school district.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The residents lived in areas that the Board proposed to include when forming a new community college district. The court reversed the circuit court's judgment that declared &sect; 6-6.1 of the Act unconstitutional. Section 6-6.1 of the Act (former Act) provided that the Board was authorized to either establish new districts or to annex to an adjacent district each parcel of territory that was not a part of a district. In the case of annexation, the voters of a territory could have petitioned for a referendum; however, there was no provision for a referendum when new districts were established. Subsequent to the appeal, &sect; 6-6.1 of the Act (new Act) was amended to provided for a referendum when new districts were created and the residents voted against the new district. However, the issue was not moot because the new &sect; 6.6.1 of the Act was not an amendment, but was a reenactment of the former section. The former &sect; 6-6.1 did not deprive the residents of the equal protection of the law. The State's interest in education was so pervasive that it was allowed to establish or alter school districts without any local referendum.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the circuit court's judgment, vacated the injunction, and remanded the action to the circuit court to determine if the referendum under the new &sect; 6-6.1 was valid.</SPAN></P>

On appeal the issue was whether the corporation's allegation of double jeopardy, or alternatively, res judicata, invoked an additional exception to the requirement that administrative remedies be exhausted prior to seeking judicial relief. The court reversed, holding that the corporation sought review of an unappealable interlocutory order by the board and that the complaint failed to state facts which warranted an exception to the exhaustion doctrine.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The village enacted an amusement tax on the gross receipts of indoor tennis facilities. The tennis club asserted that Illinois Municipal Code &sect; 11-42-5, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 24, para. 11-42-5 (1973), did not empower the village to regulate tennis and that it was, therefore, without authority to tax it. The tennis club further argued that the ordinance created an unreasonable classification in violation of the state and federal equal protection clauses. The circuit court held in favor of the tennis club but the appellate court reversed. On further appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that the power to regulate and the power to raise revenue were separate and distinct and that neither was dependent on the other. Because the ordinance at issue was a revenue measure, the court held that it did not need to consider whether tennis was subject to the police power. The court then held that the term &quot;amusement,&quot; under &sect; 11-42-5, included participative as well as exhibitive amusements and, therefore, the village had the authority to tax indoor tennis under the statute. The court finally ruled that the club lacked standing to raised any constitutional issues regarding equal protection.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant members of the Liquor Control Commission (commission) appealed the decision of the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois), which enjoined the enforcement of &sect; 12a of article VI of &quot;An Act Relating to Alcoholic Liquors&quot; (Liquor Control Act), Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 43, para. 132 (1973) and held that &sect; 12a unconstitutionally abridged the rights of plaintiff liquor licensees to make political contributions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The licensees made political campaign contributions, and the commission charged them with violating &sect; 12a. None of the plaintiffs were employees or agents of the licensees. The lower court found that the restrictions contained in &sect; 12a violated the First and Fourteenth amendments of the Constitution of the United States and Ill. Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 1, 2, 4 (1970). The court reversed, holding that no constitutional rights of the licensees had been violated. The First Amendment rights of the licensees were not violated because the state had a substantial interest in regulating liquor which overrode the marginal interest of the licensees in making campaign contributions. The court ruled that the licensees lacked standing to contend that the Liquor Control Act was overbroad by preventing contributions by employees or agents of licensees because no employees or agents were parties to the appeal. The court held that &sect; 12a did not create an arbitrary classification in violation of the licensees' equal protection rights because there were substantial differences between the liquor licensees and other licensees which justified the different treatment of the different classes of licensees.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city sought an injunction restraining the house from housing any persons suffering from mental retardation or mental disorders. The city alleged that the house violated a special use permit condition and refused to renew its license. The condition was that persons suffering from mental retardation or mental disorders apt to make them a burden to the other residents or to the surrounding neighborhood shall not be permitted to reside in the sheltered care facility. The trial court granted the house's motion for judgment at the close of the city's case. On appeal, the court affirmed in part and reversed in part. The court reversed the trial court's determination that the ordinance was unconstitutional but affirmed the decision in all other respects. The court found that its reading of the ordinance demonstrated that the ordinance was not vague. The ordinance was not arbitrary, unreasonable, or lacking substantial relation to the public health and safety. However, the court noted that the condition indicated that not all persons suffering mental disorders were barred from the house. The court held that the evidence demonstrated that house met the condition.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a consolidated action, appellants, Director of Insurance, a medical society, and a physician, sought review of a judgment by the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois), which held invalid Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 73, para. 1013a (1975). Appellants, a hospital and a physician, sought review of the circuit court's judgment that held invalid Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 110, paras. 58.2-58.10 (1975) and Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 70, para. 101 (1975).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 73, para. 1013a (1975) was a provision of the Illinois Insurance Code (Insurance provision). Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 110, paras. 58.2-58.10 (1975) were provisions of the Civil Practice Act (Civil Practice provisions), and Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 70, para. 101 (1975) was a provision of the Public Act (Public Act provision). The court held that under the Civil Practice provisions, the physician and lawyer members of the medical review panel were empowered to make conclusions of law and fact according to the applicable substantive law over the dissent of the circuit judge. Thus, the nonjudicial members of the medical review panel were empowered to exercise a judicial function in violation of the Illinois Constitution. Because these statutes providing for medical review panels were unconstitutional, the procedure prescribed therein as the prerequisite to jury trial was an impermissible restriction on the right of trial by jury. The court also held that the Public Act provision limiting recovery only in medical malpractice actions to $ 500,000 was arbitrary and constituted a special law, as did the Insurance provision, and were in violation of the 1970 Illinois Constitution.</SPAN></P>

Further information was disclosed in answers to interrogatories. The court held that the claimed deficiency in the notice did not warrant dismissal of the woman's complaint. The court concluded that &sect; 8-102 prescribed no minimum period by which the service of notice was required to antedate commencement of the action. The filing of a complaint within the six-month period afforded as much time to investigate the claim as if the notice had been filed within that period and cured the defect in the notice.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State sought review of a decision of the Appellate Court for the Fourth District (Illinois), which held that the penalty provision of the aggravated incest statute, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 11-10 (1973), was unconstitutional. The appellate court affirmed defendant's conviction for aggravated incest but remanded the case with instructions that defendant be resentenced for a Class 3 felony.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The issue before the court was the constitutionality of the aggravated incest statute. Defendant could have been sentenced from one to 20 years in the penitentiary. He argued that males charged with the offense of aggravated incest were discriminated against on the basis of their sex because females guilty of the same conduct faced possible punishment of from one to 10 years in the penitentiary. The court held that the State demonstrated an interest which justified the classification at issue. The court found that a female victim of a father-daughter incestuous relationship was exposed to potential harm to which male victims of incestuous relationships were not exposed. The possibility that the female victim could become pregnant added considerably to the potential harm that could result. The physical change in a female who became pregnant could be a source of trauma to the female. The court found that the physical and psychological dangers of incest were greater when the offense was committed by a male and the victim was his daughter. The court held that the State's interest in protecting potential victims of incestuous relationships justified the statutory classification.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, defendant alleged that para. 11-20 was unconstitutional and that the magazines in question were constitutionally protected. The court affirmed defendant's conviction. The court held that para. 11-20 was sufficiently clear to withstand constitutional objections because it adequately defined the type of sexual conduct that could be depicted. Also, although contemporary community standards were relevant in determining whether the publications were obscene, they bore no relevance to the questions of how or to whom obscene materials could be distributed. It was within the police power of Illinois to make the commercial distribution of obscene materials a crime. Therefore, the sale of obscene materials was a crime in Illinois even though the publications were not forced upon unwilling audiences or made available to minors. Further, the publications were not protected by the First Amendment or Ill. Const. art. I, &sect; 4. The publications depicted, in a patently offensive way, sexual conduct defined by para. 11-20.</SPAN></P>

Defendants assessed taxes against the lessor for the use of the leased equipment pursuant to the Illinois Use Tax Act (Act), which the lessor paid under protest.

The lessor also sought an injunction prohibiting defendants from assessing a use tax on the property leased to nonprofit institutions. The parties filed motions for summary judgment.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, the Superintendent of the Illinois State Fair Agency, challenged a judgment from the Circuit Court, in Sangamon County (Illinois), which upheld the constitutionality of the State Fair Board Act, 1975 Ill.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Superintendent's contention was that the State Fair Board Act, 1975 Ill. Laws 79-1129, establishing a 15-member State Fair Board to replace the former State Fair Agency, violated the provisions of Ill. Const. art. V, &sect; 9(a), which stated in part that the general assembly should have no power to elect or appoint officers of the executive branch. The Comptroller contended that the Act was constitutional because the interim board members did not hold an &quot;office&quot; because of the temporary nature of their positions. The court agreed that the Act was unconstitutional. The only temporary aspect to the positions under consideration was the tenure of the interim board members. The position itself was intended to be permanent and the duties of the Board were intended to be continuing duties. The fact that some incidental duties of the Board would cease in 1978 did not affect the continuing nature of the Board's primary duties. And the fact that all of the interim office holders would be replaced by permanent members of the Board by 1978 did not alter the permanent nature of the office itself. These were officers of the Executive Branch within the proscriptions of &sect; 9(a).</SPAN></P>

The court of appeals affirmed the trial court's judgment in each case. The court affirmed the decision affirming the directed verdict for the school board and the teacher and reversed the decision affirming the judgment for the student. The court held that, under Ill.

The State appealed to the same circuit court that issued the assessment pursuant to &sect; 11 of the Act, and the circuit court affirmed the order. The appellate court reversed the circuit court's decision on the basis that &sect; 11 of the Act was unconstitutional. Section 11 of the Act provided that a circuit court that was designated by the chief judge was empowered to assess the cash value of all estates that were subject to the inheritance tax. An appeal of the assessment was to be filed in the circuit court of the proper county. Section 11 did not violate the separation of powers doctrine because Ill. Const. of 1970, Trans. Schedule &sect; 4(d) allowed the circuit courts to exercise non-judicial functions. An assessment order was not considered a final judgment, but an administrative order. The term &quot;appeal&quot; that was used in &sect; 11 of the Act was construed to mean the judicial review of an administrative action.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Sangamon defendant was indicted under the Cannabis Control Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 56 1/2, para. 701 et seq.

Stat. ch. 56 1/2, para. 1100 et seq. (1973), charging him with delivery of 200 or more grams of a controlled substance. The trial courts dismissed the indictments against defendants, holding that the graduated penalty provisions of the respective acts potentially punished defendants for the weight of innocuous substances and therefore were unconstitutional. On appeal, the court reversed the judgments of the trial courts and remanded with instructions to reinstate the indictments. The classifications under the respective acts had a reasonable basis and, therefore, they did not violate the Due Process or Equal Protection Clauses of the United States or Illinois Constitutions. The Illinois legislature could have believed that a drug was more dangerous if it was mixed with an innocuous substance because it could be delivered to more people.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mothers contended that Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 106 3/4, para. 54 (1973), denied an illegitimate child equal protection as his right of support from his natural father was conditioned on establishing paternity within two years, absent formal acknowledgment, while a legitimate child's support right was not so conditioned. They urged that para. 54 denied both equal protection and due process to the illegitimate child because his support right could be terminated for conditions over which he had no control. They argued that para. 54 did not authorize a child to bring an action himself, by next friend or guardian; nor did it specifically authorize a state's attorney to file an action on his own initiative. The court held that Illinois had a legitimate interest in preventing the litigation of stale or fraudulent claims and a paternity action had to be brought within two years of the most recent statement or significant contribution. The fathers urged dismissal of the actions because they were not brought in the name of the state or controlled by public prosecutors. The court held that private prosecution of a paternity suit did not violate due process.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The members of the State Board of Elections were directed to certify the candidates for nomination for elective offices in the order in which nominating petitions were filed pursuant to Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 46, para. 7-14. In connection with this legal duty, the members adopted a regulation prescribing a lottery system to determine the order in which simultaneously filed petitions were deemed to have been filed. The lottery system allowed that candidates filing a group petition for the same office were treated as one for purposes of the order. The candidates had each filed individual nominating petitions simultaneously on the first day of filing, and later successfully challenged the constitutionality of the lottery system in the circuit court. The court ruled that regulation had not purposefully discriminated against individual candidates because its application with respect to any particular office always depended upon the number of vacancies to be filled, and the number of candidates filing individual or group petitions. Furthermore, there was no evidence that where a candidate was placed on the ballot effected the number of votes he or she received.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. ch. 95 1/2, para. 11-501.1(d), of the Illinois Vehicle Code.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In each instance defendants filed a motion to dismiss the proceeding on the ground that &sect; 11-501.1(d) was unconstitutional for the reason that it violated Ill.

Defendants argued that the Illinois Secretary of State, as an executive officer, was vested with the power to suspend drivers' licenses, and the statute in question attempted to take that power from the Secretary and delegate it to the judiciary. The people contended that the statute did not violate Ill. Const. art. II, &sect; 1. On appeal, the court reversed, holding that: (1) the doctrine of separation of powers did not inexorably preclude one of the three departments of government from exercising powers which could also be given to another department; (2) the statute was explicit that if the circuit court found that a person refused to submit to the required test requested by an officer, the Secretary should thereupon suspend the license; and (3) the court did not agree with defendants that the statute delegated to the judiciary either the power to suspend licenses or the discretion to determine whether such licenses should be suspended.</SPAN></P>

On defendant's appeal of his post-conviction petition dismissal, he abandoned the issues initially raised and challenged the constitutionality of the aggravated incest statute, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 11--1038 (1969), on the basis that the statute denied him equal protection of the law under the Illinois Constitution of 1970 and the Fourteenth Amendment because the statute applied to males only. The appellate court held that defendant waived the issue of the statute's constitutionality by failing to raise it at his trial or in his post-conviction petition. The court affirmed the lower courts and held that the aggravated incest statute was not unconstitutional as applied to defendant. Defendant's conviction was final prior to the effective date of the 1970 Illinois Constitution. The classification distinction between the aggravated incest statute and the incest statute was justified because of the potentially more serious consequences of pregnancy as a result of incest for a daughter as opposed to a son. The statutory classification was not arbitrary or unreasonable.</SPAN></P>

The complaint alleged the corporation was engaged in the business of buying and selling real estate without a valid certification as a broker by the Department. The corporation answered, stating it was engaged in the business of obtaining certificates of purchase from tax sales issued pursuant to the requirements of the Revenue Act. The corporation stated it sold the certificates to third parties, surrendered the certificate if redemption was made, or took some other course of action. The Department argued the corporation's activities brought it within the purview of the Act. The court held a certificate of purchase for delinquent real estate was not an interest in real estate. The court held the corporation's acquisition of certificates of purchase was not within the definition of real estate contained in the Act. The court held the corporation was not engaged in buying and selling real estate within the meaning of the 1973 statute at the time the Department sought injunctive relief.</SPAN></P>

After the litigants were acquitted by a jury they requested the clerk return the full amount each had deposited. The clerk retained 10 percent of the bond deposit as authorized by &sect; 110-7(f). In November 1969, the litigants filed their complaint against defendants, the clerk of the trial court and the county treasurer.

The trial court stayed proceeding pending the determination of the court of another case challenging the constitutionality of the same administrative cost provision. The provision was found to be constitutional. The trial court dismissed the complaint. The court affirmed, holding that under &sect; 110, codified at Ill. Rev.

The court considered the issue of whether the rules of a national political party must have been accorded primacy over nonconforming state law. The court found that the record contained factual questions for which resolution was necessary to determine the chairman's entitlement to relief, and not questions of law.

On appeal the court affirmed, holding that: (1) the standard of proof required for commitment under the Act was proof beyond a reasonable doubt because the requirements of due process mandated that the drastic impairment of the liberty and reputation of an individual which resulted from civil commitment needed to be justified by proof beyond a reasonable doubt; (2) the Act did not violate the constitutional requirement of equal protection of the law because defendant failed to show how a classification based on these factors is unreasonable; and (3) the Act was not unconstitutionally void for vagueness because sufficient objective criteria existed in the Act to meet constitutional requirements.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court reversed the conviction for the remaining two counts of armed robbery because the offenses arose from the same course of conduct. The appellate court refused to reduce the consecutive sentence that had been entered by the trial court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After defendant's conviction, the trial court imposed a sentence of 10 to 30 years in the penitentiary, which was to be served consecutively to any and all sentences heretofore imposed. Defendant had been previously convicted of an unrelated armed robbery and had been sentenced to 12 to 20 years. The sole issue on appeal was the propriety of the consecutive sentence under &sect; 5-8-4, codified at Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 1005-8-4 (1972 Supp.), of the Unified Code of Corrections, effective January 1, 1973. Defendant argued that the aggregate minimum of his consecutive sentence, which totaled 22 years, exceeded twice the statutory minimum for armed robbery, which totaled eight years. The State argued that under the language of &sect; 5-8-4(h), codified at Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 1005-8-4(h), the limitation on the aggregate minimum of consecutive sentences set forth in &sect; 5-8-4(c) was not applicable to defendant. The court held that: (1) the portion of &sect; 5-8-4(h) upon which the State relied was violative of the equal protection clauses of the Federal and State constitutions; and (2) the portion relied upon by the State could be severed without affecting the remaining portions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff school district appealed a judgment from the Circuit Court, in Cook County (Illinois), which granted defendant State Board of Education's motion to dismiss the mandamus action filed by the school district against the State Superintendent of Public Instruction that sought to compel him to pay to the school district reimbursement for costs of transporting pupils to its schools. The Board was substituted as defendant.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The school district characterized the act of withholding transportation reimbursement as a &quot;penalty&quot; unlawfully imposed upon it by the Board for failure to furnish transportation to nonpublic school pupils or for challenging the validity of Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 122, para. 29-4 (1973), requiring it to so provide nonpublic school pupils transportation. By the petition for mandamus, the school district sought to compel reimbursement for those prior years during which it was admittedly not complying with Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 122, para. 29-4. The court affirmed the judgment because it was unable to perceive any basis in either logic or equity why the school district should be entitled to such reimbursement. In a prior suit, in sustaining the Board's power to withhold all State funds for such noncompliance, the court necessarily sustained the refusal to make specific reimbursements for which the school district had failed to qualify.

On appeal, the county superintendent and the objectors contended that the decision of the county superintendent found ample support in the record and that, in holding that it was against the manifest weight of the evidence, the circuit court erred. The court held that the county superintendent's decision was not contrary to the manifest weight of the evidence, and the judgment of the circuit court was reversed. The effect of the circuit court's decision was to hold that as only minimal detriments would affect the adjacent districts, the electorate of the proposed district, alone, should determine whether the new district should be organized. Clearly, that was not the correct standard for review of the county superintendent's decision.</SPAN></P>

Ins. Code &sect; 502.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An insurance company granted plaintiff authority to settle claims by policyholders and furnished plaintiff with books of blank drafts drawable upon the company.

The court held that the circuit court's order declaring Ill. Ins. Code &sect; 502 unconstitutional was erroneous. The court found that the actual revocation of plaintiff's license did not take place until after defendant's order, which was based upon findings made by a hearing officer as a result of a hearing. The court did not find any evidence to indicate that the hearing officer was biased or that he had any personal or pecuniary interest in the subject matter of the hearing, or that he had played a role in defendant's investigative activities, which led to the hearing.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant homeowners brought an action against respondent house builders to enjoin respondents from building a house in violation of the zoning laws.

The appellate court declared the case moot, but reversed the grant of attorney fees, and ordered that appellants pay attorney fees to respondents. On further appeal, the court reversed and remanded, holding that because the action was moot the judgment of the trial court should stand, and the appellate court should not have considered the issue of costs and attorney fees. The court also held that attorney fees could be awarded only pursuant to statute. The court found that the award of attorney fees to respondent was not justified under Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 24, para. 11-13-15 (1973), which applied only to plaintiffs, or Ill. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The general assembly passed the Private Detective Act (Act), Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 201-27 (1974), which gave the state the power to regulate the private detective business. The city established a procedure for licensing security firms in Chicago, Ill., Mun. Code ch. 117 (1974). The detectives and agencies alleged that ch. 117 was void because it directly contravened the Act. The lower court dismissed the action. The court reversed and remanded. It held that the Act stated that the power to regulate the private detective business would be exercised exclusively by the state and that it could not be exercised by any unit of local government, including home rule units. A declaration of exclusivity under Ill. Const. art. VII, &sect; 6(h) (1970) unconditionally barred a home rule unit's exercise of the affected power. The Act repealed by implication the section of the Chicago Municipal Code that authorized municipal regulation of private detectives concurrently with that by the state.</SPAN></P>

Defendants sought review and contended that the assessment procedure that was followed was not violative of statutory provisions and that the tax was valid. On appeal, the court held that the assessments were not unauthorized by law.

The tax was a reasonable means of defraying the costs incurred by local governmental units in providing certain benefits to the occupants and owners of mobile homes. Owning an occupied mobile home was a taxable privilege. The class defined in the taxing statute was reasonable and the definition of &quot;mobile home&quot; in Ill. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff taxpayer appealed an order of the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois), which dismissed the taxpayer's action for want of jurisdiction and entered judgment in favor of defendant Illinois Department of Revenue (revenue department) on its final tax assessments.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer sought judicial review of tax assessments that were made by the revenue department. The trial court dismissed the complaint due to the taxpayer's failure to provide an appeal bond. On appeal, the taxpayer contended that revenue department's hearing violated due process by denying the taxpayer's request for continuance to produce records and obtain new counsel. The court reversed the trial court's dismissal of the taxpayer's complaint and remanded the case to the revenue department for a new hearing. The court held that the revenue department abused its discretion in denying the taxpayer's request for a continuance. That was an inappropriate to sanction for the taxpayer's delay in producing its books and records. The trial court's refusal to continue the hearing also denied the taxpayer the opportunity to be represented by corporate counsel or counsel of the taxpayer's choice. Although the taxpayer's conduct was inconvenient to the revenue department, the revenue department was required to choose justice over speed. Based on the foregoing, the taxpayer was deprived of a fair and impartial hearing within the meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged by indictment with armed robbery. Following a jury trial in the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) he was convicted and sentenced to natural life imprisonment pursuant to the Habitual Criminal Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 33B-1 et seq. (1985). He appealed, and in addition to evidentiary errors, he claimed that the sentencing statutes were unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In reviewing instructions concerning the presumption of innocence and the burden of proof, the court noted that the trial judge did in fact instruct the jury at the close of the evidence and closing arguments. A generalized question to the jurors as a whole was sufficient to ensure that the venire harbored no prejudices, and no juror indicated that he or she had any reservations about following those concepts. Accordingly, the court followed the dictates of the Illinois Supreme Court and rejected defendant's argument. Convictions for felonies which were less than 10 years old were admissible for impeachment purposes. The fact that two weeks after the robbery defendant was in possession of a weapon and handcuffs identical in appearance to those used in the incident, coupled with positive identification of defendant by two witnesses, was more than sufficient to establish his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Further, any minor discrepancies in the witnesses' testimony went to the weight of the testimony as evaluated by the trier of fact. The Habitual Criminal Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 33B-1 (1981), was properly passed in accordance with the Illinois Constitution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court concluded defendant's evidentiary and constitutional claims failed, and affirmed his conviction and his sentence under the Habitual Criminal Act.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In an action in initiated by plaintiff state, defendant appealed a judgment of the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) that denied his motion to suppress his statements. Defendant also asserted that he was not proven guilty of murder beyond a reasonable doubt, and that the imposition of a life sentence violated U.S. Const. amend. VIII and U.S. Const. amend. XIV.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of two counts of murder under Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 9-1(a) (1983). The court affirmed the judgment. No mitigating circumstances allowed a penalty of less than natural life for two or more murders. The sentencing provision, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 1005-8-1(a)(1)(c) (1983), was specific and prevailed over a more general provision. No evidence was presented during trial to support defendant's contention that he could have unreasonably believed that circumstances existed that justified killing the victims. The court declined to disturb the denial of the motions to suppress because the trial judge based his decisions on matters contained in the record. The witnesses' accounts contradicted defendant's story. The finding of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt was proper when defendant brought a fully loaded weapon to the crime scene, did not try to revive the victims, and when the victims pleaded for their lives. Defendant's failure to object to the jury instruction limiting the claim of self-defense constituted a waiver. The prosecutor's remarks during closing arguments were proper because they restated the evidence or were supported by the record.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant drove off with the motor vehicle after the true owner, with whom defendant had been drinking with that day, left for a moment. The state brought a charge of possession of a stolen motor vehicle, on which defendant was found guilty. The court affirmed the conviction on appeal. The court held that the admission of statements by defendant during police questioning were harmless error because he had not invoked his post-Miranda, Fifth Amendment rights where he refused to answer a single question during police questioning, and defendant had given explanations to the police about other matters in relation to the case. The court determined that defendant's claim of ineffective assistance of counsel was properly rejected where defendant was given an opportunity to make a statement before sentencing and claimed that his attorney failed to subpoena a number of witnesses who would have corroborated his story. The court held that defendant's statement was a mere protestation, not a post-trial motion, which would have required sworn affidavits, and the circuit court properly treated it as such.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court had not given the jury the Reddick murder and manslaughter instruction charge. The jury returned a verdict of felony manslaughter, for the victim's death, which had occurred during defendant's commission of an armed robbery. Acknowledging the jury's armed robbery conviction, defendant asserted that the court had no way of knowing whether the jury found that the killing was &quot;in the course of the robbery&quot; to constitute felony murder. The court vacated the felony murder conviction. The state argued that the Reddick error was irrelevant to defendant's murder conviction because a valid conviction for armed robbery necessarily meant defendant was guilty of felony murder. The court disagreed and remanded for a new trial on the felony murder charge. The court stated that a murder conviction need not have been reversed despite the existence of a Reddick error if the error could have been deemed harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. The court found that the evidence was not overwhelming so that the jury could not have found anything but that the victim's death was caused during the course of the armed robbery. Therefore, the court held that the Reddick error was not harmless.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The bar was cited for maintaining its premises in an unclean and unsanitary manner in violation of Ill. Admin. Code tit. 11, &sect;&sect; 100.160(a), 100.290(c). The Commission entered an order imposing a fine in the amount of $ 2,000 against the bar. The bar contended that &sect; 100.160(a) violated its due process rights as it was unconstitutionally vague. The court held that the term &quot;clean and sanitary&quot; was not vague. However, nothing informed the bar the Commission would seek fines for a violation continuing after the day of the inspection. Nothing suggested the bar was charged with multiple violations of &sect; 100.290. The Commission was limited to fining the bar for those charges on which the bar had reasonable notice. The statutory limitation on the Commission's fines was $ 500 per violation pursuant to the Liquor Control Act of 1934, Ill. Rev.

In affirming the order dismissing the complaint as barred by the statute of limitations, the court held that the statute began to run when plaintiffs knew or reasonably should have known not only that an injury had occurred, but also that the injury was wrongfully caused. As allegations of pain and suffering could only involve the period prior to death, the limitation period would ordinarily begin on that date. Plaintiffs knew that the tumor had not been diagnosed prior to the death, and estoppel did not apply, for there was no reliance on defendant's conduct which caused them to forego the filing of suit. There was no fraudulent concealment, as there was no affirmative act or representation calculated to induce a claimant to delay filing a claim or keep him from discovering its existence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The husband and wife filed a complaint against the corporations that was later dismissed. Subsequently, they filed a second amended complaint. At the hearing, the corporations objected to the filing of the second amended complaint, in part because it contained &quot;scurrilous&quot; allegations that had not been raised in the original complaint. One of the allegations in this complaint supposedly tied the chairman of the board of one of the corporations to a plot to murder the husband. The trial court allowed the husband and wife to file the second amended complaint, but impounded the trial record and ordered the parties to refrain from discussing the allegations. The husband and wife argued that the order violated the free speech and due process clauses of the federal and sate constitutions.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State appealed from the Circuit Court of Ogle County (Illinois), which granted defendant's motion to bar evidence of the out-of-court statements of the three year-old victim under the hearsay exception pertaining to victims of sexual abuse under age 13, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 115 -- 10 (1987). The trial court held that the evidence was inadmissible because the victim was not unavailable to testify.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with aggravated criminal sexual assault in violation of the Criminal Code of 1961, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 12 -- 14(b)(1) (1987). Because the child would not be testifying at trial, the hearsay evidence in question was offered under the then new statutory provision applicable when the child victim was &quot;unavailable as a witness.&quot; Counsel for defendant and the State stipulated that the child was not competent to testify at trial because of her young age. The trial court held that the child's statements were not admissible under either a common-law hearsay exception or the provisions of the statutory hearsay exception because the victim's incompetence to testify was not within the meaning of the word &quot;unavailable&quot; as used in the statute. On appeal, the court reversed because a child's first accounts of an incident of sexual abuse were sometimes more reliable than later testimony given in the often intimidating courtroom setting. The court held that, if the child was unwilling or unable to testify, this would support a finding that the witness was &quot;unavailable&quot; for Sixth Amendment purposes and the confrontation guarantees of the Illinois constitution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that the trial court's ruling rested upon an incorrect interpretation of the statute. Therefore, the court reversed the trial court's order granting the motion of the defendant to exclude the out-of-court statements of the child victim and remanded for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion.</SPAN></P>

The court, however, found that the circuit court had not abused its discretion in admitting evidence of defendant's blood-alcohol content, as contended by defendant. Further, it was not an abuse of discretion to allow an expert to give an opinion based upon his investigation as to the point of impact. In addition, the circuit court had not abused its discretion regarding any procedural matters at trial. Defendant failed to establish that his attorney's conduct fell below an objective level of reasonableness and that &quot;but for&quot; his attorney's conduct, the outcome would probably have been different. The court found that there was sufficient evidence presented from which the jury could have found defendant guilty of reckless homicide beyond a reasonable doubt. The jury was presented with evidence that defendant was driving while intoxicated at the time of the collision. Additionally, it was shown that defendant turned his vehicle in front of oncoming traffic, which caused the collision and the victim's death.

In denying his last parole request, the Prisoner Review Board (board) cited as its rationale that granting him parole would deprecate the seriousness of his offense. On appeal, the petitioner first argued that the board denied his request for parole based on arbitrary and capricious reasons and that the statutory standard for parole was invalid since it establishes a deterrent criterion, while the Illinois Constitution mandated a rehabilitative criterion. The court affirmed, holding that the trial court properly dismissed the prisoner's petition for failure to state a claim because the Illinois Habeas Corpus Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 110, para. 10 -- 101 et seq. (1987), did not provide relief to a prisoner whose request for parole had been unreasonably, arbitrarily, or capriciously denied. The court also held that the board could properly consider principles of retributive justice and general deterrence in rendering its decisions.

The store owners appealed, contending that the Act was unconstitutionally vague and thus denied the store owners due process, that the Act was overbroad, reaching beyond gambling to other games, and therefore denied the store owners due process, and that the Act was an unlawful delegation of legislative authority because it did not specify the games to which it applied, thereby allowing the Illinois Department of Revenue to determine what games to license under the Act. On appeal, the court affirmed and held that the Act was not overbroad because it did not reach beyond its purpose to regulate certain games, that no fundamental right was infringed by the Act because the activity licensed was not speech, and that the act did not deprive the store owners of equal protection of law. The Act allowed only specified games to be played and required a license to hold an event.</SPAN></P>

Under former &sect; 2-611, the circuit court lacked discretion to exact a penalty incommensurate with time, effort, and expense incurred by the aggrieved party as a consequence of untrue pleadings. The court noted that the record was devoid of proof that any plaintiff actually caused sanctionable conduct. Furthermore, the court found that neither the pleadings nor any of the other matters appearing in the record justified a finding of sanctions against plaintiffs. Rather, the court concluded that the facts in the record indicated that the responsibility for the untrue pleadings rested solely with plaintiffs' counsel.

The court noted that the good faith exception to the exclusionary rule extended to a warrantless administrative search of a business premises even though the state statute on which the search was based was subsequently found unconstitutional. The court would not extend the good faith exception to defendant's home. The expectation of privacy that the owner of commercial property enjoyed differed significantly from the sanctity accorded an individual's home. In the absence of consent or exigent circumstances, the entry into a home to conduct a search or make an arrest was unreasonable without a warrant, and where the initial search was unlawful, the information gained therefrom could not form the basis for the issuance of a search warrant and evidence so obtained was inadmissible.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that para. 4-103 violated due process guarantees. Specifically, defendant asserted that the statute violated due process because it punished every possessor of a stolen motor vehicle who had knowledge the vehicle was stolen without regard to when that knowledge was acquired or how innocently possession was obtained. The court ruled that the statute was not unconstitutional and affirmed defendant's conviction. The statute was reasonably related to the purpose of preventing vehicle theft and &quot;chop shop&quot; operations because it worked directly against activities involved in the procurement of stolen motor vehicles and chop shop operations by making it an offense to conceal, sell, dispose of, or transfer stolen vehicles. It was further related to its intended purpose by its inclusion of any individual who received or possessed a stolen vehicle. It was immaterial whether para. 4-103 was the most direct means for effectuating those purposes. The statute contained the requisite culpable conduct necessary to effectuate the purpose of the statute, and the constructive knowledge aspect of the statute did not create a conflicting mental state requirement.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The prior action was filed by the mother and subsequently dismissed for failure to prosecute. The current action as brought by the state on behalf of the child. The father contended that the instant proceeding was barred by the fact a paternity action filed by the state on the relation of the mother was dismissed for want of prosecution. The court held that the statute of limitations did not bar the second action because while the mother might be prohibited from filing another action, the child was not so barred. The court held that an action under the Ill. Parentage Act of 1984, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 40, para. 2501 et seq. (1987), might be brought by or on behalf of the child not later than two years after the child attained the age of majority. The court reasoned that technically, the child had no cause of action under the Paternity Act and, therefore, the dismissal of the mother's action had no effect whatsoever on the right of the child to bring an action under the Parentage Act.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the order of dismissal and remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

The court stated that the issue of whether it was unreasonable for defendant to have assumed he was in mortal danger was a question of fact for the jury, and that the jury clearly did not believe that the evidence supported a finding that defendant believed he was justified. On the issue of erroneous jury instructions, the court found that the record did not support a reversal of the conviction or a new trial. The court held that the sentence of natural life was proper.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant unsuccessfully attempted to kidnap one child but successfully kidnapped and sexually assaulted another child. The children accurately described defendant and his car and were able to identify him in a lineup. Neither the criminal sexual assault (CSA) statute nor the aggravated criminal sexual assault (ACSA) statute were unconstitutional on the ground that they punished innocent behavior because the mental states of intent, knowledge, or recklessness were implied for offenses involving &quot;sexual penetration.&quot; Thus, the statutes required some degree of culpability and did not punish innocent behavior. The court held that only one conviction for ACSA was proper; however, the court held that it did not believe that improper multiple convictions were considered at sentencing because the trial court indicated that all such convictions were merged and imposed a single sentence under Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, par. 12 -- 14(a)(2). The court vacated the order, however, and remanded to correct that order to reflect a single conviction for ACSA. Resentencing was not required, however, because nothing suggested that the sentence for ACSA was influenced by the conviction for CSA.</SPAN></P>

The prosecution prevailed. The court noted that the statute's purpose was to protect the safety of law enforcement personnel who stopped and approached a vehicle. The court observed that the statute was subject to only a rational basis level of review, so that it was presumptively constitutional. If there could be any possible rational basis for the legislation, the statute had to be upheld. The legislature was not obligated to give a reason for enacting a statute, especially where line-drawing was involved. The decision on where to draw the line was a difficult one and was best left to the wisdom of the legislature. Whether this decision by the legislature was wise or the best course chosen was not a proper subject of judicial inquiry. The statute was a permissible exercise of legislative authority under both the federal and Illinois Constitutions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state argued that because defendant was convicted of placing his penis in the anus of the victim, his standing to challenge the aggravated criminal sexual assault statute was limited to that type of conduct. The court agreed and affirmed the judgment of conviction. A defendant may challenge a statute as overbroad on the ground that it may be applied unconstitutionally to situations and questions not before the court only if the statute was one that may inhibit the exercise of rights of expression or association protected under the First Amendment. The hypothetical situations posited by defendant as examples of the statute's overbreadth did not implicate the First Amendment rights of expression or association. Thus, the court found that defendant lacked standing to challenge the statute as overbroad. The defendant also argued that the aggravated criminal sexual assault statute violated due process because no mental state was required for conviction. However, the court found that the aggravated criminal sexual assault statute implicitly required that the act of sexual penetration must be intentional or knowing. Therefore, the court found no violation of due process.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, defendant argued that his arrest warrant was not valid because it had not been sworn to as required by Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 111-3(b). The court found that the warrant was valid because the state's attorney who prepared and signed the information was present when the documents were presented to the judge, so there was no doubt as to their authenticity. The court concluded that defendant's arrest would have been valid without a warrant because he was arrested outside his home. The court found that the trial court properly admitted evidence of guns and ammunition, not connected with the crime, that was found in defendant's home. The court found that this evidence was relevant because it tended to indicate that defendant was prepared to use deadly force to defend his drug enterprise. The court found that the trial judge properly instructed the jury on the law of accountability.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of the judgments of the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois), which convicted him of two counts of voluntary manslaughter and sentenced him to consecutive prison sentences.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that the trial court erred in imposing consecutive sentences and in relying on the impact testimony of a victim's brother at the sentencing hearing. The court affirmed the judgments of conviction but vacated the consecutive sentences. It stated that the trial court's authority to impose consecutive sentences was limited. The court found that imposition of the consecutive sentences was improper because the evidence failed to establish that there was a substantial change in the nature of defendant's criminal objective during defendant's course of conduct in the commission of the two manslaughter offenses. It further reasoned that the manslaughter deaths could not be considered the severe bodily injury required for imposition of a consecutive sentence under Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 1005-8-4 (1987) because the severe bodily injury of death was also an essential element of voluntary manslaughter. The court concluded that admission of the victim impact testimony was not erroneous because it was truly innocuous and there was no evidence that the trial judge relied on it in determining and imposing the imprisonment sentence for each manslaughter conviction.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were charged with possession of burglary tools and attempted residential burglary. After a bench trial both defendants received concurrent terms for burglary and possession of burglary tools. Defendants appealed and the court affirmed the judgment of the trial court. The court held that the first defendant did not demonstrate any error on the part of the trial court in denying severance for him. The court held that the police officers, acting with knowledge of the attempted burglary, during a surveillance of the car that had the license number identified by the witnesses to the attempted burglary, and having viewed the first defendant approach the auto and place an object in the trunk, had sufficient probable cause to arrest him. Accordingly, the court found that the trial court's rulings that denied the first defendant's motion to quash and admitted the post-arrest lineup identification were proper. The court held that a proper foundation was established for the admission of the second defendant's license registration, and the state also provided additional evidence of that defendant's control of the car.</SPAN></P>

Defendant challenged the application of the felony murder doctrine, the use of non-pattern jury instructions, evidentiary rulings, prosecutorial comments, and the constitutionality of the sentence. The court affirmed the convictions and the imposition of sentence for felony murder because defendant knowingly struck a police officer who was holding a cocked and loaded gun while engaged in his official duty, it was foreseeable that the gun would fire during a struggle and cause injury, and the battery formed the basis for the forcible felony that substituted for the intent required for felony murder. The court found that: 1) the non-pattern jury instructions properly stated the law applicable to the facts; 2) the widow's civil lawsuit against the city and the post-trial discovery of evidence discrediting the officer's reputation had no probative value in determining defendant's guilt or innocence; 3) the state's closing argument was not inflammatory and was appropriate; 4) the deadlocked jury instruction to continue deliberating was neutral; and 5) the sentence did not violate the Eighth Amendment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with the various narcotics offenses after he purchased narcotics from an undercover officer. Defendant was charged with assault and fleeing an officer after he sped away during an investigatory stop, injuring an officer. On appeal from his convictions, the court affirmed, holding that the trial court properly limited defendant's cross-examination of the undercover officer with regard to a civil action filed against him for misidentification of a narcotics purchaser. Any alleged incentive on the officer's part to give favorable testimony because of the pending civil suit was remote and uncertain, and testimony of the officer's prior conduct would have initiated a lengthy side issue, which would have distracted the jury from the main issue of the case. Further, the admission of improper hearsay evidence from an informant concerning defendant's recent purchase of illegal drugs and intention to dispose of them because he thought the police were watching him was harmless. The admission was harmless because of the uncontested and overwhelming nature of the evidence of the factual matters involved in the controlled substance offenses which the hearsay concerned.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant two appealed his sentences as excessive, while defendant one appealed both his conviction and sentence based on multiple contentions. The court found it was necessary to remand defendant one's case challenging his conviction because a two-part Batson hearing needed to be conducted by the trial court. The court held that after reviewing the trial and suppression hearing evidence concerning the totality of the circumstances, the trial court's finding that the state proved the voluntariness of defendant one's confession by a preponderance of the evidence was not against the manifest weight of the evidence. Further, the court held that the trial court's determination that the officers had probable cause to arrest him was not manifestly erroneous. Also, the court found his confrontation with his accomplice's untainted statement, which was obtained prior to his arrest, was an intervening circumstance that purged the taint of any illegal arrest. Finally, as to defendant two the court held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in sentencing him because he was not a passive observer of the conduct of the defendant one.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Manufacturer terminated dealer's franchise because it did not approve of the location to which dealer wanted to move. Dealer brought an action alleging that the termination violated the act and that manufacturer had breached its contract. The complaint alleged that manufacturer's conduct was willful and wanton and sought treble damages. Manufacturer counterclaimed. The trial court ruled in favor of dealer on both counts, found that manufacturer's actions were willful and wanton, awarded attorney fees, but did not award treble damages. On appeal, the court affirmed and held that the trial court properly instructed the jury as to site control because improper site control in violation of the act could be accomplished by means other than through the provisions of a lease. The court held that the trial court's verdict was not against the manifest weight of the evidence because implicit in the act was the idea that a dealer should not be terminated for affiliating with a competing line. On the cross appeal, the court held that the trial court's denial of treble damages to dealer was proper because the act provided that the power to award treble damages was permissive, not mandatory.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the circuit court in favor of dealer and against manufacturer as to both the appeal and cross appeal.</SPAN></P>

The trial court granted the injunction, restraining defendant from the use of its name and logo, both of which included the name of plaintiff city, in soliciting funds. Defendant appealed, and the court reversed. The court held that the state Attorney General was exclusively empowered to seek injunctive relief under the Act, and, therefore, that plaintiff had no standing. Further, the court found that plaintiff had not proven a violation of the Act. The court noted that no evidence was presented that defendant's use of plaintiff's name tended to confuse or mislead the public into believing that plaintiff was connected with defendant's fundraising campaign. Pointing to defendant's extended previous relationship with the community, its long history of existence and use of its name and logo, and the substantial steps made to ensure that the public was correctly informed of defendant's identity and purpose, the court found no violation as a matter of law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant lured a female victim to a vacant house where he raped and killed her, choking her with a wire coat hangar, his bare hands, and a foot. The court found that defendant was properly queried under 107 Ill. 2d R. 402(b) regarding the voluntariness of his plea. In affirming, the court found that the trial court substantially complied with Rule 402(b), and was not required to apply the rule verbatim. The court held that defendant's guilty plea was not revocable simply because he subjectively believed that he would receive a certain sentence. The court held that the phrase &quot;exceptionally brutal or heinous behavior indicative of wanton cruelty&quot; under Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 1005-8-1(a)(1)(b) (1985) was not unconstitutionally vague as applied to his case because defendant engaged in cold-blooded behavior, devoid of mercy and compassion. The court held that a sentence of natural life imprisonment was proper because the trial court considered defendant's age, his drug and alcohol use, and his mental illness, but found that the day after the murder he drank alcohol, used drugs, and committed another crime.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's imposition of imprisonment for defendant's natural life and held that evidence supported the trial court's finding that the murder was brutal and heinous.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed, concluding that defendant's first two claims were foreclosed by a prior decision of the Illinois Supreme Court and that the third claim was without merit. With regard to the third claim, the court found that the statute comported with due process requirements because it provided persons of ordinary intelligence with a reasonable opportunity to ascertain what conduct was prohibited thereunder.

The attorneys also asserted that the trial court erred in reducing the number of hours computed by the attorneys. On appeal, the court reversed the judgment of the trial court. The court found that the trial court erred in relying upon the previous billings of a small number of the attorneys' clients in determining the prevailing market rate.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant claimed on appeal that the application of the armed violence statute to his kidnapping conviction resulted in an unconstitutionally disproportionate sentence. The court agreed, vacating defendant's armed violence conviction and sentence. The court noted that kidnapping, which was a Class 2 felony, was a lesser-included offense of aggravated kidnapping, which was a class 1 felony, and that armed violence predicated on kidnapping was a Class X felony requiring the same elements as aggravated kidnapping. The court thus found that through the application of the armed violence statute, defendant's kidnapping conviction was, in effect, enhanced to a Class X felony and was punished more severely than the greater felony of aggravated kidnapping, resulting in an unconstitutionally disproportionate sentence. The court also concluded that the trial court erred in imposing an extended-term sentence for kidnapping because kidnapping was not the most serious offense that defendant was convicted of. The court thus reduced defendant's sentence on the kidnapping conviction to the maximum nonextended term of seven years' imprisonment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant claimed on appeal that &sect; 4-103(a)(1) provided for two different and conflicting mental states and, therefore, that it did not comport with due process requirements because it failed to provide fair notice of what conduct was prohibited. He contended that under the statute, a person could be found guilty if he acted with either scienter or constructive knowledge and, therefore, that a person of ordinary intelligence had no notice of what the law required. Further, defendant claimed that the penalty provision, &sect; 4-103(b), was unconstitutional because it imposed a harsher penalty for the lesser-included offense of theft and it did not bear a reasonable relationship to its legislative purpose of preventing auto theft or &quot;chop shop&quot; operations. The court affirmed, concluding that the mental states referenced in &sect; 4-103(a)(1) were not irreconcilable and that the section merely provided that knowledge that a vehicle was stolen could be inferred from a person's exclusive and unexplained possession over a vehicle. The court thus found that &sect; 4-103(a)(1) provided persons with fair notice of the prohibited conduct. Further, the court rejected defendant's challenge to &sect; 4-103(b).</SPAN></P>

The court held that the evidence clearly supported the trial court's conclusion that defendant had possession of the stolen automobile. The court also decided that the statute under which defendant was convicted was not unconstitutional. The offense of possession of a stolen motor vehicle was not a lesser-included offense of general theft and therefore it was permissible for the penalty for possession of a stolen motor vehicle to have been greater than that of general theft.</SPAN></P>

Thus, after the buyer purchased the owner's property, the buyer attempted to comply with the notice provisions of the Illinois Revenue Act of 1939 (Act), Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 120, para. 482 et seq. (1987), by serving the owner personally, publishing a notice, and also alerting the council. However, the guardian argued that the notice provisions of the Act were unconstitutional and violated due process because they failed to take into account persons living in the unique situation of the owner. On appeal, the court reversed the judgment of the trial court denying the guardian's motion for a declaratory judgment. Instead, the court held that the notice to the council demonstrated that the buyer was aware that the owner was in need of assistance and that the buyer should have known that the notices were inadequate to inform the owner that her property was at risk. Thus, the court held that the tax sale, without effective notice to the owner, was a violation of due process. Accordingly, the trial court's judgment was reversed.</SPAN></P>

The magazine contended that the circuit court erred in finding the department properly applied the Illinois Income Tax Act (Act), Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 120, para. 1--101 et seq.

The magazine contended that the department failed to properly apportion its receipts from advertising space, subscription sales, and newsstand sales under the Act and that the Act as applied to the magazine was unconstitutional. The court affirmed, holding that the apportionment provisions were correctly applied. The court concluded that receipts for the sale of advertising were properly considered to be sales of tangible personal property under the Act, not a service transaction, given that the advertising space was an integral part of the publication. Further, the court ruled that the &quot;throwback&quot; provision of the Act had been correctly applied. Moreover, the court noted that the Act's combination of property, payroll, and sales factors was a widely used formula and concluded that it was constitutional as applied to the magazine.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The union was the exclusive bargaining representative of employees of the employer bargaining unit. As a result of unfair labor practices, the employer was ordered to enter into collective bargaining with the union. After little progress was made in the negotiations, the union advised the ISLRB that it believed that the employer was engaging in &quot;surface bargaining&quot; only. The union did not file any further unfair labor practices charges. Fourteen months after the original order, the employer filed a decertification petition seeking to remove the union as the employee's representative. The union excepted to the petition citing the employer's surface bargaining as a defense. The court affirmed the ISLRB's order and specifically held that the decertification proceeding was an improper forum in which to address the surface bargaining issue. The National Labor Relations Board did not adjudicate unfair labor practice charges in representation proceedings and the court concluded that ISLRB properly followed that precedent. The issue should have been addressed in either an unfair labor practices complaint or a mandamus action seeking enforcement of the earlier collective bargaining order.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An estate administrator deposited funds with the state treasurer pending a final determination of inheritance tax due. The administrator filed a class action suit, alleging that the treasurer was required to pay interest on funds in excess of the tax. In upholding summary judgment in favor of the treasurer, the court stated that the sole issue presented for review was whether an estate was entitled to the interest earned on funds deposited with the state treasurer pending a determination of the amount of inheritance taxes due, when the amount determined to be due was less than the amount deposited and the estate received a refund. The court ruled that there was no statute providing for a &quot;particular fund&quot; to be set up in order to keep the funds segregated, nor a court order directing payment to a &quot;particular fund&quot; to be held by the treasurer as trustee. Thus, the treasurer was authorized to invest the estate's deposit and keep the interest income. The case did not present the circumstances required to invoke the equitable powers of the court, and use of the estate's deposit to earn interest was not a &quot;taking&quot; of private property for public use without just compensation.</SPAN></P>

The lower court's judgment held that the Act did not provide for consortium damages and that the limitations imposed upon the recovery of damages were constitutional. The court affirmed, holding that because there was no common law action for damages caused by the service of liquor, the courts were required to exercise more restraint in construing the Act than they would be required to exercise in construing judge created-doctrines. The court ruled that the Act did not provide that the husband was entitled to consortium damages because the Act restricted damages to means of support and not the loss of love and affection. The court held that the restrictions upon recovery contained in the Act, such as a short statute of limitations, did not violate plaintiffs' due process rights because the Act created rather than abrogated a remedy.</SPAN></P>

The agreement listed the dealer's location as the old location and when the dealer moved its location again the manufacturer terminated the franchise contract. The court held that the prohibition against site control in the Act protected the dealer from being subjected to unreasonable control by the manufacturer. The court determined that there was no argument made that the new location would not be an appropriate site to market the products and the franchise agreement specifically provided for multilane dealerships. The court reasoned that under the Act a dealer should not be terminated for affiliating with a competing line. The court held that the manufacturer did not have good cause to terminate the franchise. The court determined that the dealer was not entitled to treble damages because it was unclear whether the jury found for the dealer under a theory of recovery in contract, in which case trebling of damages would be prohibited, or under the statute that provided for treble damages.</SPAN></P>

Stat. ch. 95 1/2, para. 11-501.1 (1987) because he refused to submit to a chemical test of his breath following his arrest for driving under the influence of alcohol. The lower court sustained the summary suspension by the state, and the motorist sought review. On review, the motorist advanced the argument that the failure of the arresting officer to give him a written warning of the consequences of his refusal to have his breath tested violated the motorist's due process rights. The motorist also argued that the statute was void for vagueness. The court found that the statute did not require the written warning sought by the motorist and that the testimony of the arresting officer confirmed his verbal compliance with the warning requirement. The court also found that the statute was neither contradictory nor vague. The statute clearly defined the conduct held to be unlawful and provided standards so as to avoid arbitrary or discriminatory enforcement.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was tried in absentia in a bench trial and found guilty of burglary. Defendant contended that his conviction should be reversed and a new trial ordered because he was not properly admonished in accordance with Ill Rev.

Stat. ch. 38, para. 115--4.1(a) (1985); and the State failed to show that his absence from trial was willful. On appeal, the court affirmed the burglary conviction. The court noted that defendant conceded that the trial court informed him that if he failed to appear for trial or any court dates, he could be tried in absentia. Thus, the curt ruled that the trial court substantially complied with Ill Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 113--4(e) (1985). The court found that defendant was not entitled to receive notice of the new trial date. The court reasoned that common sense and simple logic dictated that the mailing provision be inapplicable to situations where trial had already begun. The court determined that because the statutory requirements were met, a prima facie showing of willful avoidance of trial was set forth.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a paternity action, the mother and the IDPA brought a support action against the father. The trial court only considered the reimbursement due the IDPA and so entered a child support order in that amount rather than 20 percent of the supporting parent's net income as required by the Illinois Marriage and Dissolution of Marriage Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 40, para. 505(a) (1987). On appeal, the court reversed and remanded. The trial court should have considered the statutory factors of para. 505(a). The court determined that the withholding statute, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 40, para. 2520(B)(3) (1987), mandated that the withholding order be directed at any payor rather than the father's current employer. Although there could have been a conflict of interest between the mother and the IDPA's representation by the state's attorney if the father's support were sufficient to cancel all public assistance, there was no conflict in this case and the state's attorney could continue to represent the mother. The court remanded to the trial court for it to consider the factors of Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 40, para. 2514(b) (1987) and determine if retroactive support should have been awarded.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The insured brought an uninsured motorist claim against his insurer, and an arbitration award was rendered in favor of the insurer. In reversing an order denying leave to file an amended complaint, the court noted the amended complaint specifically alleged that the neutral arbitrator was representing plaintiffs in cases against other parties insured by the insurer. The court held that those allegations were sufficient to plead a claim for vacatur of the arbitration award on the basis of fraud or bias. The court stated that it did not mean to suggest that every arbitrator must disclose the number of cases, no matter how small, involving one of the parties to an arbitration which he had handled, but believed that the insured adequately alleged grounds for vacating the arbitration award in the amended complaint and that that amendment should have been allowed in the interests of justice. In affirming the dismissal of counts alleging that statutes were unconstitutional, the court held that having submitted to the arbitration without objection the insured waived its right to insist that the statutes conferring such jurisdiction were an invasion of its constitutional right.</SPAN></P>

The defense presented no evidence, and the jury found both defendants guilty on the charges of possession of a stolen motor vehicle and burglary. On appeal, defendants argued that the trial court committed reversible error when it undercut the state's burden of proof through its comments during voir dire that defendants began the case with a slight advantage, and that the trial court further erred during voir dire when, in response to a prospective juror's statements that he had been the victim of a burglary involving a theft of auto parts and vandalism, the court stated that the facts of the case were similar. The court affirmed because, even if defendants had not waived the issues to which they interposed objections on appeal by their failure to object at trial, no reversible error occurred in the absence of a showing that defendants were prejudiced by the remarks of the court. Further, the evidence, viewed in its entirety, was sufficient to support defendants' conviction for burglary and possession of a stolen motor vehicle.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff candidates appealed the judgment of the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois), which dismissed their complaint filed against defendant candidate for an election contest of the special election and for an injunction because their complaint was not filed within the five-day statute of limitations set forth in Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 24, para. 21-27 (1987).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">No candidate in a special election won a majority of the votes so a special run off election was called. Plaintiffs filed a complaint for an election contest and an injunction and alleged that the write-in votes were invalid and thus plaintiffs had actually won the election. The trial court dismissed the complaint. The court affirmed the dismissal. The court found that the right to contest an election was statutory and there had to be strict compliance with the statutory procedure. The court held that pursuant to Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 24, para. 21-27 (1987), a complaint to contest an aldermanic election had to be filed within five days of the election and that plaintiffs' complaint was untimely. The action was filed 16 days after the election. Therefore, the trial court was without jurisdiction to hear it. The court found that the injunction could not be issued because courts had no jurisdiction to enjoin the holding of an election except where it was necessary to prevent a waste of public funds by conducting an election under an unconstitutional election statute or an election called in violation of the constitution.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant grabbed the victim and dragged her 60 feet into a vacant lot. Defendant held a knife to her neck and then inserted his finger into her vagina. On trial, defendant asserted the affirmative defense of insanity. On appeal, defendant contended that the evidence was insufficient to prove that he was sane at the time of the offense. The doctor concluded that defendant was sane at the time of the offense and that defendant was able to appreciate the criminality of the alleged offense and was able to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law. In light of the evidence presented, it could not have been said that the determination of the trial court was so improbable or unsatisfactory as to have raised a reasonable doubt as to defendant's sanity. Further, the legislature intended to enact a statute that provided triers of fact with a logical scheme by which to determine the criminal responsibility of a defendant who presented evidence of insanity or mental illness. The statute accomplished that goal. The guilty-but-mentally-ill statute did not violate the constitutional guarantee of equal protection of the law. The court affirmed the judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">While defendant was out on bail, he was arrested again. When defendant was brought into night bond court, the state asked the court for leave to file a petition for violation of bail bond conditions. The court granted the state's petition over defendant's objections. The state noted that defendant's criminal record included numerous bail bond forfeitures. Defendant claimed that the trial court violated his due process rights because it failed to provide reasonable notice and a hearing on the state's petition. He also contended that the statute authorizing an increase in bail was unconstitutionally vague. On appeal, the court dismissed the appeal as moot, finding that the issues raised by defendant ceased to exist since he was previously given a hearing on the violation of bail bond charges. The court noted that the procedure followed in the case had been in effect for several years but that it involved setting a bond on a petition for violation of bail bond conditions and was without foundation because the assertions in the petition of a violation of bond conditions were not in themselves a crime for which bail could be independently imposed.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. ch. 56 1/2, para. 1401(b)(2) (1987), and the trial court denied his motion to suppress. Defendant appealed. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment because defendant failed to meet his statutory burden under Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 114-12(b) (1987) of proving the allegations in his motion to suppress, and that he was not seized within the meaning of U.S. Const. amend. IV. The court determined that a reasonable person in defendant's position would have considered that he was free to leave. The court found that the state met its burden under of proving that defendant's consent was freely and voluntarily given. The court held that the search of defendant's shoulder bag was neither tainted by the preceding events nor independently amounted to a separate violation of U.S. Const. amend. IV.

Rev. Stat. ch. 110, para. 2-408 (1985), in a personal injury action by plaintiffs, employee and husband, against defendants, driver, relative, restaurant, and owner.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employer had paid medical expenses for the husband under a group health insurance policy issued to the employee. It contended on appeal that it should have been permitted to intervene either as of right or permissively. The employee and her husband argued that the employer had no contractual right of subrogation. The court found that the purpose of the medical payments coverage of the group policy was to indemnify the employee or other beneficiary from pecuniary loss rather than to pay a sum certain on the happening of a given event, and thus found the coverage more comparable to that of fire and marine policies, under which there was a right of subrogation, than to life and accident coverage. The court stated that if an insurer paid a loss which was due to the wrongful act of another, it was subrogated to the rights of the insured independent of contract. The court determined that given the equitable nature and purposes of common-law subrogation, the cause should be remanded for a hearing on whether defendants driver and relative or their insurer knew of the employer's interest prior to their settlement with and release by the employee and husband.</SPAN></P>
