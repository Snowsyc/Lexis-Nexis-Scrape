</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff property owner filed an application for a conditional variance permit with defendant, the city zoning and planning commission. The owner appealed from a decision of the zoning appeals board that denied his request to remove six restrictions imposed upon his permit. The owner challenged a judgment of a trial court (Ohio), which removed one restriction, but which affirmed the board's decision as to the remaining five restrictions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The property owner applied for a conditional use permit, pursuant to the City of Kirtland, Ohio, Zoning Ordinance &sect; 6 (recodified), to operate a body shop business for restoring, fabricating and customizing new, used and/or antique automobiles. After receiving the conditional use permit, the owner requested that the zoning board remove the restrictions that the commission imposed thereon. When his request was denied, the owner sought judicial review. The trial court's affirmance of five of the restrictions was reversed. The court evaluated the restrictions imposed by the commission and found that the commission attempted to create a new classification of usage by limiting and restricting the type of business the owner could conduct on his premises. The commission in approving the operation of a body shop found that all of the conditions set forth in the zoning regulations were satisfied, therefore the restrictions were unwarranted. The court concluded that the zoning board had no authority to impose restrictions that were not found in the zoning regulations.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court's judgment was reversed as to its affirmance of the five remaining restrictions, and final judgment was entered on behalf of the owner.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A confidential informant cooperated with the police in their investigation of drug activity, persuading defendant to act as his agent in drug sales. Defendant sold drugs to an undercover police officer and was indicted for trafficking in drugs, in violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2925.03, and for selling a controlled substance in less than the minimum bulk amount, in violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2925.03. Defendant was convicted for trafficking in drugs. Defendant appealed, and the court affirmed. The court held that defendant committed the offense, either acting for himself or on behalf of the informant, when presented with the opportunity. The court found that there was insufficient evidence to warrant an instruction on entrapment, and that it was not entrapment for the police to merely have provided an opportunity to defendant to have committed an offense. The court noted that the informant was not a party to the sale of which defendant was found guilty, that defendant had neither attempted to obtain the informant's testimony nor his presence at trial, and had failed to request a continuance on the ground of an absent and essential witness.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellants, police union and its president, sought review of a judgment from the Court of Common Pleas of Hamilton County (Ohio) that dismissed a suit against appellees, a city and officials, challenging the constitutionality of Cincinnati, Ohio, City Charter art. V, &sect; 7. Appellees challenged a preliminary injunction that ordered them to continue labor contract negotiations with appellants for wages, fringe benefits, and other matters.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The charter's parity provision set the same pay schedules for police and fire employees. Appellees negotiated with appellants for seven months before ending face-to-face negotiation. Reversing the injunction, the court said that the trial court's finding of bad faith by appellees was contrary to the manifest weight of the evidence. An impasse had been reached. The negotiations were not a sham, a pretence, or a charade. Appellees could not be required to negotiate to avoid a finding of bad faith. Appellees offered concessions and offered to provide for a 16 percent differential between ranks. Appellees were entitled to maintain a tough bargaining position. The obligation to bargain collectively did not compel either party to agree to a proposal or require the making of a concession. Affirming the dismissal, the court said that the parity provision was constitution and did not interfere with the duty to bargain collectively. Ohio Const. art. XVIII, &sect;&sect; 7, 8, and 9 provided authority for the citizens of a municipality to adopt and amend a municipal charter.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the injunction that ordered appellees to continue negotiations with appellants and remanded for further proceedings. The court affirmed the judgment that dismissed appellants' suit.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant patient sought review of a decision of the Common Pleas Court Summit County (Ohio), which returned a jury verdict for appellee doctor in the patient's medical malpractice action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The patient filed an action against the doctor, alleging malpractice in the performance of a surgical operation, to wit, a recurrent right inguinal hernia. An arbitration report was entered in favor of the doctor. The trial court entered a jury verdict for the doctor. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that a hypothetical question presented to the patient's medical expert witness was not properly framed, sufficiently specific, and clearly stated so that the jury could know with certainty upon which state of assumed facts the expert based his opinion. If a hypothetical question contained facts, operative facts, which were not a part of the evidence submitted, the question was inadmissible. When informed consent was an issue, a hypothetical question that denied that such fact existed, as in the case at hand, violated the essential fairness of the inquiry. Thus, the trial court correctly struck from the record the only question and answer which said the conduct of the doctor did not comport with proper medical practice in the community.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant, a minor, appealed from a decision of the Common Pleas Court, Lorain County, Ohio, that found she was an unruly child.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant challenged the trial court finding that she was an unruly child. On appeal, the court found that defendant's father had signed a complaint under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2151.022 that his 16 year old daughter had run away from home. The affidavit was signed at the instance of the local police who had a teletype message indicating that defendant was in police custody in Florida. Counsel was appointed for defendant. A hearing was held, which disclosed a history of drug involvement for over four years, with possible physical and mental impairment, instability, at least 11 previous runaways to various parts of the country, attempted psychological treatment and hospitalization, and social maladjustment. The court held that &sect; 2151.022 was neither so vague nor so indefinite as to constitute a denial of due process. It was constitutional. Here, while the complaint only related to the latest runaway, it was not attacked by motion. The proof at trial revealed many instances of unruly behavior. The court found that the statute required more than one instance for a finding of &quot;unruly&quot; and that was proven in this case. Accordingly, the court affirmed the trial court judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed the judgment of the trial court (Ohio), which convicted her of criminal trespass in violation of Dayton, Ohio, Rev. Code Gen. Ordinances &sect; 133.05(A)(1). Defendant argued that she was constitutionally privileged to be at the location where the trespass occurred and was entitled to directed verdict, but the real issue was whether defendant had preserved that issue for review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of criminal trespass for handing out copies of the Communist Worker newspaper in the student cafeteria of the University of Dayton, a private university. Defendant was not a student at the university and did not attempt to buy a meal. Defendant argued that the evidence did not support the verdict because she was &quot;privileged&quot; to be there; the cafeteria was open to the public and she had a constitutional right of free speech to distribute her newspaper. However, the problem on appeal was that defendant never presented that issue of law to the trial court for it to resolve. At the trial defendant challenged the constitutionality of the statute; she did not argue that she was privileged to be in the cafeteria. The trial court's denial of defendant's motion for directed verdict was without explanation, and was not objected to at the time. The court held that an appellate court did not have to consider an error which defendant could have brought before the trial court but did not. As to the issue actually before it, the court found that the conviction was supported by substantial evidence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court overruled defendant's assignment of error and affirmed the judgment of the trial court that convicted her of criminal trespass.</SPAN></P>

Defendant admitted that he solicited and received a payment from the owner. Defendant's sole defense to the charge of bribery was that he was off-duty at the time he recovered the automobile. The trial court convicted defendant of bribery for soliciting and accepting valuable consideration to influence him with respect to the discharge of his duty as a city police officer in violation of &sect; 2921.02(B). On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's judgment and ruled that defendant, as a public official, was not free to utilize his official duties as an occasion for private enrichment. The court held that one of the official duties of defendant was to cause the return of stolen property to the lawful owner. The court ruled that the trial court's jury instruction regarding reasonable doubt was substantially in accordance with the mandatory definition contained in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2901.05(D).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The landowners purchased a parcel of property. At the time of purchase, the property was zoned for single family residential use under the city's building code. The parcel and the land that surrounded it were largely undeveloped at the time of the purchase. Numerous changes had occurred in the vicinity, which included commercial and retail development of a main road that had access to a newly constructed interstate highway, development of neighboring parcels to the north and south as single family residential areas, and construction of an elementary school immediately west of the parcel. A parcel immediately across a road to the east was zoned for industrial use. The landowners had submitted plans for development of the parcel as apartments, which were rejected. They also submitted a proposal for the construction of condominiums and 22 single family houses that was also rejected. The trial court concluded that the existing classification was constitutional as applied to the landowners and denied their request for a permanent injunction. The court held that a zoning ordinance would not be declared unconstitutional because a property was not zoned for its highest and best use.</SPAN></P>

He also asserted that he could not be convicted of both kidnapping and aggravated robbery under the allied offenses statute contained in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2941.25. The court affirmed defendant's convictions for aggravated burglary and aggravated robbery, but reversed his convictions for kidnapping because the animus required for both the kidnapping and the aggravated robbery were the same and thus, they were allied offenses under &sect; 2941.25. The court also ruled that the trial court properly denied defendant's motion to suppress the statements because the officers used no trickery or coercion to induce the statements.</SPAN></P>

The trial court convicted defendant of violating Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2909.04. The court affirmed defendant's conviction. The court held that &quot;radio service&quot; in &sect; 2909.04 was not unconstitutionally vague because a person of ordinary intelligence would be on notice of the specified prohibited conduct. The court also ruled that there was sufficient evidence to find that defendant purposely or knowingly interrupted or impaired a radio service. The court noted that defendant knew that the reporter had been given permission to use the phone and that he admitted to the acts because he did not want the mayor's enemies to hear the news conference.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Following defendant's trial, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2923.04, engaging in organized crime, was declared unconstitutional. Therefore, the court reversed the conviction. Defendant alleged that the evidence at trial on the marijuana trafficking counts was so intermingled with the organized crime count that the remaining convictions could not stand. The court disagreed and held that the evidence was relevant to the element of scienter with respect to the trafficking counts. The court found that items of evidence that were the subject of an objection were properly admitted. The court found that apart from and disregarding evidence the admission of which was disputed, there was overwhelming evidence of guilt of the crime of trafficking in marijuana and that there was no reasonable possibility that the evidence complained of might have contributed to the convictions, especially since the jury acquitted defendant of one trafficking count. No expert testimony that the substance was marijuana was required because the witnesses claimed sufficient expertise to back up their opinion evidence that the substance was marijuana. Credibility of the witnesses was for the jury.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the engaging in organized crime conviction and sentence and entered a final judgment of acquittal. The remainder of the judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was east bound on a limited access right of way.

She testified that she placed her left turn signal on, checked the rear and side view mirrors for oncoming traffic, and turned. As her car was entering the turn off, she was struck in the left rear tail light area. Defendant was cited and found guilty of improper lane usage. The court affirmed and held that the essential purpose of a traffic ticket was to apprise defendant of the offense with which he was charged and the time and date he will be called upon by the trial court to defend himself with regard to those charges. Although not outlining the section number, the information included on the face of the ticket gave notice to defendant the nature of the State's charges against her. Further, Ord. 432.08 permitted a change of lane to be made when the driver first ascertained that such movement could be made with safety. The ordinance placed a duty upon the public to exercise due care in the operation of motor vehicles and gave fair notice that a failure to exercise such due care resulted in a traffic violation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant sought review of a judgment from the Cleveland Heights Municipal Court (Ohio), in which he was convicted of disorderly conduct pursuant to Ohio Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant claimed that he was inadequately advised of his rights before pleading, the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction, the complaint was defective, and Ohio Rev.

The court reversed, holding that: (1) while the trial court informed defendant of his rights before accepting his plea, it failed to determine that he understood his rights or whether he was able to obtain counsel and was expressly waiving his right thereto, thus rendering defendant's plea unknowing and unintelligent; (2) the evidence was sufficient to support the conviction as defendant admitted to police that his actions were intentional; (3) the complaint was defective because it did not inform defendant of the act for which he was tried; and (4) since Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2917.11(A) did not restrict freedom of expression either on its face or as applied to defendant's case, the statute was not unconstitutionally overbroad.

The court held that although there was some discrepancy in the description of the property in the map attached to the incorporation petition, overall, the map and description were accurate and were not arbitrary, capricious, or unreasonable. The court held that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 707.02(D) did not mean that the entire area sought to be incorporated must have been kept regularly for outing and pleasure. The court held that the evidence showed that incorporation was for the general good of the entire community. The court held that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 707.02(D) was a general law and was thus constitutional.</SPAN></P>

In the meantime, the copy of the record made by the county recorder pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 707.09 was filed with the Ohio Secretary of State.

Plaintiffs alleged that the proposed initiative in part sought to pass a law authorizing a classification of property for the purpose of levying different rates of taxation in violation of Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 1(e). Plaintiffs challenged a judgment for the Secretary, and the court affirmed the judgment as modified. The court held that a provision of the proposed initiative clearly violated Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 1(e), as it enacted Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 5747.053, which created an absolute credit for real property taxes accrued or for rent constituting real property taxes accrued without giving a similar credit for personal property taxes. It also classified real estate in that it provided a separate category for homestead property as opposed to other types of real estate. While the constitutional issue clearly was justiciable, it was not currently justiciable. Only after, and if, the proposed law was enacted by the electorate could the constitutional issue be properly considered.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant Public Employees Retirement System of Ohio challenged a judgment the Common Pleas Court of Erie County (Ohio), which ruled in favor of plaintiffs, children of a deceased township police employee, in their action seeking a declaration that they were dependents at the time of his death, that they were entitled to benefits, and that their mother was entitled to reimbursement for support owed to her under a divorce agreement.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The deceased was divorced from the children's mother and had fallen behind in his child support payments because of serious illness. The deceased had provided 41 percent of the children's support for the year before his death. The System claimed that it was error to grant summary judgment for the children when Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 145.45(B)(2)(b) defined dependents as unmarried children under age 18, provided that the deceased member contributed one-half or more of their support during the 12-month period prior to death. On review, the court agreed. The court found that: 1) the judgment was contrary to &sect; 145.45(B)(2)(b); 2) pursuant to its police power, the State's creation of the system and its legislation enacted to administer the system were presumed to be constitutional; and 3) it was reasonable for the Ohio General Assembly to distinguish between children domiciled with a member and those living elsewhere and to define &quot;dependency&quot; in terms of those children receiving one-half or more of their support from a deceased parent. The court noted that the payment of pension funds was a matter of legislative grace.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the judgment, entered final judgment in favor of the system and against the children, and remanded for execution of costs to the children.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant contended that he was under the influence of drugs, and that, therefore, he was unable to purposely attempt to escape from jail and knowingly commit a felonious assault on a deputy. The court found that the trial court correctly charged the jury with the definitions of &quot;purposefully&quot; and &quot;knowingly.&quot; The fact that defendant alleged that he was under the influence of drugs was, standing alone, insufficient to prevent the reasonable minds of the jurors from concluding that defendant purposely attempted to escape and knowingly committed a felonious assault. The State's evidence supported the findings of the verdict, and thus the verdict reached was not against the manifest weight of the evidence. The change in the burden of proof under Ohio Rev. Code &sect; 2901.05(A) did not deprive defendant of the defense itself, or prohibit conduct that was formerly allowed, or created new standards of conduct. Therefore, the application of the amended statute did not violate Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 28. It was not reasonable under the evidence presented to charge the jury with a violation of Ohio Rev.

The trial court adjudicated their two children to be dependent and granted temporary custody to appellee State, terminating visitation rights and communication.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A county welfare department filed a complaint alleging the two children were dependent, and the trial court, sua sponte, ordered the parents to submit to mental examinations with their children. The court found that the trial court made its dispositional orders according to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2151.355(B) immediately following the adjudicatory hearing without a proper evidentiary hearing. The court noted that the trial court improperly restrained the parents' conduct in their relationship with their children without notice that such an order could be made. The court agreed with the parents that the allegations regarding emotions, hostility, and asocial habits did not support a contention of dependency, but the allegations regarding marijuana in the presence of the children did. The court also agreed that &sect; 2151.04(C) by itself was unconstitutional, but it was not vague when viewed with the requirements of &sect; 2151.27 and Ohio R. Juv. P. 10(B)(1). The court held that the trial judge made findings of psychological or psychiatric illness without an evidentiary basis, but there was enough other probative evidence to support a conclusion of dependency and an order for mental evaluation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant sought review of a judgment from the Erie County Common Pleas Court (Ohio), which convicted defendant of attempted murder and which merged a finding of guilty on a burglary charge with the attempted murder for sentencing purposes. In seeking review, defendant claimed that the trial court had erred in admitting expert testimony and defendant's prior threats and in convicting defendant of burglary.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant stuck a gun through the victims' window and shot the victims. Thereafter, defendant was charged with attempted aggravated murder and burglary. During the trial, the victims testified that defendant had previously threatened to take their lives, and defendant successfully suppressed part of an expert's testimony. After defendant was found guilty of attempted murder and burglary, the trial court held that the burglary was an allied offense of similar import to attempted murder and determined that the burglary finding was merged with the attempted murder for sentencing purposes. Thereafter, defendant sought review. Upon review, the court held that because defendant had never objected to other portions of the expert's testimony, any error resulting from that testimony had been waived. The court also held that while the prior threat had been too remote to show intent of attempted aggravated murder, the threat's admission had been harmless because defendant had been convicted of attempted murder only. Finally, pursuant to Ohio R. Crim. P. 32(B), the court rejected the contention that defendant had been convicted of burglary because defendant had not been sentenced thereon.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court found that the trial court was correct in determining that the ordinance was unreasonable, arbitrary, and confiscatory and not based upon the public health, safety, morals, and general welfare of the community. The court reached this conclusion because it did not find any concrete evidence presented by the city that justified the rationale for the ordinance. The court noted that if an Ohio legislative classification for zoning purposes was fairly debatable, the legislative judgment had to control. However, the court found that the zoning ordinance at issue was not fairly debatable. The court concluded that the zoning ordinance constituted an unconstitutional taking of property and was invalid.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">When store security officers detained his sister, defendant broke into the security office and repeatedly hurled profanity and other epithets at store personnel and at the police officers that responded. He was ultimately charge and convicted of disorderly conduct. On appeal, the court affirmed the conviction that was entered by the trial court. The court rejected defendant's argument that the conviction violated defendant's right to free speech. Rather, the court held that the speech in question constituted fighting words, which were not protected speech. The fact that the objects of the profanity were police officers did not exempt the speech from being categorized as fighting words. The court noted that the test for whether speech constituted fighting words was the effect of the speech upon an ordinary person, not on a trained police officer. The court held that to rule otherwise would increase the potential for violent confrontation between police and citizenry in situations which otherwise might never rise to that level of danger. With regard to defendant's sentence, the court ruled that the trial court was within its discretion to impose a fine along with the jail sentence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">An individual was arrested on grand theft charges. The arrestee implicated various individuals in the theft, including defendant. With the consent of the arrestee, a detective placed a recording device on the phone to make a recording of a conversation between the arrestee and defendant. The trial court granted defendant's motion to suppress the contents of the telephone conversation. The court held that under the exceptions set forth in Ohio Rev. Code &sect; 2933.58(B), the conversation of the arrestee with defendant would not have been subject to the criminal penalties of Ohio Rev. Code &sect; 2933.58(A) because the arrestee had consented to the conversation being recorded as a means of bringing defendant to justice. The court found that there was no requirement that police obtain a warrant before police could have recorded or transmitted a conversation between defendant and a police agent. The trial court should not have suppressed the tape of the conversation of the arrestee with defendant nor prohibited the arrestee or the detective from testifying about his conversation, except for impeachment purposes.</SPAN></P>

However, the two individuals were the consumers who complained to the Cleveland Office of Consumer Affairs about defendant's trade practices.

On appeal, defendant argued that the trial court erred in denying his motion to dismiss because defendant had not been brought to trial within the statutory period. The court held that the trial court did not error in denying defendant's motion to dismiss for a lack of speedy trial. The court held that the delay in bringing defendant to trial was excusable for two reasons. First, the court found that defendant's oral motion for discovery, which was granted by the trial court, tolled the time for trial for a reasonable period to allow discovery. Secondly, the court held that a shortage of veniremen on the defendant's first scheduled trial date made it necessary to postpone the trial.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The police arrested the occupants of a van for selling illegal fireworks and then approached the citizen's nearby car. The citizen was a private investigator who had a person under surveillance. The police questioned his associate and later him as to his business. The citizen explained his business but the police searched the car and found an empty holster, empty cartridges, and unloaded hand guns in the car. The citizen was arrested and charged with violating the University Heights, Ohio, Ordinance &sect;&sect; 626.04(a), 626.09(a) that prohibited the possession of firearms without a Restricted Owner's Identification Card. On appeal, the court found that the ordinances were overbroad, vague, unenforceable and unconstitutional. The exercise of police power could interfere with property if it had a substantial relationship to the public's general welfare and was not unreasonable. However, the court found no useful purpose for the ordinances and that they were law enforcement techniques designed to assist law enforcement personnel.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The real property owners consisted of a corporation and an individual who was the successor in interest to the assets owned by the corporation. The city inspected the property and notified the real property owners of various violations. The real property owner failed to obtain a permit to correct the violations or demolish the property. The city contracted with the wrecking company, who demolished the property five months after the city notified the real property owner of its intent to demolish the property for its failure to cure the violations. The trial court granted the city's motion to dismiss on the basis of immunity and granted the wrecking company's motion for summary judgment on the basis that the city had given the wrecking company oral permission to demolish the building. The court concluded that the city's demolition of the real property owner's building, which violated housing standards, was a governmental function and protected the city from liability under the governmental immunity doctrine.

The victim was stabbed multiple times but he did not die and managed to crawl out and get help while the delicatessen was burning. Defendant was tried separately and convicted of aggravated arson and attempted aggravated murder. Defendant appealed, claiming numerous errors, including that he should have been granted a mistrial because the trial court allowed the prosecutor to testify during trial to matters that were improper and prejudicial. On appeal, the court affirmed and ruled that although it was a violation of Model Code of Prof'l Responsibility DR 5-102(A) for the prosecutor to testify and then continue to represent the State, admitting the testimony was harmless error and not prejudicial to defendant because there was overwhelming evidence of his guilt.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the record indicated that defendant was advised of her Miranda rights on numerous occasions during her custody. Defendant was being advised of her Miranda rights when the statements in question were made and defendant volunteered the statements that were testified to by the detective. The second assignment of error alleged that a witness should have been permitted to testify about an exculpatory statement made by a co-defendant and that the trial court's failure to permit such resulted in a denial of defendant's right to due process and a fair trial. The court rejected the claim, holding that because the hearsay statement was presented without any indicia of trustworthiness and because no exception applied, the trial court properly refused its admission into evidence. Further, there was competent evidence presented that defendant had committed the crimes.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The patient, a 25-year-old epileptic complaining of stomach pain and vomiting, was placed on a hospital cart in the emergency room with the rails up, but was injured when he fell off the cart. At trial, the patient's witness to establish the hospital's liability had a bachelor degree in business administration and a masters degree in hospital administration. After the witness was allowed to testify, the trial court excluded his opinion testimony pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2743.43 and directed a verdict for the hospital. On appeal, the court affirmed. Section 2743.43, which limited expert testimony on the liability issues in a &quot;medical claim&quot; to certain qualified professionals, barred the patient's liability witness. The court also rejected the patient's argument that &sect; 2743.43&nbsp;unconstitutionally infringed on the judicial branch's inherent power under the separation of powers doctrine in Ohio Const. art. IV, &sect; 5(B). The competency of witnesses had frequently been addressed by the legislature and such enactments were enforced by the judiciary. Section 2743.43 was identical to Ohio R. Evid. 601(D) and, as a remedial rule of procedure, applied to pending causes of action.</SPAN></P>

The court found that defendants' convictions were supported by sufficient evidence to satisfy the requirements of due process, and that the State had produced voluminous testimonial and documentary evidence that corroborated the version of the conspiracy to kill the mobster as related by three major witnesses.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Commission revoked the club's license due to the fact that one of the club's agents and employees discharged a firearm on the club's premises, killing one person and wounding two others. The club claimed that the regulation under which its license was revoked was unconstitutional and that it should be held to be void. The court held that &quot;Regulation 1-52,&quot; promulgated by the Commission, was clear, understandable, and was not vague and uncertain. It was therefore a lawful and valid regulation. As to the claim that the regulation did not sufficiently apprise the club of the explicit standards needed to guide it in the proper supervision of its establishment, the court held that the club, by consenting to abide by the liquor statutes and regulations when applying for its license, had thereby bound itself to operate as the Commission believed was consistent with public decency, sobriety, and good order. Moreover, the Commission was not required to spell out in detail not only the proper attire to be worn in permit premises, but also to detail in its regulations the host of other conditions surrounding the regulation of the industry.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant violated her probation and the trial court adjudicated her a delinquent minor and committed her to the Ohio Youth Commission permanently. The court affirmed. The court rejected defendant's argument that the order that her probation was based upon was not properly admitted into evidence. Essentially, defendant claimed that a proper foundation was not laid. The court reasoned that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2317.40 did not apply to a judgment or order issued by a trial court. Further, there was evidence that indicated that the order was the one that was subpoenaed by the prosecution. Finally, no prejudice resulted to defendant from admission of the order into evidence. The court also rejected defendant's argument that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2151.01 required a hearing to be held on the probation violation prior to the expiration of the probationary period. The court found that defendant's construction of &sect; 2151.01 would make it impossible to convict a person if the violation occurred during the last days of his or her probation. Therefore, the court held that the hearing could be held after the expiration of the probationary period if the violation occurred during said period.</SPAN></P>

The State filed a motion for a dismissal on the ground that the expungement statute was unconstitutional under the full faith and credit clause of the United States Constitution because it undertook to confer extrajurisdictional powers upon an Ohio court. The State's motion to dismiss was granted and the applicant appealed from the decision. The State argued that the provisions of Ohio Rev.

A fight between them resulted in the husband's death by gunshot. Defendant was indicted for murder. At trial, the State produced evidence that the couple had been married for over 24 years and that the parties fought often, sometimes resulting in physical violence. The husband's friends, who drove him home on the night that he was killed, testified that they saw defendant beating her husband with what looked like a stick and that the husband fell down, unable to swing back at her. Defendant appealed her conviction. The court held that there was more than substantial evidence that defendant, beyond a reasonable doubt, intended to cause the death of her husband. The State established facts from which purpose or intent to kill could have been inferred. The trial court did not err in not charging the jury on lesser-included offenses. Since the affirmative defense of self-defense alleged by defendant, if accepted by the trier, would have constituted a complete defense to the crime charged, instructions as to voluntary and involuntary manslaughter would have been improper.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant sought review of a decision of the Court of Common Pleas of Butler County (Ohio) that convicted him of murder.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant was convicted of the murder of two victims. On appeal, appellant first argued that he presented sufficient evidence of either insanity or diminished capacity at the time of the offenses, due to heavy and continuous use of cocaine, to negative the existence of a purpose to kill. The court disagreed, noting that the State adduced contrary expert opinion testimony that he was sane on the date of the killings and was not suffering from toxic psychosis. The State also presented lay testimony that he appeared to be in a normal state of mind at that time. Thus, since reasonable minds could have differed on the issue of appellant's mental capacity, the question was one for the jury's determination. Appellant also argued that his conviction for each of four separate counts of aggravated murder was error. Here the court agreed and reversed that part of the order, noting the murder of victim one formed the factual basis for counts one and two of the indictment, and the murder of victim two founded counts three and four. Accordingly, the trial court erred in failing to set aside the jury's verdict on either of the first two, and either of the latter two, counts of the indictment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed his conviction by a jury of the Common Pleas Court of Belmont County (Ohio) for trafficking in lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), in violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2925.03(A)(7).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">An informant, who was wired with a transmitter device, bought LSD from defendant through an intermediary. The car in which the informant and the intermediary were riding was followed at all times by agents of the prosecutor's office. There was therefore no significant break in the chain of custody. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2925.03(A)(7) was a legitimate exercise of the police power. An expert witness that identified the drug had education, training, and skill not possessed by the ordinary layman, and thus his testimony was properly admitted for the jury's consideration. The expert conducted two adequate tests. One was a spot test and the other was a thin layer chromatography test. Both resulted in the reaction of LSD properties in the samples tested. The correction of an error as to defendant's age was not an appealable error since Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2967.20 provided a remedy. There was sufficient evidence presented and the trial court acted properly in not sustaining defendant 's motions for acquittal. The sentencing of the defendant to six to 25 years of which five years were mandatory did not constitute cruel and unusual punishment.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 2151.10, ordering defendant county commissioners to appropriate funds he believed necessary to operate a juvenile division and for reimbursement for legal expenses incurred by the action. The matter was tried as an original action in the court, and the parties stipulated that the transcript of the public hearing was admitted into evidence in the case.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The juvenile judge proposed that he should have sole discretion to set a budget and order funds from the commissioners, citing several cases in support thereof. The cases, however, dealt with the earlier version of &sect; 2151.10, which gave a juvenile judge sole discretion to determine the amount necessary to run a juvenile division. The amendment of &sect; 2151.10 changed the law. The court believed that the legislature intended to limit the remedy available to a juvenile judge in a dispute over his appropriation. Under the new law, a juvenile judge was held to a higher burden of proof. The determination of the amount necessary to operate a juvenile court was still within the discretion of the juvenile judge. But the method of enforcement, the remedy, had been changed. The court, thus, held that &sect; 2151.10 was constitutional. The court also held that the juvenile judge satisfied his burden of proof that the requested appropriation was necessary. Pursuant to Ohio Const. art. V, &sect; 6, the court ruled that the juvenile judge, in representing himself, could not be compensated for his service in the prosecution of the proceeding.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court granted the writ of mandamus ordering the commissioners to appropriate a certain sum for the operation of the juvenile court for the year in issue.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff suburbs filed a petition seeking regionalization of a county water supply system owned by defendant city. The Court of Appeals for Cuyahoga County (Ohio) granted the petition, as well as other requested relief sought regarding the system's supply obligations. The trial court also appointed a receiver to manage the water supply system pending transfer of its assets to the regional water district. The city appealed from the judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The city argued that the trial court erred in granting the regionalization relief pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code ch. 6119. The city asserted that it could not be incorporated into a regional water district created pursuant to ch. 6119 without its consent. The court noted that the statute did not speak to whether the area of the proposed region could include territory lying within a subdivision that had not signed the petition brought by the suburbs. The suburbs asserted that Ohio Rev. Code &sect; 6119.04 allowed for such a contingency. The court noted that under Ohio Const. art. XVIII, &sect; 4 the legislature had no power to limit or restrict the power and authority of a municipality to operate a public utility. Therefore, the court sustained the city's argument. The court stated that equity's flexible reach would find the power to install a temporary receiver to implement remedial orders relating to specific performance of water supply obligations and abatement of nuisances. The court held that further inquiry was necessary to update the information on the condition of the water system to determine whether a receivership was justified to implement the remedial orders.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judgment was remanded for an update on the state of the water system, and for consideration of appropriate remedies including the possibility of a temporary systemwide receivership.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In a consolidated appeal, defendants challenged their convictions in the Akron Municipal Court (Ohio), for operating a motor vehicle under the influence of alcohol. Defendants argued that testimony, exhibits, and intoxilyzer results were improperly admitted because the tests were improperly administered and that jury instructions on the presumption of guilt in Ohio Rev. Code &sect; 4511.19 deprived them of due process.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants were arrested separately by the same officer, who administered intoxilyzer tests to each defendant. In both cases, the test results were in excess of the percentage established under &sect; 4511.19(B) for a presumption to arise. Accordingly, defendants were presumed to be under the influence of alcohol. Both cases resulted in guilty verdicts. The cases were consolidated on appeal, and the court affirmed. Section 4511.19 did not require a report of concentration by weight of alcohol in the blood to be measured in terms greater or less than hundredths of a percent. The third digit was required to be used in calibration of the intoxilyzer, not in determining the presumption of intoxication. If there was error in failing to place the calibration liquid under refrigeration, it was a harmless in view of the testimony of the arresting officer. Independent of the tests, the officer's opinion was that both defendants were under the influence of alcohol when they operated their motor vehicles. There was a rational connection between the fact of intoxication and the presumption of intoxication in &sect; 4511.19. Accordingly, defendants were not denied due process by the presumption.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed defendants' convictions, and it ordered that a special mandate issue to the trial court to carry out the judgments to execution.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant book store appealed from its conviction in the Hamilton County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio) for engaging in organized crime in violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2923.04. Defendant individuals appealed from their convictions for pandering obscenity contrary to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2907.32. The trial court had overruled defendants' motions to dismiss the indictment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A search warrant for the store's delivery van had been issued and executed. The materials seized provided the evidence for the convictions. The bookstore argued that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2923.04 was unconstitutional. The court reversed the conviction and dismissed the bookstore. Section 2923.04 failed to establish ascertainable standards of guilt and was, therefore, void for vagueness under the Due Process Clause of U.S. Const. amend. XIV. The individuals argued that the search warrant was invalid because it authorized a sweeping, open-ended, mass seizure of presumptively protected First Amendment material. The court reversed the conviction and remanded for further proceedings against the individuals. The court held that the search warrant was unconstitutionally overbroad and that the trial court erred in overruling the motion to suppress evidence secured as a result of its execution. Based on the conclusory statement of the police investigator that other similarly obscene materials would be found at the store, the warrant impermissibly left it entirely to the discretion of the officials conducting the search to decide what items were obscene and to accomplish their seizure.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the judgment of conviction as to the bookstore and dismissed the bookstore.

XIV and Ohio Const. art I, &sect;&sect; 2 and 16 upon its face or as applied to members of defendant state teachers retirement system who had prior teaching service outside the United States.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The professor retired, having contributed to the system for 25 years.

The professor sued, and the trial court upheld &sect; 3307.32. On appeal, he contended that &sect; 3307.32 improperly discriminated against members who had prior foreign teaching experience by denying them the right to purchase additional credit for such experience while permitting those with service in other states or with the federal government to purchase additional credit for such experience. The court disagreed and affirmed. There was no unconstitutional discrimination. Before the amendment, he could have purchased credit for his Canadian service. He failed to do so and applied only after he was no longer eligible.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The applicant brought a taxpayer's action to obtain mandamus and injunctive relief after he was removed from consideration for a firefighter's position.

The trial court dismissed that portion of the claim brought under &sect; 4112.02(A) and awarded the Commission summary judgment on the rest of the applicant's claim. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment and held that because the trial court had the authority to determine the issues raised by the applicant, mandamus was not the proper remedy. The court further determined that where a statute set forth a specific complaint procedure and a specific remedy for the enforcement of the ordinance, that remedy was exclusive. Therefore, the court concluded that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4112.05(B), which provided for review by the Ohio Civil Rights Commission, was the exclusive remedy for the enforcement of Ohio Rev.

He contended that the application of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3767.11 was premature, that affidavits of police officers had no probative value in establishing a nuisance under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3767.05, and that he conducted a lawful business.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was found guilty of promoting prostitution and of possession of criminal tools. The court of appeal affirmed that judgment. After the conclusion of the criminal trial, the current action was brought pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3767, and the trial court enjoined defendant's business operation. The court rejected defendant's contention that the proceedings under &sect; 3767.11 were premature because the judgment in his criminal case had been appealed. At the time of the court's decision in the current case, that issue was moot because the criminal judgment had been affirmed on appeal. The court also found that the trial court had jurisdiction independent of &sect; 3767.11 because the abatement action was brought after the criminal prosecution. Further, because the application of &sect; 3767.11 was not improper, the injunction imposed by the trial court did not constitute a taking of property without due process of law. Finally, the court's affirmance of the trial court's criminal case disposed of the issue of whether the activity of the business was adult conversation or prostitution. There was no constitutional protection of that act merely because it was done in private.</SPAN></P>

The bank filed suit and was awarded damages. Thereafter, the trial court overruled the corporation's motion for relief from judgment. The corporation appealed, asserting that the trial court erred in denying its motion for relief from judgment, that the agreement failed to designate a definite sum of money, that the judgment was for more money than was due, and that the cognovit clause was unconstitutional and violated due process of law. The court affirmed the judgment, holding that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the corporation's motion because its supporting affidavit failed to state operative facts demonstrating a defense or that the corporation was entitled to relief under Ohio R. Civ. P. 60(B)(5). The court concluded that the corporation's other three assignments of error were raised for the first time on appeal and therefore, were not properly preserved for review.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court dealt with the issue of whether the judgment of the United States Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals, granting habeas corpus relief to the prisoner, was res judicata as to the issue of whether he was unlawfully incarcerated by the State. The court found that the State had agreed through special legislation to be liable to the prisoner only upon proof of unlawful incarceration. The prisoner was granted a writ of habeas corpus in federal court because he was deprived of his constitutional right to effective assistance of counsel. The court concluded that the issue of unlawful incarceration was determined against the State in the habeas corpus action. Therefore, the court concluded that by virtue of the binding effect of the determination of unlawful incarceration in the habeas corpus action, there was proof by a preponderance of the evidence that the prisoner was unlawfully incarcerated by the State. The court held that the trial court failed to follow the mandate of the Ohio General Assembly in concluding that the prisoner had no lawful cause of action.</SPAN></P>

Defendant, guilty of an offense classified in Ohio as a felony of the second degree, was sentenced to an indeterminate term of confinement in the penitentiary for 5-15 years.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant allegedly threatened a woman in a laundry with a knife and attacked her when she tried to flee. A request that the jury be charged on lesser included offenses was denied. The court noted that when two jurors overheard a bench conference on the issue of lesser included offenses, it threatened the jury's impartiality when their confusion created a predisposition toward defendant's guilt. The court observed that a mistrial was supported by the requisite high degree of necessity. The court found that statements a third party made to the victim were offered not for their truth, but to demonstrate what effect they had on the victim, so they were admissible and were not hearsay. The court held that given the circumscribed nature of the prosecutor's inquiry and the limiting instructions to the jury, admitting testimony about prior convictions was not error. The court concluded the jury was entitled to conclude that defendant attempted to cause physical harm with a knife, and placing the weapon in a back pocket after menacing the victim with it was sufficient, in view of the ensuing struggle during which it was ready for use, to preclude a finding that only an attempt was made.</SPAN></P>

The court held that: (1) to maintain an action under &sect; 2721.03, one must be a &quot;person;&quot; (2) a city council was not included within the definition of &quot;person&quot; in Ohio Rev.

The City's ordinance was nearly identical to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2917.11. Defendant allegedly engaged in turbulent behavior with his sister and her boyfriend at a nightclub, and ceased to desist from his behavior after being reasonably warned.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On appeal, defendant argued that the trial court erred in failing to dismiss the complaint against defendant on the grounds that the portion of Ohio Rev.

Defendant also contended that the trial court erred in convicting defendant because the evidence presented was insufficient to warrant a conviction. The issue was whether &quot;engaging in turbulent behavior&quot; was sufficiently definite to inform men of common intelligence as to its exact meaning or permit erratic arrests and convictions. While the court did not condone defendant's vulgar use of language and his actions on the night in question, the court concluded that the term &quot;turbulent behavior&quot; was not sufficiently definite to inform those of common intelligence of the point at which their conduct became impermissible and a violation of the ordinance.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was charged with and convicted of drug trafficking, drug abuse, and having a weapon while under a disability. On appeal, defendant argued that the trial court erroneously denied his motion to suppress the evidence found by the police during a search of a house in which he was arrested. The search was conducted pursuant to a search warrant. The court rejected defendant's argument and pointed out that the affidavit in support of the search warrant was sufficient because it stated that the informant had supplied information in the recent past that had led to the arrest of drug abusers. The court also found that defendant's failure to answer the police officers' knock at the door for several minutes justified the use of force to enter the premises to conduct the search. Defendant also argued that the trial court erroneously failed to grant his motion for acquittal pursuant to Ohio R. Crim. P. 29. The court pointed out that the fact that defendant was present when the search was conducted and when the drugs were found and lived at the premises for approximately seven years were sufficient reasons for the trial court to deny the motion for acquittal.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Relator county prosecuting attorney brought actions in mandamus and prohibition against respondent county judge seeking an order requiring the judge to enter a judgment of guilty of rape against a defendant in a criminal case. Defendant had pled &quot;no contest&quot; to the crime of rape, but, instead of entering a guilty judgment, the judge had made an oral finding that defendant was guilty of attempted rape only.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The State argued that the judge lacked the authority to reducing the rape charge to attempted rape after defendant had entered a plea of no contest because, pursuant to Ohio R. Crim. P. 11(B)(2), a plea of no contest was an admission of the truth of the facts alleged in the indictment. The court agreed and granted the petition for a writ of mandamus. The court denied the petition for a writ of prohibition, finding that, as a result of the issuance of the writ of mandamus, that it was moot. The court opined that when a plea of &quot;no contest&quot; was entered to an indictment charging a felony, the trial court had no authority to find a defendant guilty of a lesser offense on such a plea. Although the judge had not issued a final judgment, but had merely made an oral pronouncement, the court concluded that the oral pronouncement had legal effect and, as such, that the State was entitle to pursue a writ of mandamus and/or a writ of prohibition. The court explained that if the State waited until a final judgment was entered, double jeopardy would prevent it from pursuing its writs. The court found, however, that the issuance of either writ would not expose defendant to double jeopardy.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court issued a writ of mandamus ordering the judge to enter a judgment of guilty of rape in defendant's underlying criminal trial. The court denied the petition for a writ of prohibition.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed a decision by the Common Pleas Court (Ohio), which convicted defendant of the offenses of aggravated robbery, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2911.01, carrying a concealed weapon, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2923.12, and robbery, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2911.02.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">These appeals by defendant were from convictions in the trial court for the offenses of aggravated robbery, carrying a concealed weapon, and robbery. The court held that the trial court erred in allowing defendant's convictions for carrying a concealed weapon and aggravated robbery to stand because they were offenses of similar import. The court found that the aggravated robbery charge and the carrying a concealed weapon charge merges and, therefore, defendant's first assignment of error was sustained. The court stated that the entering of a plea of guilty by defendant admitted to all the facts alleged in the indictment, which, in this case, stated an offense of, aggravated robbery. In such a case, defendant thereby admitted committing the offense of robbery as a lesser-included offense. The statement made by the prosecution was for the benefit of the trial court in imposing sentence. Such statement by the prosecution was not the offense to which a plea was made by defendant. In the event of plea bargaining, the statement of the prosecutor might have recited an offense even more serious than that to which a plea had been entered.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed and remanded defendant's conviction for carrying a concealed weapon and aggravated robbery. In all other respects, the court affirmed the judgment of conviction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court entered an order liquidating the insurer.

The trial court subsequently ordered that distribution of the insurer's assets was to be made in accordance with the amendments to &sect;&sect; 3903.18 and 3903.23. The creditors contended that they had priority claims against the insurer that were adversely affected by the retroactive application of the amendments to &sect;&sect; 3903.18 and 3903.23. The creditors also contended that they had a vested substantive right to share in the insurer's estate and that using the amendments to &sect; 3903.18 was an unconstitutional retroactive law in violation of Ohio Const. art. 2, &sect; 28, and U.S. Const. amend.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A police officer determined that that the husband had been driving suspiciously and stopped the husband's car in his driveway. While the officer was writing a ticket for driving without a license, the wife came out of the house. When the officer stated that he was going to take the car as evidence, the wife told the officer that he could not do so because she owned the car it and had allowed the husband to drive it. An altercation between the officer and the husband and wife ensued. The husband was convicted of driving without a license and the wife was convicted of allowing an unlicensed driver to use her car. Both defendants were convicted of resisting arrest and assault. Defendants claimed on appeal that the case should have been dismissed for discovery violations, that there was insufficient evidence to support the convictions, and that they were justified in resisting arrest because the officer had used excessive force. The court ruled that defendants' discovery violations were waived because they did not comply with Ohio R. Crim. P. 16 and that the evidence was sufficient to support the convictions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The claimant was injured at work and filed an application for an additional award pursuant to Ohio Rev.

Code &sect;&sect; 4109.12(D), 4109.12(U), and that he was injured as the result of the hazard of such employment. The Commission found in his favor. The State, on behalf of the employer, brought an action in the trial court seeking a writ of mandamus against the Commission, but the trial court, instead, found for the State on the ground that Ohio Rev. Code &sect; 4128.89 was unconstitutional in so far as it mandated additional awards in excess of the percentages fixed by Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 35.

As to the claim by the State that the evidence was insufficient to permit a finding of a violation of Ohio Rev.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant, Harrison Hills (Ohio) City School District Board of Education, sought review of the judgment from a trial court (Ohio), finding in favor of appellee teacher in the teacher's action based on the Board's denial of sick leave. The Board contended that the teacher should have been barred from the trial court because she had not exhausted remedies available to her under the collective bargaining agreement between the union and the Board.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Board also contended that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3319.141 was invalid because it granted females as a group a benefit that men could not have received. The teacher was a member of a collective bargaining unit. As of August 11, 1978, the teacher had accumulated 18 1/2 of sick leave. On that date the teacher sent a letter to the Board requesting maternity leave commencing September 21, 1978 and further noting that she was using her 18 1/2 days of sick leave beginning August 25, 1978, the start of the school year. The superintendent of the Board responded by letter on August 14, 1978 that he would recommend a year's leave of absence. In affirming the judgment of the trial court, the court noted that under &sect; 3319.141, the teacher could have used sick leave for absence due to pregnancy. When the Board denied sick leave to the teacher, it was denying her a statutory right not a contractual right. Upon a review of all of the facts, the Board had no choice but to grant the requested sick leave and its denial was not a breach of contract but an illegal act. The trial court was without jurisdiction to consider the validity of &sect; 3319.141 because the attorney general was not served.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was charged with gambling, organized crime, and possessing criminal tools. At his trial, evidence seized from defendant's business included totalizers, sport sheets, water soluble paper, telephone recording devices, and a bucket of water.

He was convicted and sentenced, notwithstanding his contention that sentencing him on the three convictions violated double jeopardy principals, and thereafter he appealed. The court affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded. The court agreed with defendant that the organized crime statute was unconstitutional, citing controlling precedent. It rejected his contention that the criminal tools statute defined an inchoate crime for which conviction and sentence were barred by his gambling conviction, finding the types of tools barred by the criminal tools statute to be omitted from the gambling statute. It further held that double jeopardy did not bar his convictions for gambling and possession of criminal tools, as their elements were different.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellants, a city and its board of zoning appeals, challenged the judgment of the Court of Common Pleas of Medina County (Ohio) reversing the board's denial of appellee landowner's application for a permit to build a duplex on a lot he owned in the city.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court found that the board of zoning appeals based its denial of the landowner's permit application upon a zoning ordinance, which rezoned the landowner's property, that was &quot;unconstitutional.&quot; Affirming the trial court's judgment, the court observed that the trial court's use of the word &quot;unconstitutional&quot; was probably an overstatement and concluded that what the trial court meant was that the city's ordinance was invalid because it was improperly adopted or because it was adopted without a notice of a public hearing being published. The court noted that the zoning ordinance in question did not purport to repeal prior zoning ordinances but, instead, purported to amend a prior ordinance. The court concluded that municipal ordinances, like statutes, could not be repealed by an ordinance that was not properly adopted. Thus, the court found that the prior ordinance could still be effective or that other zoning provisions could exist that controlled the issuance of a building permit in this case. Accordingly, the trial court properly reversed the decision of the board of zoning appeals even though it used an incorrect word in describing why it did so.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The employee was a sanitary policeman for the city.

The PERS appealed the judgment of the trial court claiming that the employee failed to state a claim upon which relief could have been granted. The court held that under the State court decision, the employee was entitled to have been enrolled in the PERS and that the city had the duty to make the appropriate contributions. Although the employee was retired at the time he brought the suit against the city, the employee's right to have been enrolled in the PERS was acquired prior to his retirement and that he was entitled to enrollment under Ohio Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant shot the victim in a bar after drinking heavily. Defendant had sought help for his excessive drinking on many occasions. On appeal, defendant claimed that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2923.13(A)(4) was unconstitutional because a person of ordinary intelligence would not know whether he was prohibited from having a gun. The court affirmed the conviction, finding the statute constitutional. The court found that the words &quot;chronic&quot; and &quot;alcoholism&quot; had common ordinary meanings and that the statute was directed to persons who were addicted to the frequent, excessive use of alcohol. Whether defendant was a &quot;chronic alcoholic&quot; was a question for the jury to determine. The facts supported that determination. On a different point, the court found certain hospital records admissible because they did not concern treatment pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. ch. 372 and they were not covered by the physician-patient privilege because no contractual relationship existed between defendant and the doctor who saw him.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A landowner filed an application for a conditional use permit for permission to operate an auto salvage business. The application was denied at a hearing held before the board. The reviewing court affirmed the board's denial. The landowner appealed, contending that the trial court erred in finding that the denial was supported by reliable, probative, and substantial evidence. The court reversed. The court found that both the board and reviewing court relied heavily upon the testimony of surrounding residential landowners in rendering their decision. While the Sylvania, Ohio Township Zoning Resolution &sect; 1206.1 authorized the board to have given due regard to the nature and condition of adjacent uses and structures, undue regard was given to these surrounding uses. The area in question was zoned heavy industrial, and an auto wrecking and salvage operation was a consistent use in this zoning classification. The board and reviewing court also relied heavily upon a home improvement grant which was being considered of the homes in the area. The board and reviewing court impermissibly relied on factors not authorized by the zoning resolution in ruling on the landowner's application.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the judgment of the board.

The court held that defendant was fully aware of the reason for his arrest, despite the blank &quot;charge&quot; in the waiver of rights form. The court found that the trial court did not err in denying defendant's motion to suppress his oral statements because he had voluntarily, knowingly and intelligently waived his right to remain silent. The court found that two elements of the crime of rape occurred while still in Ohio, and that the victim's kidnapping, along with a demand for sexual acts under a continuing threat of death, was a substantial step in defendant's course of conduct, which culminated in the rape. The court noted that defendant was not prevented from a full cross-examination of his victim and that the trial court construed the &quot;rape shield law,&quot; found in Ohio Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was charged with trafficking in drugs, and although his initially appointed attorney had thoroughly prepared for trial, that attorney's late withdrawal and the subsequent appointment of new counsel with such new counsel having but two hours to familiarize himself with the facts, proposed witness testimony, and other aspects of the case, was, as a matter of law, a denial of defendant's constitutional right to the effective assistance of counsel. Although the case was reversed, in the interest of judicial economy and in accordance with Ohio R. App. P. 12(A), the court passed upon the remaining assignments of error. Defendant made no objection to the comments of the trial judge, so he waived any right to appeal that issue unless he could show the court's comments amounted to plain error. Although it would have been better had the trial court's comments been made outside the hearing of the jury, they fell far short of meeting the plain error standard. The court found that the Ohio Revised Code properly provided sufficient guidelines to allow an administrative agency to change Phencyclidine from Schedule III to Schedule II, and that that change was properly published.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant pleaded no contest to a charge of violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2923.04, Engaging in Organized Crime, for a conspiracy with 22 others to traffic in illegal drugs. Defendant reserved the right to appeal from his conviction on this count. Defendant also pleaded guilty to a charge of violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2923.01(A)(2), Conspiracy, for agreeing with others to furnish or administer cocaine to another. The trial court dismissed two other charges against defendant. The court found that recent Ohio caselaw held that the Ohio Organized Crime Statute,&nbsp;Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2923.04, was unconstitutional. Therefore, the court held that the trial court lacked jurisdiction to convict or sentence defendant under &sect; 2923.04. The court rejected defendant's second assignment of error, which contended that defendant could not be convicted of both organized crime and conspiracy to corrupt with drugs because both offenses referred to identical conduct and a single plan and agreement, thus constituting a single criminal act, because the court dismissed the first count due to the unconstitutionality of &sect; 2923.04.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On appeal, defendant contended that the trial court erred in admitting testimony regarding the police officer's identification of a substance as PCP, in permitting the State to cross-examine a witness with his grand jury testimony, and in admitting testimony of a police detective regarding defendant's refusal to talk to the arresting officer. Defendant also argued that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3719.44 was unconstitutional in that PCP was reclassified by the State board of pharmacy from a class III substance to a class II substance without legislative approval. The net effect of the change was to increase the penalty applicable to defendant. The court found that the trial court did not abuse its discretion or commit plain error in admitting the contested testimony. The court also held that &sect; 3719.44 was not an unconstitutional delegation of legislative authority to board of pharmacy to classify and reclassify controlled substances.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Relator individual filed an original action against respondent Court of Common Pleas, Trumbell County, Ohio, on a complaint in prohibition. The individual prayed for a writ of prohibition to permanently enjoin and prohibit the trial court from entertaining jurisdiction on a charge against the individual of aggravated murder in violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2903.01. A juvenile court had found the individual to be a delinquent child.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A complaint was filed in the juvenile court that charged the individual with being a delinquent child in that he had, purposely and with prior calculation and design, caused the death of another in violation of &sect; 2903.01. The juvenile court found defendant to be a delinquent child, and probable cause that he committed a felony. Thereafter, the individual was bound over, as an adult, to the trial court. He was indicted for the identical offense for which he had been tried and found to be a delinquent child in the juvenile court. The trial court overruled defendant's motion to dismiss the indictment. The court allowed the writ of prohibition. The court held that an adjudication finding a juvenile had violated a criminal law barred a subsequent trial on the adult level because of the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment. A delinquency finding in Ohio was such an adjudication. Sentencing, whether imposed or not, was not a factor for consideration in the individual's original action because the issue was that of double jeopardy. Initial jeopardy attached when the juvenile court, as the trier of facts, began to hear evidence.</SPAN></P>

That court specifically found that the charges with which the patrolman was charged were vague and inaccurate and that there was such little factual sustenance to support same that such charges were a nullity. The patrolman had been terminated for violation of rules governing members of the township police officers that provided that members should not indulge in any conduct unbecoming to a police officer and a gentleman, nor in any conduct subversive to the good order and discipline of the department. The court concluded that the common pleas court's conclusion that the charge against the police officer was vague was contrary to law. The evidence was such that it could not have been reasonably held that the dismissal order was unconstitutional, illegal, arbitrary, capricious, unreasonable, or unsupported by the preponderance of substantial, reliable, and probative evidence.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The City adopted Springfield, Ohio, Ordinance 71-239 that enacted Springfield, Ohio, Codified Ordinances ch. 171, which prohibited certain discriminatory practices and established a Human Relations Board to eliminate such discrimination. An employee of the newspaper filed a charge of sex discrimination against her employer. The Human Relations Board, following a preliminary investigation of the matter, found that it was probable that a discriminatory practice had occurred, and notified the newspaper of a public hearing. The newspaper filed the declaratory judgment action and obtained a temporary restraining order. The Ohio Attorney General filed a motion to dismiss and the parties filed motions for summary judgment. The trial court granted the newspaper's motion and found the ordinances unconstitutional. On appeal, the court reversed the judgment. The delegation by the City of executive and quasi-judicial powers was appropriate, and the ordinances properly limited the actions of the Board and delegated power to adopt and enforce rules and regulations necessary to implement the expressed legislative intent. No due process violation was apparent in the regulations.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant contended that Ohio Rev.

The court agreed, in part, because the Ohio Supreme Court had held that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2923.04 failed to establish ascertainable standards of guilt and was, therefore, void for vagueness under the Due Process Clause. Consequently, it necessarily followed that defendant could not be sentenced thereunder; and, to that extent, defendant's assignment of error was well taken. Defendant maintained that the facts indicated a violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2915.02(A)(5), making Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2923.24 inapplicable. The court disagreed, finding that the statutes recognized that the same conduct by defendant could constitute two or more allied offenses of similar import. When an act violated more than one criminal statute, the State could prosecute under either so long as it did not discriminate against any class of defendants. It followed that defendant's conduct could be found to constitute a violation of either &sect; 2923.24 or Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2915.02(A)(5).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was carrying a knife with a blade in excess of two and one-half inches, in violation of a city ordinance. On appeal, the court affirmed defendant's conviction. Defendant argued that the city ordinance was unconstitutional and that its enforcement was discriminatory. Defendant also argued that because the ordinance did not contain a specific mental state, recklessness was inferred and the city failed to prove that element of the offense. The court held that because the plain purpose of the ordinance was to impose strict criminal liability, there was no necessity to impose upon the city the burden of proving the culpable mental state of recklessness. As such, the court held that the city's failure to prove mental state was not fatal to its case. Despite defendant's argument to the contrary, the court held that there was no question that this prohibitory language was not so vague, imprecise, and indefinite as to be void. The court found that men of common intelligence could not differ as to the meaning of the prohibition contained in the ordinance. The court determined that the ordinance did not impinge on defendant's constitutional right to bear arms.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The patient alleged that the doctor was negligent in an operation on her knee. The patient prevailed in her suit, but appealed on the ground that erroneous jury instructions caused her to recover an insufficient amount. The court affirmed the decision of the trial court. The patient's injuries were not such that it was common knowledge that she would suffer future impairment. Additionally, the trial court did not err when it charged the jury that it could not award medical expenses for the treatment rendered between subsequent operations. The rule of law restricting married women from bringing suit for their medical expenses was discriminatory and unconstitutional. The instructions that the patient could not recover her medical expenses without proof of a separate contract to pay such expenses or proof of payment from her separate property, was erroneous. The error was harmless because the patient failed to prove that she was entitled to recover for any medical expenses whatsoever. In view of the fact that the doctor was entitled to a directed verdict on the issue of liability, the court held that it was inappropriate to remand the case for trial on the issue of damages.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A jury convicted defendant of voluntary manslaughter and aggravated assault. Defendant contended that the trial court should have admitted a copy of the victim's police record to substantiate the defense of self-defense and that the trial court erred in instructing the jury that defendant had the burden of proving self-defense by a preponderance of the evidence. The court concluded that the victim's police record was not relevant to the issues. Defendant did not know the victim's name or his past record at the time of the shooting at issue. Because self-defense was grounded on an accused's knowledge and experience with the assailant, the only relevant evidence concerning the assailant was that which tended to prove that knowledge and experience. The court observed that the Due Process Clause was not violated by a state provision that an affirmative defense had to be proved by a preponderance of the evidence. The court held that the trial court's prospective application of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2901.05(A) (amended 1978), which required defendant to prove self-defense by a preponderance of the evidence, was proper because the change in &sect; 2901.05(A) was procedural, not substantive.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiffs filed a medical malpractice action against defendants alleging that they had performed a tubal ligation on the patient without her consent. Pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2711.21 of the Ohio Medical Malpractice Act, the matter was referred to an arbitration panel. The arbitrators entered a finding in favor of defendants, and plaintiffs sought a trial de novo. On defendants' motion, the trial court directed that the arbitrators' decision be placed into evidence. A jury rendered a verdict for defendants. The court held that the arbitrators' findings were simply an expert opinion that the jury could accept or reject, just as it would any expert opinion. Thus, plaintiffs were not denied their right to a jury trial because the jury remained the final arbiter of the facts. Further, the legislature determined that Am. Sub. H.B. 682, &sect; 8, Gen. Assem. was a rational means of remedying what it considered to be defects in the health care system. Thus, the classification requiring the arbitration of medical claims furthered a legitimate legislative purpose. Accordingly, Ohio Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant participated in bookmaking. The jury returned a verdict of guilty on all counts against a codefendant. The trial court found defendant and another codefendant guilty. Defendant argued that the crime of engaging in organized crime violated his right to due process because it was vague and overbroad and failed to provide reasonable notice of the conduct it prohibited. On appeal, the court agreed. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2923.04 failed to establish ascertainable standards of guilt. Therefore, it was void for vagueness under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. Defendant failed to show that the trial court erred by not severing the codefendants' trials because there was no prejudice to defendant.</SPAN></P>

The court upheld the judgment. The court agreed with the trial court that there was no evidence offered to show that the employee qualified under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 1702.12(I) to assert a limitation on the employer's authority to terminate her employment. Therefore, the employee failed to prove a prerequisite to recovery under an ultra vires theory.

The city alleged that the trial court erred in determining that its regulations preempted the state's construction laws in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 3781.11, 3781.12, and 3791.04.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3781.10 the city was certified by the state building standards board to enforce the Ohio Building Code within the city. The city had also adopted its own building code that provided more restrictive standards for builders. After the builder's permit was denied for failure to comply with the city's code, it filed a petition with the board to revoke the city's certification by the board. The trial court affirmed the board's decertification, and the court affirmed that decision. The court held that although a city was empowered to enact local sanitary, and similar regulations, its power was limited to enactment of regulations that were not in conflict with the state's general laws. Thus, a city was without the power to adopt building regulations that conflicted with Ohio Rev. Stat. Ann. ch. 3781, 3791. Because the city's regulations placed more restrictive requirements on industrialized units than those mandated by the Ohio Building Code, they were in conflict with a general law. The court also held that because the city acted outside its authority in refusing to apply state law, the board properly decertified the city as its agent.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 2305.11(B), barred the action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The physician treated the patient's lacerated foot in the emergency room. Almost a year later, the patient returned to the emergency room for treatment of a secondary injury to his left ankle by another physician. The x-rays showed a foreign object imbedded in the previously lacerated area. Follow-up surgery confirmed that a shard of glass was imbedded in the patient's foot and that it could not be removed without severing the tendons so the surgery was terminated. The original suit was filed approximately one year later against the hospital, and an amended complaint filed several months later named the physician as a defendant. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's determination that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2305.11(B) barred the action. The court found that because the patient was over the age of 14, pursuant to &sect; 2305.11, he had to have filed the action against the physician within one year of the act of malpractice. The court also held that the statute of limitations could not be tolled for the failure to discover a foreign object that was already in place as opposed to an object placed there by a physician.</SPAN></P>

The employee requested partial disability compensation pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4123.57(C). The Bureau initially allowed the claim, but the Bureau later vacated its award sua sponte on the ground that it had been without jurisdiction to entertain the disability claim.

On appeal, the court held that the time provision of &sect; 4123.52 was unconstitutional as applied to the employee's disability claim.

Code Ann. &sect; 5577.04.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was carrying a load of gravel to a processing plant less than a mile from the driver's origination point, when an officer stopped his truck after noticing that the truck appeared to be overloaded. Defendant argued at trial, among other things, that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 5577.04 was unconstitutional. The trial court found that, because defendant's driving was wholly intrastate, he lacked standing to challenge the constitutionality of &sect; 5577.04 under the Commerce Clause. The court disagreed and, in remanding the case for a determination of the statute's constitutionality, found that defendant had standing to challenge it under both the Commerce Clause and under substantive due process principles. The court reasoned that the driver's activity was an interstate business because at least a part of the load would have been eventually shipped out-of-state. And, noting that &sect; 5577.04 set up limitations not related to safety or to possible damage to the highways of the State, the court determined that defendant proffered testimony tending to indicate that there was no rational basis for the weight classifications set forth therein and that a due process challenge was permissible.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the trial court's judgment convicting defendant of driving an overloaded truck. The court remanded the case for a determination of the constitutionality of the weight limit statute and for further proceedings. The court directed that, if the statute was unconstitutional, defendant was to be discharged. If the statute was constitutional, the trial court's prior judgment and sentence were to be reinstated.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant sought review of a judgment from the Akron Municipal Court (Ohio), which convicted him of a minor misdemeanor. Originally accused of assaulting a police officer, defendant was tried and found guilty of the lesser charge of disorderly conduct. The trial court refrained from imposing any fine, choosing only to order defendant to pay court costs.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued the trial court erred when it overruled his motion for a dismissal for failure to bring the matter to trial within the time period provided in Ohio Rev.

Code Ann. &sect; 2945.73(C)(1), and erred when it found that the facts substantiated a finding of guilt to the charge of disorderly conduct under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2917.11(A)(1), because that section was unconstitutional. On appeal, the court held that the hearing date was within the period prescribed in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2945.71 for the trial of first degree misdemeanors, but in excess of the statutory time mandate for the trial of a minor misdemeanor. The court held that when he was charged with a misdemeanor of the first degree and the trial of his cause proceeded within that period of time, defendant's cause was not subject to dismissal when, at the time of trial, the charge against him was amended to a crime of lesser degree. The court held further that because Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2947.20 allowed imprisonment in lieu of fine at a credited rate of $ 10.00/day, the sentence was not excessive.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant sought review of a judgment of the Common Pleas Court of Summit County (Ohio), which convicted defendant of five counts of aggravated trafficking in drugs and sentenced him accordingly. Defendant's motion for a declaratory judgment that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2951.041(B)(5) violated the state and federal constitutions was denied. The common pleas court overruled defendant's motion for shock probation and conditional probation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant contended that the legislature intended Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2951.041 to have been available to any person who was drug dependent that was charged with an offense. He alleged that by excluding a class of persons who were drug dependent from availing themselves of the remedies in &sect; 2951.041 solely because of the amount of drugs in their possession was an exclusion without a rational basis and constitutionally infirm. In affirming the trial court's denial of declaratory relief, the court held that the legislative purpose inherent in the classification was to punish those offenders who possessed large quantities of drugs more severely because they were more likely to have been dealers, or to have been capable of becoming such, or simply because the greater quantities presented in themselves a greater threat to society. Such a purpose established a rational basis reasonably related to the governmental interest sought to have been advanced, namely, curtailing the vicious traffic. Defendant's sentences required actual incarceration. Thus, until the period of actual incarceration was served, defendant was not entitled to conditional probation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiffs, who were engaged in various aspects of the used furniture trade, sought review of a judgment from the Court of Common Pleas of Franklin County (Ohio), which declared the constitutionality of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 3713.051, 3713.09 and the rules adopted thereunder by appellee Ohio Bedding Advisory Board as to the required sterilization of all second-hand furniture that was offered for sale.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In entering the declaratory judgment, the trial court declined to the find convincing the evidence as to the alleged crushing financial impact on the used furniture trade. Instead, the trial court concluded that it appeared from the evidence that sterilization could be performed at a commercially reasonable cost that did not constitute an undue burden on plaintiffs in light of the public health interests involved. In affirming, the court found that because there was rational basis for the legislation that furthered a legitimate legislative objective, namely the public health, safety, and welfare, the legislation was not violative of due process. The court noted that the defense had presented evidence that the cost of disinfecting mattresses would not be burdensome or exorbitant, some testimony indicating that the cost of chemicals could be as low as 67 cents per mattress. Even assuming it to be debatable as to whether the legislature should have first addressed some other phase of the problem or should have addressed all phases at once, it was a matter of legislative determination in the first instance, and did not render the classification unreasonable or unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant, who was 17-years old at the time of the offense, was tried as an adult by the Athens County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio) for aggravated robbery in violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2911.01. He appealed his subsequent conviction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After being robbed at a gas station, the victim called the police and gave a description of defendant and his car. Police spotted defendant and brought him back to the gas station. The victim identified defendant as the man who had robbed him minutes before. The court held that this confrontation was not impermissibly suggestive under the totality of the circumstances. There was no abuse of discretion in the juvenile court's decision to bind defendant over for trial as an adult. While Ohio R. Juv. P. 30(B) required a mental examination of defendant before the relinquishment of jurisdiction, it did not give defendant the right to an independent psychological examination. The court pointed out that the speedy trial time period described in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2945.71 did not begin to run until after defendant was transferred from the juvenile court to the trial court. Defendant's statement to police was admissible as defendant did not require the juvenile court's permission before waiving his right to remain silent. The trial court correctly ruled that defendant's juvenile record would have been admissible for impeachment purposes if defendant testified as to his good character.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed defendant's conviction.</SPAN></P>

The juvenile court found that he committed the offenses, imposed a fine, and ordered that he not drive a car without adult supervision. The court affirmed. It found that it could not address several of the assignments of error, as defendant failed to provide a verbatim transcript of the portions of the record necessary for review. It then found that it was not error to impose more than one of the orders of disposition set forth in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2151.356, as the juvenile court could impose one, some, or all of the orders of disposition contained therein, so long as the order of disposition was not so harsh as to constitute an abuse of discretion. Further, the different treatment of adult and juvenile traffic offenders was not unconstitutional, as the differential treatment was justified by differences in maturity and responsibility. Finally, even if adult and juvenile traffic offenders were to be treated similarly, the offenses with which defendant was charged related to reckless operation and his license could have been revoked under the statutes applicable to adults.</SPAN></P>

The firefighters challenged the ordinance, and the trial court prohibited the city from enforcing it. On appeal, the court upheld the trial court's order, holding that the ordinance was an incorrect interpretation of a previous order of the court in a suit between the parties. The court held that the firefighters who had accumulated in excess of 960 and up to 2160 unused sick leave hours on December 11, 1973, could always accumulate unused sick leave to that amount as they had a vested right in that amount of sick leave. The court also held that a retrospective law could not defeat that vested right.

In a previous order, the trial court had determined that the child was a dependent child because his father was a patient in a state hospital and his mother was a patient at a mental health center.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The child was born with defects requiring open-heart surgery and ongoing medical treatment. The natural parents had both been hospitalized for mental problems. The father was moderately mentally retarded, was dependent on the mother, and had a violent temper. The mother's intelligence was in the dull normal range. The trial court previously found that the child was a dependent child. On appeal from the order awarding permanent custody to the Board, the court held that the motion's allegations were sufficient to invoke the trial court's jurisdiction and to give sufficient notice to the parents to comply with due process. As they failed to seek authority to file a response to the amended motion, they waived any allegation of prejudicial error. The trial court did not err by failing to require evidence of real and substantial harm to the child before terminating the natural parents' rights. Sufficient evidence supported the award of permanent custody. The dependency standard in Ohio Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2151.04(B) was not unconstitutionally vague. Finally, the &quot;best interests of the child&quot; standard for awarding permanent custody was not a consideration in the adjudication of dependency.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 2925.03(A)(7), and her sentence of five to twenty-five years, including five years of actual incarceration. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that defendant's motion to suppress properly was denied because the search of a garment on her person was incident to a lawful, warrantless arrest. According to the court, the agents who arrested defendant were justified in doing so based on sufficient information, which was derived from a trustworthy source and which supplied the agents with a reasonable belief that defendant had committed a felony. Also, the court rejected the claim that the mandatory minimum actual prison term of five years was unconstitutional because it did not shock the common sense of justice or the conscience of mankind. Finally, the court held that because the trial court was required to impose a sentence of actual incarceration for five years, the trial court did not err in concluding that defendant was ineligible for conditional probation, pursuant to Ohio Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In response to two anonymous phone calls, police officers went to defendant's residence and searched a cistern in the rear of the house. They found a young woman's body. The trial court overruled defendant's motion to suppress. A jury convicted defendant of murder, with a specification, and attempted rape. The court affirmed, determining that the officers had a right to search defendant's cistern without a warrant because they were acting under an emergency situation that constituted exigent circumstances. The young girl had been missing for days and the police did not know if she was alive or dead in the cistern. The minimal intrusion by the officers in lifting the lid of the cistern to ascertain whether or not a body, dead or alive, was within the cistern was justified under the circumstances. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting graphic slides into evidence because the coroner testified that the slides were necessary to give a full picture of the victim's injuries.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The taxpayers refused to accede to an estate tax adjustment sought by the Commissioner that included their decedent's contributions to a pension plan paid as a lump-sum death benefit. The Commissioner claimed that the contributions were taxable under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 5731.09(A) based upon amendments to I.R.C. &sect; 2039(c). The court on appeal agreed with the probate court's finding that the Ohio legislature's attempt to incorporate future amendments to federal tax law into Ohio's statutory tax scheme was an unconstitutional delegation of legislative powers under Ohio Const. art. II, &sect;&sect; 1, 26 and that the appropriate application of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 5731.09(A) required disregarding the amended language. The court observed that the attempt to incorporate by reference future amendments to the federal tax code into the Ohio tax scheme vested the United States Congress with the discretion to change Ohio's tax laws. The court observed that the inclusion or exclusion of various items of property in a decedent's taxable estate may well be based on political and social considerations which had to be evaluated by the legislative authority imposing the tax.</SPAN></P>

The victim accepted the offer. On their way to the boyfriend's home, defendant stopped his truck in a deserted area and struggled with the victim. The victim testified that defendant struck her about the head and face and forced her to have sexual intercourse with him. While the rape was in progress, police appeared on the scene and arrested defendant. According to the victim, the episode in the truck lasted an hour and a half. Defendant testified in his own behalf that he had hired the victim to have sexual intercourse with him. The victim, during cross-examination, admitted she had once been a prostitute, but stated that she no longer engaged in soliciting. The court held that the evidence showed that the victim's detention was prolonged and secretive, and that she was subjected to a substantial increase in the risk of harm separate apart from that involved in the underlying rape. As such, the court found that defendant was properly convicted of both rape and kidnapping under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2941.25.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The police officer explained that he went outside with the two men involved in the altercation because, when the two men began arguing with him in the hotel's bar, he thought it would be better to attempt to reason with them outside. He claimed that his demotion and suspension were not supported by reliable, probative, and substantial evidence. The court agreed and reversed the judgment, explained that the police officer's act of going outside with the two men constituted evidence of a lack of restraint or discretion but was not evidence that the police officer acted in other than a gentlemanly manner. The court noted that in hindsight it appeared that the police officer made a very poor choice, but that it was impossible to know what the results would have been if he had chosen to remain in the bar and attempted to talk to the men. The court concluded that the police department's personnel requirement that a police officer act in a moderate and gentlemanly manner was no higher of a standard of care than that which prevalent among the general public.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellants, a zoning inspector and various municipal commissions (Commission), sought review of a judgment from the trial court (Ohio), which granted relief to appellee land developers in their declaratory judgment action to declare the Commission's zoning amendments invalid as not in accordance with a comprehensive plan.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Commission denied the land developers' request for a sewer tie-in to develop their subdivision without giving any reasons and had passed various amendments that changed the regulations affecting the developers' subdivision in contrast to the comprehensive plan. The developers' filed a declaratory judgment action, and the trial court granted all of the relief requested. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court concluded that the Commission's denial of the sewer tie-in without any justification was an abuse of discretion. Since the Commission chose not to make a permissive &quot;utilization plan&quot; pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 6117.01 for making tie-in decisions, it invited greater scrutiny of its decisions. Although stopgap amendments were not per se invalid, the trial court correctly determined that the Commission's zoning amendments changed the goals and the guidelines in the general land use plan and were not regulations enacted in accordance with a comprehensive plan for the purpose of promoting the public health, safety, and morals. Consolidation of the developers' actions against various boards and commissions was proper under Ohio R. Civ. P. 42.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant contended on appeal that his conviction was in violation of his constitutional rights and was contrary to the manifest weight of the evidence. The court found that the requirement of a similar federal statute requiring taxpayers to keep and produce records for the purpose of determining income tax had been held not to violate a taxpayer's rights under the Fourth Amendment governing searches and seizures. The court held that the requirement of filling out and filing a return and producing books and records by defendant did not violate his rights under the Fourth and Fifth Amendments. The court further found that Ohio Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 5747.02, which levied an income tax on every individual residing in or earning or receiving income in the state, expressly provided that the state's levy of a tax on income did not prevent a municipal corporation from levying a tax on income.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellee firefighter's union sought declaratory, injunctive, and compensatory relief in the Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio), asserting that Cleveland Heights, Ohio, City Ordinance No. 3-1977 was unconstitutional in that it &quot;stripped away&quot; sick leave that was accrued by firefighters under a previous ordinance.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The city did not amend its sick time ordinance until several years after the Ohio law regarding sick time for civil servants was changed. On appeal, the court held that the trial court did not err when it granted summary judgment for the union. There were no questions of fact because all the necessary facts were supplied by a fire chief's deposition, and the interpretation of the applicable ordinances and statutes were questions of law. There was no unresolved question of law because as of the date of the enactment of Cleveland Heights, Ohio, City Ordinance No. 3-1977, the accumulated sick leave hours that were computed under the prior ordinance were vested to the firefighters. Thus, Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 28, and U.S. Const. art. 1, &sect;&sect; 9, 10, prohibited the city's counsel from passing a retroactive law that deprived the firefighters of vested rights, as did Cleveland Heights, Ohio, City Ordinance No. 3-1977.</SPAN></P>

The trial court ordered the sale of the property and confirmed the sale after it had occurred. The landowners claimed that they were entitled to relief from the trial court's orders under Ohio R.

In order to obtain relief from the trial court's orders under Rule 60(B)(5), the landowners had to prove their motion was timely, had to set forth the reasons they were entitled to relief, and had to prove they had a valid defense to the foreclosure action. Though the landowners described the reasons that they were entitled to relief, they failed to set forth operative facts showing that their motion was made within a reasonable time. Further, the landowners failed to sufficiently show that they had a valid defense to the foreclosure action; there was no support for their allegation that the arrearage on their mortgage with the creditor was improper.

Accordingly, defendant was not entitled to invoke the constitutional guarantees against unreasonable searches and seizures. Defendant engaged in conduct that was likely to be viewed by, and affront, others within the meaning of the public indecency statute.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant landowner sought review of a decision of the Court of Common Pleas of Putnam County (Ohio), which affirmed a decision of the Planning Commission of the Village of Ottawa (Ohio) to grant a variance to appellee bank. Appellee Village of Ottawa challenged the landowner's declaratory judgment action as a proper means of review for the granting of the variance under Village of Ottawa, Ohio, Zoning Code &sect; 402.3.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The bank was classified as a neighborhood business under the Village of Ottawa, Ohio, Zoning Code, and it successfully sought a variance to use an adjacent lot for parking. The lot was zoned as residential property. The landowner successfully sought injunctive relief in the trial court in Case No. 77-104; the trial court held that the bank's variance was improperly granted and enjoined construction of the parking lot until it obtained a valid variance from the Planning Commission of the Village of Ottawa. The landowner unsuccessfully sought declaratory relief to challenge the Commission's subsequent grant of a variance to the bank and the trial court ordered the injunction dissolved. On appeal, the court reversed the judgment of the trial court, found that the variance was improperly granted, and determined that the rights of the parties were properly determined in Case No. 77-104. A potential appeal under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. ch. 2056 did not bar the landowner's declaratory relief action. The Commission exceeded its authority, as the variance constituted a rezoning of the disputed lot, and not a variance that was compatible with the lot's residential classification.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the judgment of the trial court and declared that the Commission's January 16, 1978 decision to grant the variance to the bank exceeded its authority and was void. The rights of the parties were properly determined by the initial decision of the trial court that found that the variance was improperly granted and issued injunctive relief in favor of the landowner. The court remanded the case to the trial court for execution.</SPAN></P>

The court held that under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2953.21, an action for postconviction relief was a civil proceeding. Delayed appeals in civil proceedings were not allowed pursuant to the Ohio Rules of Appellate Procedure. The court also reviewed the merits of defendant's motion for a delayed appeal in case they were in error in overruling the motion. The court determined that defendant's assignments of error had no merit. The court held that the constitutional issue raised by defendant in his petition to vacate his judgment could have been raised either at his trial or at his appeal from the judgment of the trial court. Thus, such issue was res judicata as between the State and defendant.

On appeal, the court found that the trial court based its decision on two grounds. With respect to the concession stand issue, there was no evidence that appellee deliberately attempted to violate the law. Concerning the two-game-per-week limitation, the &quot;grandfather clause&quot; of a statute as applied to appellee, was unconstitutional. The General Assembly did not provide appellee with reasonable notice of the amendments to the Charitable Bingo Act. The court agreed with the decisions of the trial court.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court, which had reversed an adjudication order of the Attorney General that denied a bingo license to the charitable organization.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the Court of Common Pleas of Defiance County (Ohio), which convicted her, in a bench trial, on the charge that while under indictment in another county on the charge of aggravated trafficking in drugs, and not having been relieved of such disability as provided in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2923.14, defendant knowingly had and carried in her possession a firearm, a violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2923.13(A)(3).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was indicted in another county for aggravated drug trafficking. Before she was tried on that charge, she was arrested for illegal possession of a firearm based upon the former charge. The trial court found defendant guilty of the firearm offense. Defendant argued that there was no reasonable nexus between an indictment for drug trafficking and the legislative determination that possessing a firearm while so indicted was illegal. The court affirmed the judgment and held that there was no law stating that the right of defendant to bear arms was supreme over the authority of the State to regulate the purchase of arms in a reasonable manner. Determinations as to what was illegal in the exercise of police power were largely within the exercise of sound discretion by the general assembly. The instability of persons or situations with respect to drug trafficking could have reasonably led to the use of a weapon by an armed person. Although defendant had not been convicted, she was charged with the crime and there could have been greater occasion and incentive for her to use a weapon illegally than would have existed were she not under indictment.</SPAN></P>

On the date of defendant's trial, the ex-wife indicated that she no longer believed that her ex-husband stole the car. The lower court entered an order of nolle prosequi. Defendant subsequently filed a motion requesting the lower court to expunge and seal all records relating to his prosecution, including police records of arrest. The lower court granted the motion, and the State sought review. The State argued that absent statutory authority, the lower court lacked jurisdiction to expunge and seal a case that was nolled when there was probable cause for arrest and indictment. On review, the court examined the provisions of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2953.32, the expungement statute, and found that the statute was not applicable to defendant's case. The court held that in the absence of statutory authority, records could be sealed and expunged only when there were exceptional circumstances in the case. The court found no exceptional circumstances in defendant's case, nor did defendant show that retention of the records would violate his fundamental constitutional rights.</SPAN></P>

The trial court found defendant was competent to stand trial and refused to suppress many of defendant's statements, but suppressed two of the statements. The court held that: (1) defendant was capable of a knowing, intelligent, and voluntary confession on the dates of certain of his statements that the trial court refused to suppress because the trial court committed no reversible error, based its decision on the testimony of a number of witnesses, and properly placed the burden of proof as to defendant's competency on the State; and (2) there was no error in the trial court's denial of defendant's motion for a directed verdict of acquittal because there was substantial evidence that supported the jury verdict.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In their complaint, the lodge sought a declaration of their bargaining rights under certain written agreements, constitutional provisions, and certain statutes and ordinances. The complaint alleged that the lodge was the exclusive negotiating agent of the officers and that the lodge and the city had entered into negotiation that concerned wages, hours, and conditions of employment. The complaint alleged that the city had terminated the negotiations. The city filed a motion to dismiss on the ground that the lodge and the officers failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. A memorandum that included attached exhibits was filed that opposed the motion. The court held that: (1) in the absence of a existing contract between the city and the lodge that gave recognition to the lodge as the bargaining agent for the employees, there was no justiciable controversy that existed for determination; and (2) there existed the possibility that a declaration of rights might be warranted as to certain causes of actions brought by the officers individually based upon subsequently developed facts as to their claims for sick time, overtime, and temporary promotional assignments.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant and his two passengers were stopped in his vehicle after he went through a red light. All three were removed from the vehicle. During a limited search of the car performed by an officer, two loaded guns were uncovered under the front passenger's seat. As a result, they were arrested and jointly indicted for carrying a concealed weapon. Prior to trial, defendant and one of the passengers filed a motion to suppress any evidence relating to the guns. At the hearing, the officer testified that he observed the individual in the rear passenger's seat duck down and reappear, and that only after that did the vehicle pull over. The motion was overruled and defendant was convicted. On appeal, the court found that the search did not violate defendant's Fourth Amendment rights. The officers had a reasonable basis for fearing for their personal safety. In addition, the search was narrowly confined to the area of the suspicious activity. An incriminating statement made by one of the passengers to his parole officer was not admissible because Ohio did not recognize a hearsay exception for statements against penal interest. The State was not required to show operability of the guns.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A police officer noticed defendant's unoccupied van, which was running and facing the wrong direction on a street.

Defendant refused and responded that the officer knew who he was. Defendant screamed, became abusive, and threatened the officer's job. Defendant was arrested. Defendant was released on bond, waived his right to a speedy trial, and trial was held nine months later.

The trial court found in favor of the city and the wrecking company and the owner appealed. The court found that &sect; 4513.63 was procedurally defective for failure to provide for the notification to the owner. The court found that that the vehicle did, in fact, meet all the requirements of &sect; 4513.63 and held that the city's failure to notify the owner that his automobile would have been destroyed resulted in no damages to the owner where the vehicle was later found to have been an abandoned junk motor vehicle.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed the decision from the Municipal Court of Lima (Ohio), which convicted defendant of sexual imposition. Defendant dispute the denial of a directed verdict because the conviction was allegedly against the manifest weight of the evidence. He also attacked the constitutionality of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2907.01(B), which defined an erogenous zone for purposes of sexual imposition.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">One officer in plain clothes sat down in a restroom area. Defendant sat down and began rubbing his knee against the officer. Defendant did not specifically ask for sex but made suggestive comments to the officer. Another officer witnessed the contact. Defendant contended that the statute was unconstitutional because it was vague and uncertain as to what was an erogenous zone. On appeal, the court agreed with the State. The officer did not have to be sexually aroused for a conviction for imposition. The court rejected the argument that reversal was warranted because an officer's memorandum only listed the knee touching and did not mention the thigh, which was the basis for the charge. In part, the other officer clearly saw the thigh touching. The court rejected the constitutionality argument for several reasons. First, the legislature had the broad police power to determine what was a crime. The determination that a thigh was an erogenous zone was a common understanding. Whether the statute was vague on other areas of the body would not be reviewed because the statute listed the thigh specifically, and the officer's thigh was the body part touched.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">When the mortgagee sold a parcel of real property to the mortgagors, the mortgagors executed a note and mortgage on the property.

After the sale, the bank informed the mortgagee that the mortgagors had ceased making payments. When the mortgagee learned that the property had been sold, he filed an action alleging that the mortgagors owed him under the note and that he should be permitted to foreclose on the mortgage. In his appeal, the mortgagee asserted that the foreclosure proceeding and the tax sale violated his right to due process. On appeal, the court held that the trial court properly granted the motion for summary judgment. The court held that a mortgage was not a constitutionally protected property interest that required that the mortgagee receive personal notice of the tax lien foreclosure action, an in rem proceeding.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant, who worked at a movie theater where obscene films were shown, appealed a judgment from the Akron Municipal Court, Summit County, Ohio, which convicted her for pandering obscenity, in violation of Ohio Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant had legally changed her name from a male to a female name, had worked at the theater under her male name, and her social security number was still in her male name. Defendant claimed that references to her former male identity were character evidence and were improperly admitted because she did not place her character in issue. Affirming the judgment, the court found that testimony regarding defendant's former name was evidence of identity, not character, and that her identity was properly before the trial court to establish the knowledge and participation required by &sect; 2907.32. The court was unable to find that revelation of defendant's conflicting gender identity so prejudiced the jury as to deny defendant a fair trial. The court held that testimony that the films were obscene was inadmissible because the trial court specifically found that the witness was not an expert, but that it was so vague, general, and lacking in basis that it could not have prejudiced the jury's perceptions while viewing the films. The court ruled that defendant's motion to acquit at the close of the State's case was properly denied because the evidence was sufficient to support a conviction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The nonprofit purchased 26 acres of real estate in the Jerusalem Township in which it sough to divide the property into two parcels. The nonprofit proposed to construct two residences on the property to be used as &quot;family homes&quot; for autistic persons. The two parcels were situated in an agricultural district. The Board denied the nonprofit's application for zoning certificates stating that the houses would violate Jerusalem Township, Ohio, Zoning Res. &sect; 3.23 in that the houses would not be single-family dwellings. The appeals board affirmed the Board's decision. On review, the board argued that there was a conflict with &sect; 3.23, which restricted homes for developmentally disabled to five persons and Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 5123.18, which regulated and licensed such homes and permitted eight persons. The court, however, agreed with the common pleas court regarding the lack of conflict between the zoning resolution and Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 5123.18(D) and (F). The court held that the limitation contained in the zoning resolution was a prohibition of what was permitted by the state law and therefore the nonprofit should have been granted a certificate.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff parents appealed the judgment of the Court of Common Pleas Hamilton County (Ohio), which dismissed their medical malpractice action against defendants, physicians and a hospital, in connection with the delivery of their child. The trial court dismissed the action, finding that it was barred by the statute of limitations under Ohio Rev. Code &sect;&sect; 2305.11 and 2305.09.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The infant, who died during the trial court proceedings, suffered severe brain damage caused by the negligent failure of the physicians and the hospital to recognize the symptoms of distress and to administer oxygen and undertake other emergency procedures in sufficient time to prevent or ameliorate the damage. Two causes of action were pleaded, one on behalf of the child and the second by the parents for loss of services, medical and other expenses, and emotional distress. On appeal, the court affirmed and held that the trial court properly dismissed the parents' action through application of the four-year statute of limitations under Ohio Rev. Code &sect; 2305.09. The court rejected the parents' argument that their action was preserved under Ohio Rev. Code &sect; 2305.16. The parents' action was not &quot;joint and inseparable&quot; from the malpractice action, within the meaning of &sect; 2305.16. The trial court properly dismissed the infant's cause of action because of the limitations bar under Ohio Rev. Code &sect; 2305.11. The court found that &sect; 2305.11 was constitutional and rejected the parents' contention that it was void for violations of vagueness and retroactivity.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted, upon a jury trial, of murder and appealed his conviction. On appeal, defendant argued that imposing upon him the burden of proof as to extreme emotional stress was an ex post facto application of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2901.05(A). The court determined that defendant was required to establish extreme emotional stress where at the time of the commission of the offense, he did not have that burden. Therefore, the court held that the trial court erred in instructing the jury that defendant was required to prove extreme emotional stress by a preponderance of the evidence because the requirement violated the Ex Post Facto Clause of the Constitution. Defendant further argued that the trial court erroneously excluded testimony concerning threats, which had been communicated to defendant in the period immediately preceding the indicted conduct. The court determined that defendant was entitled to present this evidence to the jury because the threats made or related to defendant was probative of his state of mind at the time of the killing. Accordingly, the judgment of the trial court was reversed and remanded.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After pleading guilty, defendant sought postconviction relief, claiming the plea was involuntary on account of counsel's ineffectiveness. In response, the State filed a motion for summary judgment and supported its motion with an affidavit from defendant's counsel, which stated that the charges and possible defenses had been discussed with defendant. After defendant failed to file additional evidence in opposition to the State's motion, the trial court granted the State summary judgment pursuant to rule 56. Thereafter, defendant sought review. Upon review, the court held that the general allegations of defendant's verified petition were insufficient to controvert the statements made by defendant's counsel. In so holding, the court noted that defendant had failed to show how counsel's assistance was ineffective. The court also held the record disclosed that the trial court had fully complied with the requirements of Ohio R. Crim. P. 11 in taking defendant's plea. Based upon the evidence, the court held that the trial court had correctly found that reasonable minds could come to but one conclusion, namely, that defendant was not deprived of the effective assistance of counsel.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The State conducted a sales tax audit of the corporation's restaurant and merchandise sales. The corporation asserted the &quot;test checks&quot; of three of its restaurant locations, which were applied to its other locations, did not fulfill the requirements of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 5739.10, providing that, in order to be valid, a &quot;test check&quot; had to be of the vendor's business for a representative period. The court determined that the test check agreement provided that the test check for restaurant sales was representative of the type of sales made by the corporation during the audit period. The court held that the results of the test checks of the three restaurants were properly applied to other restaurant locations not test checked based on the agreement and the corporation's admission that it was aware that the three restaurants had been tested and that the tests of the results would be applied to other restaurant locations in the same classification as representative of the type of sales made to the corporation.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant shot and killed the victim at a restaurant. Defendant asserted that the trial court erred in imposing upon him the burden of proving self-defense by a preponderance of the evidence in accord with Ohio Rev.

The court concluded that the application of &sect; 2901.05(A) to the case violated the Ex Post Facto Clause of the United States Constitution. The court determined that the instruction, that defendant had the burden to prove self-defense by a preponderance of the evidence, was harmless error. The court explained that defendant was the aggressor at every stage of the proceedings. The court found that there was insufficient evidence to raise a reasonable doubt concerning the issue of whether or not defendant was guilty of murder nor was there any basis for the submission of the issue of self-defense to the jury. However, the unnecessary instruction did no injury to defendant's case. The court determined that an instruction on involuntary manslaughter was not warranted because the record was devoid of evidence to show that defendant shot and killed the victim while under extreme emotional stress.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant's wife, who had filed for a divorce, claimed that he had forcibly kidnapped her, assaulted her, and raped her. At trial, defendant testified that there was no force and that his wife had consented to go with him and had agreed to making love. Defendant was convicted of kidnapping, rape, and assault, and he appealed, arguing that the trial court erred in refusing to grant his motion to dismiss the rape count because Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2907.01(L), which excluded spouses who were parties to a pending divorce action, was unconstitutional. He also argued, inter alia, that the verdict was contrary to the weight of the evidence and most of it was circumstantial. The court affirmed, holding that defendant did not show beyond a reasonable doubt that &sect; 2907.01(L) was unconstitutional. When a divorce action was initiated, there could be many reasons why the coverture of marriage should be suspended. The conflict in testimony between defendant and his wife did not mandate reversal, and a jury in Ohio could convict upon the uncorroborated testimony of the victim. The wife's testimony was not circumstantial, it was direct evidence by the victim of the crimes.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The mother commenced paternity proceedings against appellant pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code &sect; 3111.01 by filing a complaint that alleged that she was an unmarried woman who had given birth to a child, and that appellant was the father. Appellant appeared without counsel and entered a plea of guilty to being the father. The referee rendered a report that accepted appellant's guilty plea and ordered child support. After obtaining counsel, appellant objected to the report. The objections were overruled and the juvenile court approved the report. In challenging the judgment, appellant contended that because he was indigent, he was denied due process when he pled guilty without court-appointed counsel. The court affirmed the judgment. The court held that paternity proceedings conducted pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code ch. 3111 were civil proceedings, not quasi-criminal, as there was no chance of incarceration for indigent accused fathers on the basis of the inability to pay child support; therefore there was no right to court-appointed counsel.

Defendant claimed that he was denied effective assistance of counsel in that he was inaccurately advised that he would be eligible for parole in 10, rather than 15 years.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant entered guilty pleas to two counts of aggravated murder without specifications pursuant to a negotiated plea bargaining agreement. Defendant was advised by the trial court of the potential sentence before the plea was accepted and defendant was then sentenced to life imprisonment. The petition for post-conviction relief based on ineffective assistance of counsel claimed that defendant was told that he would be eligible for parole in 10 years when in fact he was not eligible until he had served 15 years. The trial court rejected this as a basis for post-conviction relief under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2953.21 and the court affirmed on appeal. Ohio R. Crim. P. 11 required that defendant be advised of the maximum penalty and the nonprobationable aspect of the crime, if any. The record in this case showed that defendant was so advised. There was no requirement that defendant be advised as to the date of parole eligibility. Furthermore, there was no promise of parole at a certain date, only the potential to eligible. Because the record showed that there was no ground for relief, the trial court did not err by denying the petition without a hearing.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was charged with felonious assault. On appeal, defendant contended that the trial court erred by instructing the jury that aggravated assault was a lesser included offense. The court rejected defendant's argument, noting that proof of provocation permitted the jury to find defendant guilty of aggravated assault. The court said that because emotional stress was an additional circumstance that mitigated the crime of felonious assault to the lesser crime of aggravated assault, aggravated assault was a lesser included offense of felonious assault. Defendant next argued that he was denied due process as a consequence of the trial court instruction to the jury that imposed on defendant the burden of showing self-defense by a preponderance of the evidence. The court also rejected this contention, noting that the instruction comported with Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2901.05(A). The court said that the requirement imposed upon the defense by &sect; 2901.05(A) did not deprive defendant of his right to due process and was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant motorcycle dealer sought review of an order from the Court of Common Pleas of Summit County, Ohio, which denied its request for a writ of replevin to recover three motorcycles and ordered the subject property destroyed because possession of it by anyone would violate Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4549.07.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The dealership held certificates of title to three &quot;homemade&quot; motorcycles. A police officer believed the motorcycles were stolen because of the obliteration of the serial numbers on parts of the vehicles. The dealership argued it had a right to rely upon the titles. The trial court found that under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4549.07, no one had a right to possession of the vehicles. Upon review, the court found that title, in and of itself, was not enough to demonstrate the right to immediate possession. The fact that the title numbers to parts of the vehicles had been obliterated weighed heavily in who had a right to immediate possession. The dealership did not meet its burden of proof and was not entitled to immediate possession of the vehicles. However, the trial court erred in finding the dealership in violation of &sect; 4549.07 and ordering the destruction of the motorcycles because they were criminal statutes and it essentially found the dealership guilty of a crime. The court held that the trial court could order the destruction of those parts with defaced or obliterated serial numbers under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2933.41(C)(2). The court modified the trial court's order accordingly.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the trial court's decision denying the dealership the immediate possession of the motorcycles as three distinct and complete units. The court modified the part of the order calling for the total destruction of the vehicles and held that only parts containing defaced or obliterated serial numbers could be destroyed. The items that did not fall within the category were to be returned to the dealership.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant employer alleged the concurrent negligence of appellees caused the accident in which an employee was killed. The employer further alleged that its increase in workers' compensation premiums was a proximate result of said negligence and demanded judgment against appellees for the increase in its worker's compensation premiums. The Court of Common Pleas, Cuyahoga County (Ohio) granted summary judgment to appellees. The employer appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court granted summary judgment to appellees. On appeal, the court affirmed and held that the trial court's judgment resulted in no prejudicial error to the employer. The court found that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4123.82 precluded the employer from recovering from a third party to reimburse it for an increased amount paid as a premium under the Workmen's Compensation Act even if the employee's death was caused by the third party. The court determined that &sect; 4123.82 did not infringe upon the employer's constitutional right to contract because the right was not absolute and it was subservient to the public welfare. The court noted that &sect; 4123.82 constituted a valid exercise of the state's police power. Appellee claimed that a contract between two of appellees in which one agreed to insure the other and hold the other harmless from liability for damages to third persons constituted a waiver of statutory immunity and that the employer was a third party beneficiary of the contract. The court concluded that the contract could not be construed to grant to the employer a right of recovery specifically denied by &sect; 4123.82.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant property owners sought review of the judgment from the Common Pleas Court (Ohio), which dismissed their complaint for declaratory judgment on the ground that the property owners had failed to exhaust their administrative remedies prior to seeking judicial relief. The property owners had filed an action against appellees, City of Lyndhurst and its building commissioner, alleging that the zoning of the property was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The property owners sought to use the properties for commercial purposes. However, the parcels were zoned residential. The property owners requested the City's planning commission to recommend the rezoning of the property. The commission recommended that the rezoning request be rejected, and the city council affirmed the recommendation. The property owners then sought judicial relief. On appeal, the court held that the trial court erred in finding that the property owners failed to exhaust their administrative remedies by not seeking a variance before the board of zoning appeals. The court held that there was no need to exhaust the administrative remedies because it would have been useless. The board had no power under Lyndhurst, Ohio, City Ordinances &sect; 1125.04(B)(2) to grant a variance from a conforming to a non-conforming use. Moreover, there was no reason to require the exhaustion of administrative remedies to simply challenge an ordinance's constitutionality. The court rejected appellee's argument that the action should have been dismissed for failure to serve the attorney general, finding that the property owners had served the attorney general within a reasonable time.</SPAN></P>

The administratrix claimed that the trial court erred in holding that the county commissioners and the engineer were protected by sovereign immunity from her wrongful death action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The administratrix's husband was killed when the car he was driving went off of a road and landed in a creek bed. The county commissioners, assisted by the county engineer had removed a bridge in an effort to make repairs. The administratrix failed to rebut testimony that the road was a township road and that the repairs were being made under an agreement between the counties and the township. On appeal, the court held that although the county commissioners' sovereign immunity was qualifiedly waived under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 305.12, the waiver applied only to negligence in maintaining county roads. Because the road at issue was a township road, the court held that the county commissioners were protected from liability by sovereign immunity. However, the court found that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 315.07 did not limit the qualified waiver of the county engineer's sovereign immunity to negligence in maintaining only county roads and that there was some evidence that the county engineer was negligent. Thus, the trial court improperly directed a verdict for the county engineer under Ohio R. Civ. P. 50(A)(4).</SPAN></P>

The taxpayer argued that the Board's decision was unreasonable because a sales factor that was based solely upon mileage did not adequately reflect the taxpayer's costs of performance so as to be authorized under &sect; 5733.05(B)(2)(c)(ii) and because the substitution of a mileage factor for the sales factor did not fairly represent the extent of the taxpayer's business activity in Ohio so as to be authorized under &sect; 5733.05(B)(2)(d). After examining the possible permutations of hauling activities based upon situs of such activities relative to Ohio, the court held that the calculations used by the Commissioner were correct. Specifically, the court found that the sales factor computed on a mileage basis more reasonably represented the measure of the taxpayer's income producing activity based on costs of performance in Ohio than did the taxpayer's inbound receipts ratio.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was a security guard in a store. A victim alleged that defendant committed a sexual battery on her when she was taken to an interrogation room for shoplifting. Defendant was convicted of sexual battery, and he appealed. The court affirmed his conviction. The court found that defendant had admitted a sexual act with the victim but that he maintained that the victim was the promoter of the sexual encounter to avoid prosecution for shoplifting. The court held that weighing the evidence and the issue of credibility was for a jury. The court further held that the evidence established all the elements of the crime if the jury wished to believe the State's witnesses. Moreover, according to the court, defendant failed to preserve the issue of whether &sect; 2907.03(A)(1) was unconstitutionally vague.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The applicant submitted to the attorney general an application for a bingo license as a charitable service organization pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2915.01(O). This application was preliminarily rejected. Pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 119.06(C), the applicant was granted a hearing. At this hearing, the applicant stipulated that it was not a qualifying organization under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2915.01 and argued exclusively that chapter 2915 violated the equal protection clauses of the United States and Ohio Constitutions. The examiner concluded that he was without jurisdiction to consider the constitutional challenge. An adjudication order was entered rejecting the application. The trial court affirmed the decision. On appeal, the applicant argued that the trial court erred in ruling that the statute did not violate equal protection. The court held that no fundamental interest nor suspect class became involved in the claim that the legislature's classification of those charitable organizations that acquired bingo licenses was impermissibly under-inclusive. The applicant failed to show that his right to equal protection of the laws was violated.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that contrary to defendant's contention in the appositive the trial court did not err in convicting defendant of aggravated murder in violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2903.01(B) because the evidence failed to show a causal connection between the kidnapping and the murder.

Sub. H.B. 475. The bill provided higher reimbursement payments to nursing home operators. State officials sent all Ohio nursing-home operators a letter regarding implementation of the bill. Six nursing home owners and operators filed an action against the State and were awarded higher benefits. The owners and operators in the instant suit were not parties to that action. Instead, the parties in the instant proceeding filed a separate suit seeking a writ of mandamus to compel the higher payments, but they filed their suit more than six years after the General Assembly had enacted the bill. The State argued that the six-year statute of limitations set forth in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2305.07 barred the action. The court agreed. The court held that: (1) the rights arose by virtue of the bill; (2) the owners had not instituted their action within six years of the passage of the bill; and (3) the statute of limitations barred the claim.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant mining corporation sought review of a judgment of the Court of Common Pleas of Warren County (Ohio), which granted a new trial on the issue of the constitutionality of a zoning code.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The corporation sought to establish that the township zoning code, which classified its property as residential, was unconstitutional as applied to its property. The board argued that the trial court erred in failing to place the burden of proof upon the corporation, that because the corporation purchased the property knowing that the zoning was residential it could not question the constitutionality of the code, and that the trial court erred in finding a provision of the code unconstitutional as applied to the property. The court held that the trial court erred in ruling that the burden shifted to the board once the corporation had presented evidence that its proposed use was reasonable. The trial court should have required the corporation to offer evidence that there was no reasonable ground for zoning the property residential. The corporation failed to establish that the code was clearly arbitrary and unreasonable, having no relation to public health, safety, and welfare. The corporation's purchase of the property zoned residential was merely one factor to be considered. The best interest of the community at large did not receive due consideration by the trial court.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants were charged with violations of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2907.07(C). Defendants moved to dismiss on the grounds that the statute in question was unconstitutional. The trial court granted the motions to dismiss. The state sought review, contending that the trial court erred in granting the motions to dismiss predicated upon its determination that the statute was unconstitutional. On review, the court agreed. The court noted that the authority relied on by the trial court had since been reversed. The court held that the test to be applied to determine the constitutionality of the statute was the usual standard of equal protection, whether the classification had a rational basis. The court found that the statute had a rational basis, it was directed against the solicitation of &quot;sexual conduct&quot; from subjects who were physiologically capable of engaging therein, who were beyond the age of menarche and puberty. The court found that the statutory scheme was neither illogical, nor lacking in a rational basis for its various age classifications, including, specifically, the classification in Ohio Rev.

Appellee Ohio Department of Mental Health and Retardation filed an affidavit in the Probate Division, Court of Common Pleas of Allen County (Ohio), alleging that appellant was a mentally ill person subject to hospitalization by court order. The probate court entered a judgment committing appellant to a State hospital pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 5122.11. Appellant sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The prosecutor from appellant's murder trial was allowed to participate in the commitment hearing and a psychiatrist called by him as a witness testified that in his opinion appellant had latent schizophrenia, borderline mental retardation, and a history of periodic excessive drinking, and to the effect that in his opinion appellant's release would constitute a risk to society. Appellant contended, inter alia, that the decision was against the manifest weight of the evidence and that the participation of the prosecutor and his witnesses should have been denied. The court found that while some of the evidence was remote to the issue of present mental illness and not entirely credible, the weight of the evidence and credibility to be given it was for the probate court as the fact finder and the probate court's decision was supported by clear and convincing evidence. In reversing the judgment of the probate court, the court found that the prosecutor had no standing to present the case that appellant was a mentally ill person subject to hospitalization and to call or examine witnesses on that issue.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was charged with a six count indictment resulted from three separate incidents. Among the items taken in the three burglaries, were three firearms. Defendant contended among other things that Ohio Rev.

On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that &sect; 2901.05(D) was constitutional and the trial court's charge on reasonable doubt was properly given. Moreover, the trial court did not err by denying defendant's motion for mistrial because there was no proof that defendant was denied a fair and impartial panel. Further, all the evidence presented was properly admitted. Additionally, because there was no gun admitted into evidence, there was no expert testimony necessary as to its operability. Finally, although the practice of allowing a police officer witness to sit at the prosecutor's table and testify, notwithstanding a &quot;separation of witnesses&quot; order, was not recommended this was an issue which was within the trial court's discretion.</SPAN></P>

The court also found that the child was emotionally disturbed and unable to cope with children her own age or relate to adults. The father argued that the child should have been placed in the custody of her paternal grandparents. The court found that the grandparents had not cared for children for 22 years and that the grandfather was not a blood relative to the child. The court reasoned that there was no showing that the grandparents were able to take care for a child with such special needs. The court also found that there was no error in the trial court's failure to continue the adjudicatory hearing until the father could be present because no attempt was made by counsel to secure the assistance of the trial court in obtaining the father's presence. Furthermore, the father had ample time to invoke the procedure to insure his presence but failed to do so. Therefore, the trial court's decision was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

The Akron police were not required to give Miranda warnings to defendant, who assumed an alias while talking with an Akron police officer. The court found the murder statute to be constitutional, and the jury received proper instructions. The evidence did not support defendant's claim of extreme emotional distress under Ohio Rev.

Upon review, the court reversed the judgment. The court held that the doctrine of comparative negligence was not the law in Ohio except where adopted by statute in certain actions, thus it was error to instruct the jury on comparative negligence. The court held that the jury was properly instructed on contributory negligence. Thus, the court held that the finding by the jury that the injured driver was contributorily negligent barred appellees from recovering any damages from the City, and the City's motion for directed verdict should have been granted.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The developers purchased the property in 1972. It was zoned for single-family residential use. They intended to construct multi-family dwelling units. The plans were approved. The City Council enacted ordinances that changed the zoning to multi-family use classifications. During the discussions, but after the zoning request had been initiated, the City adopted an ordinance, which--for the first time--required voter approval for all rezoning ordinances. The ordinances affecting the developers' property were defeated in November 1972 and May 1973. The developers sought a declaratory judgment in June 1973, which the trial court granted. The City revised its building code in 1975. Thereafter, the developers applied for building permits, which the City denied. The developers sought equitable relief, which the trial court granted. The city appealed. The court reversed. The state and municipalities could, within the police power, regulate the use of land and the construction of buildings and could change or amend such regulations. An owner of property had no vested right to use that property in any particular manner unless the property had been devoted to that use prior to the regulation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant's vehicle was parked on a street within the corporate limits of the City, and he did not have displayed a safety lane sticker as required by Cincinnati, Ohio Municipal Code 504-2. Defendant was issued a citation alleging a violation of the section, and he was subsequently found guilty of the offense. Defendant appealed and raised various constitutional challenges to the ordinance. Upon review, the court affirmed the judgment. The court held that first, defendant did not have standing to contest the constitutionality of the ordinance because he failed to demonstrate that he came within the class that he alleged was discriminated against. The court next held that the ordinance did not conflict with the general legislation or constitution of the State of Ohio, in particular Ohio Const. art. XVIII, &sect; 3. The court then rejected defendant claim that the ordinance imposed an unconstitutional burden on interstate commerce because it was clear that at the time he was issued the citation, he was not involved in interstate travel. Finally, the court found the conviction constitutional because defendant had the probability of notice of the ordinance.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant challenged a judgment of the conviction for possession of phencyclidine as a felony rather than a misdemeanor in the Summit County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Subsequent to defendant's conviction, he argued that the Ohio Pharmaceutical Board's action of changing possession of a controlled substance, phencyclidine, from a third degree misdemeanor to a fourth degree felony was unconstitutional. The power to make laws in Ohio was vested exclusively in the General Assembly under Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 1. The court noted that the legislative authority was non-delegable, but it did not mean that the General Assembly had to be the sole rule-making body. The key was that in providing for flexibility through administrative regulations, the General Assembly could not abdicate its exercise of discretion. Affirming the trial court's judgment, the court held that the standards imposed under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3719.44 clearly delineated policy and guided the Ohio Pharmaceutical Board in the exercise of its power. Therefore, the General Assembly did not abdicate its exercise of discretion. The court also found that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3719.44 was properly amended to change the offense from a third degree misdemeanor to a fourth degree felony. The amendment was published as a full text pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. ch. 119.</SPAN></P>

Defendant appealed, and the court affirmed. Defendant could not raise for the first time on appeal his challenges to the jury instructions. Under Ohio R. Crim. P. 30, defendant was required to object at trial to the challenged instructions in order to preserve the alleged errors for review. Defendant could also not challenge for the first time on appeal the aggravated robbery statute as unconstitutional. Defendant also contended that there was insufficient evidence that the gun he used was a deadly weapon. Under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2923.11(A) a deadly weapon was one designed for use as a weapon or that was possessed or carried as a weapon. Defendant's gun met this definition.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant sought review after the Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas, Criminal Division (Ohio), convicted him of having a weapon while under disability, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2923.13. The trial court earlier had directed a verdict as to possession of criminal tools and had denied defense motions to dismiss or sever the possession while under disability charge. The jury acquitted defendant of aggravated burglary and felonious assault.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Police officers arrested defendant. He had a hidden shotgun. The arresting officer apprised defendant of his Miranda rights and then questioned defendant, without asking him to execute a written waiver. The next morning, a detective advised defendant of his rights and asked him to sign a written waiver. Defendant refused. He also refused to sign a &quot;refusal to make a statement&quot; form and declared he was &quot;signing nothing.&quot; The detective then questioned defendant. The trial court suppressed statements made to the detective, but admitted statements made to the arresting officer. The trial court convicted defendant. The court affirmed. The admissibility of statements from the first interrogation did not depend upon defendant's behavior during the second interrogation some 22 hours later; nor did suppression of statements from the second interrogation render inadmissible statements from the first interrogation. The arresting officer had not been confronted with either a refusal to sign a written waiver or contradictory conduct. Nothing occurred that should have alerted him that the warnings given had been misunderstood. The possession while under disability statute was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Court of Common Pleas of Montgomery County (Ohio) in which she was convicted of voluntary manslaughter. Defendant contended on appeal that the trial court erred in instructing the jury that she must have proven self-defense by a preponderance of the evidence, as set forth in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2901.05(A) (amended 1978). The statute became effective after the July 1978 offense but before defendant's trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The former &sect; 2901.05(A), which was in effect at the time of the offense, placed the burden of raising an affirmative defense, such as self-defense, upon the accused. Under the amended statute, the burden of proving the existence of the affirmative defense by a preponderance of the evidence was placed upon the accused. The court reversed, holding that the retroactive change in &sect; 2901.05(A) violated the Ex Post Facto Clause, U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 10, cl. 10, and the prohibition against retroactive laws, Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 28. The amended statute placed a burden on defendant to establish an affirmative defense where no such burden existed at the time of the offense. Noting that self-defense was not statutorily defined, the court held that self-defense was not an unlawful act; thus, self-defense negated the allegation of unlawfulness that was required to be proven on a charge of voluntary manslaughter. The court declared the amended statute to be unconstitutional because it contravened the principle that an allegation of unlawfulness must have been proven by the State. Due process required that the State prove the absence of self-defense once it had had been placed in issue.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">One of the employees was suspended for five days from his employment with the employer, a state reformatory. The employee filed a complaint and alleged that the cause for suspension was never established because Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 124.34, upon which his suspension was based, was unconstitutional for lack of due process. A federal district court issued an order abstaining from ruling on the constitutionality of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 124.34 until the state courts had an opportunity to interpret it. The employees then sought a declaratory judgment. In affirming the decision, the court found that the Ohio General Assembly had vested final discretion as to the necessity of short-term suspensions in the appointing authority. There was evidence before the trial court that the employees were given an opportunity to present their side of the case during a conference. The court found that no due process rights of the employees were violated. A complaint that sought to test the legality, under the provisions of Ohio Rev.

The trial court did not commit error that was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt by permitting the State to make opening arguments before ruling on defendant's pre-trial motions. The court reasoned that because the identification testimony was properly admitted into evidence, the State's remarks regarding that testimony were not prejudicial. The trial court did not err in failing to enumerate its reasons for overruling the motion to suppress. The &quot;reasonable doubt&quot; statute,&nbsp;Ohio Rev.

Any error in the admission of a bra was not preserved for review. The use of the word, &quot;abduction,&quot; in testimony was proper because the witness was merely describing a conversation. The admission of photographs was not prejudicial. Other evidence amply identified defendants. Section 2907.02 was constitutional: its use of the terms, &quot;victim&quot; and &quot;offender&quot; was a mere semantic problem; relieving the state of the burden of proving physical resistance did not diminish the standard of proof required to prove each element of the offense; the provision for an &quot;in chamber&quot; resolution of any sexual history issues did not violate the right of confrontation. The record did not support the existence of error alleged with respect to the admission of testimony regarding the complainant's work record.

The court held that the husband's objection to paying through the Bureau was not before the court because of the husband's failure to comply with Rule 9(C).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In a replevin action, defendant county coroner appealed from a judgment rendered in the Akron Municipal Court, County of Summit, Ohio, in favor of plaintiff, the administratrix of a decedent's estate. The cause of action arose out of a suicide death committed by the decedent with a shotgun that the coroner took possession of and refused to deliver to the administratrix upon her demand for its return.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Pursuant to his duty under state law, the coroner took possession of the shotgun, and he then refused to deliver it to the administratrix. The administratrix filed a writ of replevin. A referee recommended that the writ issue on the ground that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 313.141, the statute under which the coroner claimed lawful possession, was unconstitutional. The trial court adopted the referee's report. On appeal, the court held that the administratrix need not have waited for delivery to be made to the police or sheriff department in order to institute legal action. Also, the court noted that no specific assertions, in the form of pleadings or motions, challenged the constitutionality of &sect; 313.141. Further, the record was virtually barren of any evidentiary basis asserted by the administratrix demonstrating the unconstitutionality of the statute or any corresponding justification by the coroner. The court held that the trial court failed to adhere to the requisites of constitutional scrutiny that where the question of the constitutionality of a statute was not directly raised by way of motion in the trial court, the trial judge was not called upon to rule on the issue.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed and remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with its opinion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

The court stated that under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 5711.18, a taxpayer's book value of its inventory was merely evidence of true value and would be taken as prima facie evidence of true value only when the Commissioner failed to find that the book value was greater or less than the property's true value in money. In the absence of an applicable rule or evidence to the contrary, the Commissioner and the Board had to accept the statements contained in the taxpayer's return, pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 5711.21. The statements in the taxpayer's return, being unrebutted by other evidence, became determinative. The Board's decision as to the taxpayer's property appraisals was based upon an erroneous interpretation of a directive of the Commissioner.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff sought to rezone part of his land. Pursuant to Brecksville, Ohio, City Charter art. IV, &sect; 12, the proposed change was submitted to the electors. The rezoning failed to receive a 55 percent favorable vote as required by &sect; 12. Plaintiff brought an action requesting that the trial court declare that the zoning of his land was unconstitutional and unreasonable and that &sect; 12 was unconstitutional. Plaintiff filed a motion for partial summary judgment on his claim regarding &sect; 12. The trial court granted the motion in part but held that the 55 percent favorable vote requirement was constitutional. The case proceeded to trial, and the trial court found that the zoning of the land as residential was unconstitutional. The court affirmed the trial court's finding that the 55 percent favorable voting requirement of &sect; 12 was constitutional because plaintiff failed to demonstrate that it was unconstitutional. Plaintiff failed to establish beyond fair debate that the zoning of his land was clearly arbitrary or unreasonable and had no substantial relation to the public health, safety, morals, or general welfare and thus failed to overcome the presumptive validity of the zoning ordinance.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant challenged a judgment from a trial court (Ohio), which convicted defendant of voluntary manslaughter, pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2903.03, after defendant entered a negotiated plea of no contest. Defendant was originally indicted for murder, pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2903.02, for the stabbing death of her husband.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued that the trial court erred when it overruled defendant's motion to dismiss the indictment because Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2901.05(D), defining reasonable doubt and the standards which the prosecution was required to prove to find defendant guilty, was unconstitutional. On appeal, however, the court upheld the trial court's judgment convicting defendant of voluntary manslaughter. Specifically, the court noted that it would follow previous rulings regarding the constitutionality of &sect; 2901.05(D). In addition, the court held that it did not find the definition of justifiable self-defense and the elements of voluntary manslaughter irreconcilable or mutually so similar as to efface and negate a valid case of self-preservation. Lastly, the court rejected defendant's claims that his &quot;speedy trial&quot; rights were violated. Instead, the court held that the delay at issue was occasioned by defendant's request for a sanity inquiry. Lastly, the court rejected defendant's argument that the trial court's judgment was not supported by sufficient evidence. Rather, the court held that there was sufficient reliable, credible, and probative evidence to support defendant's conviction.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The candidate claimed that the newspaper libeled him in an editorial commenting upon a prosecutor's decision not to prosecute the candidate for his alleged misconduct as a private investigator in recovering stolen property for his client. The editorial was based upon two previous news articles that reported that the candidate's actions as a private investigator violated Ohio law.The court held the proper standard was whether there was clear and convincing evidence that the editor had knowledge or conscious awareness of the probable falsity of his statements. Against this standard, the court held that the editorial in issue did not rise above an expression of opinion of statutory interpretation, and as such, was protected as a privileged comment. The court agreed with the newspaper's contention that the trial court erred in both permitting questions and charging the jury on the state's right-of-reply statutes as such statutes were unconstitutional. The court concluded that if the jury decided that the newspaper did not comply with these statutes, they could have reasonably inferred that this satisfied the requirement of actual malice.</SPAN></P>

The city sought review and contended that the trial court erred when it substituted its judgment for that of the municipal authority and that the trial court erred when it ordered the property to be rezoned. The court affirmed. It found that the trial court did not err when it found that the city's zoning of the owner's parcel was unconstitutional because the city's zoning was arbitrary, unreasonable, and did not bear a substantial relationship to the public health, safety, morals, and general welfare. Furthermore, in a declaratory judgment action, a court had the authority to declare the unconstitutionality of a zoning ordinance and to determine the reasonable use of the property under the circumstances.

On appeal, defendant argued that the trial court erred in refusing to grant his motion to dismiss the charge pending against him prior to trial. In support of his argument, defendant proposed four separate grounds for invalidating the statute under which he was prosecuted: (1) Cincinnati, Ohio, Mun. Code &sect; 503.31 violated the equal protection clause of U.S. Const. amend. XIV; (2) Cincinnati, Ohio, Mun. Code &sect; 503.31 violated the due process clause of U.S. Const. amend.

Upon review, the court held that the trial court should have granted defendant's motion to dismiss because Cincinnati, Ohio, Mun. Code &sect; 503.31 violated Ohio Const. art. XVIII, &sect; 3. The statute's regulation of access to city streets, prohibiting the operation of tracked vehicles, bore no real and substantial relation to the public health, safety, and welfare and, thus, contravened Ohio Const. art.

While defendant had standing to challenge &sect; 4301.69 on equal protection grounds, under the appropriate level of review it possessed the requisite rational basis.

The court found that the trial court had impliedly found against the auditor as to the declaratory judgment issues when it granted the writ of mandamus and that the taxes of one school district could be spread over the territory of the other without a remonstrance of the electors even if the taxes exceeded the 10 mill limit in Ohio Const. art. XII, &sect; 2. Further, the remonstrance petition authorized by Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3311.213 was a legally adequate remedy and was not unconstitutional, discriminatory, and overly restrictive. Finally, &sect; 3311.213 created an enforceable legal duty on the part of the auditor.</SPAN></P>

The court dismissed the indictment under Ohio Rev. Code &sect; 2923.04(a)(5) against one defendant because the trial court unlawfully accepted his no contest plea while the constitutionality of that statute was under debate. The court affirmed the rest of the trial court's decision, finding that the trial court was not required to weigh the evidence on a no contest plea under Ohio R. Crim. P. 11(B)(2). Also, the court noted that a motion for acquittal was not a pretrial motion and could not be appealed under Ohio R. Crim. P. 12(h). Further, the court found that evidence was not seized in violation of the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments. Defendants had not met their burden of proving that the challenged warrants were unlawful and the seizure of personal items did not invalidate the seizure of evidentiary material. The court held that Ohio Rev. Code &sect;&sect; 2923.04, 2915.09(A)(2), were constitutional and that defendants received adequate notice of the crimes charged.</SPAN></P>

Defendant claimed that &sect; 1707.44(G) was unconstitutionally vague and overbroad, that he had not engaged in the sale of securities within the meaning of &sect; 1707.44(G), and that the trial court erroneously admitted expert testimony and erroneously instructed the jury.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After filing a securities registration for their corporation, defendant and his codefendant began selling shares in the venture. Defendant explained the investment to potential investors, asked if they were interested in participating, and referred them to his codefendant who sold them the securities. The trial court allowed expert testimony interpreting portions of the corporate offering circular. The trial court gave a jury instruction on the nature and purpose of the Blue Sky Law but did not give an instruction on the elements of the offense under &sect; 1707.44(G). On appeal, the court held that &sect; 1707.44(G) was not vague or overbroad although it did not specifically enumerate what acts were violations because it referred to acts specifically enumerated in other sections of the Blue Sky Law. The court held that defendant engaged in the sales because he had solicited them. The court held that the instruction on the nature and purpose of the Blue Sky Law was reversible error because it was inapplicable to the case and was likely to have confused the jury. The court held that it was also improper to allow an expert to interpret the offering circular, which was a function of the court.</SPAN></P>

The trial court found that &sect; 1533.161 was unconstitutional because it did not bear a rational relationship to any valid State interest in the protection of wildlife and was violative of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. On appeal, the court concluded that &sect; 1533.161 was overbroad and went beyond a valid exercise of the police power because it lacked any rational, real, or substantial relationship to the public health, morals, order, safety, or general welfare.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff widow appealed from a judgment of the Court of Claims of Ohio, which granted summary judgment to defendant, the Ohio Department of Natural Resources, Division of Parks and Recreation, in her suit to recover for the death of her husband who was electrocuted while attempting to hook up his trailer to a state park's electrical system. The trial court found the State was immune from suit pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 1533.18.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On appeal, the widow alleged that she and her husband had paid a fee to the State to park their trailer in a lot at the park. Thus, she claimed, her husband was not a &quot;recreational user&quot; as defined in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 1533.18(B) and the State was not immune from suit. The court rejected this claim. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 1533.18(B), in defining &quot;a recreational user&quot; of a state park, included a person who paid a fee or consideration to the State or any agency thereof. Hence, payment of a fee or consideration to the State or its agency did not eliminate the injured person from the category of recreational user to whom no duty was owed under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 1533.18(A). The court also noted that the widow's motion to amend her complaint would have simply added the allegation that the payment made was for the use of electrical supply as well as for the parking of the trailer. A fee was still paid to the State. Consequently, it did not remove the widow and her husband from the recreational user category. Finally, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 1533.18 did not violate the Equal Protection Clause and was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The employee was receiving disability retirement from the Ohio State Teachers Retirement System when he became employed with the State of Ohio. The State, after initially accepting his payroll deductions to PERS, then attempted to refund the amounts on the basis that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 145.02 prohibited the employee from becoming a member of PERS while receiving the disability retirement. On review, the court agreed with the Board that the trial court erred because it applied the wrong version of &sect; 145.02 in finding the statute to be unconstitutional. The trial court erred in applying an amended version of the statute rather than the statute as it read at the time in issue. Noting that the action was not moot, the court found that it was not unlawful for the legislature to permit contributors to a state highway patrol pension fund to earn credits in another state pension fund while not affording the same benefit to other state employees. Thus, the trial court erred in finding that the employee could not be excluded from PERS based on his receipt of the disability pension.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Section 5-77 prohibited owners of mechanical amusement or musical devices from displaying more than four devices at any one time. At trial, the city alleged that the devices attracted young people who created law enforcement problems after they ceased to operate the machines. In affirming, the court held that the ordinance was unconstitutional because the city failed to show a real and substantial relation between the ordinance and the health, safety, morals, or welfare of citizens. The court noted that the city itself admitted that the loitering was not cured by the removal of machines and presumably was not caused solely by the existence of the machines. The court also held that the ordinance was unconstitutional because it unreasonably discriminated against business establishments that contained more than four mechanical amusement or musical devices. In addition, the court held that the classification of &quot;mechanical amusement and musical devices&quot; was arbitrary within the context of the ordinance because pinball was the only device associated with law enforcement problems, and the ordinance included other types of amusement.</SPAN></P>

The city, challenger, association, and owners also appealed from a judgment declaring unconstitutional the zoning of the developer's property.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The developer applied for a variance to build an apartment building on property zoned for single-family residences and a parking lot on property zoned for multi-family use.

The developer also filed a declaratory judgment action claiming that the zoning ordinance was unconstitutional. The matters were consolidated and the trial court entered judgments for the developer, ruling that it was entitled to a variance. The matters were appealed. The court ruled that the association and owners lacked standing and their appeals were dismissed.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff, a classified civil service employee, filed an action against defendants, alleging a right to recover personally under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983, a violation of contractual rights under the collective bargaining agreement between her union and the State, and a violation of her equal protection rights under the U.S. Constitution. A court of common pleas (Ohio) dismissed the complaint under Ohio R. Civ. P. 12(B)(6). The employee appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The employee was suspended for three days without pay allegedly for falsifying reasons for an absence. The employee stated that in an attempt to harm her, defendants caused records to be falsely changed to show that she called in sick whereas they should have shown that she was unwilling to cross a picket line. The employee also stated that she was later ordered to a disciplinary hearing adjudicated by the same authorities who brought the charges against her without being given notice of the charges, an opportunity to present evidence, or an opportunity to compel the attendance of unwilling witnesses. On appeal, the court held that (1) dismissal of the contractual violation claim was proper because a public employee held a position as a matter of law and not of contract; (2) dismissal of the equal protection claim was proper because it made the same allegations as the claim based on &sect; 1983; and (3) dismissal of the &sect; 1983 claim was improper because the employee's allegations fell within the purview of &sect; 1983 in that she sought redress against persons in official positions under state law who allegedly deprived her of her liberty or property or both without due process of law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Prior to building their home in a subdivision, the breeders applied for and received a zoning permit to construct a pigeon coop on the property for the purpose of breeding and housing racing pigeons. After the coop's construction, but before any pigeons were put in it, several of the breeders' neighbors filed an action alleging the coop was a nuisance and sought, among other things, an order voiding the permit. The trial court heard evidence regarding the housing and breeding of pigeons, determined it was animal husbandry under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 519.01, and found that under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 519.21, zoning could not prohibit it. The trial court also found that the breeding and housing was or would become a nuisance. One of the neighbors sought review. The court found that the trial court's decision regarding the breeding as animal husbandry was supported by substantial evidence, that the trial court reasonably interpreted the subdivision's restrictive covenants concerning annoyances, and that the neighbors failed to show how the breeding was a nuisance.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was charged with using weapons while intoxicated, a misdemeanor of the first degree under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2923.15(B). The State appealed a judgment from the Wayne County Municipal Court (Ohio), which found Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2923.15 to be unconstitutionally void for vagueness and dismissed the State's case against defendant.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In reaching its decision, the trial court was concerned with the lack of a statutory definitional section other than those relating to operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol and with possible differences in the terms &quot;under the influence&quot; and &quot;intoxication.&quot; The court overturned the judgment of the trial court. The conduct proscribed by Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2923.15 was carrying or using a gun while under the influence of alcohol or drugs of abuse. The court noted that the State's interest in protecting the public from a person carrying a gun while under the influence was as strong as its interest involving those operating a motor vehicle while under the influence. The phrase &quot;under the influence&quot; was to be given its usual meaning. The word &quot;intoxicated&quot; as used in &sect; 2923.15(B) meant the state of being &quot;under the influence&quot; in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2923.15(A). The words &quot;carry&quot; and &quot;use&quot; were also to be given their usual meaning. Finally, &quot;drugs of abuse,&quot; &quot;firearm,&quot; and &quot;dangerous ordnance&quot; were defined by statute and case law. Thus, the court failed to see any vagueness in the terms used and found the statute to be very clear in what it was proscribing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the trial court's judgment of dismissal and remanded the cause for further proceedings according to the law.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In a consolidated appeal, appellant fishermen sought review of a judgment by the Court of Claims (Ohio), which dismissed the fishermen's separate complaints against the Ohio Department of Natural Resources, Division of Wildlife that alleged constitutional violations related to the denial of commercial fishing licenses.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Chief of the Division of Wildlife denied the fishermen commercial fishing licenses. The fishermen filed claims in separate common pleas courts. The common pleas courts reversed the Chief's adjudicative orders on the grounds that the Chief's actions were arbitrary and capricious because the regulation under which the licenses were denied was unconstitutionally vague. The common plea courts' decisions held that the fishermen's constitutional rights were violated by the Chief. Thereafter, the fishermen filed separate actions against the Division of Wildlife in the court of claims contending that they should have been allowed to recover from the State upon tort liability, for which the State had waived immunity pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2743.02(A). The court of claims dismissed the actions for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. On appeal, the court held that the complaint was barred by the defense of sovereign immunity because the Chief's actions, and those imputed to the Division of Wildlife, were essentially legislative functions because a private party was never vested with the police power to grant, or refuse commercial fishing licenses.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant employee sought review of the judgment on the pleadings entered by the Franklin County Common Pleas Court (Ohio) for appellees, an employer and the Administrator of the Bureau of Workers' Compensation, based on its finding that the employee's pleading for a claim of an additional condition of cervical degenerative disc disease did not set forth any exception to the two-year statute of limitations of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4123.84.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The employee's claim for a concussion and low back injury sustained while in the course of employment was allowed. More than three years later, she sought a claim for the additional condition of cervical degenerative disc disease. On review, the court noted that the employee did not move to amend her complaint, although she had ample opportunity to do so. Consequently, the trial court did not err in granting judgment on the pleadings. The court held that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4123.84 was a valid statute of limitations enacted by the General Assembly pursuant to Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 35 and it was not unreasonable that it provided for a cutoff of new and unrelated conditions that had failed to manifest themselves within two years. Moreover, the employee's contention that she was unfairly discriminated against because a claim of which she had no knowledge might have been barred before she had opportunity to assert it was in conflict with her contention that she gave notice of the claim to the Industrial Commission within the two-year period, which was an exception to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4123.84, but which she failed to assert in her complaint.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">When defendant failed to appear in municipal court, a bench warrant was issued.

Defendant later entered and then attempted to withdraw a no contest plea, arguing the plea was nor by personal appearance or with counsel. Defendant was also granted one continuance. His motion to dismiss on speedy trial grounds was denied. Defendant was found guilty. Sentencing was rescheduled five times and he was found in contempt twice. The court reversed his conviction on speedy trial grounds, as he was not brought to trial within 90 days as required by statute. As the record did not contain a transcript of the plea proceeding, the related errors were overruled. As to the two contempt proceedings, written charges were not filed with the clerk of court and entries were not made upon the journal so those judgments were also reversed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellee property owner filed an action against appellee city for a declaratory judgment that Mayfield Heights, Ohio, Resolution No. 1977-30 was unconstitutional, for injunctive relief, and an for order commanding the city to issue to the property owner a building permit. The Cuyahoga Common Pleas Court (Ohio) granted judgment against the city. The city appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The city passed Mayfield Heights, Ohio, Resolution No. 1977-30, which resulted in a moratorium against development because a downstream municipality had inadequate sewer facilities. The city refused to issue a building permit to the property owner. The trial court held that the resolution was unconstitutional and ordered the city to issue the permit. On appeal the court held that: (1) the city had a duty to maintain adequate control of surface water and the run off from development, but it could not prohibit development without a reasonable plan for the installation of adequate sewers within a reasonable time; (2) the refusal to issue a permit was constitutionally impermissible in the absence of a plan to develop the requisite sewer facilities; (3) the city could not invoke the inadequacy of downstream facilities as a reason for not issuing a permit because its liability within its boundaries attached whether it did anything or not; (4) the city was not responsible for downstream damage cause by inadequate sewers in a downstream municipality.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the judgment from the trial court, which held that the city's development moratorium was unconstitutional and ordered the issuance of a building permit to the property owner.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant sought review of the judgment of the Court of Common Pleas, Cuyahoga County (Ohio), which dismissed defendant's petition for post-conviction relief without an evidentiary hearing. Defendant was found guilty of murder by a jury and sentenced to life imprisonment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On appeal, defendant contended that his petition for post-conviction relief, pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2953.21, was a proper method to raise a constitutional question based on a retroactive decision of the United States Supreme Court, although the decision was pronounced after defendant had exhausted his direct appeals from his conviction. Defendant argued that shifting the burden of proof on certain issues in criminal cases was unconstitutional. The court found that there was no shifting of the burden of proof to defendant on any element of the crime charged. The court held that the under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2953.21, in effect at the time of defendant's trial, required defendant to establish the defense of self defense by a preponderance of the evidence. The court found that the State at all times had the burden of proving the elements of the crime. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment and dismissed defendant's remaining assignments of error because they were issues that were raised or could have been raised in defendant's direct appeal.</SPAN></P>
