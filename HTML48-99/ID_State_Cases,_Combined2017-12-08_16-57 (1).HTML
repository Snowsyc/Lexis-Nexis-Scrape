<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of an order from the District Court of the Fourth Judicial District, State of Idaho, Ada County, which withheld judgment and imposed probation against him following his guilty plea on an indictment for battery with intent to commit rape pursuant to Idaho Code &sect;&sect; 18-903 and burglary in the second degree pursuant to Idaho Code &sect; 18-401.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant entered the home of a neighbor, pulled his pants down, and engaged in a struggle while trying to touch her. Defendant was charged by grand jury indictment with battery with intent to commit rape pursuant to Idaho Code &sect; 18-903, and second-degree burglary pursuant to Idaho Code &sect; 18-1401. Although defendant was a juvenile, the State proceeded against him as an adult in the district court pursuant to the automatic waiver statute,&nbsp;Idaho Code &sect; 16-1806A. After defendant's motion to transfer the proceedings to the juvenile court was denied, he pled guilty to an amended charge of aggravated battery. The court accepted the guilty plea, withheld judgment, and imposed probation, but on appeal, defendant contested the district court's jurisdiction to accept his guilty plea and requested that his conviction be overturned. The court determined that the proceedings in the district court were invalid because the State's indictment only indicated that the victim was a minor and failed to allege facts purporting to show forcible rape in order to qualify as an automatic waiver offense specified under Idaho Code &sect; 16-1806A(1)(c).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed in favor of defendant vacated the district court's order withholding judgment and imposing probation following their acceptance of defendant's guilty plea to an amended charge of aggravated battery.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged a judgment of the District Court of the Fourth Judicial District, Ada County (Idaho), which denied his motion to suppress evidence and convicted him, upon a guilty plea, of possession of a controlled substance with intent to deliver in violation of Idaho Code &sect; 37-2732.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged his conviction, contending that the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress the drug evidence seized at his residence. Defendant argued that the search was illegal because it had been conducted pursuant to a consent in defendant's prior probation agreement without a valid search warrant. Defendant had previously been convicted of assault and had been released from custody upon the condition that he comply with the terms of his probation, which included that he consent to a search of his person, automobile, and residence at any time, and waive any constitutional right to be free from such searches. On appeal, the court ruled that defendant had voluntarily consented to the search and that his rights under the Fourth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution were not violated. The court noted that in a previous appeal, the court had held that the probation term that required a consent to search was reasonably related to the purpose of defendant's probation. The court also ruled that the fact that the previous assault conviction was a misdemeanor as opposed to a felony did not alter the trial court's discretion in imposing this probation condition.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's order denying the motion to suppress and the judgment of conviction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of the judgment from the District Court of the First Judicial District, State of Idaho, Bonner County, which convicted defendant of misdemeanor driving under the influence.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">While defendant was on the side of the road talking to a friend, the police officer pulled up behind her and turned on the car's rear amber flashing lights. After noticing alcohol on her breath and after being told that she drunk a couple of beers, the police officer requested her to perform field sobriety tests. Defendant filed a motion to suppress the results of the field sobriety tests on the ground that she was unlawfully seized. The magistrate denied her motion to suppress. On appeal, the court held that the seizure was reasonable. The court found that a seizure did not occur until the police officer asked defendant to perform the field sobriety tests because it was at that moment that an innocent person would believe that he was not at liberty to ignore the police officer. The court also held that the police officer had a reasonable, articulable suspicion that defendant was driving under the influence of alcohol based upon the smell of her breath and her admission that she had had a couple of beers. The court also upheld the magistrate's admitting into evidence the out-of-court statement made by a police officer to the arresting officer, finding that it was not hearsay.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction for misdemeanor driving under the influence. The court also affirmed the magistrate's denial of defendant's motion to suppress.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant insurance agent sought review of an order from the District Court of the Fourth Judicial District, State of Idaho, Ada County, which upheld appellee Idaho Department of Insurance's order that suspended the agent's license because he violated Idaho Code &sect; 41-1064 by withholding premiums payments from insureds that were to be forwarded to an insurer.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The agent filed a breach of contract action against the insurer in federal court. Thereafter, he began to withhold premium payments from insureds that were to be forwarded to the insurer. He sent a letter to the Department, informing them he was withholding the premiums until his dispute with the insurer was resolved. In the federal action, the insurer received damages on its counterclaim because the agent violated &sect; 41-1064. The Department initiated administrative proceedings against the agent and found he violated &sect; 41-1064. His license was suspended for six months. Upon review, the court found that the lack of a warning letter to the agent did not divest the Department of personal and subject matter jurisdiction over the action. The Department was not estopped from taking disciplinary action against the agent because he informed them he was going to withhold the premiums. There was no reliance or prejudicial change in position based on any conduct of the Department because the agent sent the letter after he began withholding the premiums. Suspension of his license, rather than revoking it, reflected the fact that the agent did not withhold the premiums out of deception.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the order that suspended the agent's license because he withheld insurance premiums due to the insurer.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate's petition for post-conviction relief was premised on contentions that he was not allowed to be present at the initial meeting where the jurisdictional review committee arrived at its tentative recommendation that the court relinquish jurisdiction, the denial of calling live witnesses, the denial of speaking to desired witnesses prior to his hearing, the denial to confront staff members who had given him negative evaluations, that he was given inadequate time to prepare his rebuttal, along with a claim that the jurisdictional review hearing was premature - taking place 43 days before expiration of the retained jurisdiction period. The district court denied the petition. The court affirmed, holding that an inmate did not have a right to be present at the initial committee conference. A staff representative appointed to assist the inmate contacted those witnesses whom the inmate identified, thus due process was satisfied. The inmate failed to show prejudice in not being able to confront certain staff members. A district court was not required to retain jurisdiction for a full 120 days or for any minimum period.</SPAN></P>

Defendant also challenged his sentence of 40 years in prison, with a fixed 10-year period of incarceration, as excessive. The court affirmed the conviction and sentence, but vacated an order requiring defendant to pay restitution. The court held that defendant's plea was made voluntarily and with an understanding of the nature of the charges. However, an order of restitution was invalid in the absence of the trial court's advisement before a guilty plea. Defendant failed to show that a specific sentencing recommendation was part of any plea agreement.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The conviction was based on defendant swinging his crutch at the deputy sheriff, who was trying to arrest defendant for disturbing the peace and fighting with the deputy. The issues on appeal were the complaint's sufficiency, the sufficiency of the evidence of guilt, and whether &sect; 18-705 was unconstitutionally vague. The court affirmed the district court's judgment, and concluded that not alleging or showing that the deputy provided notice of an intent to arrest defendant did not render either the complaint or the evidence of guilt insufficient. No notice of arrest was required because defendant was violating several criminal statutes, including those that prohibited assault and disturbing the peace, when the deputy approached him. Further, &sect; 18-705 was not legally defective because precedent established that its terms, and those of Idaho Code &sect; 18-114 that required a union of act and intent as to the obstruction, provided fair warning to a person of common intelligence that defendant's conduct was forbidden and subject to a legal penalty.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The debtors defaulted on a promissory note owing to the bank that was secured by a deed of trust on property. The bank brought an action against the debtors, after a senior deed of trust was foreclosed, and the beneficiary of the senior deed of trust purchased the property. The debtors sought review of the order awarding summary judgment in favor of the bank and of an order denying their motion for change of venue. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment. The court held that, even under the amended version of Idaho Code &sect; 45-1503, the bank was entitled to proceed directly against the debtors because its interest in the property was rendered substantially valueless as defined in &sect; 45-1503(2). The court stated that the bank's action to enforce the obligation owed by the debtors began only after the foreclosure of the deed of trust that was senior to the bank's deed of trust. The court observed that, as a result, the bank's lien against the property was extinguished, and its interest in the property was thereafter unavailable for a future foreclosure, leaving the bank with only a cause of action on the note.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Approximately six and one-half years after defendant's conviction, he attempted to raise issues concerning the validity of his guilty plea and a breach of the plea agreement in a petition for writ of habeas corpus. Conceding that the statutory time within which to seek relief under the Uniform Post-Conviction Procedures Act (UPCPA) had passed, defendant argued that his claims of relief should be considered pursuant to his habeas petition. The trial court dismissed the petition and the court affirmed. Specifically, the court held that because defendant failed to challenge the constitutionality of the five-year time limit for post-conviction procedures under Idaho Code &sect; 19-4902 in his appeal to the trial court, it would not be addressed on review. Furthermore, because defendant failed to assert his claims through an application for relief under the UPCPA, instead of a habeas petition, his petition was properly denied. Additionally, the untimeliness of defendant's petition was a bar to having the matter treated as though it were a petition under the UPCPA. A &quot;discovery exception&quot; did not extend the time for defendant's petition where he never made such a claim to the trial court.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff State filed a paternity action on behalf of the relator and mother against defendant, the putative father. In addition, the State sought reimbursement of public assistance payments paid to the mother for the benefit of the child. Defendant appealed from an order of filiation and judgment entered by the magistrate and affirmed by the District Court of the Seventh Judicial District of the State of Idaho, Bonneville County.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State filed a complaint in 1989 seeking an order that defendant was the biological father of a child born in 1979. It also sought reimbursement of public assistance payments made to the mother for the benefit of the child. On appeal of an order of filiation and judgment for support payments, the court affirmed. The State's complaint was not barred by the statute of limitations. Although the version of Idaho Code &sect; 7-1107 in effect in 1979 provided a three-year statute of limitations for paternity actions, the statute was amended to create an 18-year statute of limitations, and the amended statute was made retroactive. The three-year limitation period in Idaho Code &sect; 5-218 on the State's claim for past debt accrued when the State commenced payments to the mother, not when the child was born. The action was not barred by laches, as defendant failed to prove any prejudice. The statute authorizing the State to pursue its claim, Idaho Code &sect; 56-203B, was not unconstitutional, as defendant was not entitled to due process at the time the State decided to make assistance payments to the mother. The State did not fail to bring the action on behalf of the real party in interest.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the order of filiation and judgment for support payments and awarded costs to the State. The court denied the State's request for attorney fees on appeal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a trial before the magistrate, defendant was convicted of driving without a license, Idaho Code &sect; 49-301, and of operating an unregistered vehicle, Idaho Code &sect; 49-456(1). Defendant appealed from the judgments of conviction contending, among other grounds, that the trial court lacked jurisdiction and that he was denied due process.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenges the trial court's ruling that subject-matter jurisdiction existed. He bases his right of non-compliance on his status as an &quot;ambassador&quot; from the Kingdom of Yahweh, which, thereby, entitles him to immunity. He also contended that because of his status, the United States Supreme Court has original jurisdiction pursuant to U.S. Const. art. III, &sect; 2. On appeal, the court pointed out that ambassadorial status could not be obtained through unilateral proclamation as defendant has attempted. Although defendant may have been correct in arguing that he did not have sufficient time before trial in which to seek an interlocutory appeal, he failed to show how his rights had been prejudiced. Defendant claimed that because he notified the department of transportation that he would not register his car, had rescinded his license, requested that the department notify him if his intentions were not approved, and requested a hearing, he should have been afforded some administrative process before being charged criminally. He was afforded more process than that available at many administrative procedures, including a hearing on his motion to dismiss. No error was found.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was found asleep in his vehicle with the engine running. He submitted to a blood alcohol test, which showed that his blood level was over .10. Subsequently, defendant was convicted of driving under the influence. On appeal, defendant argued that it was error to deny his motion requesting that the state select its method of prosecution. Defendant also argued that the presumption created by &sect; 18-8004(2) was unconstitutional. The court affirmed. The court held that there were two ways of proving a violation: first, by showing under a totality of the evidence that defendant was driving under the influence. The second method required the state to establish that the defendant drove with an alcohol level tested to be .10 percent or more. Either method of proof was permissible; neither of them was exclusive. Thus, it was not error to deny defendant's motion. Second, the court held that &sect; 18-8004(2) was not unconstitutional because it created a permissive presumption. The jury was free to find that the test results were not correct or reliable. Nonetheless, there was no indication that the jury relied solely on the test results in arriving at its guilty verdict.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the denial of the motion to suppress because there was probable cause. Idaho Code &sect; 19-603(1) provided that a peace officer could make a warrantless arrest when a person had committed a public offense in the presence of the peace officer. There was no question that the officers had probable cause to arrest defendant for obstructing their attempt to arrest his brother. Though defendant did not touch the officers, he placed himself in their path, forced them to push him out of the way, ignored the officers' repeated verbal requests to move, placed himself unnecessarily close to the officers, and made hand gestures in front of their faces. These facts were sufficient to establish probable cause for defendant's arrest. The facts were also sufficient to establish probable cause that defendant resisted arrest. The catalyst for the arrest occurred after defendant had backed away but then made a vulgar and hostile gesture toward the officers. Thus, the officers also had probable cause to arrest defendant for a violation of Idaho Code &sect; 18-705.</SPAN></P>

That ordinance prohibited the retail sale of safe and sane fireworks in the unincorporated areas of the County.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Idaho State Fireworks Act, Idaho Code &sect; 39-2102 et seq., limited the use of fireworks and created a class of fireworks known as &quot;safe and sane&quot; fireworks. The sellers applied to the County for a retail permit to sell safe and sane fireworks but were denied under the ordinance. The sellers argued that the State had preempted regulation of the sale and use of fireworks and that counties were prohibited from imposing additional regulations on the sale and use of fireworks because authority was not specifically granted to counties to do so. On appeal, the court ruled that the legislature intended to share regulatory authority for the sale and use of fireworks with local governments. The court found that, under various statutes including Idaho Code &sect; 39-2624, local governments had significant discretion and authority to regulate the sale and use of fireworks, and, thus, the court could not infer that the State intended to fully occupy the area of fireworks regulation. The court also held that Idaho Code &sect; 39-2629A did not impliedly limit the authority of counties to regulate the sale and use of fireworks.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The husband filed a complaint for a divorce and the wife counterclaimed. A magistrate entered a decree of divorce in favor of the wife and awarded her a disproportionate share of the community property in lieu of permanent maintenance. A lower appellate court affirmed, but remanded for the limited issue of whether the husband was entitled to credit for temporary spousal support. Upon review, the court affirmed. The court held that the magistrate's failure to make a specific finding as to the reason the husband was at fault for the divorce pursuant to Idaho Code &sect; 32-603, was not reversible error where there was substantial evidence of extreme cruelty on the part of the husband and it was obvious from the record that extreme cruelty was the ground relied upon by the magistrate. The court found the magistrate did not error by failing to classify the unpaid attorney fees as community debts where the requirement that attorney fees were to be satisfied first from community assets was removed from Idaho Code &sect;&sect; 32-704 and 32-708. The court concluded the husband's motions to disqualify the magistrate and a district judge were properly denied because he failed to show bias or prejudice.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The denial was based on a lack of jurisdiction due to the fact that defendant filed the Rule 35 motion, which sought probation, more than eight years after his sentence was imposed.

The court affirmed the denial of the motion, concluding that Rule 35 required that defendant file the reconsideration motion within 120 days of the imposition of the sentence. Neither the exception that allowed seeking to reduce an illegal sentence at any time nor the misleading conduct exception applied because defendant did not challenge the sentence's legality and merely sought leniency. Also, there was no misleading conduct by the State or special circumstances that excused not seeking a reduction when the sentence was imposed. Further, precedent showed that clarifying a sentence was not an imposition of a new sentence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Owners of a fireworks business challenged an ordinance enacted by the County Commissioners that prohibited the retail sale of &quot;safe and sane&quot; fireworks in the unincorporated areas of the county.

The court found that the Fireworks Act did not impliedly preempt the area of law pertaining to fireworks regulation. The court found that the legislature intended to share the regulatory authority for the sale and use of fireworks with local governments. The court found that the Idaho Const. art.

When the officer arrested defendant, he put handcuffs on him. Defendant became combative and made suicidal comments. At the police station, the officer asked defendant to take a breathalyzer test. Defendant agreed to take the test on the condition that the officer first remove the handcuffs. Because defendant had been combative and suicidal, the officer refused. Defendant then refused to take the test. On appeal, the court held that defendant's conditional consent constituted a refusal under Idaho Code &sect; 18-8002(3)(b) to take the test. The court also held that the officer's refusal to remove the handcuffs was not sufficient cause for defendant to refuse to take the test and that he was physically able to take the test.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of obstructing and delaying a peace officer and failure to produce proof of liability insurance. He appealed, arguing that he was denied his right to counsel and his constitutional right to testify. The court reversed the conviction for obstruction, but affirmed the charge of failing to produce proof of liability insurance. The court held that the U.S. Const. amend. VI and Idaho Const. art. I, &sect; 13 guaranteed defendant in a criminal proceeding the right to be represented by counsel if the crime was serious and defendant was needy. Because obstruction was punishable by a fine and jail time of at least one year the crime of obstruction was a serious crime. In the present case, however, the trial court never considered whether defendant was needy or indigent. The court held that defendant voluntarily waived his right to testify because he refused to raise his hands. No particular formalities were required for an oath to be valid, although compliance with certain essential elements was necessary. Any form of the oath or affirmation that appealed to the conscience of the person to whom it was administered and bound the person to speak the truth was sufficient.</SPAN></P>

The district court affirmed the evidentiary rulings and defendant's conviction. On appeal, the court affirmed. The calibration certificate was admitted by the magistrate under Idaho R. Evid. 803(6) for records of a regularly conducted activity but defendant only challenged its admissibility under Idaho R. Evid. 803(8). The printout of the test results was authenticated pursuant to Idaho R. Evid. 901 and was not hearsay as there was no &quot;declarant,&quot; nor a &quot;statement.&quot; Defendant's protection against unreliable test results was the requirement for an adequate foundation. The reliability of both the test results and of the process used were subject to attack. The scientific acceptability of the testing process of the Intoximeter was well established for the limited foundational purpose of admitting the test results.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from an order of the District Court of the Fourth Judicial District, State of Idaho, Ada County, which convicted him of possession of controlled substances based on evidence he discarded during a brief detention by police. He contended that the disclosure of the evidence was coerced through an unlawful pat-down search for identification during an investigatory stop.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">During a pre-dawn investigation of a burglary in progress, a police officer saw defendant on an adjacent block, walking away from the scene. The officer, with gun drawn, approached defendant and asked what he was doing. Defendant replied he was looking for his cigarettes. The officer asked him for identification. When he did not produce any, the officer ordered him to turn around so that the officer could pat him down for a wallet. Immediately following that command, defendant flung a small bottle containing methamphetamine and marijuana into the parking lot where they stood. On appeal, the court held that although the officer had sufficient cause to stop defendant, a frisk for identification fell outside the purview of police conduct permitted by the Fourth Amendment during an investigatory stop. Based on the officer's testimony, the stop and frisk was not to look for weapons. The intrusion, then, was a search for evidence that could not be done without a warrant or as an incident to a lawful arrest or with the consent of the person concerned. The State had not proved that the warrantless search was carried out pursuant to one of the recognized exceptions to the Fourth Amendment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court's ruling denying the motion to suppress. The court reversed the judgments of conviction and remanded the case to the district court for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner inmate sought review of orders of the District Court, Cassia County (Idaho), which held that all proceedings brought by him to gain relief from a judgment of conviction were barred by applicable statutes of limitation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate pleaded guilty to possession of more than three ounces of marijuana, a felony under Idaho Code &sect; 37-2732(e). After the inmate served a portion of the sentence, the balance was suspended and he was placed on probation. The inmate alleged in his petition for post-conviction relief that before he entered a guilty plea he was assured that his conviction would be set aside. The inmate filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus, a petition for post-conviction relief, nunc pro tunc, and refiled dismissal of this petition as a petition for post-conviction relief. He also filed a motion for expungement of his criminal record. Of the four attempts, no action was taken on one and the other three were dismissed. The inmate appealed. In affirming the three that were dismissed, the court found that the district court was correct because the petitions were filed beyond the limitation period in both Idaho Code &sect; 5-224 and Idaho Code &sect; 19-4902. In remanding, the court held that the inmate's motion for expungement was timely unless the State could show that it had been caused substantial prejudice by the inmate's delay of 10 years in filing his motion under Idaho Code &sect; 19-2604.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was operating his vehicle westbound on a highway. The road surface was slick and covered with snow and slush. The victim was a passenger in another vehicle, which was moving eastbound on the same highway. Defendant's vehicle crossed the centerline and traveled on the wrong side of the road. Defendant attempted to return to the proper lane of travel, but he lost control and collided with the victim's vehicle. The victim was seriously injured, and defendant's blood alcohol level exceeded the legal limit. Defendant was convicted of aggravated driving while under the influence of an intoxicating substance. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that the State did not need to prove that defendant's intoxicated state proximately caused the victim's injury. Defendant's conduct in crossing the centerline and in driving too fast for the slippery road conditions constituted negligence per se and caused the accident and the injury suffered by the victim. The court also concluded that the aggravated driving statute was not unconstitutionally vague because it gave notice to those who were subject to it and provided sufficient guidelines for enforcement.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was stopped for suspicion of driving under the influence (DUI).

Defendant was read an advisory form explaining the consequences of refusing to take the test. Defendant refused to be tested. He stated that he wished to talk to an attorney and that he did not understand the form. Defendant's driver's license was seized and suspended for 180 days. The district court upheld the magistrate's decision, and defendant appealed. The court affirmed. The court held that the Sixth Amendment right to counsel did not attach to a license-suspension proceeding under &sect;18-8002 because the penalty for failing to submit to an evidentiary BAC test was civil, not criminal. Similarly, neither Idaho Code &sect; 19-853(a) nor Idaho Code &sect; 19-515 afforded defendant the right to counsel. Defendant's substantive and procedural due process rights were not violated, and there were no equal protection violations.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested in Wyoming for attempted robbery. After the police read defendant his Miranda rights, defendant requested an attorney, and counsel was appointed. While in police custody in Wyoming, defendant became a suspect in robberies committed in Idaho. Idaho officers, after learning of defendant's Wyoming arrest, traveled to Wyoming to question him. The Idaho police read defendant his Miranda rights and then proceeded to interrogate him without notifying his counsel. During the interrogation, defendant confessed to several Idaho robberies. Defendant was charged with robbery in Idaho. He moved to suppress his confession, but his motion was denied. Following his conviction, defendant appealed, challenging the denial of his suppression motion. In vacating the conviction, the court concluded that the interview by Idaho police clearly violated defendant's constitutional rights because the police initiated the interrogation after defendant informed Wyoming police that he wanted an attorney. Moreover, the interview with Idaho police was unconstitutionally prohibited even though it pertained to offenses unrelated to the subject of the interview with the Wyoming police.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, bailee and others, appealed a judgment from the District Court of the First Judicial District, State of Idaho, Bonner County, which was entered against the bailee, in plaintiff boat owner's action for alleged conversion of personal property.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appeal arose from a sale of personal property to satisfy a lien for services under Idaho Code &sect; 45-805. The boat owner moored a boat at a marina operated by the bailee, which charged the boat owner for the moorage services. The boat owner did not respond to the bailee's request for payment on the bill, and the bailee sent the boat owner a certified letter, stating that the boat would be advertised for sale and that the proceeds would be applied to the storage charges. The boat owner later brought the conversion action and the district court entered the judgment against the bailee. On appeal, the court vacated and remanded the district court's judgment, concluding that the bailee did not commit a tort by collecting its debt in the manner provided by &sect; 45-805. The boat owner, having been notified of the debt and of an impending sale, could have asserted its offset before the sale occurred. Instead, the boat owner elected to remain silent. In such circumstance, the sale of the boat could not have been deemed a conversion. Thus, the boat owner had demonstrated no actual prejudice flowing from any perceived inadequacy in the notice mandated by &sect; 45-805.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court vacated and remanded the district court's judgment against the bailee for entry of an amended judgment awarding the boat owner the value of certain missing equipment, together with the difference between the actual proceeds of the sale and the amount eventually allowed by the district court as moorage charges and sale costs, in the boat owner's action for conversion of its personal property.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged a judgment from the District Court of the First Judicial Circuit, Bonner County (Idaho), which upheld a magistrate's decision finding that he failed to yield the right-of-way to an oncoming vehicle. Defendant argued that he was unconstitutionally denied the right to a jury trial, that the magistrate erred in not viewing the accident site or his vehicle, and that there was insufficient evidence to support a guilt finding.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant backed out of a diagonal parking space into an oncoming pickup truck. On appeal, the court held that defendant had no constitutional right conferred by Idaho Const. art. I, &sect; 7, and U.S. Const. art. III, &sect; 2, to a jury trial. Denial of a jury trial under the Idaho Traffic Infractions Act had been upheld, and the Seventh Amendment, not being incorporated into the Fourteenth Amendment, was not applicable to the states. The magistrate was familiar with the accident scene. Both parties used an illustration of the accident. The magistrate acted within her discretion by declining to view the scene or defendant's car. The issue framed by the citation was not relative fault but simply whether defendant had failed to yield the right-of-way. A police officer testified, and defendant confirmed, that he was backing his car out of a parking space at the time of the collision. There were no traffic lights limiting the oncoming pickup, which had the right of way. Defendant twice admitted that he never saw the pickup prior to the collision. Substantial evidence supported the magistrate's finding, beyond a reasonable doubt, that defendant had failed to yield the right-of-way.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff taxpayer, who alleged that defendant state tax commissioners had acted with malice in determining his sales tax liability on an automobile, complained of a summary judgment of the District Court of the Fourth Judicial Circuit (Idaho) dismissing a tort action he brought against them. The taxpayer filed motions for default judgment and for dismissal of the commissioners' attorney; they had filed a motion for Idaho R. Civ. P. 11 sanctions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer claimed an exemption from Idaho sales tax because he lived in Oregon; he also filed an Idaho resident income tax return. His motion for default was filed after the commissioners had filed an Idaho R. Civ. P. 12(b) motion to dismiss, which he argued was not an answer in the form required by Idaho R. Civ. P. 8(b). The commissioners' motion constituted an appearance; the taxpayer was not entitled to a default judgment. The commissioners were sued as state employees for acts within the scope of their employment: under Idaho Code &sect; 6-903(b), the state had an affirmative duty to furnish legal counsel for them. Under Idaho Code &sect; 63-3049, after the commissioners determined the tax deficiency, the taxpayer could have filed an action in the district court or could have taken an administrative appeal: he did neither and, thus, could not collaterally attack the tax deficiency determination in an independent action. It was impossible to determine whether the Idaho R. Civ. P. 11 sanction was imposed for particular misconduct or as an award of attorney fees incurred to defend the entire action, which could be made in a tort claim case only in compliance with Idaho Code &sect; 6-918A.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court vacated the order imposing the sanction and remanded the case for further proceedings on that issue. In all other respects, the court affirmed the summary judgment dismissing the taxpayer's complaint.</SPAN></P>

The father had disobeyed the magistrate's order in a school district's action under the Youth Rehabilitation Act, which alleged that the father's children were habitual truants under Idaho Code &sect;&sect; 33-202, 33-206, and 33-207.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The father and the school district resolved their dispute regarding the truancy allegation. The father was permitted to home-school the children provided that the children took the Iowa Test of Basic Skills twice each year. After the children took the first two tests, the father refused further testing and was found in contempt. The court held that the father was not entitled to a jury trial on the contempt charge under Idaho Const. art. I, &sect; 7 because the citation was pursued summarily by motion in the course of an existing action. The father's perception that his children were stigmatized by the action was in error. The legislative scheme, which provided that an initial petition would be filed pursuant to the Youth Rehabilitation Act, ensured that a determination whether a child was being adequately educated would be made by a court of competent jurisdiction without the stigma of criminal proceedings. Further, Idaho Code &sect; 33-202 was not unconstitutional for vagueness because there was ready access, through the Idaho Department of Education, to the list of subjects required to be taught and to the local school district's policies and regulations.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was sentenced for felony injury to her daughter. She appealed, and the court affirmed her conviction. The court held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it denied defendant's motion for a continuance. Defendant failed to produce any statement or testimony by a doctor that she needed a continuance due to personal medical problems. The trial court did not err in admitting 8 x 10 photographs of the daughter which showed her injuries. The trial court properly weighed the prejudice, if any, of admitting the larger photographs and found that the probative value outweighed the prejudice. The trial court admonished the jury to keep the photographs in proper perspective. The photographs were relevant to show that defendant was aware that serious injuries were being inflicted on the daughter by defendant's boyfriend. Section 18-1501(1) was not unconstitutionally vague. Defendant was given sufficient notice that she could be subject to criminal prosecution if she did not protect the daughter from unwarranted injuries.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant co-op members, in consolidated appeals, challenged orders of the District Court of the Fifth Judicial District, Camas County (Idaho), which granted summary judgment to respondent rural electrical cooperative and denied the members' motions for summary judgment under Idaho R. Civ. P. 56(c). The members' claims involved the cooperative's new policy of requiring advance assurance of payment for an ensuing season's irrigation bills.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The first member claimed that the cooperative's policy posed a financial hardship because he could not easily obtain letters of credit from lending institutions and had no alternative source of power. The court held that the policy was not arbitrary or contrary to a fundamental public policy. In the court's view, the policy served a valid purpose of avoiding nonpayment of accounts. Because the cooperative was the prevailing party, it was entitled to the attorney fees awarded. However, the matter was remanded for additional consideration of the discretionary costs awarded because the trial court did not make express findings pursuant to Idaho R. Civ. P. 54(d)(1)(D). The second member's claim for damages was premised upon the cooperative's failure to supply electrical power pursuant to a bankruptcy court's order. The trial court held that it lacked jurisdiction to consider the claim. The court held that the trial court had concurrent jurisdiction over the claim because it involved a question of contract law and the claim only tangentially affected the member's bankruptcy estate. The court voiced no opinion on the merits of the claim.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's grant of summary judgment against one member but remanded for reconsideration of the trial court's award of discretionary costs to that member. The court vacated the judgment dismissing the other member's action and remanded the case for further proceedings. Because each party prevailed in part, no fees or costs were awarded.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The bailor stored a boat at the bailee's marina for several years. When equipment was stolen from the boat, the bailee agreed that no more storage charges would be assessed until the equipment was replaced. When marina management changed hands three years later, the bailor received a bill for unpaid charges. When the bailor failed to respond, the bailee gave notice that the boat would be sold to collect the overdue charges. After the boat was sold, the bailor filed suit alleging wrongful conversion. The bailee responded that it had merely foreclosed a lien under Idaho Code &sect; 45-805, but the district court rendered judgment in favor of the bailor. The bailee appealed. In vacating, the court concluded that, because the parties simply agreed that any storage charges would be suspended for an unspecified period, the debt was not extinguished but remained in existence, subject only to a potential setoff. The bailee was entitled to assert a debt and collect it by lien foreclosure; the bailor, having been duly notified, could have asserted a setoff prior to the sale but elected to remain silent. As such, the bailee was not guilty of a tortious conversion in proceeding with the sale.</SPAN></P>

The court held that admissibility of the testimony was within the trial court's discretion and was not disturbed in the absence of an abuse thereof, which was not shown. The court determined that not every burden on the exercise of a constitutional right was invalid and that increased punishment was not improper when an accused pleaded not guilty and asserted the right to a jury trial.

The district court refused to suppress the evidence, and defendant entered a conditional plea of guilty. On appeal of the order denying suppression, the court affirmed. There was a substantial basis for the magistrate to find that probable cause existed to issue the warrant for a search of defendant's house. The different sources of the officer's information tended to corroborate each other. Defendant had been seen receiving delivery of the substance, and his home was the source of methamphetamine delivered to the suspect. The officer's affidavit was not intended to be false or misleading, and it did not reflect a reckless disregard for the truth. The failure to specify the period within which the warrant was to be executed was not grounds for suppression. The warrant was executed within 48 hours of its issuance, well within the 14-day period specified in Idaho Crim. R. 41(c). The warrant was not invalid because it was an &quot;anticipatory&quot; warrant issued in advance of the imminent receipt of the controlled substance, as evidence that it would be delivered was logically and probatively strong.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">This case involved a property tax dispute wherein the taxpayer failed to pay personal property taxes for the years 1983 through 1985. The county treasurer successfully sued to obtain the unpaid taxes and was awarded attorney fees under Idaho Code &sect; 12-121. On review, the taxpayer contended that at least part of the action was barred by Idaho Code &sect; 63-1204, which established a two-year period of limitation upon suits to collect personal property taxes. The court disagreed and held that &sect; 63-1204 simply gave tax collectors the right to collect taxes on personal property that had escaped taxation in a previous year. The applicable statute of limitations was instead Idaho Code &sect; 5-218(1), which required action to be taken within three years. The court did find, however, that as to the attorney fee award, the trial court failed to tailor the award only to those issues raised frivolously, unreasonably, or without foundation. Accordingly, the court vacated the fee award and remanded the case to the district judge for a redetermination of the appropriate amount.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment from the Fourth Judicial District Court of Ada County (Ohio), which convicted him of statutory rape in violation of Idaho Code &sect; 18-6101(1) following a conditional guilty plea. The sole issue was whether an honest and reasonable mistake of fact as to the victim's age was a defense to statutory rape.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that a reasonable mistake of fact as to the victim's age should have been a defense because it would have disproved any criminal intent to engage in non-consensual sexual activity. He contended that under Idaho Code &sect; 18-114 criminal intent was a necessary element of statutory rape, which intent could be disproved under Idaho Code &sect; 18-201(1) through evidence showing a reasonable mistake of fact. The court noted that, under Idaho Code &sect; 18-6101(1), criminal intent was not a necessary element of statutory rape. The only elements the State had to prove were the conscious performance of sexual intercourse, accomplished with a female under the age of 18. Statutory rape was a strict liability offense. Therefore, it was immaterial whether defendant reasonably believed that the victim was 18 years of age or older. Accordingly, the court held that defendant's intent was immaterial to the charge of statutory rape, and that a reasonable mistake of fact as to the victim's age was no defense to statutory rape. Furthermore, the legislature was the proper forum for considering the merits of a &quot;reasonable mistake&quot; defense to statutory rape.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The driver contended that his request for a second continuance of the license suspension hearing should have been granted. Had the driver not requested a show cause hearing, the magistrate would have been required--without further consideration--to suspend his license upon a sworn statement from a law enforcement officer. Furthermore, one continuance already had been granted. The court therefore discerned no abuse of discretion in the magistrate's decision to refuse a second continuance. He next asserted that Idaho Code &sect; 18-8002(4)(b) was unconstitutional because it unfairly allocated to the motorist the burden of demonstrating good cause for refusing a BAC test. The court held that the &quot;fundamental error&quot; doctrine was inapplicable. The driver did not contend that any error produced a hearing that was unfair. Indeed, there was no hearing because the driver failed to appear. Moreover, even if a hearing had been held in his absence, and if the State had merely relied upon the record to show that the test was refused without cause, such a showing would have gone unrefuted. Consequently, he had not established that he was actually prejudiced by the allocation of the burden of proof.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State appealed to the First Judicial District, State of Idaho, Benewah County from a judgment of the magistrate's division, which dismissed a charge against defendants. The questions of law raised were whether the making of an income tax return required that the return be filed, and, if so, whether willful failure to file a return was a crime under Idaho Code &sect; 63-3075(a). The district court answered affirmatively. Defendants appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury trial was held in the magistrate division of the district court. The prosecutor presented proof that defendants failed to file a state income tax return for a tax year. Defendants argued that the phrase &quot;make such returns,&quot; as used in Idaho Code &sect; 63-3075(a), stopped short of requiring a return to be filed. Additionally, they argued that if the statute was given a broader meaning, it was unconstitutionally vague because it failed to provide an accused adequate notice of the nature of the offense. On appeal, the court agreed with the State that the statutory scheme plainly embraced a duty to file. Although a semantic argument could be made, distinguishing between the act of &quot;making&quot; or filling out the tax form and the act of &quot;filing&quot; it, it was a distinction bereft of substance. It failed to take account of the contextual linkage between the words &quot;make&quot; and &quot;returns.&quot; The fact that Idaho Code &sect; 63-3075(a) referred to tax &quot;returns&quot; clearly indicated that the documents, once completed, were to be filed. A completed but unfiled &quot;return&quot; did not satisfy the reporting obligation of the tax code. The convictions were not disturbed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A decision of the district court, reversing the magistrate's order of dismissal of the criminal action against defendants, was affirmed. The case was remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a jury trial in the District Court of the Sixth Judicial District, Bannock County (Idaho), defendant was convicted of voluntary manslaughter. He was sentenced to a determinate period of 15 years in the custody of the Board of Correction. Defendant appealed from his sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's companion got into a fight with the victim, and defendant joined in. The victim struck defendant but later tried to retreat. Defendant and his companion then knocked the victim to the ground and repeatedly kicked him in the head. The blows caused the victim's death. Defendant first argued that his sentence was an abuse of judicial discretion. The court stated that on a sentence review, it conducted an independent examination of the record, focusing upon the nature of the offense and the character of the offender. Here, the victim was viciously attacked when he was lying on the ground unable to defend himself. As for defendant, he had chosen to become involved in the fight. Given the brutality of the attack, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in sentencing defendant. Next, defendant argued that the length of his sentence violated the Eighth Amendment and Idaho Const. art. I, &sect; 6. A sentence within statutory limits was presumed correct, however, and defendant had offered no support for his position. As for defendant's argument that his sentence was disparate, the reasonableness of a sentence depended on the facts of each case.</SPAN></P>

The court ruled that a writ of habeas corpus could not be used for such a challenge because the issue of the inmate's mental capacity at trial had been presented and decided on his direct appeal. The inmate also argued that, by operation of Idaho Code &sect;&sect; 18-207 and -310, he was deprived of his federal constitutional rights under the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments to present an insanity defense. The court noted that the constitutionality of Idaho Code &sect; 18-207 (amended 1982), which allowed a defendant to present evidence of mental condition in an attempt to negate criminal intent, had been upheld previously. The inmate did not show that &sect; 18-207 was unconstitutionally applied to him because he did not establish that he was denied an opportunity to present evidence of a mental condition or that he had offered such evidence and had it ruled inadmissible by the trial court. The inmate also failed to show how Idaho Code &sect; 18-310, which provided for the effect of imprisonment on civil rights and offices, was applied to his disadvantage.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of driving his motorcycle while intoxicated in violation of Idaho Code &sect; 18-8004. He claimed that the magistrate erred in excluding evidence, through the testimony of the arresting officer, that the police department recognized a .02 margin of error for the Intoximeter, and in ruling that the motorcycle he was alleged to have driven while intoxicated was a &quot;motor vehicle&quot; within the meaning of &sect; 18-8004. As to defendant's first contention the court held that the failure to admit evidence of the police department's policy, if error, was harmless error that did not affect the verdict because the evidence of guilt was so clear. Citing a definition of the term &quot;motor vehicle&quot; in a commonly-used law dictionary and interpretations of similar statutes by courts in other states, the court concluded that a motorcycle was generally understood to be a &quot;motor vehicle&quot; and that &sect; 18-8004 was not constitutionally defective for failure to precisely define the term &quot;motor vehicle.&quot;</SPAN></P>

The district court vacated the judgment on three counts that failed to allege physical contact, but upheld one count. The district court dismissed defendant's application on all other grounds. On appeal, the court affirmed in part and vacated in part, holding that defendant's application raised no genuine material issues of fact as to the district court's jurisdiction, assistance of counsel, disproportionality of the sentence, and breach of the plea agreement.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State contended that the trial court erred in granting a new trial on the basis that an auditor's testimony was misleading. At trial, defendant had testified that he believed he had complied with the sales tax law by paying the tax on all purchases from his suppliers. The auditor gave rebuttal testimony that defendant had not paid tax to his suppliers on purchases for the tax year at issue. The trial court allowed defendant another opportunity to cross-examine the auditor at a hearing on the motion for a new trial. At that hearing, it became apparent that the auditor's testimony was either inaccurate or incomplete. Specifically, the figure provided by the auditor may have included purchases exempt from sales tax altogether. The State argued that the trial judge should not have declared that defendant had been denied a fair trial, but the judge should have instead applied the test for newly discovered evidence. The court agreed with the State because the trial judge did not make the findings required by case precedent. Rather, he simply concluded that the auditor's testimony was incorrect and that defendant had been denied a fair trial. Thus, the motion required a rehearing.</SPAN></P>

Petitioner had been convicted in the magistrate division of failure to renew her automobile registration, a misdemeanor.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">While her direct appeal was pending, petitioner applied for post-conviction relief in the trial court, which directed her to apply to the magistrate division. The State moved for summary judgment, arguing that the direct appeal was pending. The magistrate dismissed the application; the trial court affirmed. On further appeal, the court held that post-conviction relief was available to those convicted of misdemeanors under Idaho Code &sect; 19-4901 and that the application had properly been assigned to a magistrate. Under Idaho Code &sect; 19-4902, a pending appeal did not preclude the maintenance of post-conviction proceedings. However, the court rejected petitioner's application for relief on substantive grounds, particularly, her argument that she had never relinquished her natural rights by entering into an &quot;agreement in equity&quot; with the State because the registration of automobiles was a reasonable legal obligation. The magistrate's order was not illegal merely because it required petitioner to tender federal reserve notes to pay State-imposed license fees. The decision to declare United States Treasury notes as legal tender was a political question to be determined by Congress.</SPAN></P>

The Commission affirmed this decision after a hearing. The court held that the Commission's findings that the policeman used excessive force when disciplining his stepchildren and injured them, that his actions demonstrated an inability to control his temper and an inability to react appropriately as a result thereof, that his inability to control his temper cast serious doubt upon his ability to perform his duties as a police officer, that no evidence was presented suggesting the policeman was discharged for political or religious reasons, and that the policeman was discharged in good faith and for cause comported with the requirements of Idaho Code &sect; 50-1609. In addition, these findings were reasonable and supported by substantial and competent evidence.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The probation officer searched the residence and vehicle of the probationer and discovered things believed to be narcotics paraphernalia, burglary tools, and stolen property. Two days later, the probationer filed for release by habeas corpus, and the magistrate granted him a writ partly on the basis that two business days was an unreasonably long time between the arrest and arraignment. Preliminarily, the court ruled that the probationer had used a proper procedure by filing for the writ and that the sentencing court that placed him on probation did not have exclusive jurisdiction. The court held that habeas-corpus proceedings were appropriate to obtain discharge by prisoners held without hearings prior to revocation. The court held further that under the Fourteenth Amendment where a probationer was arrested on an alleged violation minimal inquiry in the nature of a preliminary hearing had to be held as promptly as convenient after arrest while information was fresh and sources were available. The court analogized to Idaho Crim. R. 5(b), which set a 24-hour period for arraignment after arrests on warrants.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The question on appeal was whether the five-year limitation mandated by the amendment, effective July 1, 1979, under Idaho Code &sect; 19-4902, applied to a conviction entered before the effective date of the amendment. Prior to the amendment no period of limitation was prescribed in &sect; 19-4902. Defendant contended that the district court erred in applying the amendment to his petition. Relying on Idaho Code &sect; 73-101, defendant argued that the amendment to &sect; 19-4902 contained no expression by the legislature indicating the amended statute should be given retrospective effect. On appeal, the court agreed with the district court's ruling that defendant could not argue that his post-conviction rights would be cut off by retroactive application &sect; 19-4902, when he had twice asserted those rights after the effective date of the statute as amended. The court, concluding that defendant had fair notice and reasonable time to file his petition, stated that had defendant checked the statute at the time he filed even his first petition in 1981, he would have known of the amendment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged an order of the District Court of the Fifth Judicial District, Jerome County (Idaho), which convicted him on a jury verdict of delivery of a controlled substance. Defendant's first trial ended when the trial court declared a mistrial because a juror failed to appear on the second day of trial. Defendant claimed, inter alia, that he was exposed to double jeopardy contrary to U.S. Const. amend. V and Idaho Const. art. I, &sect; 13.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At the first trial, defendant immediately moved for a dismissal when the juror did not appear. In the court's view, defendant relinquished his interest in obtaining a verdict from the first jury when he moved for a dismissal not based on the merits. Defendant also claimed that he was denied his Sixth Amendment right of confrontation when he was not permitted to impeach the State's key witness with prior felony convictions. The court held that neither the trial court nor Idaho R. Civ. P. 43(b)(6) denied the right of confrontation because the trial court alerted defendant to the need for an in camera hearing and he chose to forego the opportunity. The court held that defendant's failure to assert the privilege for marital communications was the equivalent of consent. Thus, defendant waived the right to object to the admission of his ex-wife's testimony on appeal. Finally, while the trial court's instruction improperly placed the burden on defendant to prove an exception to Idaho Code &sect; 37-2732(a) without informing the jury of the quantum of evidence required to meet the burden, the error was harmless because the instruction was unnecessary for the jury's determination of the facts.</SPAN></P>

While the jury also found defendant guilty of possession of more than three ounces of marijuana, the trial court dismissed the charge and sentenced defendant to five years of probation and a term of community service.</SPAN></P>

Marijuana and paraphernalia were dispersed throughout the home in common areas to which defendant and his wife had individual access. Further, large sums of money that both defendant and his wife sent to persons known to deal in marijuana in other states were linked with entries in notebooks in the home. Defendant claimed that his wife dealt in the drugs and that he was a mere bystander. Defendant also claimed that Idaho Crim. R. 41(b)&nbsp;unconstitutionally expanded the limits in Idaho Code &sect; 19-4402 on the scope of search warrants. The court held that &sect; 19-4402 was archaic and that neither the federal nor the Idaho constitution required a narrow adherence to the limits suggested by &sect; 19-4402. Further, there was probable cause for the magistrate to issue a warrant for seizure of the evidence of a commission of a crime. In the court's view, the trial court properly admitted evidence that defendant had sent substantial sums of money to others shown to be engaged in large-scale trafficking because it was relevant to show his knowledge of and intent to possess the marijuana found in the home.</SPAN></P>

Defendant's motion to suppress was denied, and he entered a conditional plea of guilty. On appeal, the court affirmed. The deputy seized defendant and the van when he made the traffic stop. The seizure was reasonable under the Fourth Amendment, as the deputy had an articulable and reasonable suspicion that defendant had violated misdemeanor statutes regulating the operation of boats. Although the deputy had no authority to make a warrantless arrest for misdemeanor offenses committed outside his presence, he was authorized to issue a citation. Stopping the van to warn the driver against violation of boating statutes served a valid, substantial police purpose.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant taxpayer appealed a decision of the District Court of Jerome County (Idaho), which convicted him by a jury of willful failure to file a state income tax return for a certain year. The taxpayer contended: (1) that a state income tax on wages was unconstitutional; and (2) that the Idaho State Tax Commission failed to conduct an administrative hearing before he was prosecuted for willful failure to file an income tax return.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court stated that the Idaho Supreme Court had rejected any contention that income taxation was prohibited because it was not among taxes specifically authorized by Idaho Const. art. VII, &sect; 2. The court rejected the taxpayer's argument that he was not legally obligated to pay income taxes because his wages were compensation for a &quot;natural right&quot; of labor and were not &quot;income&quot; and stated that wages received for labor or as compensation for services were income. The court stated that the evidence that the taxpayer earned a certain amount of wages during the year was sufficient to support the jury's finding that the taxpayer was required to file an Idaho income tax return for the same year. The court stated that citizens could not choose to receive the benefits of a civilized society without sharing burdens, such as taxation. With respect to the contention regarding an administrative hearing, under Idaho Code &sect; 67-5209, the court stated that the case presented no factual or legal question within the commission's administrative expertise and authority and because the commission simply referred the case elsewhere, the referral did not trigger the hearing requirement of &sect; 67-5209.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the district court's judgment of conviction for willful failure to file a state income tax return.</SPAN></P>

Civ. P. 12(b)(6). Plaintiff filed an action seeking to enjoin defendants from enforcing laws which plaintiff believed infringed upon his right to freely exercise his religious beliefs.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, who practiced a religion which directed the rejection of man-made laws, was stopped and cited for failure to hold a valid driver's license, failure to display license plates, and failure to carry proof of liability insurance. Plaintiff sought to enjoin the further enforcement of those laws against him claiming that they suppressed his religiously-dictated rejection of man's laws. On appeal, the court found that defendants' enactment and enforcement of the licensing and insurance laws did not require restriction, abandonment, or expansion of plaintiff's religious beliefs. However his religious practices were affected. Accommodation of plaintiff's beliefs would substantially interfere with fulfillment of defendants' interest of having uniform licensing and insurance laws for public protection, safety, and order. Defendants' interest in the regulatory scheme outweighed plaintiff's freedom of religious practice. Furthermore, the licensing and insurance laws were essential to the accomplishment of defendants' overriding interest. Accordingly, the laws did not unconstitutionally infringe upon plaintiff's religious practices.</SPAN></P>

The trial court awarded to the creditors the costs of the sale, interest, attorney fees, and costs of suit. The debtors appealed, contending that the trial court gave undue weight to the testimony of one expert witness over another and incorrectly applied the provisions of Idaho Code &sect; 45-1512. The debtors also contended that the district court erred in its award of attorney fees, specifically that the award was excessive and erroneous. The court affirmed and held that costs of the trustee's sale and reasonable attorney fees incurred for the purposes of the sale were part of the entire amount of indebtedness secured by the deed of trust and were recoverable as part of the deficiency judgment.</SPAN></P>

The beneficiary alleged that he was denied due process when a county treasurer failed to notify him before issuing a tax deed for the property.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property was bought by owners, who gave a deed of trust in favor of the sellers, who quitclaimed their interest in the property to the beneficiary, who recorded the quit-claim deed on the same day that a county treasurer published a notice in the newspaper that taxes on the property were delinquent and that a tax deed would be given to the county, which sold the property to the purchasers at a public auction. The purchasers sued the beneficiary to quiet title to the property in the purchasers, and the trial court entered summary judgment for the purchasers. On appeal, the court held that because the beneficiary was a mortgagee for all practical purposes, he was entitled to have notice of the tax sale mailed to him. To the extent that Idaho Code &sect; 63-1126B did not provide for notice to a mortgagee of record, who did not previously request notice, &sect; 63-1126B was unconstitutionally infirm for depriving a property interest without due process. The tax deed issued under Idaho Code &sect; 63-1139 did not convey title free of the beneficiary's interest because the treasurer did not reexamine the public records just before issuing the tax deed and did not notify the beneficiary.</SPAN></P>

The court also ruled that the trial court did not err in granting the State's motion to confiscate the murder weapon. The court held that procedural due process requirements were met because the State's motion for confiscation of the shotgun provided notice, a hearing was held prior to forfeiture at which Money was represented by counsel, and there was not any unreasonable delay or resulting prejudice.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with driving under the influence of alcohol. Before the trial, defendant filed a motion to dismiss, claiming a deprivation of his right to a speedy trial under Idaho Code &sect; 19-3501 because he was not brought to trial within six months from the date of the charge. The magistrate held that &sect; 19-3501 did not apply retroactively to defendant's case, and the district court affirmed the ruling. Defendant then sought further review. The court held that legislature expressly provided that the statute would only apply prospectively, and therefore it did not apply to defendant's case, which had been pending at the time. The court rejected defendant's equal protection challenge of the statute and held that &sect; 19-3501 did not create two classes of misdemeanor defendants or violate any fundamental rights because the statute granted greater protection than was constitutionally mandated.

The petitioners sought judicial review, asking that the regulation be declared unconstitutional. The district court affirmed, and the petitioners appealed. The board filed a cross-appeal, requesting attorney fees. In affirming, the court concluded that, where the public health was at stake, it was a proper exercise of the state's police power to deny permission to construct a private subsurface filtration system where a reasonable, available sewer line existed. The petitioners failed to demonstrate that they would suffer any additional burden by connecting to the private line than the burden they would bear if required to connect to a publicly-owned line. Further, the denial of attorney fees to the board was proper; although Idaho Code &sect; 39-419(2) provided for the recovery of extraordinary expenses incurred for violations of the Public Health Act, this provision did not extend to a suit contesting the validity of a regulation and did not encompass attorney fees.</SPAN></P>

The jockey alleged a double jeopardy violation and res judicata in light of an earlier determination by the board of stewards and also claimed that venue had been improper and that the sanctions had been unduly harsh.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The board fined the jockey for having an electric prodding device, but the Commission increased the penalty. Thereafter, the jockey brought an action against the Commission, alleging a double jeopardy violation and res judicata and also claiming that venue had been improper and that the sanctions had been unduly harsh. After the trial court upheld the sanctions, the jockey sought review. In rejecting the jockey's double jeopardy argument, the court held that the administrative disciplinary proceeding had been civil in nature, notwithstanding the incidental resemblances and analogies to a criminal proceeding. As such, the court held double jeopardy was inapplicable, it being limited to criminal prosecutions. Likewise, the court held res judicata was inapplicable because the remedial scheme had permitted the assertion of a claim, notwithstanding the administrative adjudication of a prior claim. Furthermore, in rejecting the jockey's venue argument, the court held venue, without undue prejudice, could not affect an agency's jurisdiction to decide matters before it. Finally, the court held the sanctions imposed by the Commission had not been an abuse of discretion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The matter was before the court on the State's petition for rehearing. The State claimed that, where an officer merely &quot;viewed&quot; the fruits of a private search, the Fourth Amendment did not come into play. Further, even though a search warrant did not issue upon probable cause, because the police relied upon the warrant in objective good faith, the exclusionary rule need not apply.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The police officer followed an individual into defendant's residence and used his observations to support a warrant. The court held that the officer's conduct clearly had an impact on defendant's right to and legitimate expectation of privacy in his home as guaranteed by the Fourth Amendment. The court opined that the officer's observations were the direct fruit of his unlawful entry. In the court's view, it was the unlawful entry that tainted all fruit, including the observations of the officer. The court held that a finding of probable cause, tainted by statements resulting from unlawful police conduct, was not a &quot;mere technicality&quot; that &quot;good faith&quot; could cure. Further, deterrence would not be achieved if the officer could escape the impact of the exclusionary rule by having a magistrate, who would have no reason to know that the entry was unlawful, sign a warrant upon which the officer could later claim to have relied in &quot;good faith.&quot; The court concluded that the exclusionary rule precluded the use of the evidence obtained by the police with a search warrant that was irreparably tainted by the officer's initial unlawful conduct.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of manslaughter. The parole board rejected defendant's request that the 719 days which he had spent on parole be credited toward his 10-year sentence, based upon Idaho Code &sect; 20-228, which clearly provided that the time spent on parole should not be considered to have been served as a part of a prisoner's sentence when that prisoner was recommitted following a parole violation. The trial court agreed with the parole board. Defendant appealed, arguing that &sect; 20-228 was unconstitutional because it violated the separation of powers doctrine of Idaho Const. art. II, &sect; 1. The court held that defendant's argument was based upon the premise that time served on parole was the same as time served in a correctional institution. However, time served on parole was not the same as time served in a correctional institution. Parole was a gratuity that was ordered only for the best interests of society, not as a reward of clemency. It was clear that the legislature, in enacting Idaho Code &sect; 20-228 was acting pursuant to both its inherent and express constitutional authority set out in the Idaho Constitution.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of voluntary manslaughter. Defendant appealed, arguing that the trial court erred in failing to strike the jury panel as unconstitutional, in refusing to suppress evidence seized from defendant at the time of his arrest, and that the sentence imposed was excessive. The court held that defendant presented no evidence establishing the existence two of the elements regarding a fair cross-section jury. The mere allegation of a fatal defect in the pool of prospective jurors was not sufficient to set aside a conviction. Rights such as those conferred by U.S. Const. amend. IV were personal in nature and could not bestow vicarious protection on those who did not have a reasonable expectation of privacy in the place to be searched. Thus, the trial court did not err in denying defendant's motion to suppress regarding the search of his former wife's house. Defendant's sentence was not excessive because when defendant was sentenced, Idaho Code &sect; 18-4007 provided that imprisonment for voluntary manslaughter could not exceed 10 years. Thus, the sentence defendant received was within the maximum permitted by &sect; 18-4007.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from an order of the District Court of the First Judicial District, Kootenai County (Idaho), which denied his motion for post-conviction relief from a judgment of conviction entered upon his plea of guilty to rape. Defendant contended that his plea was not voluntary and that Idaho Code &sect; 20-223, which prescribed a minimum period of confinement prior to parole eligibility, represented an unconstitutional bill of attainder.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pled guilty to rape as part of a negotiated arrangement in which the state agreed to recommend an indeterminate sentence not exceeding 15 years.

Defendant subsequently contended that he would not have pled guilty had he known at the time that Idaho Code &sect; 20-223 would require five years of a 15-year sentence to be served in confinement prior to parole eligibility. The court rejected defendant's claim that his plea was not voluntary because the sentence did not represent a manifest injustice. Defendant was informed that the state's recommendation would not be binding on the trial court and that his sentence might be longer than the recommended sentence. Idaho R. Crim. P. 11, which was in effect when defendant pled and was sentenced, did not include parole eligibility under Idaho Code &sect; 20-223 among the &quot;consequences&quot; to be discussed on the record before accepting a guilty plea. The fact that the trial judge did not advise him that Idaho Code &sect; 20-223 would require him to serve one-third of an indeterminate sentence did not violate the constitutional guaranty of due process.</SPAN></P>

The district court reversed. On appeal, the court held that the State was not required to administer a chemical test for intoxication on demand. The police department did not have a policy requiring officers to offer such a test to every defendant, and the refusal to grant defendant's request was thus not a violation of the equal protection clause or an arbitrary act. The failure to give the Mobat test was not the failure to preserve evidence of defendant's blood alcohol level and was, thus, not a discovery violation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate appealed only from the conviction for involuntary manslaughter. He filed his petitions for post-conviction relief while that appeal was pending.

The second petition challenged the convictions. The inmate also filed a petition for habeas corpus in federal court, but his petition was denied. His appeal of the manslaughter charge was denied. On appeal, the court found no reversible error. Although the district court did not properly discuss or specifically determine each issue, as required by Idaho Code &sect; 19-4907(a), that failure did not require reversal because the record clearly indicated that none of the neglected claims amounted to reversible error. For instance, a claim of selective prosecution was belied by the inmate's own testimony. Issues that related to whether the State had met its burden of proof could only be raised on direct appeal.

The participial phrase, &quot;relating to the purchase or sale of goods, wares, or merchandise,&quot; modified only the immediately preceding word &quot;contract&quot; and did not limit the earlier preceding words &quot;open account, account stated, note, bill, negotiable instrument.&quot; Accordingly, &sect; 12-120(2) applied.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court gave an instruction that properly indicated that Idaho Code &sect; 18-3106(d) permitted a presumption that drawing a check on an account with insufficient funds was done with intent to defraud. The trial court's description of prima facie included a reference to sufficient evidence unless it was outweighed by other evidence in the case. The trial court also permitted the prosecution to introduce evidence of other insufficient funds checks written by defendant. On appeal, the court held that the trial court's instruction permitted the jury to conclude that the presumption was absolute. The instruction thus improperly shifted the burden of proof to defendant. The other insufficient funds checks were properly admitted because they were relevant to the issue of intent to defraud, and could be used for authentication of defendant's signature pursuant to Idaho Code &sect; 9-405(2).</SPAN></P>

He asserted, in part, that the district court erred by not determining each of the issues presented in his petition and by failing to adequately state findings of fact and conclusions of law, and that Idaho Code &sect; 18-6607 was unconstitutionally vague and thus void.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate was convicted of five counts of lewd and lascivious conduct with a child under the age of 16. Three of the convictions, involving an 8-year-old girl, were reversed because the prosecutrix's testimony was not corroborated. On appeal, the court held that the district court's memorandum decision satisfied the requirements of Idaho Code &sect; 19-4907(a) because the inmate had not met his burden of proving, by a preponderance of the evidence, the allegations on which his petition was based. Having the counts related to the 8-year-old tried along with those of the older victim was not prejudicial because the child's evidence was not offered to inject inadmissible propensity evidence. Further, the inmate had not sought severance of the offenses. His counsel's decision not to do so did not constitute ineffective representation. Because Idaho Code &sect; 18-6607 did not impinge on or chill any constitutionally protected conduct, and had previously been applied to specific conduct, the statute was not so vague as to specify no standard of conduct at all and the inmate could not attack it on its face, but only as applied to his conduct.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parties petitioned for rehearing of the court's prior opinion, which it withdrew. Plaintiff wife appealed from a judgment of the district court in a divorce action. Defendant husband cross-appealed. The district court in its appellate capacity affirmed a judgment and contempt order entered by a magistrate, who had tried the case. In its original jurisdiction, the district court also decided four motions filed while the appeal was pending.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parties' acrimonious divorce was tried before a magistrate whose decree was appealed to district court. Both parties sought further review of the district court's judgment on appeal, and also appealed the district court's rulings on certain motions filed while the appeal was pending. In particular, the wife sought review of the magistrate's order holding her in contempt for removing the children to Georgia without the court's permission. The court affirmed on each issue raised by the husband with respect to the award of custody to the wife. The court noted the magistrate's efforts to maximize the children's access to both parents by ordering the wife not to move from the immediate area without court authorization. The court affirmed the rulings below as to the division of community property and the award of alimony. The court also affirmed in all other respects except the magistrate's contempt order. It held that the magistrate lacked jurisdiction to hold the wife in contempt as the husband's affidavits initiating the contempt proceeding failed to allege that the wife had been served with the divorce decree she allegedly violated, or that she had actual knowledge of the decree.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On denial of the petitions for rehearing, the court affirmed the order upholding the judgment and decree of divorce; affirmed the order refusing to modify child custody and the order clarifying collection of alimony and child support; reversed the order refusing to set aside the wife's contempt citation; and vacated the magistrate's order adjudging her guilty of contempt. The court remanded for further proceedings as to the contempt citation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a jury trial in the District Court of the Third Judicial District, State of Idaho, Canyon County, defendant was found guilty of possession of stolen property in violation of Idaho Code &sect; 18-4612 and of being a persistent violator under Idaho Code &sect; 19-2514. He was given a fixed 14-year sentence. Defendant appealed his sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was originally sentenced for a fixed 10-year term on the stolen property conviction and to a consecutive indeterminate 20-year term for being a persistent violator. After being notified that the second sentence might be illegal, the trial court imposed the fixed 14-year sentence in place of the original sentences. The court stated that the sentencing provisions for an underlying conviction and for persistent violator status were clearly interdependent. If one part of the sentence was illegal, the entire sentence was unlawful and had to be corrected. Thus, the trial court did not err in deleting the illegal provision and amending the legal provision. Next, there was no merit to defendant's argument that under Idaho Code &sect; 19-2513A, a fixed sentence could not be imposed for the status of a persistent violator. Idaho Code &sect; 19-2514 authorized the sentencing court to sentence a defendant to a term greater than he could have been sentenced on the underlying crime had he not been twice previously convicted. Finally, the sentence was not cruel and unusual in light of the fact of defendant's recidivism; he had six prior convictions that had resulted in penal incarcerations.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The patient experienced problems with her I.U.D. and the doctor allegedly removed it. The patient continued to experience problems. Another doctor removed the I.U.D., which had never been removed. Fifteen months later, the patient filed for a hearing before the pre-litigation panel, and then commenced an action in the trial court. The trial court dismissed her action as time barred and denied her motion to reconsider. On review, the court found no error. The court held that the I.U.D. was a foreign object because it was negligently left in the patient's body after the surgeon represented to her that it had been removed. Therefore, it was no longer deliberately or intentionally within the body. The court found that the time of occurrence, act, or omission complained of was when the doctor failed to remove the I.U.D. and therefore, under &sect; 5-219(4) the patient had to commence her action within one year after the date of accrual, which was the day the I.U.D. was removed. Because the action was not filed within two years of the date of the occurrence or within one year of the date of accrual, it was properly dismissed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, defendant argued that the firearms enhancement abridged the right to bear arms under Idaho Const. art. 1, &sect; 11 and that the total period of incarceration was excessive. In affirming, the court ruled that the firearms adjustment was within the legislature's authority to prescribe minimum sentences for crimes committed while in possession of a firearm and that Idaho Code &sect; 19-2520 was constitutional. The court held that the sentence was within the statutory limits and that defendant had the burden of showing that it was excessive in light of the criteria of protection of society, retribution, deterrence, and rehabilitation. The court determined that the trial court properly found two aggravating factors consisting of the maiming of one victim and the exposure of both victims to a risk of death. The court found that the crimes were gravely serious and had an enduring, traumatic effect upon the victims and that the trial judge gave sound and thoughtful reasons for his decision. The court held that a sentence of incarceration to minimize the risk of recurrence of defendant's criminal conduct and to deter others was a sufficient ground for the substantial prison sentence.</SPAN></P>

The officer asked to see defendant's driver's license, vehicle registration, and certificate of liability insurance.

Defendant argued that &sect; 49-245 contravened the supremacy clause of U.S. Const. art. 6, cl. 2, the Fourteenth Amendment's proscription against unreasonable searches and seizures, the Fifth Amendment's privilege against self-incrimination, and the guarantees of substantive due process and equal protection. The court held that &sect; 49-425 did not violate the supremacy clause. The court determined that once the officer validly stopped defendant, the Fourteenth Amendment did not preclude the officer from routinely asking defendant for proof of insurance. The court found that &sect; 49-425 did not violate the Fifth Amendment because it only required motorists to demonstrate compliance with the requirements of the section. Further, &sect; 49-235 did not infringe upon substantive due process or equal protection guarantees.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from an order of the District Court of the Second Judicial District, State of Idaho, Clearwater County, which entered new sentences for his convictions for escape and grand larceny following the revocation of his probation. He had been sentenced to two indeterminate sentences of five years. Those sentences were suspended. The trial court ordered that the re-imposed sentences would not be served concurrently.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">While in jail, awaiting sentencing on a conviction for grand larceny, defendant escaped. He pled guilty to escape and was sentenced separately for each offense. The sentences were suspended and he was placed on probation. He was later convicted of a federal offense, which resulted in the revocation of his probation. On appeal, the court held that the trial court exceeded its authority by imposing an aggregate penalty beyond that provided in the original sentences. The matter was governed by the statutory principles embodied in Idaho Code &sect;&sect; 18-2505 and 19-2603. Idaho Code &sect; 18-2505 required the two terms of imprisonment to be consecutive, although the original sentence for escape failed to so provide. Thus, it was appropriate, upon revocation of probation, to modify the sentences to bring them into conformity with the statute. However, the trial court erred because it corrected the error by effectively increasing the punishment. By making the sentences consecutive without adjusting their terms, the trial court went beyond mere correction of the sentences. Pursuant to Idaho Code &sect; 19-2603, the trial court could not, upon revoking probation, increase the original sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court vacated the sentences imposed upon revocation of probation. The cases were remanded for resentencing consistent with the court's opinion.</SPAN></P>

Defendant also claimed that Idaho's laws forbidding and penalizing the growing of marijuana were unconstitutional. The court affirmed and held that defendant did not have a reasonable expectation of privacy in his open field. The court held that the officers did not violate defendant's fourth amendment rights by crossing the barbed wire fence because the wire was loose, some of the fence posts were leaning and some wire was lying on the ground.

He was sentenced to a fixed term of eight years and filed a post-conviction relief motion to challenge his sentence. The court held that his position was correct and remanded for resentencing. Defendant was resentenced to a 20-year indeterminate sentence, the sentencing court denying his request for an 8-year indeterminate sentence. He appealed, contending that the sentence was a violation of due process and could be found to have been vindictive. On appeal, the court held that while due process protections limited harsher sentences on resentencing absent intervening conduct of defendant that justified a harsher sentence, because the sentence had been illegal, resentencing to a legal sentence was not vindictive nor a violation of due process. The court noted that the sentencing court rationalized that the time of incarceration would likely be the same under the new sentence as that of the prior sentence and would further the goal of protecting society for the same period of time as the prior sentence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The murder was done during a robbery. Defendant's brother fired the gun that killed the victim after defendant left the store. The trial court held a hearing to decide whether or not to impose the death penalty on defendant. The trial court believed that it was not within its power to impose a determinate or fixed sentence for a number of years less than life. Idaho Code &sect; 18-4004 at the time of the appeal stated that persons guilty of first-degree murder were to receive death or life imprisonment. The court held that an indeterminate life sentence was available for first-degree murder under Idaho Code &sect;&sect; 18-4004, 19-2513. Section 19-2513 spoke of felonies and allowed the imposition of indeterminate sentences with maximums that were neither less than two years nor exceeded that provided by law except where the trial court imposed a death sentence. The court rejected the State's argument that a fixed sentence for a term less than life under Idaho Code &sect; 19-2513A would be inconsistent with the choice of death or life imprisonment posed by Idaho Code &sect; 18-4004. Hence, the trial court erred by ruling out as a matter of law an indeterminate sentence for defendant.</SPAN></P>

The record before the magistrate did not include the parties' post-trial settlement or its effect on the division of other property, on the total community indebtedness, or on the husband's ability to pay other debts or child support. The district judge rightly decided to consider the settlement, but should have granted a trial de novo, thereby allowing both parties the opportunity to present further evidence concerning the division of property, assumption or allocation of debts, and the amount of reasonable child support, in light of their changed circumstances. The course of action taken by the district court was tantamount to holding a trial de novo in the absence of both parties and was not authorized by Idaho R. Civ. P. 83(j) or 83(u).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A chemical spill occurred at the company's facility. At the request of the manager, the husband's employer sent the husband to deliver a load of road mix to be spread on the spill. While spreading the mix the husband began coughing and had difficulty breathing. Since that time he had been treated for a number of physical ailments allegedly caused by the incident. Plaintiffs sued defendants. The jury found the husband 87 percent negligent and defendants 13 percent negligent. This precluded recovery because the husband's negligence exceeded that of defendants.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff parents and defendant school district appealed from the judgment of the trial court (Idaho) awarding the parents damages, but reducing the award to the maximum available under the Idaho Tort Claims Act in their wrongful death action against the school district pursuant to Idaho Code &sect; 5-311.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parents' son was struck and killed by a school bus when he attempted to cross the street. The parents filed a wrongful death action against the school district pursuant to Idaho Code &sect; 5-311. After a jury trial, judgment was entered for the parents, but the trial court reduced the award to the maximum allowed under Idaho Code &sect; 6-926. The district's motion for a new trial was denied. Pending appeal, the district made a settlement offer, which the parents refused. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment and order, ruling that the damage limitation did not violate the parents' due process or equal protection rights because it bore a fair and substantial relationship to the state's interest in conserving public funds. The court ruled that the parents were not entitled to recover attorney fees under Idaho Code &sect; 6-918A because the district did not defend the action in bad faith. The court held that the jury instructions adequately stated the damages that were recoverable and that the district's motion for a new trial was properly denied. The court also ruled that the district's conditional settlement offer did not stop the running of statutory interest on the judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court awarding the parents damages but reducing the award to the statutory maximum available under the Idaho Tort Claims Act. The court declined to award attorney fees to either side on appeal as neither party prevailed on their respective appeals.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant denturist appealed the decision of the District Court (Idaho) that granted summary judgment to plaintiff dental board in the board's action to enjoin the denturist from the practice of dentistry, and that dismissed a counterclaim filed by a group of denturists.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The denturist and his colleagues were technicians who made and repaired dentures and other dental appliances. The board alleged that they were engaged in dentistry because they were performing services directly for customers, rather than working solely upon the dentures and appliances upon direction from licensed dentists. The denturist claimed that Title 54, Chapter 9 of the Idaho Code, which defined dentistry, was unconstitutional. The legislature defined the denturist's activity as dentistry and subject to the same restrictions in 1957 Idaho Sess. Laws ch. 81, &sect; 1. The court held that the due process standard of review of the statute was whether it bore a rational relationship to the preservation and promotion of the public welfare. The equal protection standard was whether the statute created a discriminatory classification. There was a rational basis for the classification because patients seeking a denturist's aid might depend upon him to evaluate other dental problems, which was definitely within the province of dentistry.</SPAN></P>

The wife also appealed the order.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">While the wife's divorce claim and claim for alimony were pending, the U.S. Supreme Court held unconstitutional an Alabama alimony statute that conferred the benefit only to women. The magistrate determined that the decision also affected Idaho's alimony statute, former Idaho Code &sect; 32-706, but awarded the wife support under equitable principles. Both the magistrate and the district court held that the former statute was void. The district court held that Idaho Code &sect; 32-705, the new gender-neutral maintenance statute, should be applied to the wife's claim. The court disagreed and held that a determination that the former alimony statute was unconstitutional did not require that the entire statute be declared a nullity. The benefits of the statute could be extended to husbands and meet equal protection muster. Because the magistrate had no opportunity to conclude whether the alimony requirements of Idaho Code &sect; 32-706 had been satisfied, the matter had to be remanded for that determination.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the order, but modified the district court's instructions to the magistrate upon remand of the case to determine whether the requirements for alimony under the former statute were satisfied and to enter judgment accordingly.</SPAN></P>

Defendant argued that the information failed to properly inform him of the crime charged, and the aggravated assault statute,&nbsp;&sect; 18-905 was unconstitutional because it failed to define deadly weapon.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued on appeal that the information did not sufficiently apprise him of the specific nature of the crime he was charged with and that general reference to Idaho Code &sect;&sect; 18-901 and 18-905 was not specific enough. The court affirmed and held that the information very clearly outlined the essential facts constituting the offense and that defendant's focus on the failure of the information to list the precise subsections of the statutes exalted form over substance. The written statement left no doubt as to the specific nature of the crime charged. The charge arose from an incident where defendant pointed a knife at two men and threatened to kill them. Section 18-905 was not void for vagueness for not specifically identifying a knife as a deadly weapon for under the circumstances it could not have been seriously argued that defendant wielded the knife and uttered a deadly threat without an appreciation that the knife could have been considered a deadly weapon. The statute gave sufficient warning that such conduct was forbidden and where it occurred it would be subject to the penalty of the law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with two counts of burglary and one count each of aiding and abetting a burglary and being a persistent offender. After a jury trial, defendant was convicted of the burglary counts, but the persistent offender charge was dismissed. On cross-appeals, the court reversed the burglary convictions, but affirmed the dismissal of the persistent violator charge. The court held that the jury was given confusing instructions on the presumptions that could be drawn from the forced entry and defendant's possession of recently stolen property. The court stated that the instructions could give the jury the impression that the burden lay with defendant to disprove the elements of burglary under Idaho Code &sect; 18-1401. Thus, the instructions impermissibly shifted the burden of proof and violated defendant's due process rights. The court ruled that defendant's proposed instructions were properly rejected. The court also held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in dismissing the persistent offender charge because the State failed to show that defendant's prior convictions in another state were for crimes considered to be felonies in that state.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of an order from the Kootenai County District Court (Idaho), which ordered defendant to be surrendered to authorities in the State of Washington. Defendant contended that the extradition documents were not in order because they did not show he was charged in Washington by either an indictment or an affidavit made before a magistrate.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested in Idaho, as a fugitive from the State of Washington, where he was wanted on criminal charges. Defendant refused to waive extradition and obtained a writ of habeas corpus to challenge the extradition. After a hearing, the district court quashed the writ and ordered that defendant be surrendered to Washington authorities. On review, the court affirmed because it rejected defendant's argument that extradition required an indictment by a grand jury. Federal law, at 18 U.S.C.S. &sect; 3182, permits extradition without a grand jury indictment and the U.S. Constitution did not require and indictment as an indispensable prerequisite to interstate extradition. The court also upheld the validity of Idaho Code &sect; 19-4503, allowing extradition where it is shown that the laws of the demanding state authorize a criminal charge to be made by an information, and where a copy of the information supported by an affidavit accompanies the demand for extradition. The affidavit need not have been signed before a magistrate.</SPAN></P>
