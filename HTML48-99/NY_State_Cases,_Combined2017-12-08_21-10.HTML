</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, town and individuals, in consolidated appeals, sought review of the decision of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the Second Judicial Department (New York), which affirmed the trial court's decision to grant defendant village's motion to dismiss separate actions that challenged the constitutionality of zoning ordinance and amendment, and application of the ordinance to a parcel of property.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The village had adopted a zoning ordinance and amendment to the ordinance that created a cluster residential district with floating boundaries that was later established by zoning amendments. The town had sought a judgment to declare the ordinance and amendment unconstitutional and enjoining the village from authorizing or permitting construction on any parcel benefited by the ordinance and amendment. The court affirmed the judgment as to the town, finding that it lacked standing to challenge the ordinance because the village had complied with the notice provisions in N.Y. Village Law &sect; 7-706(1). The court affirmed the judgment as to the individuals, finding that limiting the floating zoning to parcels with four or more acres was not exclusionary or unconstitutionally discriminatory. The four-acre minimum made the ordinance available to more of the property owners and only affected seven owners. The court found that the record showed that the ordinance coupled with N.Y. Village Law &sect; 7-704 was nothing but comprehensive planning rather than special interest, irrational ad hocery.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Court affirmed dismissal of town and individual's action against village zoning ordinance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Municipal corporations -- zoning -- right to court review -- Town of North Hempstead lacks standing to challenge zoning ordinance and amendment adopted by Village of North Hills (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Village Law, &sect; 7-706</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">, subd 1) -- &quot;floating zone&quot; provision of zoning ordinance not unconstitutionally discriminatory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The Town of North Hempstead lacks standing to challenge a zoning ordinance and amendment adopted by the Village of North Hills.  Section 7-706 (subd 1) of the Village Law provides that written notice of any proposed zoning change or amendment affecting property within 500 feet of the boundaries of any town shall be given to the clerk of such town at least 10 days prior to the date of such public hearing and &quot;Such * * * town * * * shall have the right to appear and to be heard at such public hearing with respect to any such proposed change or amendment, but shall not have the right of review by a court as hereinafter provided.&quot; The town is prohibited from seeking judicial review by the express terms of the statute.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The Board of Trustees of the Village of North Hills, in 1970, established, by ordinance, a &quot;Cluster Residence, R-CL District&quot;, a &quot;floating zone&quot; whose boundaries were not fixed in the original ordinance, but were to be established by later amendments to the zoning map.  Any property in an R-2 district could potentially be rezoned to R-CL if, among other requirements, a minimum plot size of four acres was provided.  That part of the zoning ordinance authorizing the R-CL district as a floating zone is not unconstitutionally discriminatory (cf.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Rodgers v Village of Tarrytown</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 302 NY 115).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The claim that the challenged amendment was not in accord with a comprehensive plan as required by Village Law ( &sect; 7-704) is rejected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. There is no merit to petitioners' contention that the individual members of the board acted in an apparent conflict of interest.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant inmates appealed from the orders of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the Second Judicial Department (New York), which affirmed judgments upon verdicts convicting each defendant of criminal possession of a dangerous drug in the first degree, and convicting two defendants of criminal possession of a dangerous drug in the fourth degree.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">All three defendants appeal from separate orders affirming their convictions for criminal possession of dangerous drugs rendered after a joint jury trial. All three were apprehended while they were together inside an automobile that also contained a large quantity of cocaine, stored in a manila envelope underneath the front seat. Their arrest stemmed from information received by police from an informer. The court held that once the prosecution proved defendants were inside a car containing drugs, it was entitled to rely on the presumption as a part of its prima facie case. The court further ruled that given the presence of both defendant and drugs in the car, it was appropriate for the court to permit the jury to consider whether the statutory presumption of possession or defendants' explanation was the more credible and, if the former, whether it was so beyond a reasonable doubt. The court concluded that the jury had a right to find that the inconsistencies in the officers' testimony relied on by defendants were trivial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the convictions finding no error in the use of a statutory presumption regarding drug possession.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- dangerous drugs -- statutory presumption of possession -- where prosecution utilized statutory presumption of knowing fpossession of dangerous drugs by every person in automobile at time drug is found (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Penal Law, &sect; 220.25</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">), defendants were properly convicted of criminal possession of dangerous drugs; although sufficient rebuttal evidence may not allow jury to consider statutory inference of possession, defendant's story directed to rebutting any knowing possession was insufficient</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> to achieve such result -- jury had right to find that inconsistencies in police officers' testimony were trivial and therefore insufficient to rebut presumption -- jury charge conveyed correct permissiveness with respect to use of presumption -- no error in withholding identity of police informant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Acting upon a tip from an informer, police officers apprehended defendants while they were together inside an automobile which contained a large quantity of cocaine, found in a container protruding visibly from beneath the front seat. At the trial, the prosecution utilized the statutory presumption of knowing possession of dangerous drugs by every person in an automobile at the time such drug is found, to complete its prima facie case (Penal Law, &sect; 220.25, since amended to conform to the 1973 controlled drug legislation), and defendants were properly convicted of criminal possession of dangerous drugs. Although sufficient rebuttal evidence may not allow the jury to consider the statutory inference of possession, defendant Low's story directed to rebutting any knowing possession was insufficient to achieve such a result.  Reasonable persons could differ about whether his explanation for his presence in the car negated possession.  Accordingly, given the presence of both defendant and drugs in the car, it was appropriate for the court to permit the jury to consider whether the statutory presumption of possession or Low's explanation was the more credible and, if the former, whether it was so beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The same conclusion, that it was proper for the jury to consider the statutory presumption of possession, applies with even greater force to the jury's consideration of whether the police officers' testimony was so lacking in credibility as to undermine the factual support their testimony provided for the presumption.  On the record here, the jury had a right to find that the inconsistencies in the officers' testimony relied on by the defendants were trivial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The charge of the trial court conveyed the correct permissiveness with respect to the use of a presumption.  After detailing the statutory provisions, the court advised the jury that the presumption was not a conclusion, that after considering all the facts, the jury had a right to find that the presumption fails, and above all, that the burden of proving guilt beyond a reasonable doubt stays with the People.  Nor is the charge erroneous for failing to state explicitly that the jury could consider the credibility of the prosecution's police witnesses in deciding whether the presumption was rebutted or not.  The charge correctly stated that the jury could consider all the evidence in the case in evaluating the presumption.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. On the facts, there is no reason to overrule the determination made at the suppression hearing that there was a sufficient showing of probable cause without disclosure of the informer. Nor was the trial court incorrect in denying disclosure of the informer's identity since he was in no position to give testimony bearing on the guilt or innocence of the defendants, and therefore the informer privilege does not give way.  Defendant Low was not entitled to the identity of the informer so as to use his testimony that Low was neither identified nor described as one of the persons who would be in the car that day, since that proof was already before the jury and conceded by the prosecution.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, a doctor and a patient under an assumed name, challenged an order of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the First Judicial Department (New York) that reversed a trial court's decision that declared unconstitutional New York, N.Y., Health Code &sect; 204, which required that a certificate of termination of pregnancy include the name and address of the patient obtaining the abortion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants challenged the constitutionality of &sect; 204, which required that a certificate of termination of pregnancy, which was required to be filed by abortion patients, include the name and address of the patient obtaining the abortion. The trial court determined that the statute's disclosure requirement was unconstitutional. The appellate court reversed that determination. On appeal, the court ruled: (1) there was no evidence that the statute violated or otherwise interfered with a woman's qualified right to an abortion in that it was intended only to monitor legal abortions and to provide statistical data for the medical community; (2) the disclosure requirement did not impinge a woman's First Amendment rights in that it was narrowly tailored to collect personal information for legitimate state purposes, and; (3) the state's interests in assuring compliance second-trimester abortion procedures, providing medical assistance to indigent patients, and enhancing research were rationally related to the disclosure requirement.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the order. The statute did not violate any woman's qualified right to an abortion or interfere with her decision to have an abortion, did not violate a woman's right to privacy, was not overbroad, and was rationally related to compelling state interest. The statute was properly upheld as constitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Health -- identification of abortion patient -- section 204 of New York City Health Code, which requires disclosure to Department of Health of abortion recipients' names, does not violate qualified right</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> to abortion, since requirement provides for distribution of services and for safety without dissuading women from having abortions or breaching confidentiality of disclosures; physician-patient relationship is not interfered with, but such relationship is provided to indigents through health counseling programs; doctrine of facial overbreadth should not be extended beyond application to ordinances governing freedom of expression -- right to privacy is not violated, since such extends only to freedom of expression and guarantee against self incrimination; regulation is narrowly tailored for legitimate purposes and avoids transgression into decision making in one's personal life -- </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">statute</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> is not overbroad and rationally relates to compelling State interest and, absent interference with right to privacy, availability of more effective means to secure same objectives does not result in invalidation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Section 204 of the New York City Health Code, which requires that hospitals report to the New York City Department of Health terminations of pregnancy according to Board of Health forms which require the inclusion of abortion patients' names, does not violate a woman's qualified right to an abortion or interfere with her decision to have an abortion. The reporting requirement was designed to monitor the safety and effectiveness of legal abortions and to provide for planning of service and to facilitate distribution and availability by providing a broad statistical sampling of data which is unavailable to a private physician or with respect to indigent women who do not have private physicians.  There is no showing that the name requirement dissuades potential abortion recipients from having an abortion and confidentiality of the information is adequately insured.  Health counseling programs facilitated by the reports are intended not to interfere with the physician-patient relationship but to provide such a relationship for indigent women.  There is no authority for extending the doctrine of facial overbreadth beyond its application to ordinances governing freedom of expression.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Disclosure of the names of abortion recipients does not violate the right to privacy, which extends only to areas involving freedom of association and the guarantee against self incrimination.  The city's motives in gathering the information are not suspect.  The regulation is narrowly tailored to collect personal information for legitimate purposes and avoids unconstitutional governmental transgression into decision making in one's personal life and those places where one's personal life is conducted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The statute is not overbroad and is rationally related to the compelling State interest in assuring compliance with second trimester abortion procedures, providing medical assistance to abortion patients and advancing medical research.  Absent interference with the right to privacy, the availability of other, more effective means to secure the same objectives does not invalidate the statute.  Accordingly, the statute is constitutional.  </SPAN></P>

The referee filed a report with the court, sustaining certain charges against the judge. The court heard arguments by counsel for the court and for the judge. The court held that the record of the judge's repeated and unrelenting display of unjudicial temperament compelled the court to conclude that he grossly violated reasonable concepts of judicial behavior. The court found the judge to be in violation of several canons of judicial ethics and determined him to be guilty of the misconduct charges. The court further held that N.Y. Const. art. VI, &sect; 22 empowered the court to make its own rules and procedures for the investigation of misconduct, the judge was given a full opportunity to present his evidence and arguments in opposition to the charges, and the record before the court was adequate.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant illegitimate son sought review of a decree of the Westchester County Surrogate's Court (New York), which granted respondent administratrix's motion to dismiss an application by the illegitimate son for a compulsory accounting of the deceased father's estate.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In response to the illegitimate son's (son) application for a compulsory accounting, the administratrix filed a motion to dismiss and argued that the son was not a distributee and hence had no standing to compel an accounting. The surrogate court granted the administratrix's motion to dismiss on the ground that the son was appellant was not a distributee under N.Y. Est. Powers &amp; Trusts &sect; 4-1.2 (a)(2). In so doing, the surrogate court rejected the son's contention that &sect; 4-1.2(a)(2) was unconstitutional. On appeal, the court affirmed the decree and found that &sect; 4-1.2 (a)(2) was not unconstitutional to the extent that it prescribed the entry, during the father's lifetime, of an order of filiation declaring paternity as a condition precedent for inheritance by son from his father. The court reasoned that, given the practical problems and difficulties associated with proof of fatherhood, the legislature had acted rationally when it established a different standard for proving fatherhood for purposes of intestacy than that required to establish motherhood.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The fact that the statute ( EPTL 4-1.2, subd [a], par [1]) provides that an illegitimate child is the legitimate child of its mother for purpose of inheritance is not unconstitutionally discriminatory.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant insurers and their insureds challenged a judgment of the Supreme Court at Special Term, entered in Kings County (New York), which granted plaintiffs' summary judgment and which declared that article 18 of the N.Y. Insurance Law was unconstitutional and invalid. The court also denied defendants' and intervenors' motions to dismiss plaintiffs' personal injury complaint.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs were injured in separate automobile accidents, which occurred after the enactment of article 18 of the New York insurance law, the Comprehensive Automobile Insurance Reparations Act. Plaintiffs joined together against their respective tort-feasors and insurers and sought a declaration that the Act was unconstitutional. Plaintiffs claimed that because the reasonable and customary charges for medical treatment for their injuries would not exceed $ 500, the Act impermissibly barred them from commencing an action for their injuries. The lower court held that the Act was unconstitutional. On appeal, the court held that the classifications created by the legislature were reasonably related to the end of establishing a rational line of distinction. The court concluded that the action involved economic legislation and that modern substantive due process principles required the judiciary to give deference to the legislature in that area. Accordingly, the judgment was reversed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the lower court's decision and determined that the statute was valid and constitutional. Accordingly, the court granted defendants' summary judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Insurance -- no-fault automobile insurance -- no-fault automobile accident compensation law (Insurance Law, art 18) does not violate due process or equal protection clauses of State or Federal Constitution, since it is reasonably related to accomplishment of permissible State objectives -- article 18 does not unconstitutionally abrogate common-law right to sue in tort, since Legislature may alter common law, and any requirement of adequate substitute for rights abrogated is met -- term &quot;significant disfigurement&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> is not unconstitutionally vague -- reasonable basis standard, rather than strict scrutiny test, should be used, since no fundamental right is denied -- there is rational basis for exclusion of noncovered persons from no-fault coverage -- threshold monetary requirements and list of injuries constituting serious injury are reasonably related to establishment of rational line of distinction -- threshold monetary requirement is properly based upon &quot;reasonable and customary&quot; charges for medical services since mathematical exactitude is not required and, under such general standard, actual payments are not determinative -- right to trial by jury is not abrogated, since article 18 modifies substantive law, such that there is nothing to which right may attach -- accordingly, article 18 of Insurance Law is not </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">unconstitutional</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> and summary judgment should be granted to defendants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The partial abolition under article 18 of the Insurance Law of an automobile accident victim's right to sue for damages for another's negligent action does not deprive the victim of a right or interest protected under the due process clauses of either the State or Federal Constitution.  The New York no-fault automobile accident compensation law is reasonably related to the accomplishment of the permissible State objective under the police power of regulating motor vehicle use and liability for the public welfare.  Article 18 has the objectives of reducing economic pressure on seriously injured persons to compromise down their claims, while reducing pressure on insurers to compromise upward minor claims to avoid investigative and defense expenses, eliminating expenditures extraneous to treatment of injuries, guaranteeing prompt payment for economic losses and lessening the burden on the courts.  There is presumptively no deprivation of due process under a statute challenged on nonprocedural grounds until the court is satisfied to the contrary, and, where the factual basis for the exercise of police power is fairly debatable and there has been extensive legislative investigation, the opinion of the Legislature regarding a legitimate and established area of police power will be accepted and the wisdom of its methods reasonably related thereto will not be questioned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Article 18 of the Insurance Law does not unconstitutionally abrogate the common-law right to sue in tort.  The New York State Constitution (art I, &sect; 4) recognizes the power of the Legislature to alter the common law and, if any adequate substitute for abrogated rights were required, whereby the new system would be measured against the common-law system, without regard to the relative treatment of any particular claimant under the two systems, no issue would be presented in relation thereto, since a more than adequate substitute is provided.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The term &quot;significant disfigurement&quot; (Insurance Law, &sect; 671, subd 4, par [a]), as used to define &quot;serious injury&quot;, is not unconstitutionally vague, since a sufficiently accurate concept is conveyed to any interested person and prior statutory use of the term has caused no difficulty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The strict scrutiny standard of review should not be applied to the plaintiff's equal protection arguments challenging article 18 of the Insurance Law, since such test should be invoked only when a challenged law creates suspect classifications or impairs a fundamental constitutional right.  No right of &quot;security of the person&quot; is interfered with, since the economic remedy for injury to the person has simply been altered.  No fundamental constitutional right of &quot;access to the courts&quot; has been denied, since that right does not exist independent of an underlying fundamental right sought to be vindicated and for which there is no alternative forum.  Rather than denying access to the courts, article 18 merely eliminates partially the judicial recovery for injuries suffered.  Accordingly, the rational basis standard of review should be applied.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. There is a rational basis for the exclusion of noncovered persons from the operation of article 18.  The exclusion of motorcycles is rationally based upon evidence that the premium cost for first-party no-fault coverage would have been prohibitively high, and the exclusion, accordingly, relates to the legislative purpose of reducing insurance costs.  Exclusion of operators of uninsured vehicles is not unreasonable, since such persons do not contribute to the compensation system.  The exclusion of out-of-State vehicles without New York no-fault coverage is in recognition of the inability of the Legislature realistically to exercise power over such persons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. Although certain injuries not listed in the definition of serious injury (Insurance Law, &sect; 671, subd 4) might have been included and the threshold monetary requirement might have been different, the classifications created are reasonably related to the legislative purpose of establishing a rational line of distinction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. The computation of the threshold requirement for serious injury is rationally based on treatment expenses rather than basic economic loss, since use of the latter would favor those with higher earned income.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. The threshold amount is properly based upon &quot;reasonable and customary&quot; charges for medical services, although such may vary among localities, since the legislative standard is not required to be mathematically exact.  The standard is general and the actual payments made are not determinative.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. The plaintiffs are not denied the right to trial by jury, since article 18 modifies the substantive law and the rights of automobile accident victims, rather than replacing the jury as the trier of fact, and to the extent of the modification nothing remains to which the right to trial by jury may attach.  It is the basic function of the Legislature to remedy defects in the common law and, if a cause of action triable by jury could not be limited or abolished, that function would be seriously impaired.  Partial abrogation produces no different result, since, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">pro tanto</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, there is nothing for the jury to try.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">10. Accordingly, article 18 of the Insurance Law is not unconstitutional and summary judgment should be granted to the defendants.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants challenged an order of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the Second Judicial Department (New York) affirming judgments convicting them of criminal possession of a dangerous drug and criminally using drug paraphernalia. Defendants contended that the testimony of an accomplice was unsupported by corroborating evidence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were convicted after a jury trial of criminal possession of a dangerous drug in the third and fourth degrees and of two counts of criminally using drug paraphernalia in the second degree. The appellate division affirmed. Defendants appealed, contending that the testimony of an accomplice was uncorroborated. In affirming, the court concluded that the trial court did not err in instructing the jurors that if they believed police testimony that there was contraband on the kitchen table when they entered the apartment, then the testimony of the accomplice had been sufficiently corroborated. In light of the evidence, this was ample corroboration. The contraband was found in the apartment of one defendant, and the other defendants were inside the apartment. The narcotics were found in open view in a room on private premises, and those persons in close proximity to the drugs at the time of discovery were statutorily presumed to have knowing possession. While this presumption was rebuttable, the jury was authorized, after hearing all the evidence, to draw from the presence of defendants at the place of discovery the logical inference that they were guilty of criminal possession.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order of the appellate division affirming defendants' convictions was affirmed as defendants' presence at the location where the narcotics were discovered by police raised a presumption that they were in knowing possession of the drugs and sufficiently corroborated the accomplice testimony.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- corroboration of accomplice testimony -- evidence that large supply of drugs was found on kitchen table in apartment of one of three defendants, that he was observed leaving apartment just prior to arrest, and that other two defendants were found inside apartment, was sufficient to supply required corroboration of testimony given by codefendant, who had previously pleaded guilty, that one of three defendants was his partner in drug trade and that they employed other two to distribute drugs and handle telephone calls regarding drugs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Three defendants were convicted by a jury of criminal possession of a dangerous drug in the third and fourth degrees and criminally using drug paraphernalia. At their trial, a codefendant, who had previously pleaded guilty, testified that one of them was his partner in the drug trade and that they employed the other two to distribute the drugs and to handle telephone calls regarding the drugs.  In addition to the testimony of this witness, who was an accomplice as a matter of law, there was other evidence that a large supply of drugs was found on the kitchen table in the apartment of the accomplice's alleged partner; that the latter was observed leaving the apartment just prior to his arrest, and that the other two convicted defendants were found inside the apartment. This additional proof tended to connect the convicted defendants with the commission of the offense, and, therefore, was sufficient to supply the required corroboration of the accomplice's testimony.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, Commissioner of Health of the State of New York and others, challenged a judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the Third Judicial Department (New York), which, in a proceeding pursuant to N.Y.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowners deeded to various individuals a number of parcels. The commissioner instituted an administrative proceeding alleging that the conveyances were in violation of N.Y. Pub. Health Law &sect; 1116. The commissioner found that the landowners had divided a tract of land into five or more parcels along an existing or proposed street, highway, easement, or right-of-way, for sale or for rent as residential lots or as residential building plots and had sold or offered for sale one or more of such parcels without having a plan of such subdivision filed with and approved by the Department of Health and without having filed a plan or map in the office of the county clerk.

The court found that the deeds contained no restrictions limiting the parcels to residential uses and there were no zoning regulations during the years in question affecting their enjoyment.

The terms &quot;residential lots&quot; and &quot;residential building plots&quot; as used in section 1115 of the Public Health Law are not defined.  However, the deeds from petitioners contain no restrictions limiting the parcels to residential uses, there were no zoning regulations affecting their enjoyment and there was no proof that petitioners sold the parcels singly or collectively for residential purposes or held themselves out as subdividers for such purposes.

The trial court concluded that the milk dealer was not arguably within the zone of interests to be protected by N.Y. Agric. &amp; Mkts. &sect; 258 and consequently lacked standing. The milk dealer contended that its interests fell within &sect; 258 because &sect; 258 was designed to regulate the milk producing industry by preventing practices that were unfair and destructive of competition. The court held that the milk dealer had standing because a fundamental tenet of the system of remedies was that when a government agency sought to act in a manner adversely affecting a party, judicial review of that action was proper.

Petitioner, a licensed milk dealer, has standing to challenge a determination of the Commissioner of Agriculture and Markets granting respondent milk association's application for an extension of its license to include a sales area presently served by petitioner.  While petitioner may not challenge the determination on due process grounds or by specific statutory right, when a government agency acts in a manner adversely affecting a party, judicial review may be had.  There is no underlying legislative intent to preclude review and, although petitioner lacks the right to intervene in the department proceedings, that does not preclude such review.  The Agriculture and Markets Law reflects an overriding legislative purpose to prevent destructive competition and petitioner, as an injured competitor, has standing to require compliance with that statute, particularly since the agency may act without a hearing.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the denial of his request for relief under N.Y. C.P.L.R. art. 78. N.Y. Civ. Serv.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State of New York (state) challenged a decision from the Erie County Court (New York), which reversed a city court's decision to convict defendant for using sound amplification equipment on a public street corner without first having obtained the permit required by Buffalo, N.Y., Ordinances ch. XXV, &sect; 1703 (ordinance).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was a candidate for a local school board. The city court convicted defendant of using sound amplification equipment on a public street corner without obtaining a permit as required by the ordinance. The county court reversed her conviction because the ordinance was an unconstitutional infringement of her First Amendment rights. The state appealed, and the court affirmed. The court held that the ordinance was unconstitutional as written. The ordinance contained provisions that impermissibly impinged upon the rights of free speech and assembly. The ordinance cast a chill over the freedom of speech because it required persons desiring permits to apply for them at least five days in advance. The ordinance was overbroad because it required the disclosure of every person who was to speak through the equipment. Finally, the ordinance was a prior restraint on speech because it mandated the denial of a permit if any person involved was previously convicted of a crime or of disorderly conduct.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the order of the county court which reversed defendant's conviction for using sound amplification equipment on a public street corner without first having obtained a permit as required by the ordinance.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional law -- sound amplification equipment -- Ordinance of City of Buffalo (ch XXV, &sect; 1703), which requires permit to use sound amplification equipment on public street, is </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">unconstitutional</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> -- provisions requiring application for permit to be made at least five days before equipment is to be used, requiring that name of every person who will speak through equipment be disclosed on application, denying permits when any person involved has been convicted of crime or disorderly conduct, and requiring that nature of subject matter to be broadcast must be described, infringe upon rights of free speech and assembly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Respondent was convicted for using sound amplification equipment on a public street corner without first having obtained the permit required by a City of Buffalo Ordinance (ch XXV, &sect; 1703).  The ordinance, as presently written, is unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Those parts of the ordinance which list the times and places where sound equipment may not be used and define criteria, such as congested traffic conditions, street repairs, or overcrowding caused by overlap of permits, to guide the police in determining whether considerations of public safety are extensive enough to permit limitations on the granting of a permit in the first instance, are sufficiently specific.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. But in other respects the ordinance contains provisions which infringe upon the rights of free speech and assembly: (a) It requires persons desiring permits to apply for them at least five days before they are to be used.  The purposes of publicizing views might be frustrated by the need to wait five days.  Only an administrative review of denials is provided for and no time limit for such review is specified.  (b) The ordinance requires that the name of every person who will speak through the equipment be disclosed on the application; it further orders that permits be denied when any person involved has been convicted of a crime or of disorderly conduct. The result is to bar free speech. Denial of a permit on the ground that a person has been convicted of a crime or disorderly conduct is not permissible -- it also constitutes a prior restraint on freedom of speech. (c) The ordinance requires that applicants for permits describe the nature of the subject matter to be broadcast. This, too, constitutes a form of prior restraint, and it also puts excessive discretion to decide what may be broadcast over amplifying equipment in the hands of the police.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, stock exchanges, sought review of a judgment from the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the First Judicial Department (New York), which directed entry of a judgment declaring N.Y. Tax Law &sect; 270-a valid and constitutional, modifying a trial court's denial of a motion by defendant state tax commission (Commission) to dismiss a complaint brought by the stock exchanges for a declaration that &sect; 270-a was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The stock exchanges brought an action against the Commission, seeking a judgment declaring N.Y. Tax Law &sect; 270-a&nbsp;unconstitutional on the grounds that it denied the stock exchanges equal protection of the laws and discriminated against interstate commerce in violation of U.S. Const. art I, &sect; 8. The trial court granted the Commission's motion to dismiss the action. An intermediate court modified the trial court's ruling and directed a judgment declaring &sect; 270-a valid and constitutional. The stock exchanges appealed, contending that &sect; 270-a discriminated against interstate commerce by encouraging nonresidents to sell New York securities on New York exchanges. On appeal, the court affirmed and held that the statute was valid and constitutional. Section 270a distinguished between residents and nonresidents of New York in favor of the latter as well as the former. The stated legislative goal of &sect; 270-a, to neutralize the economic advantage conferred by a prior version of the tax on exchanges located outside the state, was a valid one. A sale by a nonresident on a New York exchange -- the type of transaction the law allegedly encouraged -- was still interstate commerce.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed, with costs, the intermediate court's judgment, which modified, by granting in part the Commission's motion to dismiss the action brought by the stock exchanges, the trial court's denial of the Commission's motion to dismiss the action brought by the stock exchanges.</SPAN></P>

The full tax is payable, notwithstanding place of sale, unless the seller is a nonresident, and the distinction between in-State and out-of-State sales of New York securities by nonresidents is justifiable on the ground that in-State transactions are less susceptible to tax evasion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The statute does not discriminate against interstate commerce in favor of intrastate commerce; rather, it neutralizes an advantage conferred upon out-of-State stock exchanges by the prior taxing scheme.  By encouraging nonresidents to sell New York securities in New York, the statute does not discriminate against interstate commerce in favor of intrastate commerce, since such a sale is in interstate commerce, and, with respect to non-New York securities, the out-of-State exchanges retain their advantage.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant class of civil service employees and organizations challenged an order by the trial court (New York), which denied their motions for injunctions, summary judgment, and for declaratory rulings that the New York State Financial Emergency Act was unconstitutional, invalid, and violative of N.Y. Const. art. I., &sect; 7 and art. V, &sect; 6.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The class claimed that N. Y. Const. art. I., &sect; 7 and art. V, &sect; 6 were violated by the State Financial Emergency Act (Act) because it allowed appellee comptroller, as trustee of certain employees' retirement funds, unlimited power over those funds. The court agreed and it modified the judgment. It held that the pension fund of the Employees Retirement System was the property of its member, and as such it could not have been taken without the due process of law. Moreover, the comptroller's decision to invest a small portion of the assets of the retirement fund in bonds would not per se have constituted an impairment of the benefits of the members of the retirement system. However, the comptroller, as the trustee of the retirement funds being vested with the discretion to invest in such securities as are authorized by statute, constituted a violation of the nonimpairment clause because the means designed to assure benefits to public employees and those already retired would have been impaired by the Act. The court held that the judgment had to be modified to declare &sect; 14 unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court modified the judgment, without assessing costs to either party.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional law -- impairment of retirement benefits -- </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">section 14 of New York State Financial</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> Emergency Act</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> for City of New York, which mandates State Comptroller to purchase bonds of Municipal Assistance Corporation for City of New York from funds of State retirement systems, violates section 7 of article V of State Constitution, prohibiting impairment of benefits of State retirement systems; Legislature may not strip Comptroller of his discretion in making investments of retirement funds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Section 14 of the New York State Financial Emergency Act for the City of New York (L 1975, chs 868, 869, 870), which mandates the State Comptroller to purchase at face value bonds of the Municipal Assistance Corporation for the City of New York (MAC) in the amount of $ 125,000,000 from the funds of the State Employees' Retirement System and the State Patrolmen's and Firemen's Retirement System, violates section 7 of article V of the New York State Constitution, prohibiting impairment of benefits of any retirement system of the State or civil division thereof.  Although the constitutional provision is limited to &quot;benefits&quot; to which members of a retirement system are entitled, that necessarily implies protection of the sources of funds for those benefits.  While the Legislature may expand or restrict the classes of investments the Comptroller may make, it is powerless under the constitutional provision to mandate that he mindlessly invest in whatever securities it directs.  To strip the Comptroller, who is solely vested with discretion to make investments, of his personal responsibility is to remove a safeguard integral to the maintenance of the security of the sources of benefits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. It is immaterial whether the mandate is addressed to a small proportion or to a substantial part of the funds in the care of the Comptroller.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Whether the retirement benefits will be sufficiently protected by the assigned existing taxes to secure MAC bonds or will be protected by future tax levies of the State and its subdivisions need not be considered.  The benefits are already protected by the tax levying power.  </SPAN></P>

The complaints received about Sunday sales were instituted by union representatives and were made only against certain food supermarkets. The union was responding to member complaints about work on Sundays and the cut in total work hours for senior members caused by additional hiring of part-time employees. The court noted that &sect; 9 had never been actively enforced and was only prosecuted upon the complaint of a private party. The union's effort to manipulate the law for purely private purposes clearly evidenced discriminatory enforcement. While discriminatory enforcement was limited to State action, the record showed that the power of the prosecutor's office was lent to the union in their campaign and their actions became those of the State for purposes of the Equal Protection Clause of U.S. Const. amend.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.

It had been the policy over a period of years to prosecute violations only on complaints by private citizens, and in the instant case supermarkets were singled out among food markets for prosecution by an employee union to deal with a reduction in hours caused by Sunday sales.

The court held it was unnecessary, as a precondition to the taking, to determine that the public benefit in assuring the retention of the private employer was sufficient to outweigh the benefit that was conferred on the employer. There was nothing inherently wrong in serving both the city's need for renewal of its substandard land and its desire to keep the employer. The city's bare pleading of its &quot;substandard&quot; finding, failed to indicate the grounds upon which it concluded that the land was substandard. However, the landowners failed to raise properly by their pleadings the issue of the quality of the taken land.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Removal of substandard conditions is a sufficiently dominant public purpose to justify the exercise of the condemnation powers of government by the plaintiff community development agency, and economic underdevelopment and stagnation will render an area eligible for such urban renewal.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Although substandard or &quot;blighted&quot; land should be liberally defined to include areas of improper land use and unwise planning, with wide agency discretion to decide what constitutes &quot;blight&quot;, the facts supporting such a determination should be set forth.  The plaintiff community development agency failed to indicate the grounds upon which it concluded that the defendants' land was substandard and upon which it would have entitled it to summary judgment unless such grounds were shown by the landowners to be without foundation.

Therefore, the court concluded that the three-year period of limitation with respect to plaintiffs' causes of action for personal injuries stemming from defendants allegedly defective products began to run at the date of injury.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the appellate division's judgment, holding that strict products liability sounds in tort rather than in contract and that, thus, the tort statute of limitations applied.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Limitations of actions -- strict products liability -- period of limitations with respect to strict products liability claims by remote users for injuries arising out of defective products begins to run at time of injury, since cause of action sounds in tort rather than contract -- period of limitations should be three-year period applicable to negligence actions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The period of limitation with respect to strict products liability claims by remote users for injuries arising out of defective products begins to run at the time of injury. Strict products liability sounds in tort rather than contract, since liability is based on social policy rather than a jural relationship entered into between two parties prior to injury, and, accordingly, the cause of action should accrue at the time of injury. While the passage of time may decrease a manufacturer's capability to defend, it complicates the plaintiff's problem of proving that the defect existed when the product left the manufacturer's plant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. No material factors suggest that the period of limitations should be different for strict products liability than for negligence and the three-year period in CPLR 214 (subds 4, 5) should apply.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent state legislators sought review from an order of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the Third Judicial Department (New York), which reversed, on the law and the facts, an order denying a motion to dismiss a proceeding pursuant to N.Y. C.P.L.R. 78 with respect to the individual petitioner taxpayers, who sought a declaration that the state budget provision for legislators' pensions and fringe benefits was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate division dismissed taxpayers' constitutional challenge to the legislators' pension provision of the state budget bill on the ground that St. Clair v Yonkers Raceway, 13 N.Y. 2d 72, narrowly limited persons having capacity to make such challenges to those personally aggrieved thereby, and then only if the determination of the grievance required a determination of constitutionality. The court overruled that decision, holding that the time had come to bring the state's practice with respect to review of state legislative action into conformity not only with the practice in the majority of other states but also with the procedural standing of taxpayers to challenge local actions. The court found that the failure to accord such standing would be in effect to erect an impenetrable barrier to any judicial scrutiny of legislative action. Therefore, the motion to dismiss should not have been granted, but the lower courts should have issued a declaratory judgment on the merits rejecting taxpayers' contentions that the legislative and executive retirement plan violated provisions of the state constitution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court concluded that there was no substance to taxpayers' claims that the executive and legislative retirement plan was unconstitutional.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The petitioner taxpayers have standing to challenge, on constitutional grounds, State legislative enactments authorizing the expenditure of State moneys where failure to accord standing would effectively prevent judicial scrutiny of legislative action. The individual citizen-taxpayer, who is encouraged to take an active interest in government and would be most likely to invoke the powers of the judiciary, should not be excluded from access to the judiciary, which is an integral aspect of the doctrine of separation of powers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The legislative and executive retirement plan of the State of New York (Retirement and Social Security Law, &sect; 80-a) does not compensate officeholders beyond their terms in office or constitute payment of unauthorized fees in violation of the State Constitution (NY Const, art XIII, &sect; 7; art III, &sect; 6), since retirement benefits are a component of current compensation,  in which presently earned payment is deferred, and neither constitutional provision relied upon forbids future payment of currently earned income.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Respondents' motion to dismiss, to the extent that it is applicable to petitioners' subsequently served &quot;First Amended Petition&quot;, should be granted, since petitioners' allegations, that lump sum payments to legislators in lieu of expenses are unconstitutional, are so inexactly stated that they fail to state an identifiable cause of action upon which declaratory relief may be granted in favor of either party.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged an order of the Appellate Division of the New York County Supreme Court (New York) that reversed a family court judgment concluding that appellee had committed acts that, if done by an adult, would constitute the crimes of manslaughter, assault, and possession of a dangerous weapon and committing him to a detention center.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee, a minor, was arrested and taken to the police station, and his mother was notified that he was in police custody. Appellee was questioned both before and after her arrival. The family court concluded that appellee had committed acts that, if done by an adult, would constitute manslaughter, assault, and possession of a dangerous weapon and ordered that he be committed to a detention center. The appellate division reversed, concluding that appellee's statements should have been excluded, as the police failed to comply with the mandates of N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 724. In reversing, the appellate court concluded that police sufficiently complied with the statute; while appellee's parent was not contacted until his arrival at the police station, this did not constitute undue delay. Further, as the appellate division had not yet designated any facility suitable for questioning children, precise compliance was not possible. Additionally, the statutory mandate that the child be taken immediately to family court was subject to an exception when the police officer determined that it was necessary to question the child.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Respondent, a person alleged to be a juvenile delinquent, was properly accorded his right under subdivision (a) of section 724 of the Family Court Act to have his parent immediately notified of his arrest. While no call was made until arrival at the station house, the call was made without undue delay and such delay as did occur was reasonably justified.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Since the Appellate Division had not yet designated any facility in the First Department, including the station house to which respondent was taken, as suitable for the questioning of children, as required by the Family Court Act ( &sect; 724, subd [b], par [ii]), precise statutory compliance was impossible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The statutory requirement that respondent should be taken directly to the Family Court (Family Ct Act, &sect; 724, subd [b], par [ii]) was not violated when the police took respondent to the station house, since the mandate is subject to an express exception if it is determined that the child should be questioned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. As at least a mixed question of fact, the issue of taint with respect to respondent's written statement, on the basis of questioning prior to respondent's mother's arrival, is not reviewable by the Court of Appeals.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Eight defendants appealed separate orders of the Appellate Divisions of the Supreme Court (New York) affirming their respective sentences and convictions for drug trafficking. Defendants alleged that the drug trafficking statutes under which they were convicted imposed cruel and unusual punishment and were disproportionate to their crimes pursuant to N.Y. Const. art. I, &sect; 5 and U.S. Const. amend. VIII.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Eight defendants challenged the constitutionality of statutes classifying the drug-trafficking crimes for which they were convicted as class A felonies, the highest rank of crime in the state. Defendants also challenged the sentencing provisions under N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 70.00, which imposed a mandatory maximum sentence of life imprisonment and minimums from one or six years to eight and one-third years. The principal issue was whether the laws mandating life imprisonment, and therefore lifetime parole on parole release, prescribed sentences so disproportionate as would constitute cruel and unusual punishment in violation of constitutional limitations contained in N.Y. Const. art. I, &sect; 5 and U.S. Const. amend. VIII. Drug trafficking was a widespread phenomenon that impoverished the users and led to violent crime. The court affirmed the judgments upholding the drug-trafficking statutes. The court held that the punishments imposed for these crimes were not grossly disproportionate or cruel and unusual in the constitutional sense based upon the legislature's rational view of the gravity of the offenses, the danger posed by the offenders, and the penological purposes served.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the orders of the appellate divisions upholding defendants' sentences for drug trafficking.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sections 220.40, 220.39 and 220.18, which classify the crimes for which the defendants were convicted as class A felonies and the applicable sentencing provisions (Penal Law, &sect; 70.00, subd 2, par [a]; subd 3, par [a], cls [ii], [iii]), imposing a mandatory maximum term of imprisonment for life and minimums of one or six years to eight and one-third years for sales of drugs, are not so disproportionate to the crime as to constitute cruel and unusual punishment.  The cruel and unusual punishment clause (NY Const, art I, &sect; 5; US Const, 8th Amdt) is flexible, prohibiting gross disproportionality of punishment, a determination to which the gravity of the offense and the danger to society of the offender are decisive.  Narcotics sales are symptomatic of a widespread phenomenon in which crimes of violence are engendered against law enforcement officers, drug traffickers themselves, addicts and the public.  Facing a high recidivism rate in drug-related crimes and an inadequate response to less severe punishment, the Legislature could reasonably shift the emphasis from rehabilitation to isolation and deterrence. While the drug offenses are punished more severely and inflexibly than almost any other offense in the State and more severely than in any other jurisdiction, the punishments are not irrationally severe, given the dimensions of the problem.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State appealed an order from the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the First Judicial Department (New York), which reversed a verdict convicting defendant of criminally selling a dangerous drug in the third degree, and which directed a new trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">As a sanction for his failure to comply with a notice of alibi statute,&nbsp;N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 250.20, defendant was prevented from calling an alibi witness. The court found that the statute was unconstitutional. The court applied its holding as to the statute's unconstitutionality retroactively. Therefore, on the ground that the alibi witness testimony should not have been excluded, the judgment of conviction was properly reversed. The due process standard, sought to be applied retroactively, profoundly and directly affected the fact finding process itself. The requirement that the seriousness of the decision for which retroactivity was sought, be balanced against the seriousness of its impact on the administration of justice, was easily met. The decision was of serious constitutional dimension, and the effect on the administration of justice by retroactive application was, at most, relatively inconsequential. The court affirmed the order.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court determined that the notice of alibi statute was unconstitutional, and applied its holding retroactively to determine that alibi witness testimony against defendant should not have been excluded.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Where the defendant was prevented from calling an alibi witness for failure to comply with New York State's notice-of-alibi statute ( CPL 250.20), a subsequent holding that the statute is unconstitutional should be given retroactive effect on direct appeal. While a defendant who complied with the statute should not derive benefit from the declaration of unconstitutionality, since the effect of the statute, which required disclosure of alibi witnesses, was only to hinder such a defendant's preparation to rebut the prosecution's rebuttal of the alibi, a defendant who has been prevented from calling a witness suffers a detriment which profoundly and directly affects the fact-finding process.  On balance, the effect of retroactive application on the administration of justice is, at most, inconsequential since there has been no significant reliance on the statute by law enforcement authorities and since any prejudice may be counteracted by the trial court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Testimony by an undercover police officer as to a station house viewing of the defendant six hours after arrest did not violate the defendant's due process rights.  The officer had allegedly purchased heroin from the defendant, contacted other officers, and then relocated the defendant for arrest by other officers.  The station house viewing was not for identification, but was to ascertain if the officers had arrested the proper person.  The second viewing by a trained police officer who was a deliberate participant in the criminal encounter does not bear the burden of the caveats involved in an identification by a nonprofessional. Rather than being improper, the procedure assured that an innocent man was not arrested.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The police officer's testimony with regard to his second viewing did not constitute improper bolstering, since only third-party bolstering is prejudicial hearsay, and his testimony regarding his first viewing, although bolstering the testimony of the other officers, was nothing more than the strengthening of eyewitness testimony by other testimony to the same effect.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Accordingly,  there should be a new trial. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant and the People appealed from an order of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the Third Judicial Department (New York), which modified, on the law, and as modified affirmed a judgment convicting defendant of murder in the second degree. The modification consisted of convicting defendant of manslaughter in the first degree and remanding the matter to the trial court for resentencing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was originally convicted for murder in the second degree after being indicted for murder in the first degree. On direct appeal of the conviction, the appellate division reduced the conviction to the lesser included offense of manslaughter in the first degree. A federal appeals court held that defendant was deprived of his constitutional right to a trial when the appellate division summarily reduced the conviction to first degree manslaughter. The court found that when defendant was retried for murder in the second degree, that portion of the order of the appellate division setting aside the conviction for murder in the second degree, which under N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 470.20(3), then carried with it a dismissal of the charge, was still in effect because it had never been expressly nullified. Therefore, upon the second trial, the court lacked the power to try defendant for murder in the second degree and the appellate division did not err in setting defendant's conviction aside.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed an order that as modified convicted defendant of manslaughter in the first degree and remanded the matter for resentencing, because the trial court lacked the power to retry defendant.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- former jeopardy -- defendant could not be retried for murder in second degree after Appellate Division reduced conviction thereof to manslaughter in first degree for insufficiency of proof resulting from suppression of evidence, despite Federal court nullification of that appellate holding on ground that defendant was deprived thereby of right to be tried on lesser charge without inadmissible evidence before jury; reduction of original conviction necessarily involved</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> reversal of conviction on higher charge and affirmance of lower charge, and Federal court order did not nullify entire order, leaving reversal portion, such that effect thereof is same as acquittal -- reversal of conviction on higher charge was equivalent to dismissal thereof and mere granting of new trial could not restore charge -- retrial on lower charge was not precluded since only order relating to higher charge was dismissed, notwithstanding Federal nullification of conviction on lesser charge -- defendant was properly convicted on lesser charge on retrial for higher crime, since proof resulting in second improper conviction for higher charge was sufficient to establish guilt of lower charge, and Appellate Division could reduce conviction under </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">CPL 470.15</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> (subd 2) because tainted evidence was not admitted and lesser offense was one for which jury could have convicted -- accordingly, Appellate Division's second reduction of conviction to manslaughter in first degree, following retrial, was proper and case was properly remanded for resentencing defendant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The defendant could not be retried for murder in the second degree after the Appellate Division summarily reduced his conviction thereof to manslaughter in the first degree for insufficiency of proof resulting from suppression of certain evidence, despite a Federal court nullification of that appellate holding on the ground that the defendant was deprived thereby of the right to be tried on the lesser charge without the inadmissible evidence before the jury.  Unless an appellate order setting aside a conviction is reversed, the defendant may not be retried for the offense and the effect is the same as acquittal.  The Federal court order did not nullify the Appellate Division order in its entirety.  The reduction of the original conviction to manslaughter in the first degree necessarily involved a reversal of the conviction on the higher charge and an affirmance of the conviction for the lesser included offense of manslaughter in the first degree.  There is nothing offensive in the partial invalidation of an appellate order modifying a conviction, as is best illustrated by the procedure of cross appeals in which the court considers only the appeal of each party from that portion of the order which adversely affects him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. When the defendant was retried, the portion of the Appellate Division order setting aside the conviction for murder in the second degree, which necessarily carried with it a dismissal of that charge, was still in effect, and the mere granting of a new trial on another count could not restore the dismissed charge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Since it was only the order relating to the charge of murder in the second degree which was equivalent to a dismissal, and the conviction of manslaughter in the first degree was affirmed, retrial on the latter charge was not precluded, notwithstanding Federal nullification of the conviction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. On retrial the defendant was properly convicted of manslaughter in the first degree, since the proof resulting in his second improper conviction of murder in the second degree was sufficient to establish guilt of the lesser included offense and the conviction may be reduced under CPL 470.15 (subd 2).  Since the tainted evidence was not admitted, the lesser offense was one for which the jury could have convicted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Accordingly, the Appellate Division's second reduction of the conviction to manslaughter in the first degree, following retrial, was proper and the case was properly remanded for resentencing the defendant.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Petitioner is entitled to an order directing respondent township to make future assessments at full value as required by section 306 of the Real Property Tax Law. The widespread practice of utilizing fractional real property assessments involves a flagrant violation of the statute, perpetuated by such factors as the ability it affords taxing authorities to increase revenues while maintaining a stable tax rate, to tax various forms of property at different rates and to affect the amount of State aid which is based upon assessed valuation. Since assessments may not exceed full value (NY Const, art XVI, &sect; 2), fractional valuation discourages claims of overvaluation, and a taxpayer has the more difficult task of proving inequality of assessment.  Undervaluation makes it difficult to ascertain whether there is uniformity of assessment or inequality as a result of incompetence, favoritism or corruption.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. An invalidation of the assessment rolls would create fiscal chaos for respondent township, which would be a sufficient basis to deny an order of mandamus and, since relief under section 706 of the Real Property Tax Law, contesting an illegal assessment, would have the same impact, the settled assessment rolls should not be disturbed by declaring them a nullity.  Accordingly, an order directing future assessments to be made at full value should go into effect within a reasonable time, but not later than December 31, 1976, and in the interim any tax levies, liens, foreclosures or transfers shall not be subject to challenge for failure to comply with section 306 of the Real Property Tax Law.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">N.Y. Civ. Serv.

It was argued that &sect; 209 was unconstitutional and the court disagreed and affirmed the judgment against appellant City of Buffalo. The court held that N.Y. Const. art.

The Home Rule powers sustain the regulation of the hours of work and compensation of employees by a local government only to the extent that such exercise is not inconsistent with a general law enacted by the Legislature,  and when an impasse in negotiations is reached and arbitration is sought, an attempt by a local government to regulate hours of work and compensation of policemen and firemen would be inconsistent with the arbitration procedure established by the Legislature.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. There is no unconstitutional delegation of authority by the Legislature to the arbitration panels.

Plaintiff also challenged the findings that denied plaintiff's application for an injunction, granted defendant's motion for summary judgment, and declared the act constitutional. The court modified the lower court's judgment to state that plaintiff did state a valid cause of action for relief and affirmed all other findings. The injunction was properly denied, as the notes, bonds, or other obligations of the Stabilization Reserve Corporation (SRC) were not the debt of either defendant or the state, and neither defendant nor the state was liable thereon. Additionally, any payments made by defendant to the SRC would have been proper, as defendant had an absolute right following the receipt of any state-aide monies to pay a portion thereof to a public benefit corporation under N.Y.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The New York City Stabilization Reserve Corporation Act (Public Authorities Law, &sect;&sect; 2530 - 2549) is constitutional.  The act provides for sale of bonds by a public benefit corporation, with the proceeds to be paid to the City of New York and yearly deficits of the corporation to be paid by the city.  It is specified that neither the city nor the State is liable for debts of the corporation, and if the city fails to make appropriations therefor the State Comptroller will pay the required amounts from the first moneys becoming available to the city from per capita State aid or the Stock Transfer Tax Fund.  The act complies with section 1 of article VIII of the New York Constitution, which prohibits the loan of the city's credit in aid of a public corporation, since any appropriation would be, according to the terms of the act, a gift rather than payment of indebtedness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Since the city can in no way become indebted, there is no violation of sections 2 or 4 of article VIII or section 5 of article X of the Constitution which prohibit, respectively, the city from contracting indebtedness without pledging its full faith and credit, from contracting indebtedness in excess of its debt limitation and from becoming liable for the obligations of a public corporation.  The city has a right to pay a portion of its State aid moneys to a public corporation and the mere directive by the State and city respecting the distribution of such funds creates no lien thereon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Reference in the complaint to the constitutional debt limitation of the City of New York and to the insufficiency of borrowing power of the city under such restriction to permit the contemplated sale of bonds under the act does not indicate an overindebtedness separate from that questioned with respect to the Stabilization Reserve Corporation, and no cause of action is made out in relation thereto.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Since the plaintiff himself specifically requested judgment pursuant to subdivision (c) of CPLR 3211, which converts a motion to dismiss into a summary judgment motion, he cannot be heard to complain that he received insufficient notice that the court would treat the defendant's CPLR 3211 motion as a CPLR 3212 motion for summary judgment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. The plaintiff has standing to bring this action under the taxpayer provisions of section 51 of the General Municipal Law. The city is a proper and necessary party, since the complaint is directed at the manner in which the city meets its constitutional mandates, which obviates the technical arguments respecting the nonjoinder of the State and the Stabilization Reserve Corporation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. Accordingly, the Stabilization Reserve Corporation Act was properly declared valid, and the complaint stated a cause of action for the relief demanded.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The main issue was whether each petitioner could be subjected to the unincorporated business tax on that portion of the 1961 New York joint venture income, which exceeded the percentage of the total corporate income on which New York franchise taxes were required to be paid under the allocation formula. The court determined that petitioners were entitled to an unincorporated tax exemption limited to the amount, which was included in the corporate partners' income allocable to New York State as a result of the application of New York's allocation formula and not just an exemption for an amount equal to the allocation ratio percentage of the income allocable to New York.  N.Y. Tax Law &sect; 709(2) meant just what it said: It was the amount of corporate income included in that allocable to New York pursuant to ratio that was the limit of the exemption and not just the ratio percentage of that New York income. Thus, the statute spoke of an &quot;amount&quot; of income rather than percentage. Only any amount of income from the joint venture that exceeded the amount of total corporate income allocable to New York for corporate franchise tax purposes was subject to the unincorporated business tax.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The corporate petitioners engaged in electrical or construction work on a project within New York State and paid corporate franchise taxes ratably to the extent that their total income was attributable to New York State.

The petitioners may not be exempted from unincorporated business tax only on the portion of New York State joint venture income which equals the percentage of that income upon which corporate franchise taxes were paid, since the statute speaks of &quot;amount&quot; rather than percentage of income.  Only the amount of joint venture income which exceeds the total corporate income allocable to New York State for corporate franchise tax purposes is subject to unincorporated business tax. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, town and officials, amended a zoning ordinance to create a residence district providing for a retirement community district. The town's subsequent resolution granted an application of defendant corporation to rezone its land. Plaintiff homeowners filed an action for declaratory judgment and injunctive relief. The Supreme Court (New York) affirmed the trial court, which upheld both the amendment and the resolution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The town's resolution allowed the corporation to rezone its land from a district allowing single-family dwellings to a retirement community district for the purpose of building residences designed for older people. The application for rezoning was granted following a public hearing. None of the homeowners appeared or raised any objection at that hearing or at the earlier one regarding passage of the amendment. The homeowners claimed that the town board exceeded the zoning powers delegated it by the legislature and impermissibly applied a classification based upon age. The court held that the grant provided a sufficient basis for the town's amendment to provide for multiple residences for elderly people. The enabling legislation empowered the town to regulate and restrict the use of land for the purpose of promoting the health, safety, morals, or the general welfare of the community. The amendment had a rational basis. There was no indication that the intent or effect of the ordinance was to segregate the community according to age or to benefit a particular building developer in the absence of a need for specialized housing for the elderly.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defendant town did not exceed its powers to regulate land use for the community health and general welfare (Town Law, &sect; 261) by amending its zoning ordinance to create a residence district providing, among other uses, for a &quot;Retirement Community District&quot;, and it validly granted a reclassification of a parcel of land as a &quot;Retirement Community District&quot; for the purpose of building multiple residences for aged persons.  The town's action was inclusionary, rather than exclusionary, and is a movement toward correction of social and historical patterns of housing deprivation. Possible depreciation in value to surrounding residential properties, by virtue of increased traffic, will not shield the existing zoning classification from adaptation to changing community needs.  Age considerations are appropriate when rationally related to a proper governmental purpose, such as meeting the special needs of an important segment of the population by establishing, as opposed to denying, a zoning district allowing residences designed for, but not limited to, aged persons.  There is no indication of intent to discriminate against younger people, to benefit a particular builder or to reap tax base benefits without the drain on municipal services created by families and children, and there is no arbitrary specific age limit in the ordinance. &quot;Senior citizenship&quot; is within the normal expectancy of most people, rather than an unalterable classification, and provision for the elderly may be viewed as a nondiscriminatory exercise of the power to provide for the general welfare of all people, since, even if fairly debatable, the town board's legislative judgment must control.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The father contended that N.Y. Dom. Rel. Law &sect;111(3), which limited consent to the adoption of a child born out of wedlock to the natural mother, was unconstitutional in that it violated the due process and equal protection clauses of the United States Constitution by unjustly discriminating between fathers of children born out of wedlock and all other parents. On appeal, the court held that if consent was to be required of the father of an out-of-wedlock child, that was a matter for the legislature; the courts had no right to expand the terms of the instant statute. The classification of &sect; 111(3) discriminating between fathers of children born out of wedlock and all other parents was reasonable, not arbitrary, and, because it kept in mind the paramount consideration of a child's welfare, the legislative action was justified. The court held that although it was an adoption proceeding, the father, having been given notice by court direction, the right to object, and a full hearing with representation by an attorney, was not deprived of due process, N.Y.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the adoption of a child born out of wedlock, the Domestic Relations Law ( &sect; 111, subd 3) requires the natural mother's consent, but does not require the natural father's consent.  This legislative distinction or classification is reasonable and constitutional, irrespective of whether or not paternity has been determined by an order of filiation and whether or not the natural father has paid some support.  The constitutional requirement of equal protection of the laws is not served by giving an out-of-wedlock child's natural father a possibly extortionate veto against an adoption which is in the child's best interests.  In this case, due process was accorded to the natural father when the court gave him notice of the petition for adoption and he appeared by counsel and objected and the court held a hearing thereon and determined that the proposed adoption by the man whom the natural mother has recently married is in the best interests of the child.  The judgment of adoption is affirmed.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed an order of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the Fourth Judicial Department (New York), which affirmed his conviction, upon a plea of guilty, for attempted criminal possession of a dangerous drug in the fourth degree in violation of N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 220.15.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted for attempted criminal possession of a dangerous drug in the fourth degree in violation of N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 220.15. He received five years' probation. The appellate division affirmed, and defendant appealed. On appeal, the central issue was whether a police officer could arbitrarily stop an automobile solely to examine the motorist's license and registration or to inspect the vehicle for possible equipment violations. The court, in reversing defendant's conviction, found that police officers were authorized to conduct &quot;routine traffic checks&quot; if the stop was based upon specific and articulable facts which, taken together with rational inferences from those facts, reasonably warranted the intrusion. Additionally, police officers could conduct nonarbitrary, uniform, and systematic inspections. Here, the stop was an unreasonable limited seizure. The officer's subsequent discoveries constituted derivative evidence obtained by an illegal seizure that should have been suppressed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The intermediate court's order affirming defendant's conviction was reversed and conviction was vacated; defendant's conviction for attempted criminal possession of a dangerous drug in the fourth degree was vacated because the contraband discovered was derivative evidence obtained by an illegal seizure that should have been suppressed because the police officer improperly stopped defendant's vehicle without cause.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- unlawful search and seizure -- police officer may not arbitrarily stop automobile, solely because of unusual appearance, to examine license and registration or to inspect for equipment violations; such stops must be only upon reasonable suspicion of violation or according to nonarbitrary, uniform procedures in order to balance State's compelling interest in highway safety with motorist's interest in being free of arbitrary State intrusion -- defendant's conviction of attempted criminal possession of dangerous drug in fourth degree, based upon evidence obtained in illegal seizure of automobile, is vacated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A police officer may not arbitrarily stop an automobile on a public highway, solely because of its unusual appearance,  to examine the motorist's license and registration or to inspect the vehicle for possible equipment violations.  The defendant's conviction of attempted criminal possession of a dangerous drug in the fourth degree, based upon evidence obtained in an illegal seizure of his automobile, is accordingly vacated.  A single automobile on a public highway may be stopped only upon reasonable suspicion of a violation of the Vehicle and Traffic Law and, absent a minimal degree of such suspicion, a &quot;routine traffic check&quot; may be conducted only according to nonarbitrary, nondiscriminatory, uniform procedures, such as at roadblocks, checkpoints and weighing stations.  An automobile stop is a limited seizure within constitutional limitations.  The State's compelling interest in highway safety, requiring some form of on-the-spot inspection, is properly balanced with the motorist's general right to be free from arbitrary State intrusion by an elimination of any arbitrary element in the practice.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of a decision of the Appellate Term of the Supreme Court in the Second Judicial Department (New York), which affirmed his conviction for attempted possession of gambling records in the second degree.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">To uncover illegal gambling policy slips, a police detective obtained a search warrant to search a restaurant occupied by a named suspect and to search any &quot;persons occupying said premises&quot; pursuant to N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 690.15(2). The warrant was executed. Defendant, who was not named in the warrant and who was sitting in the restaurant, was told to empty his pockets. He complied and policy slips were recovered. Defendant was charged with attempted possession of gambling records. He moved to suppress the evidence seized on the ground that he was not named or described in the warrant and that the search of his person violated his constitutional rights. The motion was denied, and defendant was convicted. The lower appellate court affirmed. He sought review, arguing the court erred when it refused to suppress the seized evidence. The court vacated the judgment and dismissed the information. It held that even though N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 690.15(2) allowed searches of any person present at the scene, the warrant was too general. The court found the warrant lacked any limitation of the scope of the area to be searched and lacked a sufficiently particular description of its targets.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the lower appellate court's decision, vacated defendant's conviction of attempted possession of gambling records in the second degree, and dismissed the information.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- search warrants -- search warrant authorizing search of restaurant, named individual, not defendant, and &quot;any other person occupying said premises&quot;, issued upon information that named individual received money and policy papers and went into restaurant, is not sufficiently particular with respect to defendant, occupant of restaurant, sitting alone, since there was no probable cause to believe every occupant of specified premises possessed policy slips, and conviction for attempted possession of gambling records is, accordingly, vacated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. A search warrant authorizing a search of certain premises, a named individual, not the defendant, and &quot;any other persons occupying said premises&quot; did not meet the particularity requirements of the Fourth Amendment with respect to the defendant and the defendant's conviction for the crime of attempted possession of gambling records should, accordingly, be vacated. The warrant was issued upon information that a &quot;known and convicted policy operator&quot; had several times received money and policy papers in front of the specified premises, a restaurant, and had gone inside after each transaction.  Upon execution of the warrant, a search was conducted of the named individual, a companion, and the defendant who was seated alone at a table.  Although CPL 690.15 (subd 2) provides for a warrant directing a search of a designated place and any person therein, the description in the warrant and its supporting affidavit must be sufficiently definite to enable the searcher to identify the persons, places or things to be searched. In this case the sufficiency of the description hinges upon whether there was probable cause to believe that each and every occupant of the specified premises possessed the policy slips sought under the warrant.  The facts before the issuing Judge, based upon a single, one-hour observation of the exterior of the premises seven days prior to the warrant application, did not support such an inference or indicate that the premises were limited to criminal activity, and the description of the defendant was, therefore, too general.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. An application for a warrant pursuant to CPL 690.15 must delineate the character of the premises, the nature of the illegal activity, the number and behavior of persons present during the times when the warrant is sought to be executed and whether any person apparently unconnected with the illegal activity has been seen at the premises.  The locus of the search must be limited to the area of criminal activity, and, in determining the reasonableness of the application, the necessity for this type of search should be considered.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner landowner sought review of a decision of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the Third Judicial Department (New York), which reversed the judgment of the trial court that granted an application by the landowner for a judgment directing respondent comptroller to pay an additional sum of post-judgment interest on a judgment of the Court of Claims, and dismissed the petition.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The comptroller issued the landowner a check, the balance of principal due and post-judgment interest until 20 days after the time to appeal had expired. The landowner thereupon demanded additional post-judgment interest to cover the further period to the date of actual payment. The comptroller rejected the demand by virtue of the 20-day limitation on post-judgment interest in the Court of Claims Act (Act). The court affirmed the decision of the appellate court and held that the denial of the landowner's request for additional interest was proper because the landowner did not show that the comptroller's payment of judgments was substantially and seriously delayed beyond the 20-day limitation period, as a matter of course. The court found that the delay in payment may have been attributable in large part to the landowner's conceded failure to file a certified copy of the judgment as required by the act.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the decision of the lower court.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Judgments -- interest on judgment of Court of Claims -- limitation on post-judgment interest on judgment of Court of Claims from date thereof &quot;until the twentieth day after the comptroller is authorized to issue his warrant for&quot; payment (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Court of Claims Act, &sect; 20</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">, subd. 7) is constitutional; it does not deprive claimant of just compensation for appropriation of real property -- substantial delay in payment of judgment beyond 20-day period, not shown by claimant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Subdivision 7 of section 20 of the Court of Claims Act insofar as it limits interest on a Court of Claims judgment against the State from the date thereof &quot;until the twentieth day after the comptroller is authorized to issue his warrant for the payment thereof&quot; is constitutional.  That limitation does not deprive a claimant of his right to &quot;just compensation&quot; for the appropriation of real property in eminent domain. The compensation required by the State and Federal Constitutions includes interest on an award from the date of taking to the date of adjudication.  Post-judgment interest is awarded as a penalty by legislative grace and, absent a showing of unreasonable delay in payment of the judgment, the 20-day limitation must be sustained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. In the instant case in which claimant's land was appropriated and an award made by the Court of Claims, claimant had not proven a substantial delay beyond the 20-day period.  Any delay in payment of the claim may be due in large part to claimant's failure to file a certified copy of the judgment (Court of Claims Act, &sect; 20, subd. 6).  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent hearing officer challenged the judgment of the appellate court that annulled a hearing of constitutional grounds pursuant to N.Y.

Respondent challenged the appellate court's judgment that petitioner was deprived due process because he was convicted of speeding by clear and convincing evidence instead of beyond a reasonable doubt. The court reversed and found that the real question was the constitutionality of the substitution in the adjudication functions by an administrative agency and administrative procedures for the courts of criminal jurisdiction and criminal procedures. The court held that the transfer of traffic infractions to an administrative agency was clearly authorized by the legislature for reasons of reducing congestion in the criminal courts. The court rejected petitioner's contention that he was denied due process by the use of the clear and convincing standard in the adjudication of civil fines because fines were routinely imposed under a standard less than beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A judgment that annulled an administrative hearing that found petitioner driver guilty of speeding by clear and convincing evidence was reversed because the legislature clearly intended to transfer adjudication of traffic offenses to an administrative agency and away from the criminal courts and there was no due process violation because fines were regularly imposed by a standard less than beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional law -- administrative adjudication of traffic infractions -- burden of proof -- substitution in adjudication of traffic infractions of administrative agency and administrative procedures for courts of criminal jurisdiction and judicial procedures, where conviction can result only in fines, is not </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">unconstitutional;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> transfer authorized due to volume of traffic on highways and congestion in criminal courts -- </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">statute</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Vehicle and Traffic Law, &sect; 227</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">, subd. 1), establishing burden of proof on People in such proceedings as &quot;clear and convincing evidence&quot;, does not unconstitutionally deny due process -- nor is there denial of equal protection.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Petitioner was found guilty of speeding and fined $ 15 after a hearing before an administrative hearing officer whose determination was affirmed in an administrative review proceeding.  Article 2-A of the Vehicle and Traffic Law authorizes administrative adjudication of traffic infractions in cities with populations of 275,000 or more, and subdivision 3 of section 227 mandates that no penalty shall include imprisonment. The substitution in adjudication of traffic infractions of an administrative agency and administrative procedures for courts of criminal jurisdiction and judicial procedures, where conviction can result only in fines with no imprisonment, is not unconstitutional.  Strong presumptions of constitutionality attach to any action of the Legislature, and the transfer of traffic infractions to an administrative agency was clearly authorized due to the volume of traffic on the highways and the congestion in criminal courts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Subdivision 1 of section 227 of the Vehicle and Traffic Law, which establishes that the burden of proof upon the People in such proceedings be by &quot;clear and convincing evidence&quot;, does not unconstitutionally deny due process.  An incident to the proper transfer of traffic infractions to an administrative agency, where determinations cannot result in imprisonment, is the substitution of an administrative rather than a judicial standard of proof. Civil fines and penalties are routinely imposed by administrative action based on lesser standards than guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Petitioner was not denied equal protection, since equal protection does not require territorial uniformity of law within a State.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed an order of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the First Judicial Department (New York), which affirmed defendant's convictions for criminal possession of stolen property in the second degree, assault in the second degree, unauthorized use of a vehicle, and possession of a dangerous instrument.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of criminal possession of stolen property in the second degree, assault in the second degree, unauthorized use of a vehicle, and possession of a dangerous instrument. Defendant, while driving a stolen automobile and being pursued by police, struck a taxicab, injuring two people. Defendant claimed that the charge of criminal possession of stolen property could not serve as the basis for a charge of felony assault, pursuant to N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 120.05(6). Defendant asserted that the felony assault statute was directed at dangerous felonies only. The intermediate and appellate courts both disagreed and affirmed defendant's convictions. The appellate court said that the New York legislature did not intend the felony assault statute to be directed only at a certain class of felonious behavior.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's convictions for criminal possession of stolen property in the second degree, assault in the second degree, unauthorized use of a vehicle, and possession of a dangerous instrument. The court rejected defendant's argument that the legislature intended the felony assault charge to be based solely upon dangerous underlying felonies.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- assault -- </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Penal Law ( </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">&sect; 120.05</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">, subd. 6</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">) provides that person is guilty of assault in second degree when, in course of and in furtherance of commission or attempted commission of felony, he causes physical injury to person other than participant -- defendant, while in possession of stolen automobile struck taxicab, injuring two of its occupants -- felony of criminal possession of stolen property properly served as predicate for felony assault conviction -- Legislature did not intend to limit such predicate felonies to dangerous felonies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The Penal Law ( &sect; 120.05,  subd. 6) provides that: &quot;A person is guilty of assault in the second degree when: * * * In the course of and in furtherance of the commission or attempted commission of a felony * * * he, or another participant if there be any, causes physical injury to a person other than one of the participants.&quot; Defendant, while in possession of a stolen automobile struck a taxicab, injuring two occupants of the taxicab. The felony of criminal possession of stolen property properly served as a predicate for a felony assault conviction pursuant to the statute.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The Legislature in enacting the felony assault provision did not intend to limit to dangerous felonies the predicate felonies giving rise to felony assault in the same manner as it had limited the predicate felonies for felony murder. The language of the statute is clear and unambiguous, and does not specify that only felonies of a violent nature may be the basis for a felony assault conviction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The statute does not conclusively presume an intention to cause physical injury or that the possibility of physical injury can be foreseen.  Rather it is constructive malice that is ascribed.  Due process does not preclude a legislative policy determination that the felon who proximately causes injury to another, irrespective of the nature of the underlying felonious act, may be held criminally accountable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. An alleged error in submitting to the jury criminal possession of stolen property in the second degree and unauthorized use of a vehicle has not been preserved for review in this court.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, public retirement system and state official, challenged a decision from the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the First Judicial Department (New York), which affirmed an order of the trial court granting summary judgment to respondent retired public employee and declaring unconstitutional the retroactive application of N.Y. Retire. &amp; Soc. Sec. Law &sect; 431.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Section 431 limited the amount of increased compensation that could be considered in determining the final average salary for retirement purposes of public employees. The retired individual filed a class action challenging the constitutionality of the retroactive application of the statute to himself and others similarly situated. The trial court granted him summary judgement. The appellate court affirmed, and on appeal, the court modified and affirmed. The court held that the retroactive application of the statute diminished or impaired the benefits of membership in the retirement system in violation of N.Y. Const. art. V, &sect; 7. The court modified the order to state that it was the effective date of the statute, rather than the operative date, that controlled the constitutional reach of the statute.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Subdivision 4 of section 431 of the Retirement and Social Security Law limits the amount of increased compensation which may be considered in the computation of the final average salary of a civil service employee for pension purposes to a maximum of 20% over the previous year. The retroactive application of that statute to those who became members of a public retirement system before its effective date constitutes a diminution and impairment of membership benefits in violation of section 7 of article V of the New York Constitution. An employee's rate of compensation is the most significant part of the formula for determining retirement allowances and is entitled to the protection of the Constitution.  Increases in salary may not be excluded from final average salary for prior members.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The date from which retroactivity should be determined is June 17, 1971, the effective date (L. 1971, ch. 503, &sect; 20) and not April 1, 1972, the operative date, of the statute.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent bank brought an action against appellant city to recover invalidly levied taxes. The trial court noted the availability of remedies alternative to a refund claim under the city's administrative code and denied the city's motion to dismiss for untimeliness. The Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the First Judicial Department (New York) affirmed the award with interest. The city appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city claimed the refund application was untimely and that the bank could have avoided any time bar by pursuing a plenary action. The bank claimed it was not barred from pursuing a remedy in an action for moneys had and received and that the statute of limitations was tolled from the time it filed its claim under the city's administrative code and when it brought the judicial proceeding. The court held that the proceeding under the city's administrative code was untimely but that it should have been converted into a plenary action to avoid dismissal. When a tax statute was alleged to be unconstitutional, it could be challenged in judicial proceedings other than those prescribed by the statute as exclusive, and the invalidity or total inapplicability affected the entire statute, including the limitations and restrictions on the remedy provided in it. The court was empowered to convert a civil judicial proceeding not brought in the proper form into one brought in proper form rather than to grant a dismissal as to a substantial part of the relief sought. The bank's claim would be deemed interposed when the notice of petition was served and not when the refund application was filed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the appellate division was vacated and the case remitted to the trial court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Limitations of actions - refund of taxes - limitations contained in exclusive procedures of contested statute - unconstitutional taxing statute - tolling provisions - interest - article 78 proceeding brought pursuant to exclusive procedures of contested municipal taxing statute is subject to short Statute of Limitations contained in taxing statute - since tax statute alleged to be unconstitutional or wholly inapplicable may be challenged in judicial proceedings other than those prescribed by statute as exclusive, proceeding may be treated as plenary action for moneys had and received, for which limitations period is six years - plenary action is deemed interposed at date that special proceeding was brought, not on date that refund application was filed - city may serve answer containing Statute of Limitations - bank should be awarded 3% interest on refunded taxes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. More than five years after its first disputed quarterly payment of municipal taxes, the petitioner bank filed a refund claim pursuant to the exclusive procedures of the contested taxing provisions. When the greater portion of the late claim was denied, after a three-year administrative delay, as being precluded by the short Statute of Limitations prescribed by the taxing statute (Administrative Code of the City of New York, &sect; L46-9.0), the petitioner brought this article 78 proceeding under the statute. Although the proceeding resorted to is timely to review the adverse determination, it is subject to the statutory time limit which bars a claim brought after the later of 18 months from the date for filing the tax return or 6 months from the date of payment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Since a tax statute alleged to be unconstitutional or wholly inapplicable may be challenged in judicial proceedings other than those prescribed by the statute as exclusive, the proceeding may be treated under CPLR 103 (subd. [c]) as a plenary action for moneys had and received, for which the applicable limitations period is six years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The plenary action is deemed to have been interposed on the date that the special proceeding was brought, not on the date that the refund application was filed, since only judicial proceedings toll the six-year Statute of Limitations, and the 30-day bar from institution of an action or proceeding after filing (Administrative Code of the City of New York, &sect; 394a-1.0, subd. a) did not toll the statute beyond 30 days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The city may serve an answer pleading, if it be so advised, the Statute of Limitations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. The bank should be awarded interest at 3% from the date of payment on that portion of the taxes, refund of which is not barred by the Statute of Limitations.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In two separate actions, plaintiff tenured teachers (teachers) brought an action against defendant Board of Education (Board), contending that their suspension without pay, prior to the determination of disciplinary proceedings under N.Y. Educ. Law &sect; 3020-a, was unconstitutional. Two separate departments of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court (New York) ordered the Board to pay the teachers back and continuing pay. All parties appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that, as presently drafted, &sect; 3020-a did not authorize suspension of a tenured teacher without pay. Because compensation was a matter of substantive right, the Board was prohibited from taking such away except pursuant to explicit statutory authorization. Further, the authority to withhold pay was not necessary to the achievement of the sound administration of the public school system, for which the power of suspension was granted. In its opinion, the court also surmised that it would not have been unconstitutional if &sect; 3020-a were drafted to provide for suspension without pay, provided that the determination of the disciplinary proceedings were not unreasonably delayed. The court also rejected one teacher's claim that the charge arising from his relationship with a graduated student violated his constitutional right of privacy, because such right was not absolute. Further, it was too early in the proceedings to determine whether the relationship affected the teacher's professional performance directly, or if public notoriety of the relationship impaired his capabilities.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court modified and affirmed the orders.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Schools -- teachers -- suspension without pay -- withholding of pay during period of suspension of teacher is not authorized by </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">section 3020-a of Education Law</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">, since unnecessary and since pay is substantive right -- earnings from other sources may be credited against teacher's salary during suspension -- right of privacy does not preclude use of charge that male guidance counselor spent night with recent female graduate since private conduct ceases where responsibilities are impaired and inquiry into prior relationship or public notoriety should not be foreclosed -- conversion of article 78 proceeding into action for declaratory judgment is discretionary and is refused.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.  Section 3020-a of the Education Law does not authorize withholding of pay during a period of suspension of a teacher. The power of suspension is essential to sound public school administration, but withholding of pay is not necessary and compensation is such a substantive right that it may not be taken away without explicit statutory authorization, which should not be inferred from oblique statutory reference to restoration of full pay after an employee is acquitted of charges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. All earnings from other employment during a teacher's suspension may be credited against his entitlement to back salary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The right of privacy does not preclude use of a charge against a guidance counselor that he spent the night with a recent female graduate of the school.  What might otherwise be private conduct ceases to be so if it directly affects a teacher's professional responsibility or becomes the subject of public notoriety and reasonably impairs the teacher's capability to discharge his responsibilities.  Foreclosure of further inquiry regarding a prior relationship or public notoriety would be inappropriate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Conversion of an article 78 proceeding into an action for declaratory judgment under CPLR 103 (subd. [c]) is discretionary and is refused.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant individual, for himself and as mayor, sought review of the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court Third Judicial Department (New York), which affirmed a judgment of the lower court dismissing appellant's petition to compel respondent Town Board to grant an exemption to village property owners from the town's levy for certain items for which N.Y. High. Law &sect; 277 authorized an exemption.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">N.Y. High. Law &sect; 277 authorized certain towns to exempt village property lying within the town from highway taxes levied pursuant to N.Y. High. Law &sect; 141 for expenditures for machinery, tools, and for snow removal. The town levied a highway tax for a number of expenditures, including those for which an exemption was authorized. The incorporated village , lying within the boundaries of the town, applied to the Town Board (Board) for an exemption, which was denied. Appellant filed an action to compel the Board to grant the exemption or, in the alternative, to have N.Y. High. Law &sect; 277 declared unconstitutional. The trial court interpreted appellant's action as one for mandamus under N.Y. C.P.L.R. 78 and dismissed the action. The appellate court affirmed. Appellant sought review. The court characterized appellant's action as one for declaratory judgment under N.Y. C.P.L.R. 103(c). The court held that by its terms N.Y. High. Law &sect; 277 unmistakably provided that whether to grant an exemption rested with the discretion of the town board. The court held that as so interpreted, &sect; 277 was not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court modified the judgment of the appellate court and as so modified, affirmed it. The court's modification consisted of holding that exemption provision at issue did not command a town to grant an exemption to village property owners and that as so interpreted, the exemption provision was not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The Legislature's delegation to a town, in which there is an incorporated village which forms a separate road district, of authority to impose town highway taxes on real property within the village, is not unconstitutional.  The State has great freedom in selecting the subjects of taxation and exemption. If there are any facts reasonably conceived to justify a classification, it must be upheld, and the present system of allocation of taxing powers serves several legitimate purposes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The legislative delegation of discretionary authority to town boards, pursuant to section 277 of the Highway Law, to exempt properties within the village from town highway taxes for expenditures in subdivisions 3 and 4 of section 141 of the Highway Law does not compel exemption and is constitutional.  Legislative judgment as to taxing statutes will be upheld if reasonable, and there is no sufficient basis to determine that section 277 involves either an impermissible delegation or unreasonable tax policy. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Criminal defendant appealed from an order of the Appellate Term of the Supreme Court in the First Judicial Department (New York), which affirmed a judgment convicting defendant of obscenity in violation of N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 235.05 and imposing a fine of $ 100,000.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant corporation was convicted of two counts of obscenity under N.Y. Penal Law &sect;235.05 for showing the film &quot;Deep Throat&quot; at its Times Square theatre. The appeal raised two primary issues: (1) whether, under N.Y. Const. art. I, &sect; 2, defendant was entitled to a jury trial and (2) whether the fine imposed exceeded the amount permitted by &sect; 80.10 (1)[e]. The court held that the criminal court was not empowered to adjudge a forfeiture as an incident to conviction and that the right to a jury trial did not come into play since here the criminal proceedings were not &quot;tantamount to forfeiture proceedings.&quot; Thus the lower court properly tried the case without a jury. Defendant was convicted of two offenses committed on two different dates. It was the profit from these offenses, from showing the film on these two dates, which had to be used in determining the maximum penalty authorized by law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the conviction but reduced the fine on the grounds that by fining defendant the total profit made on the showing of the film, the lower court went beyond the legal maximum and penalized defendant for committing crimes which were neither charged nor proven at the trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- right to jury trial -- defendant corporation is not entitled to jury trial of charges of obscenity in second degree, since criminal proceedings therefor are not tantamount to forfeiture -- fine pursuant to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">section 80.10 of Penal Law</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">, not exceeding double gain from offense, must be based upon offenses charged, two showings of film, not upon total showings of film over 37-week period, which showings were not basis for charges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The defendant corporation was not entitled to a jury trial on charges of obscenity in the second degree in violation of section 235.05 of the Penal Law, a class A misdemeanor. Although section 410.00 of the Penal Law authorizes seizure of equipment used in the projection of pornographic films, a forfeiture thereunder requires proceedings in the Supreme Court, and the criminal court, therefore, has no power to adjudge a forfeiture as an incident to a conviction for obscenity. Since the criminal proceedings are not tantamount to forfeiture proceedings, there is no right to a jury trial under section 2 of article I of the State Constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. A fine imposed pursuant to section 80.10 of the Penal Law, of up to two times the gain from the offense, should not be based upon the total number of showings of a film and the total profit over 37 weeks, but should be based only upon the two showings which were the basis of the offenses charged. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The candidate was nominated under the democratic and conservative parties for the same office of county judge in a general election. The chairman requested a renouncement of the conservative party nomination, but the candidate refused, was censured, then filed the action for declaratory and injunctive relief. The trial court held that there was no justiciable controversy, and that a censure was improper. The appellate division reversed, declaring that the challenged by-law was invalid, proposing a prior decision was overruled. The court affirmed respondents' appeal, but dismissed petitioner's appeal. The censure issues were moot but the by-law issue was important to resolve. The court held that the overruled case the appellate division relied upon, was only overruled in part. The court departed from any holding of unlimited validity of a similar by-law and to the extent that the overruled case could have been understood to uphold the rule as to judicial candidates, but only to that extent, it was overruled. The court concluded that an internal rule or by-law of a political party was invalid if it mandated unethical conduct on the part of a candidate for judicial office.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. As applied to a candidate for judicial office, article VII (&sect; 1, subd. [f]) of the by-laws of the Nassau County Democratic Committee, limiting nominations by that party to candidates who have agreed to refuse to accept the nomination of any other political party or independent body, except a Republican nomination, is invalid as contravening public policy which mandates that selection for and performance in judicial office shall be free from political manipulation insofar as practicable. Candidates for judicial office may not indorse one another, may not attack one another and may not indorse or attack candidates for nonjudicial office.  They are to be as nonpartisan as the selection of Judges by election permits.  Such a by-law would compel a judicial candidate to take a partisan position not essential to his candidacy and would require unethical conduct. ( </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Matter of Yevoli </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">v.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10"> Cristenfeld</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 29 N Y 2d 591, overruled in part.)</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The questions raised by petitioner as to his censure by the committee for accepting the nomination of the Conservative Party are not only moot, but are not properly before the court.  The dissent at the Appellate Division was not in his favor and he was not aggrieved by the modification of the majority.  Consequently, petitioner's cross appeal should be dismissed.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs state employees brought an action that complained that the imposition of the Taylor Law, N.Y. Civ. Serv. Law, &sect; 210, and subd. 2, which penalized state employees for strikes and violated their due process rights. The court affirmed the trial court decision that the application of the penalties was proper, but the United States Supreme Court vacated that opinion so that the court could consider the impact of a newly decided case. The court affirmed its earlier decision and determined that the case was different because the case involved fines and loss of tenure for strike activity rather than removal of non-probationary employees from the federal service and for the remedies available to the employee to contest such removal. The court concluded that the state application of the remedy did not require a pre-penalty administrative proceeding because N.Y. Civ. Serv. Law &sect; 210, and subd. 2 allowed direct and adequate judicial review of the administrative determinations and the penalties of fines and loss of tenure were not severe and were reversible in both monetary terms and in status.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the decision that the Taylor Law did not deprive plaintiff state employees of due process by not allowing a pre-penalty administrative hearing for penalties in a strike because the court determined that the right to judicial review of a decision was adequate and the United States Supreme Court case requiring a hearing before termination of a tenured federal employee was not similar to the state employee strike case.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. When the State of New York and the Civil Service Employees Association failed to reach an agreement on the terms of a new contract of employment, thousands of State employees failed to report to work on April 1 and 2, 1972.  Thereafter, pursuant to the Public Employees' Fair Employment Act (Civil Service Law, art. 14, &sect; 210), New York State's Director of Employee Relations notified approximately 7,800 employees individually that it had been determined that each of them had been illegally on strike, and that, pursuant to the statute, they would be placed on nontenure probationary status for one year, and that they would be fined two days' pay for each day they had been illegally on strike, but that they could file an affidavit within 20 days showing that such determination was incorrect. About 3,400 of the 7,800 did file such affidavits, and the Director of Employee Relations sustained approximately 500 of them and determined that they had not been on strike.  The director further determined that 694 of the affidavits had raised questions of fact which would warrant a hearing by a hearing officer. Such hearing officer's evidentiary determination would be judicially reviewable by a proceeding under CPLR article 78.  The director further determined that approximately 2,300 of the affidavits were prima facie without merit, but that these 2,300 determinations, too, could be judicially reviewed by proceedings under CPLR article 78.  Constitutional due process is satisfied by these statutory procedures and by the judicial reviewability of the determinations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Although a duly notified employee has the burden of producing a prima facie sufficient affidavit of fact, any adverse determination is judicially reversible retroactively and without any irreparable harm to the employee.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court convicted defendants on drug charges and the appellate court affirmed the convictions. The court affirmed the judgment of the appellate court because it found no merit in defendants' claim that the state lacked the power to prosecute because defendants were apprehended slightly beyond the state's jurisdiction.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. New York City police officers and a Federal agent had approached defendants to arrest them for possession and attempted sale of narcotics and as one of defendants was apprehended, the other defendants, seated in an automobile, fled toward the Hudson River.  Two city police officers pursued and arrested them in the Lincoln Tunnel, the arrest having taken place beyond New York's jurisdiction.  Although defendants were not returned to New York in compliance with a New Jersey statute providing for arraignment and extradition, that did not deprive New York courts of jurisdiction.  While New York may decline to exercise jurisdiction rather than exploit the fruits of unauthorized conduct, the breach involved does not call for this sanction since the officers acted in good faith and did not knowingly or intentionally disregard the law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The evidence seized should not be suppressed. The arrest and incidental search were valid.  The officers reasonably believed they were authorized to act as they did.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner teacher was hired on a probationary basis and filed an article 78 proceeding against respondent board of education (board) after her position was abolished. The employee sought adjudication that the board's actions were contrary to law and requested an order that she be assigned to a teaching position and receive back pay. The Appellate Division (New York) ordered that the petition be granted, and the board appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The teacher was hired on a probationary basis to teach first grade. The teacher discovered that her position was being abolished and requested that she be considered for and granted another position. Several positions were available; however, the teacher was not offered a new position. The board admitted that had the teacher's position not been abolished, she would have continued to be employed. On appeal, the court determined that while the teacher's position was abolished, she was never terminated by the board. Pursuant to N.Y. Educ. Law &sect; 2509(1), the superintendent of schools was required to recommend to the board that the teacher be dismissed. The record revealed that no such request was made. Thus, the teacher remained an employee of the school district (district) and as such, was available for another similar position within the district. Further, she was to be given seniority rights over other probationary teachers, substitute teachers, and newly employed teachers whose service was less than hers. Therefore, the teacher had seniority over the teachers newly employed by the board after the date that her position was abolished.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the appellate division was affirmed but modified. The teacher was entitled to be reinstated nunc pro tunc to a teaching position with back salary as granted by the appellate division. However, the board was entitled to a credit for earnings that the teacher may have had from other employment during the period in question, exclusive of summer work.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Schools -- teachers -- services of petitioner, probationary teacher, whose position was abolished, were not discontinued since there was no evidence that superintendent of schools recommended such discontinuance or that majority of board of education voted to terminate her services and abolition of her position did not result in termination; accordingly, petitioner continued</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> as employee of board -- petitioner had seniority rights over newly appointed teachers and, therefore, her reinstatment was properly ordered nunc pro tunc -- amicus curiae may properly point out that court may lack jurisdiction because of nonjoinder of newly appointed teachers, but that question of jurisdiction need not be reached.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Effective September 1, 1971 petitioner was employed by respondent board of education as a probationary teacher. In June, 1972 petitioner was advised in writing that her position had been abolished, but no mention was made of terminating her employment.  Section 2509 (subd. 1) of the Education Law provides that the services of a probationary teacher may be discontinued, on recommendation of the superintendent of schools, by a majority vote of the board and there is no evidence that the superintendent made such a recommendation or that a majority of the board voted to terminate petitioner's services.  The abolition of her position did not terminate her services.  Reading sections 2509 and 2510 of the Education Law together, the board must take special action to discontinue the services of a teacher whose position has been abolished and, accordingly,  petitioner continued as an employee of respondent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Pursuant to the provisions of section 2510 of the Education Law, providing for reappointment in accordance with seniority of teachers whose positions have been abolished, petitioner has limited seniority rights even though she is a probationary teacher. The Commissioner of Education has consistently ruled that section 2510 applies to probationary teachers and that construction is reasonable and is controlling.  Petitioner, therefore, had seniority rights over newly appointed teachers and her reinstatement was properly ordered </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">nunc pro tunc</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> as of September 5, 1972.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Although an </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">amicus curiae</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has no status to present new issues, it may properly point out that the court lacks jurisdiction because of the nonjoinder of the newly appointed teachers. However, the status of those teachers being postulated, the question of nonjoinder is not reached.  </SPAN></P>

His counsel sought an order vacating and terminating all proceedings had or to be had upon the grounds that the convening of the court violated rights guaranteed to the justice and to the electorate of his district by U.S. Const. V and XIV in that the proceeding required the court to enact ad hoc standards for judicial patterns of conduct unrelated to bribery, corruption, criminality, venality, or willful misconduct because there was no legislative or constitutional mandate for such enactment. His counsel argued that the legislature had the exclusive power to define codes of conduct to be enforced by penal or quasi-penal sanctions and that the court's proceeding imposed ex post facto qualifications upon an elective office. He also argued that the proceeding, insofar as it would determine whether the justice's past conduct warranted his retention in elective office, deprived the electorate of rights granted exclusively to it pursuant to N.Y.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant election board challenged a judgment of the Supreme Court of Westchester County (New York), which, in an action for a declaratory judgment brought by respondent voters, directed the election board to transfer the voters' party enrollment from one county to another and declared N.Y. Elec. Law &sect;&sect; 187, 386 unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The voters were enrolled as democrats in one county. They moved to another county and wished to vote in the upcoming democratic primary, which was to take place four months after their move. The election board informed the voters that they could register for the general election but that they were not eligible to vote in the primary. The voters filed suit, seeking a declaratory judgment directing the election board to transfer the party enrollment of the voters from the first county to the second and to permit them to vote in the primary election. The trial court declared that &sect;&sect; 187, 386 were unconstitutional in that they denied the voters equal protection by prohibiting or restricting the transfer of enrollments across county lines within the state. On appeal, the court reversed, holding that the statutes at issue were not unconstitutional because the legislature had a demonstrable rational basis for the distinction between voters moving from one political subdivision to another and voters moving within the same municipal unit that also happened to lie within another stratum of local government.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment of the supreme court in favor of the voters and entered a declaration that the election laws at issue were constitutional as applied here.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Elections -- enrollment -- section 187 of Election Law, which in effect imposes (subd. 6) waiting period after enrollment as party member of 8 or 11 months before primary election where voter moves from one county to another, but allows (subd. 8) voters to move within City of New York across</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> county lines or within villages straddling two counties to enroll without time delay, is constitutional; it does not deny equal protection since there is rational basis for distinction -- section 386 of Election Law providing for transfer of enrollments is constitutional.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.  Section 186 of the Election Law, which had previously been held valid in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Rosario </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">v.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10"> Rockefeller</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (410 U.S. 752) and which provides for a registered voter to enroll as a party member, in effect mandates that people must enroll within 8 or 11 months in advance of a primary election. Section 187 which provides for exceptions to that waiting period but reimposes (subd. 6) that period where a voter moves from one county to another, although it allows (subd. 8) voters who move within the City of New York across county lines or within villages straddling two counties to enroll without time delay at least 30 days prior to a primary election, is constitutional.  It does not deny plaintiffs, enrolled Democrats who moved from New York County to Westchester County in May, 1974 and were informed that they could register for the November general election but could not be treated as enrolled Democrats so as to be eligible for the September primary election, equal protection. There is a rational basis for the distinction made by the Legislature between voters moving from one county to another county and those moving within a municipal unit.  A transfer of enrollment between unrelated counties involves separate adminstrative units and poses difficulties not found within the same municipal unit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. There is no denial of equal protection where the time delay restriction is imposed to preserve the integrity of the various parties.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant city sought review of the decision of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the First Judicial Department (New York), which affirmed a supreme court judgment adjudging that the designation of plaintiff property owner's building as a &quot;landmark&quot; was beyond the power of the Landmarks Preservation Commission and was null and void, and enjoined the city from interfering with the property owner's use of its land and building.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owner made a case that the building was wholly inadequate for its continued use as office space and that it had to be replaced if the property owner was to be able to freely and economically use the property. The court determined that the city's action through its commission was attempting to force the property owner to retain its property as is, without any sort of relief or adequate compensation, and that this restriction was a taking. Without any move toward invoking the power of eminent domain, the commission was attempting to add the property to the public use by purely and simply invading the owner's right to own and manage. The court determined that the power given the city to force termination of the property owner's free use of its premises short of condemnation directly violated the property owner's rights under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments and N.Y. Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 6, 7. The court concluded that the landmark designation as applied to the premises exceeded the permissible limits of the city's zoning power and it was confiscatory.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court modified the appellate court's order to declare that the landmark designation as applied to the property owner's building was confiscatory.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The residential mansion of a famous financier was built in midtown Manhattan in 1853 and was purchased in 1942 by a religious corporation for use for its own offices; however, the building has proved to be wholly inadequate for the religious corporation's purposes and so now the corporation wishes to demolish the mansion and erect a modern office building on the site.  But New York City's Landmarks Preservation Commission (Administrative Code of City of New York, ch. 8-A) designates the mansion as an historic landmark and forbids its demolition and replacement.  No compensation is provided for this economic hardship to a religious corporation.  The Court of Appeals grants judgment declaring that this &quot;landmark designation&quot; amounts to a void and unconstitutional confiscation of the corporation's property (U. S. Const., 5th and 14th Amdts.; N. Y. Const., art. I, &sect;&sect; 6, 7).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Since this is an action for a declaratory judgment of unconstitutionality as applied to plaintiff, and since plaintiff's proof of economic hardship is substantially unchallenged, the constitutional issue is properly before the Court of Appeals for adjudication, even though the courts below improperly converted this declaratory judgment action into a proceeding for judicial review of the reasonableness of the commission's designation of this property as an historic landmark. </SPAN></P>

The court held that the equalization rate produced a more accurate assessment rate than did evidence of actual sales or selected parcel methods.

The people denied the allegation. On the appeal from affirmance of defendant's conviction, a principal point urged for reversal was that the people's denial was insufficient in law and that a hearing should have been conducted on defendant's allegations.

As such, the court held that it barely sufficed to shift to the people the burden of responding.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Defendant and another were arrested when the automobile in which they were riding had stopped and was blocking traffic.  An officer approached the vehicle and shined his flashlight about the interior of the automobile and noticed a brown bag on the back seat.  Thereafter as the officer was returning the license and registration to the driver, defendant who was seated in the front passenger side made a sudden movement toward the brown bag. The officer snatched the bag and defendant shouted, &quot;Be careful man, that's a bomb&quot;.  The officer then opened the bag and withdrew a device which he recognized to be a bomb mechanism.  When asked if the device could detonate, defendant then replied, &quot;if you know anything about bombs, they can't go off.&quot; During the course of defendant's trial for possession and transportation of incendiary bombs and possession of a weapon, defense counsel alleged that the People were employing information derived from wiretapping of defendant and defense counsel. The People denied the allegation.  That allegation was vague, conclusory and unsupported and barely sufficed to shift to the People the burden of responding.  The People's denial, coupled with the court's perusal of the prosecutor's file for traces of eavesdropping evidence, which revealed none, sufficiently met the allegation.  Allegations respecting a subsequent cross-examination and a reference in the summation, following so closely upon the previous denial, are within its sweep.  These latter allegations were little more than speculative.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Defendant has the burden of coming forward with facts which reasonably lead him to believe that he or his counsel had been subjected to undisclosed electronic surveillance. Defendant's allegation should specify, insofar as practicable, the dates of suspected surveillance, the identity of the persons, and the facts relied upon which allegedly link the suspected surveillance to the trial proceedings.  It is then incumbent upon the People to affirm or deny the allegations.  Ordinarily, a denial should be in affidavit form signed by a responsible officer.  The affidavit should specify the law enforcement agencies contacted to determine whether electronic surveillance had occurred, the persons contacted, the substance of the inquiries, and the dates of claimed surveillance. If appropriate, a hearing may be conducted during trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Given the suspicious circumstances of the traffic stop, the arresting officer acted reasonably for his own safety in seizing the bag. Shining the flashlight about the interior of the automobile was not an unreasonable intrusion and the subsequent search of the automobile at the police station was justifiable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. It cannot be said as a matter of law that the inculpatory remarks of defendant to the arresting officer were involuntary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. The evidence was sufficient for the jury to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the device seized was an incendiary bomb containing an explosive substance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. The statutory terms, &quot;incendiary&quot;, &quot;bomb&quot; and &quot;explosive substance&quot;,  are susceptible of reasonable application in accordance with the common understanding of men.  </SPAN></P>

The union shop provision in union's contract with employer might bar access of employer's channels to commentator if he ceased to pay dues or their equivalent to union.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant school board challenged an order of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the Second Judicial Department (New York), which reversed the trial court's dismissal of respondent teacher's suit alleging termination of his employment in violation of the First and Fourteenth Amendments and ordered a new hearing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The probationary teacher was denied tenure pursuant to N.Y. Educ. Law &sect; 3012. He sued the school board alleging its decision to deny him tenure was based on his activity in political causes and the fact that he was Jewish. The trial court dismissed his complaint. The appellate court ordered a new hearing at which the school board must show that tenure was not denied for impermissible reasons. On appeal the court held (1) the evidence presented did not support the teacher's contentions that the school board denied him tenure for unconstitutional reasons, (2) in ordering a new hearing, the appellate court improperly shifted the burden of proof on the issue of constitutional deprivation from the teacher to the school board, (3) the teacher had the burden of proving that the school board's reasons for denying tenure were improper, (4) testimony by several school board members that they based their votes in part on statements about the teacher made to them by others did not constitute hearsay, and (5) the board members' states of mind were relevant and they could testify to out-of-court statements made by others which circumstantially indicated what a board member believed at the time.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Schools -- teachers -- tenure -- petitioner, teacher, failed to substantiate his allegations that he was denied tenure in violation of his constitutional rights as there was no support for his contentions that tenure was denied because of his political philosophy, his method of instructions, his attire or his religious beliefs -- petitioner has burden of proof to produce evidence to show deprivation of his rights -- statements relied on by board</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> members made to them by others tending to establish their state of mind at time they cast their vote were not hearsay.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. In a proceeding to review the determination of a school board denying tenure to petitioner, a teacher of social studies, petitioner failed to substantiate his allegations that the denial was made in violation of the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution.  There is no support for his contentions that tenure was denied because he attended a political rally at other than school hours, he made available to his students a pamphlet explaining student rights under the First Amendment, he wore a western-style hat and he was a member of the Jewish race and religion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. In remanding the proceeding for a new hearing to require the board to produce legal and competent evidence to establish that tenure was not denied for impermissible reasons, the Appellate Division improperly shifted the burden of proof to the board.  In such cases, the petitioner has the burden of proof to produce such evidence to show deprivation of his rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The statements relied on by some members of the board made to them by others about petitioner were not hearsay.  The truth or falsity of those statements was not at issue but rather the reason for the votes by the board members and, as to that, the statements tended to establish the members' state of mind at the time they cast their votes.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants challenged an order of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the Second Judicial Department (New York), arguing that the felony coercion statute,&nbsp;N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 135.65, violated constitutional guarantees of due process and equal protection, in that the same elements were required for misdemeanor coercion, and the choice to charge as a felony or misdemeanor was left solely to the prosecutor's discretion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants challenged their convictions, contending that the felony coercion statute,&nbsp;N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 135.65, violated constitutional guarantees of due process and equal protection, in that the same elements were required for misdemeanor coercion under N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 135.60, and the choice to charge as a felony or misdemeanor was left solely to the prosecutor's discretion. While the court agreed that the statutes as written offered wide prosecutorial discretion, it did not agree that the discretion was such as to render either statute unconstitutional. The discretion to decide what was an exceptional case warranting prosecution for the lower degree was entrusted to the prosecutor. More serious crimes should be charged under statutes providing more serious penalties. Thus, the court did not find that such reliance, on its face, violated the constitutional guarantees of due process or equal protection. The order appealed from was accordingly affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Finding no constitutional defect in allowing the prosecutor to use discretion in deciding whether to charge felony or misdemeanor coercion, the court affirmed the conviction of appellants.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- coercion -- although definitions of coercion in first degree, felony, and coercion in second degree, misdemeanor, are almost identical when coercion is committed by instilling in victim fear of physical injury or property damage, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">statute</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> defining coercion as felony does not violate constitutional guarantees of due process and equal protection; opportunity for prosecutorial choice is no bar to prosecution -- there is no claim by defendants, convicted of attempted coercion in first degree, of discrimination or abuse of discretion by prosecutor and testimony supports his choice of felony section -- no objections having been made to charge as to conspiracy in third</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> degree, issue preserved for review.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Although the definitions of the crimes of coercion in the first degree, a class D felony (Penal Law, &sect; 135.65), and coercion in the second degree, a class A misdemeanor (Penal Law, &sect; 135.60, subds. 1, 2), are almost identical when the coercion is committed by instilling in the victim fear of physical injury or property damage, the statute defining coercion as a felony does not violate the constitutional guarantees of due process and equal protection. Overlapping in criminal statutes and the opportunity for prosecutorial choice is no bar to prosecution.  Read in the light of the Practice Commentaries and the related extortion statutes, there is a guideline differentiating felony and misdemeanor coercion. In general, the misdemeanor is to be charged where the method of coercion is covered by subdivisions 3 to 9 of section 135.60 and the felony is to be charged if the additional element of a threat of personal or property injury is involved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. While unlawful discrimination in the exercise of a prosecutor's power to charge would violate the equal protection guarantee, defendants, who were convicted of attempted coercion in the first degree,  a class E felony, make no claim of actual discrimination or other actual abuse of discretion and the testimony at the trial supports the District Attorney's choice of the felony section.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The issue with respect to the trial court's instructions concerning the elements of conspiracy in the third degree was not preserved for review since no objection was made to the charge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. While some confusion was generated by the court's explanation of the difference between conspiracy in the second and third degrees, defendants cannot claim prejudice since they were convicted of the lesser degree.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. The evidence supporting defendants' conviction of attempted coercion in the first degree, conspiracy in the third degree, and three counts of assault in the third degree was not insufficient as a matter of law.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant directors challenged a decision of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the Third Judicial Department (New York) that reversed, on the law and the facts, a judgment of the trial court in the directors' favor. The directors had sought to cancel notices of tax determination issued by respondent State Tax Commission.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The commission served each of the individual directors with a notice for the full amount of the corporation's tax liability. The notices stated that the tax due had been determined in accordance with N.Y. Tax Law &sect; 1138. The first notice was canceled and replaced by a second, again for the full amount of the tax due. This time the notice stated that the named individual was personally liable for the tax. The directors requested a hearing, arguing that because the corporation had filed returns containing correct computations of taxes owing, the commission lacked authority both to have issued the notices of determination against them and to conduct administrative hearings pursuant to the notices. The trial court found in favor the directors and the appellate court reversed, stating the N.Y. Tax Law &sect; 1138 authorized the administrative procedure employed by the commission. On review, the court reversed. The court found that the commission exceeded its statutory authority in proceeding administratively against the directors after the corporation had filed returns containing correct computations of tax liability.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The State Tax Commission exceeded its statutory authority in proceeding administratively by way of notice of determination and hearing to recover unpaid sales taxes against petitioners, officers and directors of a corporation which had filed timely returns containing correct computations of tax liability.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Neither section 1131 (subd. [1]) of the Tax Law, defining &quot;persons required to collect tax&quot;, nor section 1133, providing that every person required to collect the tax shall be personally liable, empowers the commission to issue notices of determination and hold hearings pursuant to those notices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The sole provision for administrative procedure is contained in section 1138 of the Tax Law which authorizes (subd. [a]) such procedure if a return is not filed or is incorrect or insufficient and further provides (subd. [b]) that if the commission believes that the collection of the tax will be jeopardized, it may assess the tax prior to the filing of a return and prior to the date when the return is required to be filed.  Neither of these conditions is present.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The commission's administrative procedure employed against petitioners was not authorized by the general powers granted in section 1142 (subd. 6) of the Tax Law to assess and readjust sales taxes.  The Legislature did not intend to extend the commission's authority to use the procedures of section 1138 beyond the bounds of that section.  Section 1138 specifies two situations in which the administrative procedure is appropriate and it will not be inferred that such procedure was intended to apply to situations not mentioned.  That section contains a strict condition precedent, deposit of the amount of the tax due or an undertaking, to judicial review of a posthearing determination and this will not be extended to situations not expressly prescribed. Finally, where the circumstances specified in section 1138 are not present, an action to enforce payment may be brought and a warrant procedure against property is provided for.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. An unregistered United States bearer bond found by plaintiff more than three years before the commencement of the present action to recover the bond from the Property Clerk of the New York City Police Department cannot be returned to plaintiff as finder. Subdivision 1 of section 251 of the Personal Property Law defines &quot;property&quot; as money, chattels and tangible personal property other than instruments and subdivision 2 of section 251 defines an &quot;instrument&quot; as a &quot;bond&quot;.  Lost &quot;property&quot; goes to the finder (&sect; 253, subd. 8; &sect; 254, subd. 2) and title vests in him whereas a lost &quot;instrument&quot; is to be retained in police custody until delivered to the person entitled thereto (&sect; 253, subd. 6; &sect; 255, subd. 1).  No &quot;instrument&quot; is to be returned to the finder (&sect; 255, subd. 2).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. An interpretation of subdivision 2 of section 251 of the Personal Property Law, which defines an &quot;instrument&quot; as a check, draft, promissory note, bond, bill of lading, warehouse receipt, stock certificate or other paper or document, that would limit the term &quot;instrument&quot; to commercial paper and, therefore, except bearer bonds finds no support in the language of the statute.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The word &quot;bond&quot; is not qualified by the concluding language in subdivision 2 of section 251 &quot;or other interest in property or in an enterprise&quot;, the United States Government allegedly not being an &quot;enterprise&quot;, but is qualified by the phrase &quot;evidencing, representing or embodying a chose in action or a right with respect to property&quot;.  The bond found by plaintiff evidences a right in the bearer to payment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. A Federal Treasury regulation providing that the Treasury will pay bearer bonds to the person presenting them and, where they are lost, will not undertake to protect owners has not pre-empted the policy of New York State.  The regulation applies only to bearer securities not yet due and, consequently, has no application to the present bond which had matured.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Even if the bond were not yet due, questions of title to Federal bearer securities are to be decided by State law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. It is for the Legislature to determine whether to protect the expectations of finders of such bonds in the same manner as it already protects the expectations of finders of &quot;property&quot;.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, the Finance Administrator of the City of New York, sought review of two judgments of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the First Judicial Department (New York), the first of which affirmed a trial court's order directing respondent club to be removed from the city's tax rolls and the second of which reversed a trial court's judgment and restored the tax exempt status of respondent bar association's property.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The association and club owned properties that qualified for the exemption for real property taxes provided by the state constitution and N.Y. Real. Prop. Law &sect; 420 for properties owned by charitable or education organizations and used exclusively for such purposes. Section 420 was amended and renumbered as N.Y. Real Prop. Tax Law &sect; 421, which allowed a city to terminate by local law the exemption for bar associations and scientific organizations. The city adopted such a local law and notified the association and club that their properties would be returned to the tax rolls. On appeal, the court rejected the association and club's argument that they were entitled to a tax exemption for the reason that their activities were by their very nature charitable or educational, and the court held that the properties did not qualify for the exemption under &sect; 421. The court found that the association was not organized and conducted primarily for charitable or educational purposes and that, likewise, the club was not conducted for such purposes. The court further found that &sect; 421, which permitted the return of the properties to the tax rolls, did not violate due process or equal protection.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the appellate division's judgment which affirmed a trial court's order directing the club to be removed from the city's tax rolls and the appellate division's judgment which reversed a trial court's judgment and restored the tax exempt status of the bar association's property.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Pursuant to an amendment to section 420 (now &sect; 421) of the Real Property Tax Law (L. 1971, ch. 414) which continued tax exemptions for Bar Associations and scientific groups but permitted local governments to terminate the exemption by local law, the City of New York validly restored the real property of the Association of the Bar of City of New York and the Explorers Club to the tax rolls effective January 1, 1972 (Local Laws, 1971, No. 46 of City of New York).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The Association of the Bar of the City of New York is not organized and conducted primarily for charitable or educational purposes, for which purposes the exemption still applies, but is an association of professionals primarily concerned with the interests of its members.  While its functions may be characterized as educational and, to a lesser extent, as charitable, these are incidental only and while it confers a public benefit, public benefit is not the test for exemption. In addition, Bar Associations have been characterized separately by the Legislature for exemption purposes and the Association has never sought exemption under the broader categories for charitable or educational organizations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The Explorers Club is conducted primarily for scientific purposes.  While it has charitable and educational functions, they are adjunctive to its purpose of promoting exploration and research in the earth sciences.  The public benefit conferred by the Club is not the test for exemption. In addition, the Legislature has chosen to classify scientific organizations separately and the Club has not heretofore claimed exemption as a charitable or educational organization.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4.  Section 421 of the Real Property Tax Law does not violate the due process or equal protection clauses of the Federal and State Constitutions.  The Legislature has determined that the continuous removal of real property from the tax rolls imposes a particular hardship on local governments and the taxpayers and that the erosion of municipal tax bases must be stemmed.  Consequently, it reasonably drew distinctions between organizations conducted primarily for charitable and educational purposes and those conducted for scientific or Bar Association purposes.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, a manager of a drugstore, was convicted by the Appellate Term of the Supreme Court in the First Judicial Department (New York) of violating the Administrative Code of the City of New York by not maintaining a difference in price between brands of cigarettes that had a higher tar content and those which had a lower tar content. Defendant brought an appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The defendant admitted that he did not differentiate on the basis of tar and nicotine content in pricing the various brands of cigarettes, stating it was virtually impossible. The defendant contended that the price-differential requirement imposed by the city was illegal. The court held that because the State had the authority under its police power to properly enact a price differential, the question was whether the State had, in any way whatsoever, authorized the city to enact such regulations. The court held that the city was granted the exercise of the police power to promote health by the sovereign people acting through the New York State Constitution and the legislature. The court held that because it was not unreasonable for the city to conclude that the higher prices required of the more harmful cigarettes would induce the cigarette consumer to switch to a less harmful variety, the price differential based on tar and nicotine content was clearly within the police power over matters pertaining to health.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the order that convicted defendant of not maintaining a difference in price between brands of cigarettes with a higher and those with a lower tar content.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Taxation -- price differential between cigarette brands -- requirement in New York City Tax Regulations that retailers maintain difference in price between brands of cigarettes that have higher tar and nicotine content and those having lower content and that amount of this price differential be at least equivalent to tax attributable to such content is proper exercise of police power to promote health -- in addition, imposition of price differential is within city's authority under enabling statute.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Pursuant to an enabling statute (L. 1952, ch. 235, as amd. by L. 1971, ch. 394), the City of New York placed a tax on the sale of cigarettes based on the tar and nicotine content thereof.  The requirement in the city Tax Regulations that retailers maintain a difference in price between brands that have a higher tar and nicotine content and those that have a lower content and that the amount of this price differential be at least equivalent to the tax attributable to such content is a proper exercise of the police power, not inconsistent with any provision of the Constitution or other general law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The City of New York has been granted the exercise of the police power to promote health through the State Constitution and the State Legislature (N. Y. Const., art. IX, &sect; 2, subd. [c], [ii], [10]; Municipal Home Rule Law, &sect; 10, subd. 1, [ii], a, [12]; New York City Charter, &sect; 27, subd. a).  The price differential is reasonably related to the reduction of the use of the more harmful brands of cigarettes since it is intended to force a consumer to pay a higher price for harmful cigarettes and, therefore, clearly pertains to health.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The fact that the differential regulates prices does not render it invalid.  Such regulation has a substantial relation to the health objective of reducing the amount of high tar and nicotine cigarettes smoked by city inhabitants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The price differential does not deprive retailers of pricing flexibility permitted by State law.  The fact that the State also taxes cigarettes has no significant relation to the city's price differential and, therefore, does not create an inconsistency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. There is no requirement that a local law be enacted in response to a uniquely local situation.  Since the price differential is not inconsistent with a general State policy, there is no requirement that the problem remedied be based on peculiarly local conditions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. Since the enabling statute specifies that it was delegating power to the city to tax the tar and nicotine content of cigarettes and provides for judicial review, it is not violative of section 1 of article XVI of the State Constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. The enabling statute authorized the city to impose a tax on cigarettes such as the Legislature has the authority to impose and the Legislature has the power to fix prices of commodities. Therefore, the city has the power to impose the tax which includes the price differential. This broad reading is supported by the legislative history of the 1971 amendment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. The difficulty in the practical application of the price-differential requirement does not render the regulation unconstitutionally vague and, in any event, defendant has, who sold two brands at the same price neither alleged nor proved any difficulty in ascertaining the proper prices under the differential with respect to the brands of cigarettes which formed the basis of his conviction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. Treating vending machines as a separate classification is reasonable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">10. The enactment is not &quot;overbroad&quot; because it cannot be said that the purpose could be as effectively accomplished by advertising or notice requirements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">11. Even if the Federal Public Health Cigarette Smoking Act of 1969 is preemptive, it does not preclude a price differential. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant board appealed a decision from the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the Second Judicial Department (New York), which reversed the dismissal of plaintiff landowner's action to have a zoning ordinance declared unconstitutional and entered judgment in favor of the landowner.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowner's property was zoned for residential use and he sought to have it changed to business use. The landowner brought an action to have the zoning ordinance declared unconstitutional as to his land and asserted that the land was unfit for residential use. The trial court dismissed the action. The appellate division reversed and entered judgment in favor of the landowner. On appeal, the court reversed. The court stated that the landowner did not establish that the land could not yield a reasonable return if used for residential purposes. The court stated that the landowner was entitled to have his property yield a reasonable return and that it did not have to be the most profitable or greatest return. The court stated that the landowner failed to carry the burden and did not show that the statute was unconstitutional therefore the presumption of constitutionality prevailed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the appellate division's judgment entered in favor of the landowner and reinstated the trial court's judgment that dismissed the landowners action to have a zoning ordinance declared unconstitutional as it applied to the landowner's property.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Municipal corporations -- zoning -- complaint in action for zoning change from residential to business use properly dismissed where there was market for residential property in area and plaintiff's property could profitably be developed for that purpose --</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> zoning was not spot zoning but was part of comprehensive plan for general welfare of community -- ordinance insofar as it affects plaintiff's property is constitutional.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. In an action in which a zoning change from a residential to a business use is sought, the complaint, alleging that the area in which plaintiff's property is situated has become business and commercial in nature and that the property is unfit for residential use, was properly dismissed.  While plaintiff is entitled to a reasonable return on its property, it need not be the greatest return.  There was evidence that there was a market for residential property in the area and that plaintiff's property could profitably be developed for that purpose.  A slight or even a significant difference in the amount of profit does not </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">ipso facto</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> establish confiscation of the property.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The zoning is not spot zoning, but is part of a comprehensive plan of long duration designed for the general welfare of the community.  Much of the area around plaintiff's property is zoned and developed as residential and it can be profitable to develop the property in accordance with the zoning classification.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The zoning ordinance insofar as it affects plaintiff's property is constitutional.  The property is reasonably adapted for the present classification. That a greater profit will result if it is zoned commercial or business does not establish confiscation where the residential use permits a reasonable return. The action of defendants in seeking to maintain the area for residential purposes was a proper one and it cannot be said that the denial of the requested change of use was arbitrary or unreasonable.  The presumption of constitutionality prevails.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff employee appealed an order of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court (New York), which unanimously affirmed a judgment of the trial court in a proceeding pursuant to N.Y. C.P.L.R. 78, denying the employee's application to re-enroll as a member of the city retirement system upon his re-entry into city employment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee entered into a city retirement system contract in 1941, which contained a right of re-entry into the system if he became a city employee again, before attaining age 70, after he had originally retired. When the city re-hired the employee, he sought re-entry into the retirement system, which was denied. The court reversed and remitted, holding that: (1) under the express language of the retirement statute, the employee's membership in the retirement system ceased when he retired in 1955 and was granted an annual retirement allowance; (2) when the employee re-entered city employment in 1968, at age 67, his retirement allowance ceased; (3) the fact the retirement system lower its re-enrollment age from 70 to 65 before the employee re-entered the system did not control; (4) the employee's opportunity to re-enter the retirement system, while conditional upon being rehired by the city, was nevertheless a retirement benefit; and (5) the city was not obliged to re-employ the employee, but having done so, the conditional aspect of the benefit was satisfied and the employee had a right to be re-enrolled as a member. This right was protected N.Y. Const. art. V, &sect; 7.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Civil service -- retirement -- New York City -- amendment to section B3-47.0 of Administrative Code lowering age from 70 to 65 at which retiree may re-enter Retirement System upon being rehired by city may not be applied to petitioner who re-entered city service at age 67 since when he became member of system maximum age was 70 and to deprive petitioner of such retirement benefit would be </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Petitioner became a member of the New York City Employees' Retirement System in 1941 when section B3-47.0 of the Administrative Code provided that a member who had retired had the right to again become a member of the Retirement System if he were re-employed by the city before attaining the age of 70.  Petitioner retired in 1955 and thereby became a beneficiary of the system.  Fifteen days before petitioner re-entered city service in 1968 at the age of 67, that section was amended to lower from 70 to 65 the maximum age at which a beneficiary could again become a member of the system.  To apply the amendment to petitioner and deprive him of such a benefit would be unconstitutional.  (N. Y. Const., art. V, &sect; 7.) Upon becoming a member of the system, one of the benefits to which petitioner was entitled was to re-enter the system until age 70 upon re-employment and that benefit has been diminished.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The opportunity to re-enter the Retirement System, conditional upon being rehired by the city, was a retirement benefit and while the city was not obliged to rehire petitioner, having done so, the condition was satisfied and petitioner had a right to be re-enrolled as a member.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The fact that petitioner was not a &quot;member&quot; of the Retirement System at the time of the amendment has no bearing on the issue.  The constitutional shield would be ineffective if it could be pierced by denominating potential recipients of retirement benefits as &quot;members&quot; or &quot;beneficiaries&quot;.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant indicted individuals sought review of the decision of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the Second Judicial Department (New York), which dismissed the indicted individuals' petitions filed to prohibit appellee judges from presiding over their trials, on the ground that the statute that authorized the judges' appointment, the Emergency Dangerous Drug Control Act, 1973 N.Y. Laws 603, was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">There were two separate groups of indicted individuals. The court held that the group that challenged the constitutionality of the legislation had standing but the group that challenged the legislation as violating the constitutional doctrine of separation of powers did not have standing. The court affirmed the dismissal of the petitions. The court determined that nothing in the state constitution guaranteed a defendant charged with a felony the right to have been tried before an elected rather than an appointed judge. The order that appointed the judges was designed to have accomplished the purpose of the constitutional requirement of a temporary assignment. The court held that it would not substitute its own judgment for that of the legislature in determining the particular method that should have been used to meet a given need. The court decided that there was no constitutional infirmity in the actions of any of the three branches of government.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the appellate court's dismissal of the indicted individuals' petitions that alleged that the appointment of the judges was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional law -- assignment of additional Court of Claims Judges to Supreme Court -- Emergency Dangerous Drug Control Act authorizing appointment of up to 68 additional Judges of Court of Claims to provide Judges for anticipated increase in dangerous drug felony prosecutions is constitutional -- Constitution authorizes temporary assignment of Judge of Court of Claims to Supreme Court to have powers and duties</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> of Justice thereof and nothing in Constitution guarantees defendant charged with felony in New York City right to be tried before elected Supreme Court Justice -- designation of newly appointed Judges of Court of Claims to act as Supreme Court Justices in Criminal Term by order of Appellate Division is proper temporary assignment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The Emergency Dangerous Drug Control Act (L. 1973, ch. 603) insofar as it authorizes the appointment of up to 68 additional Judges of the Court of Claims, in order to provide Judges to preside over an anticipated increase in dangerous drug felony prosecutions as a result of the new law, is constitutional.  The Legislature is authorized to increase the number of Court of Claims Judges (N. Y. Const., art. VI, &sect; 9) and it is of no legal or practical consequence that it set an outer limit of 68 new Judges rather than fixing the number at that figure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. While the Constitution provides for the election of Supreme Court Justices (N. Y. Const., art. VI, &sect; 6, subd. c) and further provides that, in New York City, the Supreme Court has exclusive jurisdiction over crimes prosecuted by indictment (art. VI, &sect; 7, subd. a), the Constitution also authorizes the temporary assignment of a Judge of the Court of Claims to the Supreme Court (art. VI, &sect; 26, subd. b), and provides that while temporarily so assigned a Judge shall have the powers, duties and jurisdiction of a Justice of the court to which he is assigned (art. VI, &sect; 26, subd. k).  Therefore, nothing in the Constitution guarantees a defendant, charged with a felony in New York City, the right to be tried before an elected rather than an appointed acting Supreme Court Justice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The order of the Appellate Division designating newly appointed Judges of the Court of Claims to act as Supreme Court Justices in the Criminal Term &quot;until the further order of this Court&quot; accomplishes the purpose of the constitutional requirement of a temporary assignment.  The indefiniteness of the assignment is equivalent to a temporary designation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The Legislature agreed with the judicially expressed concern that the stricter sentences and limitations on acceptances of lesser pleas to higher crimes charged in the new drug law created an emergency need for additional Judges and the court should not substitute its judgment for that of the Legislature in determining the particular method to meet the need. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 5. While the device used to increase the number of Judges to try felony cases has the effect of minimizing whatever purpose is evident in the Constitution to provide for an elective Supreme Court to try such cases, this cross-working of purposes is not equivalent to an ambiguity or conflict in the grant of constitutional powers requiring a court to look beyond the literal language and narrow or restrict the otherwise unqualified grant of power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. The contention of petitioners that the acting Supreme Court Justices are likely to be partial or subject to improper executive influence is unacceptable.  Moreover, given the validity of the statute, the argument becomes irrelevant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. Petitioners have standing to challenge the constitutionality of the appointment and designation of those Judges who are to preside at petitioners' trials, since their interest in the constitutionality of the legislation is personal, direct and substantial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. Those petitioners, who allege that the requiring of participation by the executive branch of government in proposing a plan for the efficient use of judicial resources violates the doctrine of separation of powers, are not directly affected by that provision so as to afford them standing to challenge its constitutionality.  Nor will the constitutional question presented affect the validity of any orders or judgments of the acting Supreme Court Justices to warrant the court's consideration in the absence of standing.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants sought review of a decision of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the Third Judicial Department (New York) that reversed an order granting their motion to dismiss indictments charging defendants with offering false instruments for filing in violation of N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 175.35, and grand larceny in violation of N.Y. Penal Law &sect;155.35, and ordered that the indictments against them be reinstated.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were charged with offering false instruments for filing in violation of N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 175.35 and grand larceny in violation of N.Y. Penal Law &sect;155.35. The appellate court reversed the order that granted defendants' motion to dismiss the indictments. Noting that the Supreme Court rendered N.Y. Gen. Mun. Law &sect;&sect; 103(a) and (b)&nbsp;unconstitutional, the court held that the State could compel any person enjoying a public trust to account for his activities and could terminate services if he refused to answer relevant questions. However, testimony compelled under threat of loss of public employment was inadmissible and could not be used as a basis for subsequent prosecution. The grand jury considered evidence obtained at the expense of a constitutional right, which generally did not require indictment dismissal, and was fatal only when the remaining legal evidence was insufficient to sustain the indictment. However, the Steuding rule was applicable because defendants were a &quot;target&quot; of the investigation. In addition to the dismissal requirement, an exclusionary rule protected defendants from indictment based on any incriminating testimony, and from the use of such evidence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reinstated the order granting defendants' motion to dismiss the indictments against them.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Defendants, under subpoena, appeared before a Grand Jury investigating the purchasing practices of a city with which they had entered into a contract, executed a limited waiver of immunity and surrendered the subpoenaed records.  Subsequently the Grand Jury returned two indictments against them.  Section 103-b of the General Municipal Law provides that any person who, when called before a Grand Jury to testify in an investigation concerning any transaction or contract had with the State or any political subdivision thereof, refuses to sign a waiver of immunity or to answer any relevant question should be disqualified from thereafter selling to or submitting bids to or receiving awards from or entering into any contracts with any municipal corporation, for a stated period.  A statement obtained pursuant to this statute is coerced within the meaning of the Fifth Amendment and may not be used at a subsequent criminal prosecution. The fact that the defendants are public contractors and not public employees (cf.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Garrity </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">v.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10"> New Jersey</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 385 U.S. 493; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Gardner </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">v.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10"> Broderick</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 392 U.S. 273) or license holders (cf.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Spevack </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">v.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10"> Klein</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 385 U.S. 511) does not render a different rule applicable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The general rule that the submission of some inadmissible evidence during the course of the proceeding is fatal only when the remaining legal evidence is insufficient to sustain the indictment is inapplicable when the Grand Jury has considered testimony from a witness who is a &quot;target&quot; of the investigation and, in this case, defendants fall into this category.  The violation of the constitutional privilege carries with it a dismissal of the indictment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Reindictment is possible, however, if sufficient evidence, independent of the evidence, links, or leads furnished by the prospective defendant, is adduced to support it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The law in effect at the time defendants appeared before the Grand Jury required an affirmative claim of the privilege against self incrimination and an invalid waiver, as was present in this case, would not confer full transactional immunity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Sections 103-a and 103-b of the General Municipal Law as presently enacted are unconstitutional.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff challenged an order of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court, First Judicial Department (New York), granting defendant's motion to dismiss the complaint insofar as it asserted a class action on an insurance policy, and defendant challenged a grant of summary judgment to plaintiff.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, a state employee who received medical insurance from defendant insurer, argued that N.Y. Ins. Law &sect; 221(5)(e) required defendant to reimburse him for services rendered by a licensed psychologist, even though the policy did not cover such services. Defendant argued that the statute did not apply because the policy was issued before the statute's effective date. The court noted that the statute required insurers to provide coverage for services rendered by a licensed psychologist if their policies covered similar services rendered by physicians, and that defendant's policy did so. The court then noted that defendant could renew or discontinue coverage annually. The court found that the statute applied to defendant because defendant had not discontinued coverage on the first renewal date after the statute's enactment. The court also agreed that a class action was not warranted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the orders, holding that the case did not warrant class action status, and that the insurance law amendment applied even though it was enacted after the policy issued, because the policy was renewed annually and defendant could terminate coverage or increase premiums each year.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Insurance -- group medical expense insurance -- 1971 amendment to section 221 (subd. 5, par.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> [e]) of Insurance Law providing for reimbursement to subscribers of group health insurance policies for services of psychologists and stating that amendment was prospective in application is applicable to group health policy issued in 1957 which provided that term of policy was for one year and that policy was renewable from year to year unless terminated -- since insurer had option not to renew or to change premium, prospective application of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">statute</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> not violative of constitutional prohibition against impairment of obligation of pre-existing contract -- class action properly dismissed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. A 1971 amendment to section 221 (subd. 5, par. [e]) of the Insurance Law stated that whenever a group health insurance policy provides for reimbursement to a physician or a psychiatrist for treatment of mental or emotional disorders, a subscriber thereto shall be entitled to reimbursement for such services whether performed by a physician, psychiatrist, or psychologist and was to apply only to policies written or renewed on or after its effective date.  That amendment is applicable to a group major medical expense insurance policy issued in 1957 to cover employees of the State of New York which policy provides that its term is for one year and it is renewable from year to year unless terminated by written notice. Therefore, plaintiff is entitled to be reimbursed for a course of treatment with a psychologist for a mental ailment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Since the defendant insurance company had the option not to renew the contract on the next anniversary date of the policy following enactment of the statute or to change the premium, the policy was modified upon renewal by operation of law to include reimbursement for services of psychologists and the prospective application of the statute does not violate the constitutional prohibition against the impairment of an obligation of a pre-existing contract.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The statute is not inapplicable to a policy covering &quot;medical services&quot; on the ground that psychologists are not permitted to practice medicine.  Some services rendered by a physician may be rendered by a psychologist and where the practices overlap the statute mandates reimbursement for psychologists' services.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. A class action by plaintiff on behalf of all other similarly situated employees of the State was properly dismissed.  The complaint merits no such procedure.  Pending legislation providing for a broadened scope and more liberal procedure for class actions is preferable to judicial development in the same direction.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On remand from the United States Supreme Court, which vacated the judgment of the Court of Appeals (New York), affirming appellants' convictions for violations of N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 235.05.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants were convicted of misdemeanors because they violated N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 235.05, which prohibited the promotion or production of obscene material. The United States Supreme Court vacated the convictions and remanded the case to reconsider New York's penal law dealing with obscenity and pornography in light of its Miller decision, which left to local government to determine what is obscenity in the respective communities in which such decisions may be promulgated. The court found that N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 235.01 sufficiently described the prohibited conduct; therefore, it satisfied the void-for-vagueness test. Further, the court found that the statutes complied with the Miller limits as written and construed because they prohibited commercial exploitation of hard core pornography. The court concluded that the state's hard core pornography standard did not go beyond the Miller standard. Accordingly, appellants' convictions were reinstated.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In each appellants' case, the order of the appellate term was affirmed and the convictions reinstated because the courts below employed standards entirely in accord with applicable state law.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- obscenity -- </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Penal Law ( &sect; 235.00</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">) is constitutional -- obscenity trial guidelines stated -- State-wide standard, not local community standard, governs -- Trial Judge must preliminarily determine that film or other work lacks any social value, before he can submit this question to jury -- mere pretense or interspersing of some nonpornographic matter should be disregarded -- Judge who personally views film may, without first conducting adversary hearing, issue warrant for seizure of copy of film as evidence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The definition of criminal obscenity in the Penal Law ( &sect; 235.00) is sufficiently specific and is constitutional.  ( </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Miller </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">v.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10"> California</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 413 U.S. 15, followed.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.  In a prosecution under that statute the basic guidelines for the triers of fact are: (a) whether an ordinary adult would find that the film, magazine or other work taken as a whole, appeals to the prurient interest, and (b) whether the work depicts or describes, in a patently offensive way, sexual conduct specifically defined by section 235.00, and (c) whether the work taken as a whole lacks serious literary, artistic, political or scientific value.  ( </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Miller </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">v.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10"> California</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 413 U.S. 15, followed.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Guideline questions (a) and (b) above must be determined, not according to any local community standards, but according to the State-wide standard through the construction given by the appellate courts.  ( </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Miller </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">v.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10"> California</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 413 U.S. 15, explained.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Guideline question (c) above can be determined by the triers of fact only after the Trial Judge, in the absence of the jury and without disclosing his determination to them, has independently and fully resolved this issue against the accused, as a preliminary matter of law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Guideline (c) above is set forth in the Penal Law ( &sect; 235.00, subd. 1, cl. [c]) in these words: &quot;it is utterly without redeeming social value &quot;.  Properly construed, these words mean that a mere pretense or interspersing of some nonpornographic matter should be disregarded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. A Judge who is authorized to issue warrants and who has personally viewed a motion picture film and has found it to be obscene may, without first conducting an adversary hearing on the issue of probable obscenity, issue a warrant for the seizure of a copy of the film as evidence in an obscenity prosecution against the exhibitor.  ( </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Heller </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">v.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10"> New York</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 413 U.S. 483.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. Accordingly, judgments convicting the defendants of promoting obscenity (Penal Law, &sect; 235.05) are affirmed.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed an order of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the Second Judicial Department (New York), which affirmed his conviction for felony murder and manslaughter in the second degree.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with felony murder and common-law murder. At the time of defendant's trial in 1971, &sect; 295-1 allowed the prosecutor to demand defendant to identify his alibi defense if he intended to offer one at trial. If defendant did not comply and serve a bill of particulars, the trial court could exclude any alibi testimony offered by defendant at trial. Defendant contended that the absence of reciprocity in the notice-of-alibi statute rendered it unconstitutional. The court agreed and held the statute to be unconstitutional. However, under the general principle allowing a court to make such rulings prospective in criminal litigation, the court ordered that its ruling applied only to cases in which a trial was commenced after June 11, 1973. It noted that the application of &sect; 295-1 in defendant's case did not operate to exclude any alibi testimony. Defendant furnished the names of his alibi witnesses on demand and their testimony was admitted at trial. Although defendant was denied advance notice of the identity of the prosecution's rebuttal witnesses, he was not inhibited in his own opportunity to establish his alibi.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant carrier challenged the decision of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the First Judicial Department (New York), which affirmed the order of the trial court that granted the motion to compel compliance of a subpoena duces tecum that was issued by respondent, the Commissioner of the Department of Consumer Affairs of the City of New York (Commissioner), pursuant to N.Y. C.P.L.R. 2308(b).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following an investigation by the city, the Commissioner issued a subpoena duces tecum to the carrier, requesting all of its books and records. The Commissioner's justification for the subpoena was that numerous complaints had been issued against the carrier. When the carrier refused to comply, the Commissioner filed a motion to compel, pursuant to N.Y. C.P.L.R. 2308(b), which the trial court granted. The appellate court affirmed. On appeal, the court reversed and concluded that the subpoena was overbroad and that the Commissioner failed to provide sufficient justification for its request. The court reasoned that allowing such a broad subpoena would subject innocent parties to administrative abuse. The court denied the motion to compel and granted the carrier's motion to quash the subpoena.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the order of the appellate court and denied the Commissioner's motion to compel and granted the carrier's motion to quash the subpoena duces tecum.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Witnesses -- subpoena duces tecum -- subpoena duces tecum requiring production of all business records for 17 months will not be judicially enforced upon general allegations by local consumer protection agency of &quot;numerous complaints&quot; -- subpoena quashed, without prejudice to city commissioner's renewal of motion to compel compliance</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> based on proper foundation, or making more inquiries into complaints and issuing more limited subpoena, based on sufficient factual showing -- </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Transportation Law ( &sect; 160</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">) does not pre-empt field or exclude municipal consumer protection law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Acting under New York City's Consumer Protection Law of 1969 (Administrative Code of City of New York, ch. 64), which is designed to prohibit deceptive or unconscionable trade practices by those who provide consumer goods or services, the city's Commissioner of Consumer Affairs issued a broad subpoena duces tecum to a corporation which is in the business of moving household goods within the city; and subsequently the commissioner moved for an order to compel compliance with the subpoena ( CPLR 2308, subd. [b]).  The subpoena would require the corporation to produce practically all of its books and records for the preceding 17 months.  The commissioner averred that she had received &quot;numerous complaints&quot; of underestimates and overcharges which led her to believe that the corporation was engaged in a pattern of deceptive practices.  Such a general averment cannot support such a broad subpoena duces tecum issued by a local regulatory agency.  Although the courts do not require a municipal regulatory agency to show probable cause for the issuance of a subpoena, the courts must guard innocent parties against the possibilities of administrative abuse of power and harassment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Accordingly, judicial enforcement of the subpoena is denied and the subpoena is quashed.  Of course, the commissioner may renew the motion based on a sufficient showing, may make additional preliminary inquiries into recent complaints, or may issue a subpoena of limited scope, with proper supportive foundation, and then apply anew for judicial enforcement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The Transportation Law ( &sect; 160), which regulates motor carriers of household goods in New York City, does not pre-empt the field and exclude a local law, such as New York City's Consumer Protection Law, from regulating carriers of household goods within the city.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant widow sought review of the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the Fourth Judicial Department (New York), which reversed an order denying a motion by respondent state to dismiss the claim for failure to state a cause of action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant widow filed a complaint against respondent state alleging in her first action that respondent was negligent in failing to warn the decedent of an impending riot of which respondent had, or should have had, knowledge. The second action was based upon intentional tort. It alleged that during the forceful retaking of the prison where decedent was employed as a clerical worker, respondent's trooper, without just cause or provocation, willfully and intentionally assaulted and battered appellant's husband by firing several shots, one or more of which struck her husband and caused his death. The appellate court granted respondent's motion to dismiss, and appellant sought review. The court affirmed as to the dismissal of the negligence action, holding that appellant was relegated to workmen's compensation as her exclusive remedy. However, the court reversed the dismissal of the second cause of action, holding that it properly alleged that respondent's trooper willfully and intentionally assaulted appellant's husband. The court held that respondent could be held liable for an assault if it was without cause or provocation and, thus, dismissal of the action was improper.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the appellate court's dismissal of appellant widow's negligence action, holding that appellant was relegated to workmen's compensation as her exclusive remedy.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Claimant's decedent, employed by the State Department of Correctional Services as an accounts clerk at Attica Correctional Facility was taken hostage during the 1971 riot and was killed when the prison was retaken by law officers.  Claimant's first cause of action to recover for decedent's death which alleged that the State was negligent in failing to warn decedent of the impending riot of which the State had, or should have had, knowledge was properly dismissed.  Claimant is relegated to workmen's compensation as her exclusive remedy since the claim alleges that the State was negligent while decedent was performing his duties as clerk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The second claim alleging that a State trooper, during the forceful retaking of the prison, &quot;wilfully and intentionally assaulted&quot; decedent causing his death states a cause of action. With the waiver of immunity found in section 8 of the Court of Claims Act, the State became liable for the torts of its agents on the basis of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">respondeat superior</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, notwithstanding that the agent was engaged in a&quot;governmental&quot; activity.  The use of excessive force in the retaking would be sufficient to render the State liable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Claimant faces a heavy burden of proof to establish the use of excessive force and in the light of all the circumstances dismissal of the second cause of action was inappropriate.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner landlords sought review of two decisions by the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the First Judicial Department (New York), which held that 1971 N.Y. Laws 1012 amending the Local Emergency Rent Control Act was constitutional and that the New York City, N.Y., Rent, Eviction and Rehabilitation Regulations amend. 33 was invalid.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In two separate actions, the landlords challenged the constitutionality of Amendment 33. The appellate court determined that, pursuant to the Local Emergency Rent Control Act, the housing commissioner had the authority to declare the amendment invalid because it was more restrictive or stringent than prior regulations. On appeal, the court affirmed the appellate court decisions. The court concluded that: (1) the power granted to the housing commissioner did not violate the state constitution; (2) the housing commissioner reasonably exercised his power after finding that the amendment was more restrictive or stringent than present law, which resulted in the landlords being deprived of compensation to which they were entitled; (3) while the standard followed by the housing commissioner was rather broad, the complexity of rent controls and the presumption of constitutionality attached to legislative enactments persuaded the court that the standard was sufficient and the statute should be upheld; and (4) the landlords were entitled to have their hardship applications processed consistent with the law and regulations absent the challenged amendment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed both orders of the appellate court and held that the hardship applications presented by the landlords were to be construed absent consideration of the challenged amendment to the rent control laws.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Landlord and tenant -- rent regulation -- chapter 1012 of Laws of 1971 giving State Housing Commissioner veto power over regulations affecting controlled housing when proposed regulation is more restrictive than provisions previously in force does not violate home rule provisions of Constitution -- there is no unlawful delegation of legislative power without standards -- disapproval by commissioner of amendment 33 of New York City's Rent Regulations as more restrictive was reasonable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Chapter 1012 of the Laws of 1971 which, in effect, reposes a veto power in the State Housing Commissioner over regulations affecting controlled housing accommodations when the proposed regulation is more stringent or restrictive than the provisions previously in force, does not violate the home rule provisions of the State Constitution.  Chapter 1012 is general legislation applicable to any city of the State having a population of one million or more inhabitants, despite the fact that there might be but one city to which it could apply.  Moreover, the subject of rent control is primarily a matter of State concern and a function of the State at large.  Chapter 1012, therefore, does not relate to the property, affairs or government of the City of New York within the home rule provision (art. IX, &sect; 2, subd. [b], par. [2]) of the Constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Chapter 1012 does not unlawfully delegate legislative authority without standards to guide the exercise thereof.  In exercising his discretion to approve or withhold approval of a more restrictive regulation than those previously in effect, the commissioner's power is circumscribed by the statement of policy contained in the Local Emergency Rent Control Act, which chapter 1012 amends, that the transition from regulation to a normal market of free bargaining between landlord and tenant is the objective.  While this is a broad standard to guide the commissioner's discretion, in view of the strong presumption of constitutionality attaching to legislative enactments and the complexity of rent control and regulation, such standard is sufficient.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Amendment 33 of the City of New York's Rent Regulations, effective January 1, 1972, amended the provisions dealing with (&quot;hardship&quot;) adjustments based on net annual return to the owner-landlord to conform them to the procedures and standards of the computerized maximum base rent (MBR) system.  In particular, an apartment at its individualized MBR could not be assessed its share of the hardship increase even though the building as a whole might not be yielding its prescribed statutory return of 8.5%.  In determining that Amendment 33 was more restrictive than existing regulations because it bars or limits the collectibility of an increase in rent which is warranted under previous regulations without compensating landlord for the loss of rent to which he is entitled, the commissioner acted reasonably.  </SPAN></P>

The appellate court reversed and determined that the patient was dangerously mentally ill under former &sect; 85 and ordered him transferred to the state criminal hospital. The patient appealed. The court reversed and reinstated the trial court's order. The court held that the law was unconstitutional insofar as it mandated that dangerously mentally ill patients in civil state hospitals, whose confinement was not based on a criminal charge or conviction, be transferred to a state hospital, which was a correctional facility for mentally ill convicted criminals. To have subjected the patient to a greater deprivation of personal liberty than was necessary to achieve the purpose for which he was being confined violated due process.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A police officer began questioning defendants after he observed them run a light. During the questioning, a fight broke out and one defendant shot the officer. Both defendants were convicted of felony murder, while defendant shooter was also convicted of intentional murder. The court of appeals' orders affirmed the convictions. Defendant who did not shoot the officer contended the affirmative defense provisions of the felony murder statute,&nbsp;N.Y. Penal Law &sect;125.25(3), were unconstitutional because they compelled a defendant to disprove any connection with the murder. The court affirmed the orders because the affirmative defense provisions were constitutional. The defenses required knowledge and proof that only defendant would have been privy to, so that shifting the burden of persuasion to defendant would not create a hardship. Requiring the prosecution to disprove the defenses beyond a reasonable doubt would place an undue burden on it and reduce the statute's authority.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- murder -- evidence was sufficient to prove felony murder beyond reasonable doubt -- court's instruction that flight after arrest for felony constitutes crime of escape whether flight takes place before or after shooting was not erroneous -- burden of defendant to establish affirmative defense to felony murder by preponderance of evidence is not violation of due process -- court's denial of motion by defendant for severance was not abuse of discretion -- court properly sustained</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> objections to questions designed to show witness omitted facts in prior statements to which he was now testifying -- defendant, although tranquilized, was competent to participate in proceedings -- sufficient evidence was introduced to prove sanity at time of crime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Evidence that the defendants assaulted a police officer, that the police officer drew his service revolver and told the defendants that they were under arrest, that the defendants resisted the restraint and got away, and that in the course of getting away, defendant Bornholt shot and killed the officer for which defendant Victory, participant in the underlying felony, must share, was sufficient to prove all the elements of felony murder beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The court's supplemental instruction that &quot;flight after a lawful arrest by a policeman for the felony of assault in the second degree does constitute the crime of escape in the second degree whether that flight takes place before or after the shooting&quot; was not erroneous.  In stressing that the shooting must have occurred in furtherance of committing the crime of escape, the court's charge sufficiently informed the jury that, if the defendant did not intend to escape at the time the killing occurred, it could not convict of felony murder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. In view of the disparities in convenience of proof and opportunity for knowledge and in light of the basic underlying principle of constructive malice and accomplice liability, the defendant Victory's burden of establishing the affirmative defense to felony murder by a preponderance of the evidence is not a violation of constitutional due process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The denial by the trial court of a motion by defendant Victory for a severance on the ground that he intended to call his codefendant, Bornholdt, as a witness to introduce a statement, purportedly made by said codefendant, exculpating defendant Victory was not an abuse of discretion. Defendant Victory never offered proof as to what Bornholdt's testimony would be except for a conclusory statement, did not show how the purported statement would aid his defense to the felony murder charge and did not show that Bornholdt would in fact testify.  Finally, the motion was untimely.</SPAN></P>

A witness may not be impeached at trial by showing that he omitted to state facts at a prior time unless at that prior time the witness' attention was called to the matter and he was specifically asked about the facts.  Objections to certain questions regarding the assault were properly sustained where it was not shown that at the prior time the witness' attention was specifically called to the manner in which defendant Victory assaulted the police officer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. Defendant Bornholdt, although tranquilized with a drug administered at a hospital while awaiting trial, was competent to participate in the jury selection proceedings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. Sufficient evidence was introduced from which a jury could conclude that the defendant Bornholdt knew the consequences of his conduct and that such conduct was wrong.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.

CPL 270.20).  The judgments of conviction are reversed and a new trial is ordered.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Despite being duly nominated by the Republican Party for public offices, each of the candidates was also nominated by independent groups for the same office and challenged the trial court's invalidation of the independent petitions on the grounds that &sect; 138-b impermissibly prohibited independent groups from nominating their candidate of choice if that candidate had already been nominated by a political party, while allowing candidates to be nominated by more than one political party. Respondent county board of elections contended that the statute was designed to prevent the major parties from preempting the ballot to the exclusion of valid independent groups. In reversing the judgment of the trial court, the court gave little credence to the elections board's argument and instead held that no rational justification existed for a statute that allowed one candidate to accept nominations from two different political groups, but denied another candidate the opportunity to accept nominations from a political group and a political party. Therefore, the court declared that N.Y. Elec. Law &sect; 138-violated U.S. Const. amend. XIV and N.Y. Const. art. I, &sect; 11.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. In this case, appellants, Republican Party candidates for public office, are ineligible to receive and accept the nomination of an independent group, thereby preventing them from having their names listed on the ballot in two separate rows as nominees of the independent group and of the Republican Party while their opponents, nominees of both the Democratic and Conservative Parties, are not barred from having their names appear in two separate rows for the same office.  The advantage to certain candidates being listed on two rows while denying that privilege to others represents a denial of equal protection. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, state, and power authority, appealed an order from the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the Third Judicial Department (New York), which modified and affirmed the trial court's order denying the state and power authority's motions to dismiss plaintiff property owners' complaint. The appellate court certified the question, &quot;Did the trial court err as a matter of law in failing to grant the motion to dismiss the complaint?&quot;</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state and power authority required sand and gravel as filler for the construction of a dam power project. The state and power authority took a full fee interest in the property owners property by eminent domain rather than an easement only to extract sand and gravel. The trial court denied the state and power authority's motions to dismiss the property owners complaint. The state and power authority appealed and the court certified the following questions: Did the trial court err as a matter of law in failing to grant the motion to dismiss the complaint? The court held that it could not be determined, on the complaint and the affidavits in support of the cross motions, that to take a fee interest in all the acres was permissible to accomplish the conceded public purpose of extracting a limited amount of sand and gravel. The court held that N.Y. Pub. Auth. Law &sect; 1007authorized the acquisition of interests in property, such as easements. The trial court's order was affirmed, and the certified question was answered in the negative.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the appellate court's order denying the state and power authority's motion to dismiss the property owners' complaint. The court answered the certified question in the negative.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Eminent domain -- extent of taking -- owners allege that State intends to use only 300,000 cubic yards of 4,300,000 cubic yards of sand and gravel on property for dam project -- in action for declaratory judgment, record is insufficient to make determination -- State, as agent for</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> Power Authority, is proper party -- questions of necessity of appropriating any particular property and extent of such taking are subject to judicial review -- certified question interpreted not in most strict literal meaning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The soil on plaintiffs' 67.7-acre tract of land located near a proposed dam site is of superior quality for use as sand and gravel for high-grade dam filler. The State, acting on behalf of the Power Authority of the State of New York, appropriated the entire 67.7-acre tract in fee.  The owners allege that the State intends to use only about 300,000 cubic yards of the 4,300,000 cubic yards of sand and gravel on the property for the dam project.  In this action for a declaratory judgment in which the owners challenge the right of the State and the Power Authority by eminent domain to take a full fee interest rather than an easement only to extract sand and gravel, the record is insufficient to make a determination.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The State, as agent for the Power Authority, is a proper party to the action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The questions of the necessity of appropriating any particular property and the extent of such taking are subject to judicial review. The principle that there is no right to condemn land in excess of the need for public purposes, and that no more may be taken than is required for the particular public purpose, applies not only as to the volume of the land to be taken, but as well to the nature or extent of the estate in the property taken.  In general, there may not be the acquisition of a fee when only an easement is required.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The certified question whether Special Term erred as a matter of law in failing to grant the motion to dismiss the complaint in a declaratory judgment action is interpreted, not in its most strict literal meaning, but to inquire whether Special Term erred in its decision that, on the record before it, there was not an adequate basis for making a declaration in favor of the State and the Power Authority.  So understood, the question should be answered in the negative.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant owner of conforming property challenged an order of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the First Judicial Department (New York) which, in a summary proceeding, declared that &sect; 16(3) of the New York State Urban Development Corporation Act was constitutional in exempting projects of respondent New York State Urban Development Corporation (UDC) from zoning and other local laws.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner owned land which conformed to local zoning laws near a proposed urban development project. He filed a complaint seeking a declaration that the statute under which UDC purported to act was unconstitutional in that it was in conflict with the legislative powers of the municipality under the home rule provision of N.Y. Const. art. IX, &sect; 2. The lower court declared the UDC's enabling provision constitutional, that decision was affirmed, and this appeal ensued. The appellate court found housing was a matter of state-wide concern and, since the statute under attack was general in nature and affected housing, it followed that local laws otherwise in conflict could not inhibit the operation of the general laws. UDC's powers stemmed from the state constitution itself under N.Y. Const. art. XVIII, which established the legislative power to create such an agency in order to alleviate the housing problem throughout the state in the interests of general health, safety and welfare. Hence, there was no constitutional infirmity in either the creation of UDC or its right to override local zoning laws.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the decision of the lower court declaring a section of the New York State Urban Development Corporation Act constitutional in exempting UDC projects from local zoning laws.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Municipal corporations -- zoning -- New York State Urban Development Corporation, in planning to develop 12-acre parcel</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> of real property, may plan and execute projects in disregard of local zoning laws.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Plaintiff alleges that defendant New York State Urban Development Corporation (UDC) is planning to develop a 12-acre parcel of real property by providing facilities which, in size and in numbers of persons to be accommodated, will violate a village zoning ordinance which prohibits high-rise apartments, multiple dwellings and residences on lots of less than 7,500 square feet in the area affected.  Article XVIII of the State Constitution, which creates the necessary authority for the contemplated project, enabled the Legislature to provide for State housing projects and, pursuant to it, UDC was created (New York State Urban Development Corporation Act [L. 1968, ch. 174, as amd.]).  Section 16 (subd. [3]) of the New York State Urban Development Corporation Act provides that: &quot;the corporation and any subsidiary thereof shall, in constructing, reconstructing, rehabilitating, altering or improving any project, comply with the requirements of local laws, ordinances, codes, charters or regulations applicable to such construction, reconstruction, rehabilitation, alteration or improvement, provided however, that when, in the discretion of the corporation, such compliance is not feasible or practicable, the corporation and any subsidiary thereof shall comply with the requirements of the state building construction code&quot;.  It also provides that: &quot;nor shall any municipality have power to require the corporation or any subsidiary thereof, or lessee therefrom or successor in interest thereto, to obtain any other or additional authority, approval, permit, certificate or certificate of occupancy from such municipality as a condition of owning, using, maintaining, operating or occupying any project acquired, constructed, reconstructed, rehabilitated, altered or improved by the corporation or by any subsidiary thereof.&quot; When these quoted portions of the statute are taken together, it is clear that the Legislature, in reciting the words &quot;constructed, reconstructed, rehabilitated, etc.&quot;, did not have only building code regulations in mind.  It would be too narrow an interpretation to say that the statutory provisions did not contemplate zoning. Accordingly, UDC may plan and execute projects in disregard of local zoning laws.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Article IX of the State Constitution is expressly made subject to other provisions of the State Constitution, and section 3 of article IX provides that &quot;[except] as expressly provided, nothing in this article shall restrict or impair any power of the legislature in relation to * * * Matters other than the property, affairs or government of a local government.&quot; A general law such as section 16 (subd. [3]), applicable to all municipalities, cannot be construed as a law designed to be disruptive of the property or affairs &quot;of a local government.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Section 2 (subd. [b], par. [1]) of article IX provides that local laws cannot be overridden except by &quot;enactment of a statute * * * in one calendar year and the re-enactment and approval of such statute in the following calendar year.&quot; That provision reasonably applies only where a special act, disruptive of the powers of a particular municipality, is involved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. There is no constitutional infirmity in either the creation of UDC or its right to override local zoning laws.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff guest sought review of a judgment of the Supreme Court in the First Judicial Department (New York), which affirmed a judgment of the trial court, dismissing the action against defendant hotel. The guest filed the action seeking a declaratory judgment of the unconstitutionality of N.Y. Lien Law &sect; 181, a permanent injunction, and damages for mental distress.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The guest took up residence at the hotel. Approximately two months later, the guest was locked out of her room for nonpayment of one week's hotel charges. Pursuant to the innkeeper's lien law, N.Y. Lien Law, &sect; 181, the hotel summarily seized the guest's personal property without notice and without an opportunity for a hearing. The guest was left with only the clothes she was wearing, her purse with some personal identification, and small change. On appeal, the court reversed the judgment of the lower court, which had affirmed the judgment of the trial court; the trial court had dismissed the action against the hotel. The court held that the innkeeper's lien law irreconcilable with evolving concepts of due process and was unconstitutional. The court overruled Waters &amp; Co. v. Gerard, 189 N.Y. 302 (1907) to the extent that it held the contrary. &quot;State action&quot; could have been found in an innkeeper's execution on his own lien. Procedural due process required notice and an opportunity for a hearing before the hotel was allowed to deprive the guest of a possessory interest in her property.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment of the lower court, which affirmed a judgment of the trial court, dismissing the action against the hotel.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Liens -- innkeeper's lien -- innkeeper's lien law (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Lien Law, &sect; 181</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">), pursuant to which hotel summarily seized personal property of resident for nonpayment of one week's hotel charges, without notice and without opportunity for hearing, is </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">unconstitutional</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> -- </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Waters &amp; Co. v. Gerard (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">189 N. Y. 302)</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> overruled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. A resident at a hotel was locked out of her room for nonpayment of one week's hotel charges and, pursuant to the innkeeper's lien law (Lien Law, &sect; 181), the hotel summarily seized her personal property without notice and without an opportunity for a hearing.  Section 181 of the Lien Law which is the authority for such action is irreconcilable with evolving concepts of due process and is unconstitutional.  Insofar as </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Waters &amp; Co. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">v.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10"> Gerard</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (189 N. Y. 302) holds to the contrary, it is overruled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Although the return of plaintiff's property to her several months after filing of the complaint renders the claim for injunctive relief academic, the claim for money damages remains.  The due process and search and seizure issues remain and the controversy is justiciable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Moreover, judicial reluctance to decide questions which need not be reached should yield when, as here, important constitutional issues are raised and the controversy is of a kind likely to recur.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. While plaintiff's property was not seized by a State official, but by private persons acting pursuant to State law, in some circumstances, the actions of a private citizen can become the actions of the State for purposes of the due process clause.  The execution of a lien traditionally has been the function of the Sheriff.  On this view, &quot;State action&quot; can be found in an innkeeper's execution on his own lien.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Procedural due process requires notice and an opportunity for a hearing before the State may deprive a person of a possessory interest in his property.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. The guest's interest in possession and use of his property outweighs the innkeeper's interest in summarily seizing that property to secure the payment of charges.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants and respondent, parolees, sought habeas corpus against respondents and appellant, officials. Two trial courts dismissed the writs; the third ordered a hearing; the fourth rescinded revocation of parole. The Appellate Divisions of the Supreme Court in the Fourth and Second Judicial Departments (New York) affirmed the first three judgments, that of the First Judicial Department reversed the fourth. Parolees and an official appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parolees claimed a due process right to counsel at preliminary parole revocation hearings. The officials claimed that no such right existed. The court noted that the federal Constitution conferred only a conditional or discretionary right to counsel at a final parole revocation hearing, and that the federal due process right to counsel at a preliminary revocation hearing was thus conditional or discretionary. The court determined that the due process right to counsel at a preliminary revocation hearing under the state constitution should be coextensive with that under the federal Constitution and no more, and that whether due process required counsel at such a preliminary stage should depend on the peculiarities of particular cases, the decision to be made on a case-by-case basis in the discretion of the parole board. The court determined that parolees should be entitled to a Morrissey hearing if, on the date of that decision, charges of delinquency had not yet been considered and the parolee had not yet been declared delinquent by a member of the parole board. The court concluded that a parolee was not entitled to bail or release pending a hearing before the parole board.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the orders in the first, second, and fourth cases, and reversed the order in the third, directing that the petition in that case should be dismissed.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The Supreme Court, with respect to indigent probationers and parolees, has indicated that the Federal Constitution confers only a conditional or discretionary right to counsel at a preliminary or a final parole revocation hearing (cf.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Gagnon </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">v.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10"> Scarpelli</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 411 U.S. 778).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. A parolee's due process right to counsel at a preliminary revocation hearing under the State Constitution should be coextensive with that under the Federal Constitution and no more.  Whether due process requires the assistance of counsel at this preliminary stage should depend on the peculiarities of particular cases.  The decision as to the need for counsel should be made on a case-by-case basis in the exercise of a sound discretion by the Parole Board in accordance with the guidelines set forth in the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Gagnon</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The Supreme Court, in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Morrissey </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">v.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10"> Brewer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, stated that its decision requiring preliminary and final parole revocation hearings was applicable only to &quot;future revocations of parole.&quot; (408 U.S. 471, at p.  490.) Parole revocation is a process initiated by the issuance of a warrant for the retaking and temporary detention of the parole violator followed by his actual arrest. In determining whether a parolee is entitled to a preliminary hearing, the critical stage in this process is the declaration of delinquency by the Parole Board member.  (7 NYCRR 1.17.) If, on the date of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Morrissey</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> decision, the charges of delinquency had not yet been considered and the parolee had not yet been declared delinquent by a member of the Parole Board, then he should be entitled to a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Morrissey</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> preliminary hearing for the revocation process had not yet been engaged.  That the delinquency may be declared retroactive and that the actual arrest may predate </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Morrissey</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is irrelevant for the purpose of determining whether a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Morrissey</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> preliminary hearing should be available to the parolee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The right to bail is purely statutory and, in the absence of specific legislative direction, parolees are not entitled either to bail or to release pending a hearing before the Parole Board. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 5. Included within a parolee's due process right to a preliminary hearing is the right to have that hearing conducted &quot;at or reasonably near the place of the alleged parole violation or arrest.&quot; (408 U.S., at p. 485.) While hearings within the City of New York would be preferable for parole violators arrested in the City of New York for violations occurring there, the reasonable expedient procedure adopted by the board of conducting the hearings at Ossining should not be condemned as violative of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Morrissey</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> decision.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from an order of the Appellate Term of the Supreme Court for the Ninth and Tenth Judicial Districts of the Second Judicial Department (New York), which affirmed the trial court's conviction of defendant for loitering in violation of N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 240.35(6).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted for loitering in violation of &sect; 240.35(6), and the appellate court affirmed. On appeal, the court reversed and dismissed the complaint. The court held that &sect; 240.35(6) was unconstitutional on its face and utterly failed to give adequate notice of the forbid behavior. Section 240.35(6) contained two substantive elements: (1) loitering in or about a place without apparent reason, (2) under circumstances which justified suspicion that a person may have been engaged or about to engage in crime. Both elements failed to give sufficient notice of the conduct proscribed and to advise defendant in sufficiently clear and unambiguous terms of the distinction between harmful and innocent conduct. Also, &sect; 240.35(6) placed virtually unfettered discretion in the hands of the police, which encouraged arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement, because it contained absolutely no guidelines governing the determination as to whether a person was engaged in suspicious loitering. Further, &sect; 240.35(6) plainly undercut the constitutional requirement that arrests were lawful only upon a showing of &quot;probable cause.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Section 240.35 (subd. 6) of the Penal Law, which provides that a person is guilty of loitering when he: &quot;Loiters, remains or wanders in or about a place without apparent reason and under circumstances which justify suspicion that he may be engaged or about to engage in crime, and, upon inquiry by a peace officer, refuses to identify himself or fails to give a reasonably credible account of his conduct and purposes&quot;, is in violation of due process of law. It is not so clear and positive as to give an unequivocal warning to the citizen of the rule which is to be obeyed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Not only does it fail to give adequate notice of the conduct to be avoided and punished but it also places virtually unfettered discretion in the hands of the police and thereby encourages arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement.</SPAN></P>

Moreover, by authorizing an arrest for loitering &quot;under circumstances which justify suspicion that [a person] may be engaged or about to engage in crime,&quot; subdivision 6 of section 240.35 undercuts the constitutional requirement that arrests are lawful only upon a showing of &quot;probable cause.&quot; </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from the Oneida County Court (New York), which rendered judgments upon jury verdicts convicting him of first degree murder and imposing the death penalty. Defendant claimed that the trial court erred in admitting the murder weapon and other physical evidence found in his closet and that the death sentence violated U.S. Const. amend. VIII's prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Shortly after robbing a gas station, defendant allegedly shot and killed two police officers. Other police officers eventually traced defendant to a house, where they found him hiding in a closet. After surrendering himself, defendant informed the police that the gun used in the crime was in the closet. Upon searching the closet, the police found the gun and other evidence. At the trial, defendant was convicted upon jury verdicts of first degree murder and sentenced to death. On appeal, defendant argued that the trial court erred in admitting the gun and other evidence found in the closet and that the death penalty violated U.S. Const. amend. VIII. The court reversed the death sentence and remanded for resentencing. Specifically, the court held that the &quot;inevitable discovery&quot; rule was both valid and applicable in the present case as an exception to the exclusionary rule with respect to the admission of the gun and other evidence. But the court ruled that because N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 125.35(5) left the imposition of the death penalty solely to the jury's discretion, the statute violated the constitutional prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction and held that the trial court did not err, due to inevitable discovery, in refusing to exclude the murder weapon and other evidence seized by police from the closet. But because state law left the imposition of the death penalty to the sole discretion of the jury, the court reversed and remanded defendant's death sentence, holding that it constituted cruel and unusual punishment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- murder -- sentence -- search and seizure -- defendant who had shot two policemen and had been traced to his home and found hiding in closet was not entitled to suppression of gun found in closet -- police would have inevitably found gun during normal course of lawful search -- search not unlawful under rule in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Chimel v. California (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">395 U.S. 752)</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> -- no arrest or search warrant was necessary -- New York </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">statute</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Penal Law, &sect; 125.30</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">, subd. 5) which leaves infliction of death penalty to jury constitutes cruel and unusual punishment as interpreted by </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">United States Supreme Court ( </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Furman v. Georgia, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">408 U.S. 238).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Defendant, who had previously shot two policemen and had been traced to his home in Syracuse and was found hiding in a closet, was not entitled to suppression of a gun found in the closet. The gun may not be deemed inadmissible as &quot;fruit of the poisonous tree&quot;.  Evidence obtained as a result of information derived from an unlawful search or other illegal police conduct is not inadmissible where the normal course of police investigation would have inevitably led to such evidence.  In this case, the police would have inevitably found the gun during a lawful search.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The determination in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Chimel </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">v.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10"> California</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (395 U.S. 752) that the lawful arrest of an accused, where accomplished without an arrest warrant, or a warrant to search the area where he is found, permits a search only of his person and the area from which he &quot;might obtain weapons or evidentiary items&quot;, does not mean that the gun should be excluded although defendant had been removed from the closet. That case did not disapprove of the search of the room but only to a search of an area remote in time and place from the arrest. Neither did the fact that the police had handcuffed the defendant render the search unauthorized.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. No arrest or search warrant was necessary.  There was probable cause to arrest the defendant, and the entry and search of a house by police officers to find a suspect, whom the police had probable cause to arrest and to believe had recently arrived there, and to look for weapons or fruits of the crime does not render either the entry without warrant to search or the search without warrant invalid.  Circumstances here demanded quick action.  No constitutional rights of defendant were violated by the warrantless entry, search and arrest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Since the New York statute (Penal Law, &sect; 125.30, subd. 5) leaves infliction of the death penalty to the untrammeled discretion of the jury, that penalty constitutes cruel and unusual punishment within the sense of the Eighth Amendment as that amendment has been interpreted by the United States Supreme Court in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Furman </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">v.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10"> Georgia</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (408 U.S. 238).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. The judgment appealed from is modified by vacating the sentence of death and remitting the case for resentencing.  </SPAN></P>

The trial court denied the motion and quashed the subpoena against appellants. Respondent sought review and the intermediate court reversed and granted the petition for commitment. Appellants sought review arguing that respondent could not compel them to surrender their privilege against self-incrimination. The appellate court affirmed the commitment order.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Appellants, New York City policemen, were subpoenaed to testify before the Commissioner of Investigation of the City of New York and were questioned about entries made on five sheets of police memo book paper.  Each of them identified certain entries on the sheets as being in his handwriting, but, when asked under what circumstances or for what purposes the entries had been made, each testified that he could not remember.  The entries on the police memo sheets were made pursuant to a common scheme which contemplated passing the sheets among patrolmen of the precinct sector for their additions and corrections.  It is incredible as a matter of law, as well as obstructive to the purposes of the investigation, that the policemen could not recall the nature of this common scheme. Accordingly, they did not make bona fide efforts to answer the questions put to them and refused to answer legal and pertinent questions without reasonable cause.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Each policeman was advised of his right to counsel and his privilege against self incrimination. They were also advised that, if they refused to answer any questions relating to the performance of their official duties, they would be subject to dismissal from the police force, and that if they did testify, neither their answers, nor any information or evidence gained by reason of those answers, could be used against them in a criminal proceeding. Their evasive responses can be used in a subsequent contempt proceeding pursuant to CPLR 2308 (subd. [b]).  The rationale of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Garrity </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">v.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10"> New Jersey</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (385 U.S. 493) does not apply to the situation here.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff taxpayers challenged an order of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the Second Judicial Department (New York), which reversed the trial court and directed judgment in favor of defendant purchaser in the taxpayers' action to compel the determination of a claim to real property sold for delinquent taxes.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayers were delinquent in the payment of their real property taxes, so the county, pursuant to the mandate of N.Y. Real Prop. Law &sect; 1002(1), advertised the property for sale to satisfy the delinquent taxes in two area newspapers for six successive weeks, as required by N.Y. Real Prop. Law &sect; 1014(1). The purchaser then bought the property and received a county tax deed. The taxpayers filed an action to have the deed declared invalid. The trial court declared title to be in the taxpayers, and the appellate court reversed. On appeal, the court affirmed the appellate court, holding that title to the property belonged to the purchaser. Although the taxpayers did not actually receive notice of the tax sale or of redemption following the sale, notice was published in two newspapers for the required period of time as specified in &sect;&sect; 1002(1), 1014(1). Thus, because indirect notice was sufficient to persons interested in property in default in the payment of taxes, the Due Process Clause of the New York Constitution and the United States Constitution were not offended by summary statutory remedies for the collection of ordinary taxes.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the appellate court's order declaring that title to the real property belonged to the purchaser in the taxpayers' action for a determination of a claim to the property, which was sold for delinquent taxes.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.  Section 1002 of the Real Property Tax Law provides that the county treasurer shall cause a notice of tax sale to be published at least once each week for six weeks in two designated newspapers, specifying a day at the expiration of the six weeks on which the sale will commence.  Section 1014 provides that the county treasurer shall, at least three months before the expiration of the one year allowed for the redemption of lands sold for taxes, cause commencement of publication of a notice, once a week for six successive weeks in the designated newspapers, containing a list of the lands sold for taxes and unredeemed, specifying every parcel unredeemed, the amount necessary to redeem and stating that, unless such lands are redeemed on or before such day, they will be conveyed to the purchaser. The procedure followed by the county as required by these statutes gave the property owners sufficient notice that their property would be sold for nonpayment of taxes and notice of redemption. Indirect notice is sufficient to persons interested in property which is in default in payment of taxes.  No issue is presented as to the property owners' knowledge that taxes were to be paid or of consequences of nonpayment.  The challenged sections ( Real Property Tax Law, &sect;&sect; 1002, 1014) satisfy the requirements of due process and are not constitutionally infirm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The court suggests that the Legislature re-examine these statutes, since the circumstances of land ownership were much different when the Legislature enacted the provision regarding the selection of two newspapers for the purpose of advertising tax sales and notices of redemption. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of a decision by the Appellate Term of the Supreme Court for the Second and Eleventh Judicial Districts of the Second Judicial Department (New York), which reversed his conviction for loitering and affirmed his conviction for attempted possession of a hypodermic instrument.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, when questioned by the housing authority police, refused to answer questions. After the officer placed defendant under arrest, he conducted a search and recovered drugs and a syringe. Defendant was charged with loitering, possession of a dangerous drug, and criminal possession of a hypodermic needle. He moved to suppress the evidence and the motion was denied. He was found guilty of loitering and then pleaded guilty to attempted possession of a hypodermic needle. He sought review. The intermediate court reversed the loitering conviction because the complaint was defective but upheld the search and drug conviction. Defendant again sought review arguing that the seized evidence should have been suppressed because there was no probable cause for the underlying loitering arrest, and that the subsequent search was illegal. The appellate court reversed defendant's conviction for attempted possession of a hypodermic instrument. It found that that the officer lacked probable cause to believe that defendant was acting in an unlawful manner and therefore, the search was unlawful and the evidence should have been suppressed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court reversed an order convicting defendant of attempted possession of a hypodermic instrument, and it dismissed the charge. The court held that there was no probable cause to arrest defendant for loitering and since the loitering arrest was the predicate for the search, the search was unlawful and the evidence should have been suppressed.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. At about 11:30 at night, defendant and a friend entered the unlocked lobby of an apartment building. They briefly talked to a third person in the building and then spoke to one another for about eight to ten minutes. At that point, two policemen entered the lobby, and one of them asked defendant if he lived in the building.  He replied that he did not.  When the officer asked him to identify himself and to explain his reasons for being there, defendant refused and was placed under arrest for loitering. Section 240.35 (subd. 6) of the Penal Law provides that: &quot;A person is guilty of loitering when he * * * Loiters, remains or wanders in or about a place without apparent reason and under circumstances which justify suspicion that he may be engaged or about to engage in crime, and, upon inquiry by a peace officer, refuses to identify himself or fails to give a reasonably credible account of his conduct and purposes&quot;.  There was no evidence that the circumstances would justify a suspicion that defendant was &quot;engaged or about to engage in crime&quot;.  The record demonstrates that the defendant was placed under arrest because he refused to identify himself or explain his presence in the building.  Such a refusal may not, in and of itself, justify an arrest or a conviction under the statute.  There was no probable cause for the defendant's arrest for loitering. The incidental search was unlawful and the evidence taken from the defendant should have been suppressed. The complaint should be dismissed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. In the view taken, the court finds it unnecessary to consider the constitutionality of the loitering statute.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner juvenile was detained for two months during his case investigation.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Unless evidence has established probable cause to detain an alleged juvenile delinquent, he cannot constitutionally be detained for more than several days beyond the statutory three-day limit (Family Ct. Act, &sect;&sect; 729, 747).  The initial detention hearing (Family Ct. Act, &sect; 728) may be an appropriate time to conduct an inquiry into whether there is probable cause to hold the infant; or, after a fact-finding hearing has been started and has established probable cause to detain the infant, the balance of the fact-finding hearing may be adjourned &quot;for good cause shown&quot; for not more than three days or, in case of homicide or an assault which incapacitates the victim, &quot;for a reasonable length of time&quot; (Family Ct. Act, &sect; 748).  On the issue of adjournment, the hearing need not be limited to &quot;competent&quot; evidence (cf. Family Ct. Act, &sect; 744), but may include reliable hearsay even though the question of adjournment involves probable cause to detain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. In this alleged homicide case, the infant has been unlawfully detained during some two months of adjournments of the fact-finding hearing, without any evidence establishing probable cause to hold him.  His writ of habeas corpus would be sustained, were it not for two facts: -- he has meantime been released on parole, and the Family Court in the City of New York has meantime adopted a regulation directing substantially the above-stated procedure.  Since the relief requested would serve no purpose, the judgment appealed from should be modified to the extent of dismissing the writ of habeas corpus solely on the ground of mootness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. However, the appeal itself should not be dismissed as moot when a question of general interest and substantial public importance is likely to recur. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner taxpayer sought review of an order of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the Third Judicial Department (New York), which confirmed a determination of respondent State Tax Commission sustaining the imposition upon the taxpayer of sales taxes under article 28 of the New York Tax Law, and dismissed the petition.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The question was whether the taxpayer was engaged in the &quot;storage&quot; business as that term had been applied by the courts, and, if so, the extent of its tax liability vis-a-vis its operators. The taxpayer contended that it was not engaged in storing tangible personal property within the meaning of N.Y. Tax Law &sect; 1105(c)(4). It urged that the term &quot;storage&quot; or &quot;storing&quot; connoted custody involving such duration and dominion as to render impossible its application to the public's use of coin-operated checking lockers. The court concluded that the statutory language fairly encompassed the type of service involved. The essence of the service was the provision of a place for the safekeeping of goods, which generally accorded with the ordinary and common meaning of storage. The taxpayer was the taxable vendor of these services and was liable for the collection of the sales tax. The nature of the contractual relationship between the taxpayer and its operators indicated that the former was the vendor within the meaning of the statute. For all intents and purposes, when a patron made use of a locker, he was dealing with the taxpayer.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The would-be candidates sought to fill, by election, the unexpired terms of five school board members. The board refused to accept their nominating petitions. The trial court held that Article 52-A of the Education Law was unconstitutional but it failed to direct the holding of an election. The appellate court modified the judgment and held that N.Y. Educ. Law &sect; 2590-c(6)(34)(b), which provided that vacancies on the school board could be filled for the unexpired term, was unconstitutional but it also failed to order an election. The court affirmed. The court noted that school board members were elective officers subject to N.Y. Const. art. XIII, &sect; 3, which provided that an appointment to fill a vacancy only last until the commencement of the political year. The fact that the school board members' terms did not coincide with the calendar year was not dispositive. The court concluded that an election should have been ordered by the trial court but declined to order such an election when the school board's term would imminently expire.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the order declaring that part of a statute permitting appointment to the community district school board for a term longer than authorized by the state constitution unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

XIII, &sect; 3) which provides that &quot;in case of elective officers, no person appointed to fill a vacancy shall hold his office by virtue of such appointment longer than the commencement of the political year next succeeding the first annual election after the happening of the vacancy&quot; and (&sect; 4) which defines political year as beginning on first day of January, in conflict with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Education Law ( </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">&sect; 2590-c</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">, subd. 6</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">, par.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Article 52-A of the Education Law established the New York City Community School District System and provided for the election of community boards of education.  The first members of the board were elected in March, 1970 for three-year terms commencing July, 1970 and ending June 30, 1973 (Education Law, &sect; 2590-b, subd. 2, par. [d]).  The statute provided that all subsequent members shall serve for two-year terms with elections to be held in May of odd-numbered years and terms to commence on July 1 (Education Law, &sect; 2590-c, subd. 2).  In one district, a community board of nine persons was elected in 1970.  By July of 1972 five of them had resigned, their places being filled by five members serving by appointment of the board.  The Education Law ( &sect; 2590-c, subd. 6, par. [34], cl. b) provides that &quot;Vacancies shall be filled for the unexpired term by the community board.&quot; Article XIII (&sect; 3) of the New York State Constitution provides that &quot;The legislature shall provide for filling vacancies in office, and in case of elective officers, no person appointed to fill a vacancy shall hold his office by virtue of such appointment longer than the commencement of the political year next succeeding the first annual election after the happening of the vacancy.&quot; Article XIII (&sect; 4) of the Constitution defines a political year as beginning on the first day of January.  There is a conflict between the Constitution and an appointment for an &quot;unexpired term&quot; as authorized by Education Law ( &sect; 2590-c, subd. 6, par. [34], cl. b).  School board members are &quot;elective officers&quot; and school board elections are not excluded from the application of article XIII (&sect; 3) of the Constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Although the issue is now academic, in October, 1972 Special Term should have directed that an election be held to fill the vacancy in the general election of November, 1972 and if the Board of Elections could not be ready by November, a special election should have been ordered for December.  Under the State Constitution, when a vacancy in an elective office occurs, the vacancy should be filled by an election in the shortest reasonable time possible.  However, the court will not direct a special election to be held in April or May, 1973 for a term to expire at the end of June, 1973.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The fact that a vacancy filled at an interim election might not allow for proportional representation in accord with the formula set out in section 2590-c (subd. 6) of the Education Law does not mean that the election should not be held.  It is more important to conduct an election and replace an appointed official with an elected official than to adhere to the fine details of proportional representation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. While it appears that district lines for school board elections may not coincide with election district lines for other elections, the practical difficulties presented can be overcome.  The city board of education can redraw the boundary lines of community board districts wherever possible to coincide with the lines for other districts.  The problems presented by the fact that school board election petitions were not due until October, 1972 and that there are eligible voters in the school board election other than the registered voters of the district are matters which deserve legislative attention.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners, a teacher and teachers union, challenged an order of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the First Judicial Department (New York), which affirmed an order denying an application by petitioners and dismissed their petition for an order annulling a decision of respondent comptroller of the city of New York and directing him to comply with a direction to pay petitioner teacher's salary.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner teacher was denied an early termination of her maternity leave. Through her collective bargaining representative, petitioner teachers union, she filed a grievance in accordance with her collective bargaining agreement. In the second step of the grievance procedure against respondent Board of Higher Education of the City of New York, petitioner was retroactively reinstated and awarded her salary. But respondent comptroller of the city of New York refused to comply with the decision insofar as it awarded back pay and argued that a payment of salary retroactively would constitute a gift of public funds. Petitioners commenced a N.Y. C.P.L.R. 78 proceeding. The lower court agreed with the respondent, stating that the award of retroactive salary would be a public gift and violate N.Y. Const. art. VIII, &sect;1. The court reversed, reasoning that the retroactive award of salary was no more a gift than any other award of damages for unlawful deprivation of an opportunity afforded by contract. The court further stated that an award of a collective bargaining grievance procedure was a legally enforceable contractual right and was as binding as any other arbitration award.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A teacher, member of a union which had a collective bargaining agreement with the Board of Higher Education, was placed on maternity leave and, following birth of her child in November, 1969, sought reinstatement in time for the commencement of the spring semester in February, 1970.  In the second stage of the grievance procedure under the contract, a decision dated May 12, 1970 retroactively reinstated petitioner teacher as of February 1, 1970 and awarded her back pay.  It was error to deny payment thereof on the ground that, since petitioner performed no services, payment would constitute a gift of public funds in violation of the Constitution.  The award resulting from the grievance procedure was a contractual right and was not a &quot;gift&quot; of public funds. The award is as binding as an arbitration award and imposes a legal obligation on the part of the municipality to comply with the decision.  </SPAN></P>

Although the appeal was briefed and argued on choice-of-law principles, the high court of California recently declared that the California guest statute violated the equal protection guarantees of the California and United States Constitutions. The classifications that the guest statute created between those denied and those permitted recovery for negligently inflicted injuries did not bear a substantial and rational relation to the statute's purposes of protecting the hospitality of the host-driver and of preventing collusive actions.

On appeal, the court held that the Due Process Clause was applicable to a tax statute only if the act was so arbitrary as to compel the conclusion that it did not involve an exertion of the taxing power, but constituted, in substance and effect, the direct exertion of a different and forbidden power. The court held that the wide variety of classifications permitted under the principles of equal protection went far to dispose of the employees' claim that Local Law No. 36 was arbitrary and capricious as it treated self-employed professionals as unincorporated business for tax purposes.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Prior to 1971 the New York City Unincorporated Business Income Tax Law defined an unincorporated business as &quot;any trade, business or occupation&quot; (Administrative Code, &sect; S46-2.0, subd. [a]).  In 1971, the State authorized the city to repeal the provision excluding or exempting professionals and to redefine an &quot;unincorporated business&quot; to include not only trades, businesses and occupations but professions as well (L. 1971, ch. 412,  &sect; 1).  In June of that year the city passed Local Law No. 36 of 1971 to extend the tax imposed under its Unincorporated Business Income Tax Law to previously exempted self-employed professionals.  The court at Special Term properly upheld the local law as constitutional.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. This law was enacted solely as an exercise of the taxing power. It was not motivated by any purpose other than the raising of revenue.  In such case the due process clause may not be availed of to condemn the statute.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. There was no denial of equal protection. The wide variety of permitted classifications in taxation disposes of the plaintiff's claim that Local Law No. 36 is arbitrary and capricious insofar as it treats self-employed professionals as unincorporated businesses for tax purposes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Plaintiff's argument that, even if the Legislature may legally treat self-employed businessmen and self-employed professionals similarly for tax purposes, it is not permissible to impose a business tax on such self-employed taxpayers without imposing the same tax on salaried employees is without merit.  A state of facts reasonably can be conceived that would sustain the classification, and that is sufficient.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5.  The fact that the tax classification under attack in this case has existed unchallenged in the State law since its enactment almost four decades ago is some evidence that such classification rests upon a just and reasonable ground.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the order of the Supreme Court for the Second and Eleventh Judicial Districts in the Second Judicial Department (New York), which affirmed her conviction based upon a guilty plea for attempted possession of a dangerous weapon.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted for attempted possession of a dangerous weapon, to which she pled guilty. On appeal, she contended that a warrantless search of her handbag and seizure of a loaded revolver violated U.S. Const. amend. IV. Her motion to suppress the evidence had been denied before her entry of the guilty plea. The court found that the motion was properly denied, and it affirmed the conviction. A forcible encounter between a police officer and defendant occurred in a precinct station house. The officer had a reasonable suspicion that defendant was carrying a concealed weapon. Based on the totality of the circumstances, although the action was predicated on an informant's tip, there was the requisite indicia of reliability to warrant the search and seizure without a warrant. Thus, the court found no constitutional or statutory violation stemming from such action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction for attempted possession of a dangerous weapon following a guilty plea, because the warrantless search of her handbag, based on reasonable belief that she had a weapon, was not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- stop and frisk -- defendant complained to police officer that her paramour menaced her; policeman arrested him and defendant preceded policeman to station house to file complaint; paramour told officer that defendant had gun; at station house policeman asked defendant for her purse which she gave him; he found loaded gun therein; stop and frisk was reasonable and gun was admissible against defendant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When defendant complained to a police officer that she had been menaced with a knife by a man with whom she had been living, her assailant was arrested and driven in the police vehicle to the station house. Defendant preceded the officer to the station house to file a complaint.  The man,  during the ride, informed the officer that defendant was &quot;sick&quot; and had a gun. At the police station, the officer asked defendant for her handbag. When she gave it to him he found a loaded revolver therein for which defendant had no license. The search was reasonable under the &quot;stop&quot; and &quot;frisk&quot; law ( CPL 140.50).  The search here occurred in the station house precipitated by a reasonable suspicion based on an informant's tip that defendant was carrying a concealed weapon. The &quot;stop&quot; was justified, its reason being a report of a concealed weapon. Concealed weapons present an immediate and real danger to the public which supports a police search on less than a probability.  The gun was admissible in evidence against defendant.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, members of a county board of elections, challenged the order from the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the Second Judicial Department (New York), which reversed, on the law, a trial court's judgment dismissing respondent town electors' complaint. The appellate court had remanded for a judgment declaring that a town proposition was not legally submitted to the voters and was therefore not effective.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A proposition submitted to the town electors at their last general election was carried by a slender margin. The proposition would have changed the town board from a body, all of whose members were elected at large, into one of representatives elected by districts. The intermediate court of appeals nullified on the vote on the ground that the proposition was not submitted in the manner required by law, because the proponents of the proposition failed to publish notice by publication and posting on the town signboard, as required by N.Y. Town Law &sect; 82. The members argued that the town clerk's failure to comply with &sect; 82 was not fatal, while the electors contended that the trial court had properly declared the vote null and void. The court held that: (1) statutory requirements of notice by publication and posting for the submission of propositions were mandatory and actual notice or substantial equivalence were acceptable substitutes; (2) the election was void because the electors did not receive notice of the time and place of the election; and (3) the legislature, not the courts, must determine how each notice shall be given. Accordingly, the court affirmed the order.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed, without costs, the order rendered by the intermediate court of appeals, which reversed the trial court's judgment dismissing the town electors' complaint and remanded for a judgment declaring that the proposition was not legally submitted to the voters and was not effective.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. A proposition which would have changed the town board from a body, all of whose members are elected at large, into one of representatives elected by districts was submitted to town electors and carried by the margin of 191 votes out of about 72,000 votes cast. The Appellate Division properly nullified the vote on the ground that the proposition was not submitted in the manner required by law.  Section 82 of the Town Law requires that, before propositions may be submitted to the electorate, there must have been notice by publication and posting on the town signboard.  There was no attempt of any kind at posting or publication.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Statutory requirements of notice by publication and posting for the submission of propositions are mandatory, and actual notice or substantial equivalences will not be acceptable as a substitute unless there has been, in fact, some posting and publication to satisfy the statute.  All other statutory requirements to make elections effective, convenient, or even just more efficient, are generally treated as directory only, with respect to which substantial equivalence will be acceptable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Publication and notice are not addressed to the general public as a practical matter.  These requirements, in a legal or jurisdictional sense, serve the same function as service of process,  including alternative forms of process, in the institution of litigation, or the requirement that tax rolls are to be on public view at the tax office, or that statutes must be promulgated to be effective as law.  Such preconditions should not be confused with actual publicity. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs supervisors sought review of an order of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the Third Judicial Department (New York), which affirmed a trial court declaratory judgment that the 1971 N.Y. Laws chs. 503, 504, were constitutional in so far as they barred the supervisors from joining a civil service association for public employees.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supervisors claimed that N.Y. Civ. Serv. Law &sect; 201(7) deprived them of the freedom to associate, was unconstitutionally vague, impaired their right to contract for insurance in violation of due process, and deprived them of equal protection. The board claimed that &sect; 201(7) was constitutional and an appropriate exercise of the state's power to regulate public employees. The court affirmed the appellate court's order declaring &sect; 201(7) to be constitutional and held that the state had a legitimate purpose in regulating the conduct of the public employees and that the supervisors fit the definition of supervisors in &sect; 201(7) and was similar to the definition in 29 U.S.C.S. &sect; 152(11), which was sufficiently detailed to withstand the vagueness challenge. The court further held that there was no constitutional right to be a public employee and when the supervisors agreed to become public employees they consequentially agreed to abide by the statutory provisions that regulated their conduct, including prohibiting them from joining an association, with which the state must bargain.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the appellate court order, which affirmed the state court declaratory judgment, which held that the civil service requirements that the supervisors could not join a bargaining association was constitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Civil service -- exclusion of managerial personnel from collective bargaining -- provision of Civil Service Law adopted in 1971 (L. 1971, ch.  503, &sect;&sect; 4, 16; ch. 504, &sect; 1) that &quot;managerial&quot; and &quot;confidential&quot; personnel may not be members of or hold office in organization which represents or seeks to represent public employees is valid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The provision of the Civil Service Law, which was adopted in 1971 to provide for designation of certain public employees as &quot;managerial&quot; and &quot;confidential&quot; and to provide that they may not be members of or hold office in any organization which represents or seeks to represent public employees (L. 1971, ch. 503, &sect;&sect; 4, 16; ch. 504, &sect; 1), is valid.  The exclusion of managerial personnel from collective bargaining rights has long been permitted by statute and decisional law affecting private employment.  The need to have responsible management personnel to formulate policy and to handle labor relations is equally applicable to the State in its capacity as an employer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The language of section 201 (subd. 7) of the Civil Service Law, defining managerial and confidential employees, is similar to the Federal statute, which has been upheld, and is sufficiently detailed to withstand attack for vagueness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Plaintiffs' contentions that insurance contract rights would be impaired are not persuasive.  Those contracts were entered in contemplation that the State had continuing power to legislate on matters affecting public employees (see 9 N. Y. Jur., Constitutional Law, &sect; 270).  Participation in the insurance plans was made contingent on continued association membership.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The statute will not impair the association's previous collective bargaining agreement with the State.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. There has been no showing that exclusion of management personnel from association membership is an unreasonable limitation on State employees.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants appealed decision from the Appellate Term of the Supreme Court in the First Judicial Department (New York), affirming their conviction of a violation of N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 235.05 by selling obscene material.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Both defendant booksellers were convicted of selling obscene material as the trial court found scienter from actual knowledge and the statutory presumption of knowledge, found in N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 235.10. The court below affirmed and defendant sought appeal, claiming that the court erred in failing to grant their motion for judgment as the state had presented no evidence that they actually knew the contents of the magazines they sold. The court, in affirming the decision, held that the presumption of knowledge found in the statute was valid as it was amply supported by the probabilities that they knew what they were selling. The court also found that the presumption did not place an impermissible burden on free speech.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the decision as it found that the statutory presumption that defendants knew what they were selling was valid based on the probabilities.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- obscenity -- rebuttable presumption, that one who sells obscene material in course of his business knows its character (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Penal Law, &sect; 235.10</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">, subd. 1), is valid and constitutional when applied to &quot;hardcore&quot; obscenity -- defendant who introduces evidence after court fails to grant his motion to dismiss at close of People's case may supply evidence needed for People's case -- managers of bookstore who personally sold many copies of obviously obscene magazine were properly convicted of obscenity (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Penal Law, &sect; 235.05</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Two bookstores, each of which stocked and sold large quantities of legitimate books and periodicals, also displayed and sold an issue of an &quot;Adults Only&quot; so-called comic cartoon magazine which was found obscene. Each store had a manager who personally sold about 25 copies of this contraband. The trial court properly found, chiefly from the defendants' own testimony, that they knew the obscene content and character of the magazine they were selling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. When the trial court, by reserving decision or otherwise, fails to grant the defendant's motion for a dismissal at the close of the People's case, and the defendant then introduces evidence, the defendant may supply a deficiency in the People's case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. In a criminal case, it has always been a permissible inference of fact, based on human probabilities, that a possessor of contraband knows its contraband nature.  Of course, the inference is rebuttable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The statutory presumption, that a person who sells obscene material in the course of his business knows its content and character (Penal Law, &sect; 235.10, subd. 1), is likewise supported by rational connection and human probability and is likewise rebuttable by evidence, and, when applied to a sale of &quot;hardcore&quot; obscenity, the presumption does not unduly inhibit constitutional freedom of expression, but rather is valid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Accordingly the two managers of bookstores were properly convicted of obscenity (Penal Law, &sect; 235.05).  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, the Commissioner of Education of the State of New York (commissioner) and an acting principal, sought review of a decision of the Supreme Court in Albany County (New York), which, in a N.Y. C.P.L.R. art. 78 proceeding and a prior nonfinal order of the appellate division, annulled her appointment, under N.Y. Educ. Law &sect; 2573 (5) and N.Y. Const. art.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent board of education sought to annul the commissioner's order requiring it to promote the acting principal to a permanent position. The commissioner contended that the acting principal had served 11 years, and she was entitled to the promotion even though she had not passed the required examination for licensing as principal. The commissioner filed a motion to dismiss for insufficiency on the ground that the acting principal had served in excess of the three-year probationary period and that she had acquired tenure under N.Y. Educ. Law &sect; 2573 (1). The trial court, agreeing with the commissioner, granted his motion. The appellate division reversed, holding that the determination was purely arbitrary, and it was in direct contravention of N.Y. Const. art. V, &sect; 6, which required appointment according to merit and fitness ascertained by competitive examination. On remittance to the trial court, the appointment was annulled upon a finding that the pleading raised no issues of fact or legal defenses. The court affirmed, concluding that service under the acting assignment did not satisfy or fulfill the probationary period requirement and that the appointment was contrary to &sect; 6.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the annulment of the acting principal's promotion to principal in a proceeding in which the board challenged her appointment on the ground that she had failed the civil service exam and therefore was not qualified for the position.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. A person who had been serving as a licensed assistant principal of a junior high school was appointed &quot;acting&quot; principal of a day elementary school in 1961 under a temporary appointment. On several occasions, she took and failed to pass an examination for principal of a day elementary school. The Commissioner of Education was in error in directing the Board of Education to grant her a permanent appointment as principal.  The provision in the New York Constitution (art. V, &sect; 6) that appointments shall be &quot;according to merit and fitness to be ascertained, as far as practicable, by [competitive] examination&quot; may not be avoided.  A civil servant may not be appointed without the required examination to a higher position than his license or title calls for upon the basis of his satisfactory performance during temporary or &quot;out-of-title&quot; service in such higher position.  The Commissioner acted in a purely arbitrary manner.  His determination was therefore properly annulled despite the provisions of section 310 of the Education Law.</SPAN></P>

Although persons who have served a &quot;probationary term&quot; in a position to which they have been appointed are thereupon &quot;entitled to receive permanent appointments&quot; and the tenure which attaches thereto ( Education Law, &sect; 2573, subd. 5), an appointment may only be made by the Board from an eligible list of those who have passed a competitive examination. The appointment to an &quot;acting&quot; capacity of a person who has not passed an examination is not the &quot;appointment&quot; envisaged by the statute.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant county social services commissioner sought review of the decision of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of the Fourth Judicial Department (New York), which reversed the decision of the trial court that had granted respondent state social services commissioner's motion for summary judgment, and which directed the county commissioner to provide public assistance benefits to striking union workers.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The union went on strike against the telephone company. Several of the workers filed for public assistance, registering as required by N.Y. Soc. Serv. Law &sect; 131(4). The county commissioner brought an action in the trial court against the state social services commissioner, seeking confirmation of his determination denying assistance to the striking workers. The county commissioner filed a motion for summary judgment. The trial court granted the motion in favor of the county commissioner. The appellate court reversed the decision of the trial court. On the county commissioner's appeal, the court affirmed the decision of the appellate court. The court determined that N.Y. Soc. Serv. Law &sect; 131 provided that persons who registered and held themselves out as available for employment were eligible for public assistance, and this included persons on strike if they were &quot;unable to maintain themselves&quot; within the sense of &sect; 131 and otherwise complied with the provisions of that statute.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Social services -- benefits to strikers -- persons on strike may obtain public assistance (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Social Services Law, &sect; 131</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">) -- person on strike does not &quot;refuse&quot; employment (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Social Services Law, &sect; 131</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">, subd. 4) -- such payment to strikers is not subsidization of strike and does not constitute </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">unconstitutional</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> interference with free collective bargaining.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Shortly after commencement of a strike, certain members of local unions applied for public assistance and their applications were denied.  In an action by the County Commissioner of the Department of Social Services against the State Commissioner seeking confirmation of this determination, the Appellate Division properly directed plaintiff to pay public assistance benefits to the striking workers who were eligible therefor.  It stated that, immediately prior to the 1971 amendment to subdivision 4 of section 131 of the Social Services Law, strikers were eligible to receive public assistance provided that they registered with the State employment office and did not refuse any new employment opportunities and that the amendment to subdivision 4 does not affect their rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Under subdivision 4, as it read prior to 1971, a person on strike was an &quot;employable person&quot; and ineligible for public assistance if he &quot;refused to accept employment in which he is able to engage.&quot; A person on strike does not, simply because he is on strike, &quot;refuse&quot; to accept employment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The amendment of subdivision 4 may be regarded as legislative approval of the administrative construction long accorded section 131 by the State Commissioner, sanctioning assistance payments to strikers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The payment of welfare benefits to needy strikers may not be regarded as the equivalent of State subsidization of the strike in violation of the State's policy of neutrality in labor-management disputes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Plaintiff contends that a striking worker should be ineligible for assistance, since, it being likely that he will return to his &quot;struck&quot; employer at the conclusion of the strike, he has in effect refused to accept any other employment.  However, applicants for assistance in the present case have registered for other employment as required by subdivision 4, and there is no evidence that they have failed to attend job interviews or refused referrals or refused to accept an offer of employment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. Granting public assistance to strikers does not constitute an unconstitutional interference with the system of free collective bargaining prescribed by the Federal Government.  </SPAN></P>

The court held (1) Pub. Serv.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. When the Public Service Commission temporarily suspends proposed rate increases filed by water companies, and temporarily allows lesser rate increases (5.5% in these two cases), and then finally grants rate increases (7.6% in one case, and 6.95% in the other case) which exceed such temporarily allowed rates, the Commission &quot;may&quot; or may not, in its discretion, make such final rates retroactive (Public Service Law, &sect; 113, as amd. by L. 1970, ch. 271; cf. &sect; 114).  This discretionary power in such case to grant or to deny &quot;appropriate reparation to the company&quot; (Public Service Law, &sect; 113, as amd.) is not confiscatory or violative of due process of law or of the equal protection of the laws; rather, it is valid and constitutional.  In each of the cases here involved,  the Commission's denial of &quot;reparation&quot; was not arbitrary or capricious or an abuse of discretion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. In fixing the final rates, the Public Service Commission refused to allow an estimated adjustment in operating income for estimated future taxes of some $ 200,000 on realty and on special franchises which would result from the construction of some new so-called &quot;backbone&quot; facilities which had not yet appeared on the tax assessment rolls; however, the Commission gave the utility company permission to apply, without further hearings, for a further rate increase on an expedited basis to cover such tax increases as soon as the amount of such taxes would become known.  This determination by the Commission did not violate due process, but rather was proper and constitutional.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional law -- redistricting -- reapportioning -- Legislature acted in substantial conformity with principle of equal population in redistricting and reapportioning State Legislature (L. 1972, ch. 11) -- integrity of counties preserved (cf. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">N.

III, &sect; 14) provision that no bill shall become law unless it is on desks of members for three days -- best available Federal census data used and constitutional requirement satisfied.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. In redistricting and reapportioning the State Legislature (L. 1972, ch. 11), the Legislature acted in substantial conformity with the principle of equal population.  In the Senate, the plan produces a total deviation from population equality of 1.82%; and in the Assembly, the deviation is 3.38%.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The Legislature has not unduly departed from the State constitutional command that the integrity of counties be preserved (N. Y. Const., art.  III, &sect;&sect; 4, 5).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The New York Constitution (art. III, &sect; 4) requires that Senate districts &quot;be in as compact form as practicable&quot; and &quot;consist of contiguous territory&quot; and (&sect; 5) provides that Assembly districts shall be formed from &quot;convenient and contiguous territory in as compact form as practicable.&quot;  These constitutional requirements must be harmonized with the principle of substantial equality of population among districts.  &quot;Contiguous territory&quot; means &quot;territory touching, adjoining and connected, as distinguished from territory separated by other territory.&quot; The requirement of compactness is a practical one but the term &quot;compact&quot; has no precise meaning.  Although some of the challenged districts are irregular in form, none are so aggravated or outrageous as would warrant the conclusion that the Legislature has completely departed from the constitutional standard.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The alleged gerrymandering of special interest groups -- racial, social, economic or ideological -- is too sensitive and significant an issue to be decided on this record.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. The procedure, admittedly complex, followed by the Legislature for adjusting the size of the Senate (cf. N. Y. Const., art. III, &sect;&sect; 3, 4) is valid and does not transgress any constitutional provision.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. There is no constitutional infirmity in the legislative method with regard to Bronx and Westchester Counties.  The legislative method takes into account that a portion of the Bronx belonged to Westchester in 1894, that in 1895 New York County annexed parts of Westchester County (L. 1895, ch. 934), and that in 1912 New York County ceded certain territory, including the territory annexed from Westchester in 1895, to form Bronx County (L. 1912, ch. 548).  Under the circumstances, the legislative determination is reasonable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. The State Constitution (art. III, &sect; 14) provides that &quot;No bill shall be passed or become a law unless it shall have been printed and upon the desks of the members, in its final form, at least three calendar legislative days prior to its final passage&quot;.  There was substantial compliance with the letter and spirit of the constitutional requirement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. The State Constitution states that the latest Federal census shall be &quot;controlling as to the number of inhabitants in the state or any part thereof&quot; for purposes of State legislative apportionment. (N. Y. Const., art. III, &sect; 4.) Although the court was free to direct discovery of the census data pending its decision on motions for dismissal and summary judgment ( CPLR 3214, subd. [b]), its failure to do so was not, under the circumstances, an abuse of discretion.  The best available 1970 Federal census data were used and the constitutional requirement has been satisfied.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State of New York enacted the N.Y. Laws of 1971 ch. 372.

The landlord brought an action to declare Local Law No. 7 invalid and unconstitutional. Unsuccessful in the courts below, the landlord filed an appeal to the court. While the appeal was pending, the city adopted N.Y. City Local Law No. 51 of 1972, which added N.Y. Real Prop. Tax Law &sect; 467-b, expressly authorizing the city to grant exemptions to senior citizens from rent increases if the city fully compensated the landlords for the losses occasioned by such exemptions. The court reversed the order of the appellate court and remitted the case to the special term court with directions to dismiss the complaint upon the ground that the issue presented was moot.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Chapter 372 of the Laws of 1971 sanctioned continued rent control in New York City, and prohibited the enactment of any local law controlling rents which contained provisions &quot;more stringent or restrictive&quot; than provisions &quot;presently in effect.&quot; The City of New York thereafter adopted Local Law No. 7 of 1972 which extended exemptions from rent increases previously granted (Local Law No. 31 of 1970) to eligible senior citizens for a further period of six months.  Plaintiff, a landlord, thereupon brought this action to declare Local Law No. 7 invalid and unconstitutional on the ground that it violated chapter 372 of the Laws of 1971.  While the appeal was pending from an adverse decision, the city, pursuant to chapter 689 of the Laws of 1972, adopted Local Law No. 51 of 1972 which replaced and superseded the earlier local law (Local Law No. 7 of 1972), and thereby rendered academic and moot the only question presented on the appeal.  Since that issue is not one that is likely to recur, there is no reason or justification for continuing to entertain the appeal.  The complaint should be dismissed.</SPAN></P>

The court remarks on the deleterious side effects which rent control, as administered by the city, has had on the maintenance of rental housing accommodations, and particularly on housing occupied by many of the elderly tenants affected by the exemption provisions involved in this case.  </SPAN></P>

The trial court disallowed a demurrer to the indictment upon finding the &quot;factual situation&quot; similar to that in People v. Radich, which had not then been decided by the court. The appellate division affirmed, finding that the legitimate public interest in preventing a breach of the peace and an outbreak of violence was threatened. Reversing the appellate division's decision and vacating defendant's convictions, the court found that there was nothing in the photographs, which concededly constituted the sole basis for the indictment, comparable in any substantial degree to the &quot;constructions&quot; in Radich and nothing that offered the likelihood of incitement to disorder and by public exhibition afforded an opportunity for protest and counterprotest with consequent potential of public disorder.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of an order from the Appellate Term of the Supreme Court in the Second Judicial Department (New York), which affirmed defendant's conviction under Village of Ocean Beach, N.Y., Ordinance art. II, &sect; 4 for not complying with a billboard regulation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant maintained four signs on his drugstore. He challenged his conviction for a violation of Village of Ocean Beach, N.Y., Ordinance art. II, &sect; 4, relating to commercial signs. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that the ordinance represented a valid and permissible exercise of the police power and that defendant's conviction thereunder was proper. The court held that the ordinance merely proscribed the erection and maintenance of commercial signs which, in the circumstances and setting, would be unnecessarily offensive to the visual sensibilities of the average person and would materially detract from the community and district pattern. The court denied defendant's equal protection claim, finding that the ordinance had been applied to other individuals as three other persons were convicted under the same ordinance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed appellant's conviction for violating a local ordinance dealing with billboard restrictions. The court found that the ordinance was a valid and permissible exercise of police power.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Municipal corporations -- erection of signs -- village ordinance, which provided that signs for existing commercial or business uses might not exceed four square feet in area, is valid and permissible exercise of police power -- defendant, registered pharmacist operating drugstore, properly found guilty of violating ordinance -- aesthetics is valid subject of legislative concern -- means adopted in ordinance reasonably related to community policy -- ordinance not unconstitutionally vague -- defendant failed to show conscious, intentional discrimination -- claim of discriminatory enforcement should be raised before trial by motion to dismiss prosecution upon constitutional</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> grounds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. A village ordinance provided that signs within the village for existing commercial or business uses might not exceed four square feet in area.  Defendant, a registered pharmacist operating a drugstore, who maintained four signs on his drugstore, each one exceeding four square feet in area, was properly found guilty of violating the ordinance. The ordinance represents a valid and permissible exercise of the police power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Aesthetics is a valid subject of legislative concern.  Concededly, this ordinance was motivated by aesthetic considerations.  The means adopted in this ordinance are reasonably related to the community policy and are not unduly oppressive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Defendant's business is largely a commercial enterprise and its essential character is not affected merely because, on occasion, first aid is administered there.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. In this case, the claim of discriminatory enforcement was raised by a motion to dismiss the information at the close of the People's direct case.  The claim of discriminatory enforcement should not be considered as an affirmative defense to the criminal charge, to be determined together with the issue of guilt by the trier of fact, but, rather, should be addressed to the court before trial as a motion to dismiss the prosecution upon constitutional grounds.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner candidate sought review of the order from the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the First Judicial Department (New York), which reversed the judgment from the trial court directing respondent Secretary of State to conduct a drawing to determine all candidates' positions on the ballot, and dismissed the proceeding.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The candidate filed a proceeding against the Secretary under N.Y. Elec. Law &sect; 330. The trial court directed the Secretary to conduct a drawing to determine the position on the ballot, where appropriate, of the vertical and horizontal columns of candidates. On appeal, the intermediate appellate court reversed the trial court's judgment and dismissed the proceeding. On further appeal, the court affirmed the intermediate appellate court's order. The court held that the Secretary's manner of listing the candidates on the ballot was not arbitrary or unreasonable. The Secretary properly denied the candidate's request to have the order of the names of all candidates determined by lot, because displacement on the ballot would have been prejudicial to the candidates of the other parties whose ballot positions were fixed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the intermediate appellate court's order reversing the judgment from the trial court and dismissing the proceeding under the election law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Elections -- position on ballot -- in election for Judge of Court of Appeals, there being three vacancies, Secretary of State listed political parties in accordance with number of votes in last gubernatorial election and Republican candidates in order of certification; candidates of other parties were listed in such way as to guarantee that no name was placed in different column; such manner of listing was neither arbitrary nor unreasonable -- since exercise of right to draw lots for position, granted by Election Law, would prejudice other candidates and render possible malfunction of voting machines, Secretary of State properly denied request of one Democratic candidate for drawing of position by lot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Each of the major political parties nominated three candidates for three vacancies for Judge of the Court of Appeals.  The Secretary of State listed political parties on the ballot in accordance with the number of votes cast in the last gubernatorial election and Republican candidates were positioned in the order of their certification to the Secretary of State, the candidates of the other parties being listed in such a way as to guarantee that no name was placed in a different column. This manner of listing was neither arbitrary nor unreasonable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The right, granted by subdivision 1 of section 104 of the Election Law to a candidate to request that ballot position be determined by lot where two or more candidates are nominated by one party for an office to which two or more persons are to be elected, is impaired whenever its exercise might work a displacement on the ballot prejudicial to the candidates of other parties or would otherwise effect a violation of section 248 of the Election Law or any other provision thereof.  Accordingly petitioner, a Democratic candidate who received Conservative Party indorsement and who requested a drawing by lot was properly denied it.  Difficulties would develop from the exercise of that right, prejudicial to other candidates which would not be obviated by use of a fourth column, since section 248 of the Election Law limits the number of columns or rows to the number of candidates to be elected. Moreover, inherent limitations on the voting machines as well as the prospect of malfunction require that the name of a particular candidate always appear in the same column. Additionally,  since petitioner acquiesced in having his name, as a Conservative Party candidate, placed in the third column, the Secretary of State was justified in keeping his name, as a Democratic nominee, in the same column. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was adjudicated a person in need of supervision (PINS) pursuant to N.Y. Fam. Ct. Act &sect; 712(b). The statute defined persons in need of supervision as males less than 16 and females less than 18 persons who were incorrigible, ungovernable, or habitually disobedient and beyond lawful control of the other authority. Appellant challenged the statute as violating due process for being unconstitutionally vague, and for unconstitutionally discriminating against females. The court reversed the order. The court concluded that the statute was sufficiently definite, but the age-sex distinction was unjustified, and that section of the statute had to be stricken as unconstitutional. The object of the PINS statute was to rehabilitate and treat young persons. There was no reasonable ground for differentiating between males and females over 16 and under 18. The imputation was that females who engaged in conduct, sexual or otherwise, ought more to be censured and their conduct subject to greater control and regulation than that of males.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Order placing appellant on probation was reversed because the statutory age-sex distinction was not justified and had to be stricken as unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional law -- discrimination on account of sex -- Family Court Act (&sect; subd.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The Family Court Act ( &sect; 712, subd.

The terms, &quot;habitual truant,&quot; &quot;incorrigible,&quot; &quot;ungovernable,&quot; &quot;habitually disobedient and beyond * * * law control&quot; are sufficiently definite to render the statute constitutional.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The statute does, however, unconstitutionally discriminate against females. The fact that the statute seeks to provide rehabilitation and treatment for young persons who engage in the sort of conduct there proscribed affords no reasonable ground for differentiating between males and females over 16 and under 18.  A girl of 16 or 17 may not be subjected to a possible loss of liberty for conduct which would be licit for 16 and 17-year-old boys.  So much of section 712 (subd.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother brought a filiation proceeding to determine that the father was the parent of her child born out of wedlock and to require that he support the child. The father offered proof by three of his fellow students at the college petitioner and he attended that each had had sexual intercourse with petitioner during the period within which conception could have occurred. Because this testimony was without corroboration it was excluded. The father was determined to be the parent. The judgment was affirmed on appeal and the father sought further review on constitutional grounds. The court held that: (1) N.Y. Fam. Ct.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants appealed orders of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the Fourth Judicial Department (New York), which affirmed in part and reversed in part judgments of the county court, which convicted defendants on several counts of obscenity in violation of N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 35.05 and denied their motion to suppress the material on which the judgments rested.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A judge issued a search warrant authorizing a search of defendants' premises for magazines and photographs alleged in a police affidavit to have been obscene material. The search warrant did not name or otherwise describe the magazines referred to in the supporting affidavit, but permitted the police to search for and seize a wide range of material. The police seized material and arrested defendants. The trial court convicted defendants of several counts of obscenity in violation of &sect; 35.05. The appellate court affirmed the convictions as to two counts and reversed the judgments on the remaining counts. The court reversed the orders of the appellate court, dismissed the remaining counts of the indictment and granted defendants' motion to suppress the material on which the judgments rested. The court found that the police seizure was judicially unsupervised. The court held that the judge was required to have decided preliminarily if the particular material on which he was asked to authorize seizure was obscene and that that decision should not have been left open to the judgment of the police.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the orders of the appellate court, which affirmed in part and reversed in part judgments of the county court, which convicted defendants on several counts of obscenity.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- obscenity -- search warrant -- defendants' convictions were based on magazines not described in search warrant or underlying affidavit and not before Judge who had issued warrant -- they were seized on judgment of police executing search warrant -- determination whether particular material is obscene must not be left to judgment of police -- indictment dismissed -- search and seizure</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> not justified as incident to lawful arrest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. On an affidavit by a police officer stating that defendants at their book store possessed &quot;obscene material&quot;, a search warrant was issued authorizing a search of the premises of defendants.  It did not name or otherwise describe the magazines referred to in the supporting affidavit, but permitted the police to search for and seize any material which depicted &quot;scenes of nude persons&quot; and which &quot;expose the female and male genital organs, the female and male pubic areas, including the male penis and the female breasts&quot;.  Defendants' convictions were based on two magazines which were not described in the search warrant or in the underlying affidavit, and, therefore, were not before the Judge who had issued the warrant.  They were seized, rather, on the judgment of the police executing the search warrant that they violated section 235.05 of the Penal Law. A Judge must decide preliminarily whether the particular material on which he is asked to authorize seizure is obscene and this must not be left open to the judgment of the police.  The indictment should be dismissed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. While a warrant of arrest had been issued for defendants for selling four named and described magazines, these magazines were not the ones on which the present convictions rest.  As to those that were described in the warrant of arrest, there has been either a dismissal or no conviction.  Thus, either the police seized the material on which these convictions are based exercising their own judicially unsupervised judgment under a general search warrant as to what is obscene within the statute; or in making arrests under a warrant concerned with entirely different publications and material, they made a similar unsupervised judgment in seizing other material unrelated to that arrest on which these convictions are based.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The procedure followed by the police here is such that it is unnecessary to reach the question whether the two publications are obscene within a constitutionally permissible construction of the New York statute.  </SPAN></P>

The Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the First Judicial Department (New York) affirmed the trial court's judgment. The tenants appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The tenants occupied a residential building. Pursuant to the RSL, the landlords executed a plan of cooperative organization to convert the rental units to co-operative ownership. A percentage of the tenants had to agree to join in the plan. The tenants alleged in their petition that New York City, N.Y., Admin. Code ch. 51, &sect; YY51-6.0(c)(9) was unconstitutional and that the city officials acted arbitrarily in approving the plan of cooperative organization. The trial court ruled that the constitutional issue could not be determined in a N.Y. C.P.L.R. &sect; 78 proceeding and that the city official's actions were not arbitrary. The appellate division affirmed without opinion. On appeal, the court held that: (1) in an effort to determine the whether a cause for complaint had been stated the trial court should have treated the complaint as a declaratory judgment action and addressed the constitutional issue; (2) New York City, N.Y., Admin. Code ch. 51, &sect; YY51-6.0(c)(9)(a) was constitutional; and (3) the RSL did not limit a more extensive right, but granted the tenants a limited right that they did not have before.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the decision from the appellate court that dismissed the tenants' petition.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Landlord and tenant -- rent regulation -- conversion to co-operative ownership -- in CPLR article 78 proceeding by tenants in building where plan to convert to co-operative ownership has been presented, Special Term should have considered tenants' claim that section YY51-6.0 of Rent Stabilization Law, under which landlord refused to execute renewal leases, was </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">unconstitutional</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> -- since parties briefed issue, Court of Appeals will consider it without remand therefor to Special Term -- Rent Stabilization Law, which gave tenants limited right</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> to renewal, subject to exception where plan for conversion has been presented, effective upon purchase of apartments by 35% of tenants, is constitutional.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. In a CPLR article 78 proceeding by tenants in a building where a plan of co-operative organization has been presented to convert it to co-operative ownership, Special Term should have taken cognizance of petitioners' claim that section YY51-6.0 of the Rent Stabilization Law (RSL) (Administrative Code of City of New York, ch. 51, tit. YY) pursuant to which their landlord refused to execute renewal leases, was unconstitutional.  While a proceeding under article 78 is not the proper vehicle to test the constitutionality of legislative enactments, since all necessary parties were before the court, under subdivision (c) of CPLR 103 it should have treated the proceeding as an action for a declaratory judgment to test constitutionality and proceeded accordingly.  Since CPLR 3017 (subd. [a]) provides that &quot;[relief] in the alternative or of several different types may be demanded&quot;, the general rule, recognized in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Matter of Diocese of Rochester </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">v.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10"> Planning Bd</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. (1 N Y 2d 508), that a party cannot, in the same proceeding,  rely upon a statute or retain benefits thereunder and attack its constitutionality, is no longer viable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Since the corporation counsel and the other parties concerned with the co-operative plan have briefed the issue of constitutionality, remand to Special Term is not necessary and it is proper for the Court of Appeals to consider it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Prior to enactment of the RSL (Local Laws, 1969, No. 16 of City of New York; Administrative Code of City of New York, ch. 51, tit. YY), tenants possessed no rights to renewal leases. The enactment of the RSL granted them the limited right to renewal of leases, subject to an exception where a plan for conversion has been presented, effective upon the purchase of apartments by a certain number of tenants. Appellant tenants have no ground for complaint and the provision for conversion to co-operative ownership upon purchase by a minority (35%) of the tenants (&sect; YY51-6.0) is not unconstitutional.  Judgment is directed in favor of respondents declaring that section YY51-6.0 (subd. c, par. [9], cl. [a]) is constitutional.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, guardian of unborn children, sought a declaratory judgment to declare the 1970 abortion liberalization statute unconstitutional. The trial court granted a preliminary injunction against defendant hospital, ordering it to stop performing abortions. The intermediate court vacated the injunction and sustained the statute's validity. On appeal, the court affirmed, concluding that the issue of the litigation, whether unborn children were to be recognized as legal persons with a right to life, was not justiciable because it required only a policy decision. The issue was outside the law unless the legislature provided otherwise. It was the duty of the legislature, not the courts, to provide legal personality for the unborn, or to provide other protections.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The statute defining a &quot;justifiable abortional act&quot; and permitting abortion under stated circumstances (L. 1970, ch. 127) is not unconstitutional.  Children in embryo need not be recognized as legal persons or entities entitled under the State and Federal Constitutions to a right to life.  While unborn, and even unconceived, children have been recognized as acquiring certain rights or interests, unborn children have never been recognized as persons in the law in the whole sense.  Whether the law should accord legal personality is a policy question which, in most instances, devolves on the Legislature, subject to the Constitution.  The Constitution does not confer or require legal personality for the unborn; the Legislature may, or it may do something less, and provide some protection far short of conferring legal personality. </SPAN></P>

The affidavit and the warrant stated that the individual was overheard placing a call on the public telephone to an outside person. The next day another call to the same number included conversations about betting on sports events. Pursuant to the search warrant, the police entered the apartment and found papers indicating that the apartment was used for gambling. Defendant came to the apartment and was arrested. Defendant's motion to suppress was not granted and he was found guilty of possession of gambling records. In the second case, a warrant was issued and a conversation was intercepted relating to gambling. Evidence uncovered during the search led to defendant's arrest. That defendant's motion to suppress evidence was granted.

As to a known, convicted gambler named in an eavesdropping order, the supporting affidavit of the prosecutor showed probable cause to intercept conversations on said gambler's home telephone and on a public telephone in a telephone booth which the gambler was using.  On the basis of those intercepted conversations, a warrant was properly issued to search an apartment at a different address, which was obtained from the telephone company, and wherein was located the telephone to which the named gambler was making calls.  Pursuant to the search warrant, the police entered the apartment and found papers indicating that it was a wire room for large-scale gambling. While the police were there, a person who was not named in either of the warrants came to the apartment and opened the door with a key.  The police arrested him, and he was charged with possession of gambling records.  His motions to vacate the eavesdropping order and the search warrant and to suppress the evidence were rightly denied, and he was properly convicted. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from an order of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the Second Judicial Department (New York), which affirmed a denial of defendant's petition for a writ of error coram nobis.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of conspiracy, third-degree burglary, and first-degree grand larceny. The district attorney filed an information charging defendant with fourth-felony offender status. The lower court found that defendant's proof that counsel at a prior conviction did not represent him was not sufficient. Defendant was sentenced as a fourth-felony offender. Defendant filed an earlier appeal requesting resentencing on ground that the burden of proving the unconstitutionality of the prior convictions had been wrongfully placed upon him. The petition was denied. Defendant filed the present petition for a writ of error coram nobis, reasserting his claim that the prior conviction was not a constitutionally valid predicate conviction to support the fourth-felony-offender sentence, on the ground that he was not represented by counsel. The lower court denied the petition, and the appellate court affirmed. The court held that the burden of proof was properly placed upon defendant at the sentencing hearing. The court further held that, on balancing the evidence, the court could only conclude that defendant failed to carry this burden of proof.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent, a motion picture distributor, sought the recovery of motion picture license fees paid to the state between June 1959 and June 1965, when the applicable statutes were nullified. The Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the Third Judicial Department (New York) entered an order that affirmed a modified judgment in favor of the distributor. The modification consisted of increasing the award.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The distributor paid all but a trivial portion of the motion picture license fees without protest and had not otherwise ever resisted the statutory procedure for licensing or the payment of fees. Nevertheless, when the applicable statutes were nullified, the distributor brought suit. The distributor claimed that it was entitled to recover because the payments of the license fees were involuntarily made under duress. The state asserted that the payments of the license fees were voluntary. The court agreed with the state, holding that the distributor's payments were voluntary because they were made without protest or other action to resist the payments or to recover them. Thus, in the absence of protest at the time, the distributor was not entitled to recover the fees it paid just because in a collateral matter on grounds not applicable to it or ever raised by it, the applicable statutes had been declared null. However, because a small percentage of fees were paid under protest between March and June 1965, the matter was remanded so that such fees might be computed and recovery allowed.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Theatres and shows -- motion pictures -- licenses -- motion picture license fees paid without protest were voluntarily made and may not be recovered -- even if payment were coerced, State was not unjustly enriched and recovery is denied.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Motion picture license fees paid to the State without protest from June 10, 1959 to June 10, 1965 (except as to a small percentage paid under protest between March and June, 1965) when the statutes were nullified, were voluntarily made by claimant and may not be recovered. The fees were reasonable tariffs for motion picture licensing and the films were actually licensed</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. Even if the payment of the fees were involuntary or coerced, the State was not unjustly enriched.  The State received no benefit.  The fees defrayed the cost of the licensing program and did not produce revenue.  The funds were disbursed long ago and the State did not act tortiously or fraudulently.  The parties being equally innocent, recovery may be denied </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In companion cases, petitioner students sought review of decisions of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the Second and Fourth Judicial Departments (New York), which reversed the trial court decisions granting relief to the students in their proceedings to compel respondent board of elections to permit them to register to vote, and dismissed petitions which sought a declaration that N.Y. Elec. Law &sect; 151 was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The students were summarily denied the right to register to vote because they were residenced at their respective colleges or universities. One set of students filed an action to compel the board of elections to permit their registration. Relief was granted by the trial court, then reversed and remanded by the appellate court for proceedings pursuant to the election law. The other set of students filed actions seeking a declaration that N.Y. Elec. Law &sect; 151 was unconstitutional, which was dismissed by the trial court and affirmed by the appellate court. The court affirmed the appellate court in the first case, finding that the fact of residence was a subject of detailed inquiry which should have only been determine after the court has heard proof. With respect to the second case, the court found that those students should have also been afforded the opportunity to have their registrations challenged as statutorily prescribed, and remanded the case involving the second set of students for proceedings de novo in conformance with election law procedures.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the appellate court decision which reversed and remanded the trial court decision granting relief to the students in their proceeding to compel the board of elections to permit them to register to vote. The court modified the appellate court decision which dismissed petitions seeking declaratory relief and remanded them to the trial court for challenge proceedings consistent with the election law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Elections -- residence -- students -- in Palla v. Suffolk County Board of Elections, order of Appellate Division determining that issue of bona fide change in residence of students at university could not be determined by questionnaires but required court to hear proof, including swearing of witnesses and recording of testimony, affirmed -- in Matters of Bell and Gorenberg courts treated proceedings as for declaratory relief</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> only -- petitions included demand for judicial review -- matters remanded to Board of Elections for proceedings de novo -- statutory scheme for determining residence of students not violative of due process and right to equal protection -- Election Law ( &sect; 151), which provides procedure for determining residence of student, codifies traditional criteria for determining residence for voting purposes -- determination of residence is factual -- no special burden imposed on students -- classification reasonable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. In </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Matter of Palla </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">v.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10"> Suffolk County Bd. of Elections</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, petitioners, students at a university, were denied registration by the County Board of Elections on the ground that residence in a university dormitory did not qualify them to vote under sections 150 and 151 of the Election Law. Special Term, on the basis of questionnaires, found that residency was established by the petitioners, other than those who indicated recent registration in other districts.  The Appellate Division held that the issue of the bona fide change in residence could not be determined on the basis of the questionnaires but required a determination only after the court has heard proof, which contemplates the swearing of witnesses and recording of their testimony, and remanded the matter for further proceedings.  The order appealed from in this proceeding is affirmed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The procedures for challenging a prospective registrant for voting on the basis of residence are prescribed by section 171 of the Election Law and contemplate the use of sworn affidavits (&quot;challenge affidavits&quot;), which are calculated to provide necessary details.  Where the sworn answers satisfy a majority of the board of the applicant's right to be registered, they shall register the name as a voter; if not, they are required to point out to the applicant the qualifications which he lacks as a voter. In either event, provisions for a form of expedited judicial review of board determinations are set forth in section 331 of the Election Law. The &quot;challenge affidavit&quot; may be augmented by the use of any reliable device.  While a line of inquiry such as that initiated by the questionnaires was authorized, the function of such questionnaires would properly be confined to augmenting the &quot;challenge affidavit&quot;, not usurping its role.  Since the fact of residence is properly a subject of detailed inquiry, the issues of fact raised by the affidavits, as well as the inferences to be drawn, should be determined only after the court has heard proof.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. In </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Matter of Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> some of the petitioners had been refused the right to register, and some who had been previously registered were notified that their right to vote would be challenged on Election Day or that their registrations would be voided because of their residence at college dormitories. In </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Matter of Gorenberg</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, a class action on behalf of students at the university, declaratory relief was sought and also an order compelling the Board of Elections to register petitioners and those similarly situated.  The courts below elected to treat the proceedings as for declaratory relief and, in upholding the statutory scheme, dismissed the petitions.  The petitions included a demand for judicial review of an administrative act as well as a prayer for declaratory relief, and, on that basis alone, the board's determinations should have been annulled and petitioners afforded an opportunity to establish residence.  The matters should be remanded to the Board of Elections for proceedings </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">de novo</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The statutory scheme is not violative of the due process and equal protection clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment, does not violate the Voting Rights Act (U. S. Code, tit. 42, &sect; 1971), is not contrary to the Twenty-Sixth Amendment, and does not abridge the 18-year-old voting right.  The statutory scheme represents, at most, a permissible effort to insure that all applicants for the vote actually fulfill the traditional requirements of bona fide residence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5.  Section 151 of the Election Law provides that for &quot;the purpose of registering and voting no person shall be deemed to have gained or lost a residence by reason of his presence or absence * * * while a student of any institution of learning&quot;.  Residence, in turn, is defined in terms of domicile and is dependent upon the applicant's expressed intent, his conduct and &quot;all attendant surrounding circumstances&quot;.  The criteria which the Board of Elections may deem relevant in determining an applicant's residence for voting purpose (cf. subd. [c]) are an elaboration and codification of the criteria which have always been matters under the decisional law of the State properly considered in making a determination of one's residence.  In its operation and effects, the statute is entirely neutral.  Facts supportive of a student's change of residence for voting purposes, must be independent of his presence at the college for educational purposes.  The determination is a factual one, evaluated in terms of actual conduct, having in mind the statutory criteria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. Students do not bear such a special burden as to make the procedures under section 151 offensive to the equal protection guarantee.  The statute by its terms imposes no voter qualifications and withholds no constitutionally secured right.  The classification represents no more than a reasonable effort at assuring that applicants for the vote actually fulfill the requirements of bona fide residence.  The statute distinguishes between residents and nonresidents -- not students and other citizens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. The Board of Elections erred in summarily denying the petitioners' applications because of their student status.  In </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Gorenberg</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the determinations should be annulled and the petitioners afforded the opportunity of having their qualifications challenged as prescribed in section 171 of the Election Law. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant town boards challenged a decision of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the Second Judicial Department (New York), which reversed a special term's decision that denied appellee applicants' application for preliminary approval of a residential subdivision plant because of their failure to secure a special permit as required by Ramapo, N.Y., Zoning Ordinance &sect; 46-13.1.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The applicants argued that the primary purpose of the zoning ordinance was to control or regulate population growth within the town. In reversing and remitting to the special term for further proceedings, the court held that the ordinance involved proper zoning techniques, exercised for legitimate zoning purposes. According to the court, the ordinance advanced legitimate zoning purposes by assuring that each new home built in the town would have at least a minimum of public services in the categories regulated by the ordinance. Thus, the court found that the challenged ordinance was designed to promote the welfare of the town. The court determined that the existing physical and financial resources of the town were inadequate to furnish the essential services and facilities that a substantial increase in population required. Therefore, a rational basis for phased growth existed. Thus, the court found that the ordinance was not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed and remitted to the special term for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Municipal corporations -- zoning -- zoning ordinance which prohibits subdivision approval except where stated facilities or services are available, not </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">unconstitutional</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> -- enabling legislation (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Town Law, &sect;&sect; 261</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">263</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">) sufficiently broad -- purpose of ordinance is orderly growth, not exclusion -- subdivision rights are conditioned, not denied -- diminution in value of land not confiscation -- other appropriate uses permitted -- justiciable controversy presented.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.  Section 46-13.1 of the Town zoning ordinance prohibits subdivision approval except where the residential developer has secured, prior to the application for plat approval,  a special permit or a variance.  The standards for the issuance of special permits require the availability to the proposed subdivision plat of five facilities or services: (a) public sanitary sewers or approved substitutes; (b) drainage facilities; (c) improved public parks or recreation facilities, including public schools; (d) State, county or town roads -- major, secondary or collector; and (e) firehouses.  No special permit may issue unless the proposed residential development has accumulated 15 development points, to be computed on a sliding scale of values assigned to the specified improvements.  The purpose is to phase residential development to the Town's ability to provide the above facilities or services.  The board may issue special permits vesting a present right to proceed with residential development in such year as the development meets the required point minimum, but in no event later than the final year of the 18-year capital plan.  A prospective developer may advance the date of subdivision approval by agreeing to provide the necessary improvements.  Meanwhile, applications are authorized for a reduction of the assessed valuation.  The effect of these integrated efforts in land use planning and development is to provide an over-all program of orderly growth and adequate facilities through a sequential development policy commensurate with progressing availability and capacity of public facilities. The ordinance is constitutional.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. In enacting the challenged amendments, the Town Board has sought to control subdivision in all residential districts, pending provision of essential services and facilities.  Though zoning may not be invoked to further the general police powers of a municipality ( </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Westwood Forest Estates </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">v.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10"> Village of South Nyack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 23 N Y 2d 424), the challenged amendments are within the municipality's delegated authority to determine the lines along which development shall proceed, though it diverts that growth from its natural course.  Considered in terms of the enabling legislation, the amendments constitute proper zoning techniques, exercised for legitimate zoning purposes (Town Law, &sect;&sect; 261, 263).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The Planning Board has the right to refuse approval of subdivision plats absent improvements specified in Town Law ( &sect; 277), and the fact that it is the Town and not the subdividing owner who is required to provide improvements does not transform the scheme into an absolute prohibition.  Denial of subdivision plat approval invariably amounts to a prohibition against subdivision, albeit a conditional one (Real Property Law, &sect;&sect; 334-a, 335).  Whether it is the municipality or the developer who provides the improvements, the objective is the same; and, in either case, subdivision rights are conditioned, not denied.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The power to zone under current law is vested in local municipalities and the issues presented framed in terms of the parties' due process rights.  The general public interest requires, however, that those rights not be adjudicated independently of the rights of others &quot;in search of a more comfortable place to live.&quot; Measured under this standard, the ordinance nevertheless represents a first practical step, achieved without forsaking paramount social goals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Land use and development regulations are designed to determine the course of growth within a particular town or district.  Where those restrictions upon the beneficial use and enjoyment of land are necessary to promote the ultimate good of the community, and are within the bounds of reason, they will be sustained.  Nevertheless, zoning only directs growth; it cannot be used to further local efforts at exclusion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. The timing devices presently at issue have their purpose in preventing premature subdivision absent essential municipal services and to insure continuous development commensurate with the Town's obligation to provide such services.  Unlike proscribed exclusionary tactics, they do not freeze population at present levels, but seek to maximize growth and the efficient utilization of land.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. These restrictions, though substantial in nature and duration, are not absolute; and the restricted parcels may be put to profitable use within a reasonable time.  The amendments contemplate a definite term and in the interim the Town is committed to the construction and installation of necessary improvements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. The burden of holding restricted property is an ordinary incident of police power regulation and the fact that the restriction may result in a depreciation in market value does not render the underlying scheme unconstitutional, absent a showing that the measure is unreasonable in terms of its necessity or the diminution in value is tantamount to a confiscation. Diminution is a relative concept and, though its magnitude is an indicia of a taking, it does not, of itself, constitute a taking.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. Assuming that the restrictions here will remain in force for the life of the program, up to 18 years in certain areas, they do not amount to a confiscation. In the interim, the landowner is not deprived of either the best use of his land or other appropriate uses, still permitted in the various residential districts, including the construction of a single family residence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">10. The challenged amendments propose restrictions of a certain duration and founded upon estimate determined by fact.  The inference is permissible that within a reasonable time the subject property will be put to the desired use at an appreciated value.  Taken as a whole, then, the proposed restraints, mitigated by the prospect of appreciated value and interim reductions in assessed value, are within the limits of necessity and should be sustained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">11. The prescription for securing a special permit under the ordinance is mandatory, and were the scheme held unconstitutional, the ordinance could admit of no constitutionally permissible construction so as to require initial administrative relief to determine whether injury had occurred.  The attack by the subdividing owners is directed against the ordinance in its entirety, and the thrust of the petition and complaint is that the amendments operate to destroy the marketability of the subject parcels for residential use and thus constitutes a present invasion of the property rights of the complaining owners.  The alleged harm is thus immediate and is sufficient to raise a justicable issue.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff racing associations appealed a decision of the Supreme Court at Special Term in Albany County (New York) finding for defendant New York State Off-Track Pari-Mutuel Betting Commission and sustaining the constitutionality of defendant and the New York City Off-Track Betting Corporation Law, 1970 N.Y. Laws, ch. 143, 144, 145. The court found that the legislation was constitutional under N.Y. Const. art. I, &sect; 9.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff racing associations challenged the constitutionality of defendant New York State Off-Track Pari-Mutuel Betting Commission and the New York City Off-Track Betting Corporation Law, 1970 N.Y. Laws, ch. 143, 144, 145. Plaintiffs claimed that their property and financial interests in the gambling and horse-racing business were adversely affected by the off-track betting system. The court affirmed the lower court's decision finding that both defendant and the statute were constitutional pursuant to N.Y. Const. art. I, &sect; 9, noting that a state was empowered to collect revenue and that the statute fairly compensated racetrack owners for the use of their facilities. The part of the net revenues, which went to the participating municipalities was so closely tied to the interrelated financial dependence of the local governments on the state that the fiscal assistance through defendant was revenue for the support of the state government.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the lower court's judgment, finding that the statute and defendant New York State Off-Track Pari-Mutuel Betting Commission were lawful.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Horse racing -- off-track pari-mutuel betting -- Pari-Mutuel Revenue Law (&sect; 69-c), which imposes tax on off-track pari-mutuel bets, provides &quot;reasonable revenue&quot; for support of government within language of State Constitution (art. I, &sect; 9) -- revenues for support of municipal governments are for support of &quot;government&quot; within constitutional language -- Governor's certificate complied with constitutional provision for shortening time to permit consideration of bills (N.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Chapter 143 of the Laws of 1970 established the Off-Track Pari-Mutuel Betting Commission and chapter 144 created the New York City Off-Track Betting Corporation, and both were authorized to provide for off-track pari-mutuel betting. From an absolute constitutional prohibition on gambling (art. I, &sect; 9), a specific exception was made for &quot;pari-mutuel betting on horse races as may be prescribed by the legislature and from which the state shall derive a reasonable revenue for the support of government&quot;.  The Pari-Mutuel Revenue Law (&sect; 69-c) imposes a tax of one half of 1% on all off-track pari-mutuel bets. After operating expenses of the public benefit corporation conducting the system have been paid, 80% of the net revenues, up to $ 200 million, go to the participating municipality, and 20% to the State.  If they exceed $ 200 million, the State and the participating municipality each receives half (&sect; 69-c, subd.  4).  This distribution is a &quot;reasonable revenue&quot; for the support of government within the constitutional language. ( </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Saratoga Harness Racing Assn. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">v.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10"> Agriculture &amp; N. Y. State Horse Breeding Development Fund</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 22 N Y 2d 119, decisive.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Revenues which go to the support of municipal governments are for the support of &quot;government&quot; within the constitutional language. Fiscal assistance through a State agency to the political subdivisions of the State must be regarded as revenue for the support of State government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Article III ( &sect; 14) of the State Constitution postpones the enactment of bills for at least three days after copies are in final printed form on legislative desks.  That time lapse may be cut down if the Governor certifies to the Legislature &quot;the facts which in his opinion necessitate an immediate vote thereon&quot;.  In view of the imminence of adjournment, the Governor's certificate of April 19, 1970 complied with the constitutional requirement.  The request by the leaders of both houses to the Governor for a certificate shortening the time to permit consideration of the bill before adjournment was to make legislative action possible.  This is a compliance in terms and in spirit with article III (&sect; 14).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The off-track betting statutes do not deprive plaintiffs of property without due process of law. A gambling enterprise is prohibited by article I ( &sect; 9) of the State Constitution and operation of the gambling part of plaintiffs' business depends on legislative permission. This permission may be conditioned and the conditions altered from time to time according to the legislative view of fairness.  The Legislature should be able to reapportion the profit results of the gambling business, including the allocation of a greater share for public benefit. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant newspapermen sought review of a judgment from the Supreme Court, Appellate Division (New York), which dismissed their petition that sought to direct respondent judge to open the courtroom in a criminal prosecution to the public and press.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judge closed his courtroom to the newspapermen upon a motion by the defendant due to news articles that revealed prior criminal conduct of the defendant. The newspapermen challenged the dismissal of their petition and argued that the judge's order violated the First Amendment's guarantees of freedom of speech and of the press, and the Sixth Amendment guarantee of a public trial. The court determined that the judge's order closing the courtroom was aimed specifically at the news media and was intended to punish the newspapermen for what the judge characterized as &quot;contumacious conduct&quot; in disregarding his prior admonitions. The court held that the judge's threat of contempt and his order closing the trial because of the newspapermen's conduct had a deterrent effect on free discussion by the press. The court concluded that the judge's order was an unwarranted effort to punish and censor the press. The court held that the questions on appeal became moot when the trial ended and the requested relief would serve no purpose. The court ordered that the lower court judgment be modified to reflect that the petition was dismissed as moot.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court ordered the judgment modified to reflect that the newspapermen's petition was dismissed as moot.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- public trial -- constitutional law -- freedom of press -- because of disclosures in public press, and editorials critical of trial court for threatening contempt on newsmen, trial court granted motion of defense to exclude public and press from trial; newsmen were targets of order and have standing to challenge order of exclusion -- order had effect of denying freedom of press; no showing that order was needed to protect integrity of trial -- acquittal rendered questions academic but questions presented are of sufficient importance and interest to justify entertaining appeal -- order punished and censored press and would otherwise be reversed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. In articles about the defendant in a criminal action, newspapers reported that he had a criminal record and was reputed to have underworld connections.  The trial judge, respondent herein, stated that the articles were unfair and, after polling the jury and finding that no juror had read the articles, denied the motion by the defense for a mistrial but warned the news media that he would hold any reporter in contempt who reported anything other than what traspired in the courtroom. When, thereafter, articles and editorials were published in newspapers critical of respondent's threats of contempt, respondent directed that the courtroom be closed to the press and public.  Since petitioners were the direct targets of respondent's order, and their ability to comment upon the trial as professional journalists was thereby impaired, they have the requisite personal stake in the outcome of the controversy to give them standing to challenge the validity of that order.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The contempt power may not be utilized to impose punishment for the publication of out-of-court statements relating to a pending court proceeding, except where such statements are shown to present a clear and present danger or a serious and imminent threat to the administration of justice.  No such showing appears in this record. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 3. While respondent did not hold any reporters in contempt, his threat of contempt, followed by his condemnation of the subsequent newspaper articles and editorials as &quot;contumacious conduct&quot; and his order closing the trial because of such conduct had a deterrent effect on free discussion by the press.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Moreover, there was no support for respondent's conclusion that defendant could obtain a fair trial only if the courtroom was closed to the public and press.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Although termination of the trial rendered the appeal academic and moot, the questions presented are of sufficient importance and interest to justify entertaining it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. The conclusion that respondent's order was an unwarranted effort to punish and censor the press would ordinarily lead to a reversal. However, since the defendant has been acquitted and the questions presented became academic, the order is modified to the extent of dismissing the petition but only for that reason.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant adoptive parents sought review of a judgment from the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the Fourth Judicial Department (New York), which affirmed a judgment that denied the adoptive parents' N.Y. C.P.L.R. art. 78 petition for a determination that appellee department's denial of their application for adoption on the ground that they did not have a religious affiliation violated their constitutional rights.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The adoptive parents' application for adoption was denied by the department because they lacked a religious affiliation. The adoptive parents brought a N.Y. C.P.L.R. art. 78 proceeding against the department for a determination that the religious affiliation requirements were unconstitutional. The trial court found no constitutional violation but ordered the department to process the adoptive parents' application. The judgment was affirmed and the adoptive parents sought further review. The court affirmed the judgment and held that: (1) the religious affiliation requirements of N.Y. Fam. Ct. Act &sect; 116, N.Y. Soc. Serv. Law &sect; 373, N.Y. Dom. Rel. Law &sect; 113, conformed to N.Y. Const. art.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment that requirements that children be adopted by persons of the same religion as the child were constitutional and directed the department to process the adoptive parents' application for adoption, without costs.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional law -- free exercise of religion -- adoption -- article VI (&sect; 32) of New York Constitution and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">statutes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> adopted in conformity therewith, requiring that child be placed for adoption &quot;when practicable&quot; and &quot;consistent with the best interests of the child&quot; with persons of same religious persuasion as child, are not </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">unconstitutional</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> -- legislation</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> does not constitute establishment of religion and does not deny petitioners, whom the lower courts permitted to apply for adoption, right to free exercise of religion or equal protection of laws.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Article VI (&sect; 32) of New York's Constitution requires that a child shall be placed for adoption, when practicable, with persons of the same religious persuasion as the child.  The statutes, requiring religious conformity of child and adoptive parents &quot;when practicable&quot; ( Family Ct.  Act, &sect; 116, subd. [g]; Social Services Law &sect; 373, subd. 7; see, also, Domestic Relations Law, &sect; 113), were broadened to provide that such religious matching should be &quot;consistent with the best interests of the child&quot; (L. 1970, ch. 494).  Under the statutes, religion is one of many factors in the placement of a child for adoption, and placement in conformity with the religious wishes of the parents of the child, though desirable, is not mandatory. The challenged legislation places primary emphasis on the temporal best interests of the child.  These religious affiliation requirements of the statutes enacted in conformity with article VI ( &sect; 32) of the State Constitution are valid under the United States Constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Under the criteria which have developed to determine when there is a violation of the Establishment Clause, the constitutional provision and the statutes do not constitute the estabilshment of religion. The matching provisions fulfill a &quot;secular legislative purpose&quot; and reflect and preserve a &quot;benevolent neutrality&quot;  toward religion. They do not have the primary effect of advancing or inhibiting religion or of fostering an &quot;excessive government entanglement&quot; with church interests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Subdivision (e) of section 116 of the Family Court Act which defines the words &quot;when practicable&quot; does not support petitioners' claim of unconstitutionality. In applying subdivision (e) in the light of the provisions of subdivision (g), the court retains discretion to determine whether a particular placement is in the best interests of the child.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. There is no basis for the claim of the petitioners, to whom the courts below granted permission to file an application as adoptive parents, that the challenged legislation denies them the right to the free exercise of religion or creates an arbitrary classification which denies them equal protection of the laws.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner real estate broker challenged an order of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the Third Judicial Department (New York), which dismissed his N.Y. C.P.L.R. art. 78 proceeding to vacate respondent secretary of state's order suspending the real estate broker's license. The real estate broker challenged the wording of N.Y. Real Prop. Law &sect; 441-c as unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The real estate broker's license was suspended based on charges filed by clients who alleged that the real estate broker had exacted finders' fees that were excessive. The secretary of state found that the real estate broker had demonstrated untrustworthiness within the meaning of N.Y. Real Prop. Law &sect; 441-c. The real estate broker initiated a N.Y. C.P.L.R. art. 78 proceeding to vacate the suspension and to challenge the constitutionality of N.Y. Real Prop. Law &sect; 441-c as vague and indefinite. The appellate court dismissed the proceeding as academic because the real estate broker's appeal of his suspension was superceded by a subsequent order of revocation of his license. The court held that it was error for the appellate court to dismiss the real estate broker's appeal as academic where there were questions presented that were of general interest, substantial public importance, and likely to arise with frequency. The court held that &sect; 441-c was not unconstitutionally vague, that there was substantial evidence to reasonably conclude that the real estate broker demonstrated untrustworthiness, and that the secretary of state properly disciplined him by suspending his license.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order dismissing the real estate broker's appeal was modified to the extent of deleting the condition imposed by the secretary of state that limited fees the real estate broker could charge in future transactions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Brokers -- real estate brokers -- although CPLR article 78 proceeding sought review of suspension of petitioner's real estate broker's license only despite later revocation of his license, both orders are intertwined and, because of public importance, will both be reviewed -- proceeding is treated as action for declaratory judgment in order to determine issue of constitutionality -- </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">section 441-c of Real Property Law</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> is constitutional and word &quot;untrustworthiness&quot; therein is not vague --</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[**2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> petitioner was properly found to have demonstrated untrustworthiness for charging excess brokerage fees on apartment rentals -- imposition of condition that petitioner return excess fees as part of punishment on finding of untrustworthy conduct was valid exercise of respondents' power -- as to fourth client who forfeited, because of clause in lease, $ 311.85 representing security, rent and commission although she never took apartment, since respondents had approved such clause, it was improper to penalize petitioner for using clause and to compel full reimbursement; partial reimbursement of excess commission should have been ordered -- imposition of condition that future fees be limited to one month's rent was arbitrary and confiscatory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. A proceeding under CPLR article 78 was commenced to review the earlier suspension of petitioner real estate broker's license but not the revocation of petitioner's license which had been made later and 18 days before this proceeding's commencement.  The revocation and suspension orders were intertwined to such a degree so as to preclude adoption of a conclusion that the revocation order rendered the questions raised in this article 78 proceeding&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[**3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  academic.  In any event, a matter, although settled as between the parties, will not be considered academic when the underlying questions are of general interest, substantial public importance and likely to arise with frequency.  The questions presented in this appeal, particularly those which relate to the propriety of the conditions which respondents imposed in the suspension order, fall into this category and, it was error for the Appellate Division to dismiss the appeal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Article 78 proceedings are inappropriate vehicles to test constitutionality and the proper remedy is an action for a declaratory judgment. Since all necessary parties are before the court, the article 78 proceeding may be treated as an action for a declaratory judgment and the issue determined.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3.  Section 441-c of the Real Property Law is not unconstitutional.  The words &quot;demonstrated untrustworthiness&quot; are not vague.  The term is sufficiently certain to real estate brokers to apprise them of the scope of permissible activities and it is the standards of that calling which serve as the guide for their behavior.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Petitioner was properly found to have demonstrated untrustworthiness for his deviations from&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[**4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  these professional norms.  Evidence introduced at the hearing indicated that petitioner's fees were far in excess of what the local real estate board considered usual and he was unable to explain what special services were rendered to earn these fees.  Additionally, it was revealed that petitioner had no established formula or basis for the computation of commissions.  Although neither the real estate board nor respondents had authority to fix fees, the amount of the fees and their relevance to actual services were matters which were properly considered by respondents in evaluating the complaints filed against petitioner.  It was therefore proper to discipline petitioner by suspending his license.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Where a broker is disciplined because he demonstrated untrustworthy conduct by charging excessive fees which bear no relation to legitimate services, respondents may legitimately condition the suspension on the return of those excessive fees.  The reimbursement ordered in the case of three clients who complained was a valid exercise of respondents' powers, and petitioner has failed to effectively demonstrate any error in the manner in which they were imposed or in their amount.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. In&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[**5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the case of a fourth client who complained, the client never took an apartment because it was unavailable on the date promised but nevertheless was forced to forfeit $ 311.85 representing the security, rent and commission because a clause in the lease provided that no refunds would be made if the apartment were available within 30 days of the date promised. Since respondents had specifically approved this 30-day provision a few months previously, it was improper to penalize petitioner for using this clause and to compel reimbursement of the full sum paid.  However, in view of the finding that the commission exceeded the guidelines established by the Real Estate Board by some $ 86.98 and does not reflect unusual services rendered, a refund in that amount should have been ordered in the same manner as in the other transactions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. The imposition of an additional condition that in the future fees be limited to one month's rent was arbitrary.  Inasmuch as there is no statute authorizing the fixing of fees, brokers are entitled to commissions for legitimate services.  To arbitrarily limit future fees was confiscatory and placed petitioner in an uncompetitive position in the market place&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[**6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  as it would deprive him of compensation in situations where his services exceeded the norm.  </SPAN></P>

Section 78 of the Mental Hygiene Law, which provides for the involuntary admission to an approved hospital, for no longer than 30 days (shortened by regulation [14 NYCRR 62.2] to 15 days) of any person who is &quot;alleged to be in need of immediate observation, care or treatment for mental illness&quot; does not constitute a denial of due process.  Where immediate action is necessary for the protection of society and for the welfare of an allegedly mentally ill person, a person is not unconstitutionally deprived of his liberty so long as he is afforded an opportunity within a reasonable period to litigate the question of his mental illness and the proceedings by which he was confined. That opportunity is amply afforded by the statute.  One need not be violent or dangerous to be constitutionally confined&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[**3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  for a short period prior to notice and an opportunity to be heard.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.  Section 72 of the Mental Hygiene Law, which provides for admission of a person &quot;alleged to be mentally ill and suitable for care and treatment&quot; but also provides that admission can be had only on a certificate of two examining physicians accompanied by an application, made 10 days in advance of admission, from a relative, friend or specified official is not unconstitutional.  The procedure under that section is such that a mentally ill person, so committed and hospitalized, may not be said to have been deprived of his liberty without due process of law.  </SPAN></P>

On appeal the court held that: (1) the purpose of &sect; 600 was to regulate a lawful activity in the interest of public safety, (2) the self-reporting requirement was constitutional if its tendency to incriminate was only incidental and minimal, (3) leaving the scene of an accident was a true and substantial independent wrong meriting treatment as a separate criminal offense, (4) the self-reporting requirement under &sect; 600 was a valid exercise of the state's regulatory power and thus was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The issue in this case was whether chapter 462 of the Laws of 1970, which amended article 52 of the Education Law under New York law, was applicable to the city of Albany after July 1, 1971. The court found that consideration of the legislative history confirmed that the law was applicable to the city of Albany. The court found that the legislature demonstrated that its intent was not to divide the cities on the basis of population but, rather, to separate out article 52's six enumerated cities from the remaining cities of the state in order to accord them special treatment under the Education Law.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.  Section 2550 of the Education Law, contained in article 52 of the Education Law, declares that &quot;This article shall apply to the school districts of the following cities only: New York, Buffalo, Rochester, Syracuse, Yonkers and Albany.&quot; Article 51 applies to all other school districts of cities which in 1950 had a population of less than 125,000 inhabitants and to those school districts of cities incorporated thereafter.  By chapter 462 of the Laws of 1970, section 2553 of the Education Law, which is contained in article 52&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[**3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of the Education Law, was amended to make the Albany Board of Education elective, subject to a permissive referendum to be held at the general election in November of 1970.  The referendum was held and the voters approved the elective board.  Chapter 462 also provided that the first election of members of the board was to take place at the general election in November, 1971.  Chapter 492 of the Laws of 1970 became effective three days after chapter 462.  It provided that, in the case of a city which had a population of 125,000 inhabitants or more by the 1960 census and less than 125,000 by the 1970 census, the school district of that city should be governed by the provisions of article 52 until July 1, 1971.  Albany's population, according to the 1970 census, dropped below 125,000 inhabitants. Chapter 462 of the Laws of 1970 is applicable to the City of Albany after July 1, 1971.  The Legislature has indicated its intent that Albany be governed by the provisions of article 52 of the Education Law, regardless of any change in its population.  It is unreasonable to suppose that chapter 492, which became effective three days after chapter 462, repealed chapter 462.  Two classes of cities&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[**4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  are provided for, one class consisting of six cities including Albany, and the other consisting of all the other cities.  The Legislature demonstrated its intent to accord special treatment under the Education Law to the six enumerated cities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Chapter 462 is not unconstitutional.  It does not violate section 17 of article III of the State Constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The question whether chapter 462 violates section 4 of article VIII of the Constitution (dealing with a city's taxing and debt contracting powers) is not presented since no issue relating to Albany's taxing and debt contracting powers is involved.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a child custody action appellants, foster parents and an adoption service, sought review of an order of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the Second Judicial Department (New York), which reversed a trial court's order dismissing writs of habeas corpus filed by appellees, a mother and the New York Department of Social Services (Department). The appellate court sustained the writs and directed the return of the child.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The foster parents contended that they were entitled to custody of the child because they could provide better care for her. The court disagreed and affirmed the appellate court's decision, holding that the appellate court correctly determined it lacked power, absent abandonment of the child, statutory surrender outstanding, or the established unfitness of the mother, to deprive the mother of custody. The court held that since none of these factors was present the natural mother was entitled to obtain the custody of her child, and the child should have been returned to her mother. The court reasoned that the burden rested, not upon the mother to show that the child's welfare would have been advanced by being returned to her, but rather upon the foster parents and the adoption service to prove that the mother was unfit to have her child and that the latter's well-being required separation from her mother. The court determined that the foster parents were merely a temporary parent substitute and were not entitled to assert any further rights with regard to the child.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. A natural mother has the right to the custody of her child, in the absence of abandonment or an outstanding formal surrender of the child by her, or demonstrated unfitness. Accordingly, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[**2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  in a case where the natural mother of a child gave her to the New York City Commissioner of Social Services for temporary care, not for adoption, and the agency to whom he delegated the custody of the child placed her with a couple for compensated foster care, to be returned on demand, the latter were properly directed to return her to the agency for return of custody to the natural mother.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Although the mother had executed a statutory written surrender of custody and authorized the adoption of the child, the child was never placed for adoption and, when the mother demanded her return, the Commissioner, joined by the agency, consented to such return, thus nullifying the surrender, as if it had never been.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The fact that the mother may have made inadequate plans for the child's upbringing does not demonstrate unfitness, and there has been no serious effort to assert abandonment of the child by her.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, landlord and a membership corporation, appealed from an order of the New York County Supreme Court, which found certain rent control laws for the elderly were constitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In response to a housing shortage, New York City issued certain local laws governing the amount of rent that could be charged the elderly poor. The landlord and a membership corporation brought suit seeking to strike the legislation. They argued that the legislation resulting in a taking of property without compensation and that it was violative of the equal protection laws. The trial court disagreed and upheld the legislation. The court affirmed. The exemptions from the elderly poor did not render an impermissible taking of property or a denial of due process. Additionally, the legislation did not deprive plaintiffs of the equal protection of the laws. The legislation had a substantial relation to a legitimate public purpose, namely, the prevention of sever hardship to aging needy citizens resulting from the shortage of low and moderately priced housing accommodations.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the order that found certain rent control laws for the elderly were constitutional.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional law -- rent regulation -- New York City's Local Law No. 31 of 1970 (Administrative Code of City of New York, &sect; Y51-5.0, subd.  n), which exempts from rent increases provided by New York City's Local Law No. 30 of 1970 (&sect; Y51-5.0, subd. a, par. [2]) any tenant 62 years of age or older, not recipient of public assistance, with limited income, and which applies from August 1, 1970 to January 1, 1972, is valid exercise of police power -- exemption does not amount to taking of property without compensation -- </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">legislation</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> does not reduce rent but merely prohibits certain increases -- no denial of equal protection of law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. New York City's Local Law No. 30 of 1970 provided&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[**2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  for general increases in maximum rents (Administrative Code of City of New York, &sect; Y51-5.0, subd. a, par. [2]).  Local Law No. 31 of 1970 (&sect; Y51-5.0, subd.  n) exempts from such rent increases any tenant 62 years of age or older, not the recipient of public assistance, whose total annual income -- when added to that of other members of the household -- does not exceed $ 4,500, after taxes, and who pays more than one third of such income for rent. Special Term, noting that it &quot;only affects rent increases granted on or after Aug. 1, 1970&quot; and &quot;is due to expire on Jan. 1, 1972&quot;, properly upheld the legislation as a valid exercise of the police power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Plaintiffs are in error in arguing that the exemption amounts to a taking of property without compensation in that it &quot;effects a reduction in the rent of certain tenants at the expense of their landlords&quot;.  Local Law No. 31 calls for no reduction; it merely provides that, for a limited period, elderly tenants are to be exempt from certain rent increases.  They will be required to pay the same rent as before, established pursuant to the pre-1970 legislation which has been upheld as valid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Local Law No. 31 does not deprive the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[**3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  plaintiffs of equal protection of the laws.  The classification has a reasonable basis; it has a substantial relation to a legitimate public purpose -- the prevention of severe hardship to aging needy citizens resulting from the shortage of low and moderately priced housing accommodations. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was granted permission to appeal from a judgment of the Appellate Term of the Supreme Court for the Ninth and Tenth Judicial Districts in the Second Judicial Department (New York), which affirmed a judgment of a city court convicting defendant of bookmaking and possession of bookmaking records. The issue was whether certain recordings of defendant's voice as a result of a wiretap pursuant to court order were admissible.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The central issue was whether recordings of defendant's voice obtained as a result of a court-ordered wiretap were properly admitted at trial. The police secured a court order in 1966 authorizing them to intercept and record conversations over a telephone line they suspected defendant was using for bookmaking. A tape recording of his telephone conversation was introduced over his objection at trial. Defendant argued on appeal that the evidence obtained by wiretapping was constitutionally inadmissible. He also urged that the order authorizing the telephone interception violated &sect; 605 of the Federal Communications Act. The court affirmed, holding that the seizure was not unconstitutional by 1966 standards and thus the recordings were properly allowed into evidence. There was probable cause for the wiretap, and the affidavit in support of the court order specifically described defendant and his suspected gambling activities, including the specific location to be observed. Any deviation from constitutional standards announced after 1966 was held to be harmless in light of the overwhelming evidence against defendant. Neither defendant's constitutional or statutory rights were violated.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's convictions for bookmaking and possession of bookmaking records.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- wiretapping -- tape recordings of conversations on public telephone made on June 15, 1966 were properly admitted on defendant's later trial which resulted in conviction for bookmaking, despite invalidation of rule of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Olmstead v.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Tape recordings of conversations on a public telephone wherein defendant took several bets, made on June 15, 1966, although&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[**2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  defendant was convicted of bookmaking and possession of bookmaking records on July 31, 1969, were properly admitted in evidence.  At the time the tape recordings of the conversations were made the rule of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Olmstead </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">v.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10"> United States</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (277 U.S. 438) was applicable holding that a wiretap, conducted without a physical intrusion into defendant's premises, was not an unlawful search and seizure within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment.  At the time of the trial, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Katz </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">v.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10"> United States</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (389 U.S. 347) invalidated the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Olmstead</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> rule and prohibited the use of such evidence.  Since the evidence obtained by the wiretap was admissible when the wiretap was made, the recordings were properly allowed in evidence in the later trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Section 605 of the Communications Act of 1934 prohibits all tapping of telephone conversations. Evidence seized in violation of section 605 has been held inadmissible in Federal court but admissible in a State criminal proceeding. In </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Lee </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">v.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10"> Florida</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (392 U.S. 378), decided on June 17, 1968, evidence seized in violation of section 605 was held inadmissible in State criminal proceedings.  However, on June 19, 1968, Congress enacted the Omnibus&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[**3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 wherein it amended section 605 and authorized wiretapping. Under such amendment, the fruits of court authorized wiretaps are admissible in State courts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. In seizures made before the effective date of the Safe Streets Act, substantial compliance with its provisions is all that is required to bring the evidence within the newly-enacted exception in section 605.  Substantial compliance was present here.  The wiretap was obtained under judicial supervision, in full compliance with section 813-a of the Code of Criminal Procedure, with probable cause for the seizure clearly indicated.  There is no valid reason to exclude such evidence especially since the police acted in full compliance with both constitutional law and the statutory law of our State as it existed at that time.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The MTA determined and certified to the county the costs for operating, maintaining, and using the railroad stations in the county. The MTA brought an action against the county. The appellate division reviewed the submission of controversy upon an agreed statement of facts, pursuant to N.Y. C.P.L.R. 3222(1). The appellate division entered an order in favor of the MTA, finding its acted within the scope of its authority under N.Y. Pub. Auth. Law &sect; 1277, finding the statute constitutional, and making an award to the MTA, declaring the county liable for liability insurance and expenses, and the county not entitled to credit or offset for liens or additional revenues received by the railroad. On the county's appeal, the court affirmed the appellate division. The court determined that the statute did not violated the constitution because the MTA did not have taxing authority and was not a super-government, that the legislature provided only limited discretion to the MTA in fixing costs to be charged the county, and that the statute did not violate Home Rule because it had sufficiently state wide impact, N.Y.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant board challenged an order from the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the Second Judicial Department (New York), which affirmed the trial court's judgment for respondent owner in its action under N.Y. C.P.L.R. 78 to annul the board's zoning decision and obtain a permit to modify a building.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner's building complied with the zoning ordinance but was deficient in its provision of off-street parking and constituted a nonconforming use. The other properties in the area were also nonconforming. The owner applied for a permit to remodel garage space into office space, which would have had the effect of further decreasing compliance with the parking requirement. The board denied a variance and the owner brought a N.Y. C.P.L.R. 78 action against the board to challenge its decision. The trial court granted the requested relief and the board sought review. The court held that: (1) because the building was in compliance and the parking was the issue, the request should be treated as an area variance; (2) an area variance should be granted unless the board demonstrated a public health, safety or welfare need; (3) the public interest in decreasing traffic congestion was an ample public safety justification; (4) the owner then had the burden of showing that its hardship deprived it of any reasonable use of the property and amounted to a taking of the property; and (5) mere financial loss was not hardship.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the order that granted the owner the requested relief from the decision of the board. The court remitted the matter for further proceedings to dismiss the owner's petition without prejudice to any action for a declaratory judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Municipal corporations -- zoning -- applications for variances from zoning regulations which prescribe number of off-street parking spaces required for buildings are governed by rules for area variances -- Board of Appeals properly denied variance to petitioner for purpose of converting off-street parking spaces into office space; such</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> determination promoted public safety by decreasing traffic congestion -- constitutionality of zoning ordinance cannot be determined in article 78 proceeding -- petition dismissed without prejudice to commencement of action for declaratory judgment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Applications for variances from zoning regulations which prescribe the number of off-street parking spaces required for buildings are governed by the rules relating to area variances. Petitioner is seeking to convert 1,850 square feet of garage space to office space to be added to its office and apartment building, which is a permitted use.  While the change is not strictly one of area, the variance is to be treated as an area variance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Appellant Board of Appeals denied a variance to petitioner which would have created more income producing office space and would have removed off-street parking spaces below the number for which petitioner has a nonconforming use, although, under the zoning ordinance, the addition of the office space required more off-street parking spaces. Such denial was not an abuse of discretion. The board reasonably determined that further increases in the amount of square feet devoted to business use would be likely to result in traffic problems and that it was necessary to promote public safety by enacting and applying the ordinance. The courts below erroneously substituted their judgment for that of the board.  The board's determination did not deprive petitioner of any use of its property since it remains a valid apartment and office use.  That petitioner suffers a financial loss by denial of the variance does not constitute a hardship within the rule established by </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Matter of Fulling </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">v.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10"> Palumbo</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (21 N Y 2d 30).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. In this proceeding ( CPLR art. 78) the constitutionality of the zoning ordinance cannot be determined.  Petitioner's remedy is an action for a declaratory judgment. Although CPLR 103 (subd. [c]) gives the courts the power to treat an article 78 proceeding as an action for declaratory judgment, it cannot be done here because the village trustees must be parties to the proceeding and they have not been made parties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The petition is dismissed without prejudice to the commencement of an action for a declaratory judgment. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The police exhibited defendant to the complainant, who identified him as the culprit. Defendant argued that because the &quot;show-up&quot; exhibition was suggestive and, therefore, inadmissible under the rules laid down in a series of federal cases, the grand jury identification was &quot;inadmissible&quot; and that the people failed to present a prima facie case to the grand jury. The court held that evidence that was inadmissible because it was incompetent (for example, hearsay) was different from evidence competent prima facie, rendered inadmissible only by extrinsic, subsequent proof. For purposes of grand jury presentations, the evidence was competent until nullified. An indictment's proper purpose was to bring a defendant to trial upon a prima facie case, which, if unexplained, would warrant a conviction, N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 251. The identification testimony before the grand jury satisfied that purpose. Moreover, undoing the indictment would only result in resubmission to the grand jury. It would also ignore the significance of other evidence in the case, which corroborated complainant's identification, that made the victim's identification of less than the usual importance.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the Fourth Judicial Department (New York) affirmed an order and judgment of the trial court that granted the motion of defendants, county and company, to dismiss plaintiff taxpayers' amended complaint challenging the validity of a stadium project. The taxpayers appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The county entered into a contract with a company whereby the company agreed to operate a new proposed domed stadium as lessee in return for a percentage of the revenues. The taxpayers alleged that the contract violated provisions of the state constitution and effected a waste of county funds and sought to enjoin the county from permitting the stadium to be operated by someone other than county employees and to declare the contract null and void. The county and company moved to dismiss the taxpayers' complaint based on res judicata by another taxpayer's previous action. The trial court granted the dismissal, and the appellate court affirmed the judgment of the trial court. The taxpayers appealed on constitutional grounds. The court held that res judicata applied only to the matters actually litigated in the prior suit. The prior suit only raised questions of competitive bidding on the contract and res judicata did not prevent the trial court from passing upon the merits. The court ruled that the lease provided to the company by the county was in furtherance of a public and not a private purpose, and was not in violation of the state constitution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court's order affirming the trial court's dismissal of the taxpayers' complaint was affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Counties -- contracts -- validity -- contract executed by county, pursuant to act of State Legislature (L. 1968, ch. 252) permitting incurring of indebtedness in connection with building of stadium, was warranted by legislative act -- contract is in furtherance of public and not private purpose -- no loan or gift of property (N. Y. Const., art.  VIII, &sect; 1) -- in third taxpayers' suit regarding stadium, res judicata applies only to matters actually litigated in prior suit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Pursuant to an act of the State Legislature empowering Erie County to enter into contracts and incur indebtedness in connection with the building of a stadium (L.  1968, ch. 252), and a resolution of the County Legislature, an agreement was signed by the County Executive and one Kenford providing that Kenford would operate the stadium as lessee and would pay a stated sum to the county over a 40-year term. If the parties could not agree upon a lease within a stated time, then, it was agreed, they would execute a 20-year management agreement whereby Kenford would operate the stadium in return for a percentage of the revenues.  The lease or management contract was warranted by the act authorizing the county to build the stadium.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. By giving control over the stadium to Kenford, for either 40 years under the lease or 20 years under the management contract, the county did not convert the stadium into a private use for Kenford's benefit.  The purposes of the stadium are to &quot;furnish to, or foster, or promote among, or provide for the benefit of, the people of the county of Erie, recreation, entertainment, amusement, education, enlightenment, cultural enrichment&quot; (L. 1968, ch. 252, &sect; 2).  That the county may not itself be using the stadium is irrelevant to these purposes.  The county's residents will be obtaining the full benefit for which the stadium is intended.  The lease is in furtherance of a public and not a private purpose.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The fact that the bids submitted exceeded the amount authorized by the county does not render the litigation moot. Whether the county is absolved from any obligation to Kenford and whether its legislature was justified in rescinding the contract by unilateral action are questions which require a factual determination.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The lease here under attack may not be construed as a &quot;loan&quot; or &quot;gift&quot; of county property &quot;in aid of any * * * private corporation or association, or private undertaking,&quot; as prohibited by article VIII ( &sect; 1) of the State Constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. This is the third taxpayers' suit challenging the stadium project.  Upon considerations of policy in these taxpayers' actions, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">res judicata</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> applies only as to the matters actually litigated in the prior suit. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state appealed from an order of the Ulster County Court (New York), which dismissed eight separate informations in the form of Uniform Traffic Tickets that had charged defendants with violations of N.Y. Comp. Codes R. &amp; Regs. tit. 21, &sect; 103.1.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Each defendant was a driver of a charter bus and was charged in a separate information with violating &sect; 103.1 by driving a charter bus in a closed service area between Albany and New York City during a summer weekend. Defendants contended that closing those portions of the road violated the equal protection clause. The trial court dismissed the charges and the state sought review. On appeal, the court reversed the dismissal, holding that there was no constitutional violation because there was a reasonable basis for the exclusion of the charter buses from the service areas. The thruway authority had the right to exclude vehicles from an already crowded service area, and the choice of exclusion for only charter buses was rationally related to the fact that they brought a large crowd of people all at one time. There was valid authority and reasoning for the particular exclusion and accordingly, the charges should not have been dismissed. The matter was remanded for further proceedings upon reinstatement of the informations.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the lower court's dismissal of the informations charging the charter bus drivers with violation of the rule which excluded them from particular service areas during busy summer weekends. The court directed reinstatement of the informations and remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional law -- Thruway -- charter buses -- Thruway Authority in closing service areas between Albany and New York City to charter buses on summer weekends did not violate equal protection clauses of Federal and State Constitutions -- general regulations of Thruway Authority on file with Secretary of State sufficient -- further filing not required.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The actions of the Thruway Authority in closing service areas between Albany and New York City to charter buses on summer weekends do not violate the equal protection clauses of the Federal and State Constitutions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Each defendant, a driver of a charter bus, was charged in a separate information with violating section 103.1 of the Thruway Regulations ( 21 NYCRR 103.1), which provides, in part, that &quot;No person shall fail, neglect or refuse to comply with any * * * sign * * * erected or displayed by the Thruway Authority on the Thruway system&quot;.  The signs in question announced that the service areas between Albany and New York City would be closed to charter buses from midnight Friday to midnight Sunday during the heavily traveled summer months.  There is no violation of equal protection where the Authority, due to the overcrowding of facilities, restricted the use of those areas in order to protect the users of the facilities from injury and inconvenience. The charter bus companies were admittedly forewarned so as to allow them to make alternative plans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Moreover, the Thruway Authority has an affirmative duty to take action to alleviate dangerous conditions that it could foresee.  The action taken is both reasonable and consistent with its responsibilities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. There are on file with the Secretary of State pursuant to the requirements of section 8 of article IV of the New York State Constitution regulations allowing the Thruway Authority to close any part of the Thruway system to the public if dangerous conditions evolve and prohibiting any person from refusing to obey any sign or device erected by the Thruway Authority.  These parent or general regulations constitute sufficient authority and a further filing is not required.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><BR><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">DISPOSITION:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Judgment reversed, without costs, and matter remitted to Supreme Court, Dutchess County, for further proceedings in accordance with the opinion herein.  <BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Relator parolee appealed an order from the Supreme Court in Dutchess County (New York), which denied his petition for a writ of habeas corpus. The parolee argued that his due process rights were violated because he did not have the benefit of counsel at his parole revocation hearing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The issue presented on appeal was whether the parolee was constitutionally entitled, under the United States Constitution and the Constitution of New York State, to the assistance of counsel in his parole revocation hearing. Although most of the courts which passed upon the matter held that there was no such right under the Due Process Clause of the Fifth or Fourteenth Amendment, the court preferred the contrary view, expressed by a few courts, as well as by the commentators, that the right to the assistance of an attorney at the hearing was constitutionally mandated. Revocation of parole was a decision that deprived an individual of his liberty; as such, the decision turned on factual determinations. Therefore, it was necessity for the parolee to have the aid of counsel in marshaling the facts and introducing evidence of mitigating circumstances.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Accordingly, the order, which denied the parolee's petition for writ of habeas corpus, was reversed and the case was remitted to the Board of Parole for the purpose of conducting a hearing at which the parolee would be entitled to the assistance of counsel and permitted to call witnesses.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Parole -- revocation of parole -- right to counsel -- parolee has constitutional right to be represented by lawyer and is entitled to introduce testimony in parole revocation hearings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The demands of due process, under both the United States Constitution and the Constitution of the State of New York, require that a parolee be represented by a lawyer in parole revocation hearings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Although the United States Supreme Court has not considered whether a parolee has such a constitutional right in a parole revocation hearing, it has held that counsel must be afforded a defendant at a proceeding to revoke probation. The differences between the &quot;deferred sentencing&quot; procedure involved in two Supreme Court cases, probation revocation and parole revocation are not such as would militate against the need for a lawyer where revocation of parole results in the deprivation of liberty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The presence of an attorney and the receipt of testimony offered by the parolee need not prolong the hearing beyond the time necessary for the Board of Parole to ascertain the facts upon which it is to make its determination.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The failure of relator to request the assistance of a lawyer at his hearing did not constitute a waiver of his right to counsel. In the absence of competent legal assistance, he may not be precluded from arguing that he is entitled to a lawyer because he did not know enough to ask for one.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner certified public accountant (CPA) sought review of an order from the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the Third Judicial Department (New York), reversing the trial court's judgment that had directed recission and cancellation of an order from the Commissioner of Education that had revoked petitioner's CPA license. Petitioner contended that he was denied a fair hearing because he was denied certain subpoenas duces tecum.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner certified public accountant (CPA) had been convicted of furnishing a gratuity to a federal employee. The Department of Education subsequently charged him with having been convicted of a crime and with being guilty of unprofessional conduct. Petitioner was found guilty of both charges and respondent university board of regents ordered the Commissioner of Education to revoke petitioner's license to practice as a CPA. The trial court directed recission and cancellation of the order revoking petitioner's certificate and the appellate court reversed. On appeal, the court affirmed the order. Petitioner contended that he was denied a fair hearing because the committee hearing the charges against him denied his request for the issuance of certain subpoenas duces tecum. The court found that the failure on the part of the subcommittee to issue the subpoena duces tecum was not an abuse of discretion. A subpoena duces tecum could not have supported petitioner's claim that he was deprived of the opportunity to show that his conviction was not a crime with the meaning of the Education Law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the order from the appellate court that had reversed the trial court's recission and cancellation of an order of the Commissioner of Education which revoked petitioner certified public accountant's (CPA) license to practice as a CPA. It was not an abuse of discretion for the subcommittee, before which the hearing was held, to deny petitioner's request for the issuance of certain subpoenas duces tecum.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Licenses -- certified public accountants -- petitioner, certified public accountant, was not denied fair hearing on charges of having been convicted of crime and unprofessional conduct, of which he was held guilty resulting in revocation of license -- since hearing committee was given specific authority by </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Education Law ( </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">&sect; 7406</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">, subd. 3</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">) to issue subpoenas, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">CPLR 2307</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> dealing with issuance of subpoenas, was not limit on committee's power -- under language of section 7406, petitioner did not have unqualified right to</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> have subpoenas issued, but matter rested in discretion of hearing committee -- first reason advanced for issuance of subpoena could not be supported and denial was not abuse of discretion -- second reason, that regulation under which charges were brought was not properly filed, is also without merit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Following the conviction of petitioner, a certified public accountant, in Federal court for furnishing a gratuity to a Federal employee, he was charged by the Department of Education with having been convicted of a crime and with unprofessional conduct, and after a hearing held at which he was found guilty of both charges, respondent ordered the revocation of his license to practice as a certified public accountant. Petitioner was not denied a fair hearing because his request for the issuance of certain subpoenas duces tecum was denied by the hearing committee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.  CPLR 2307 (subd. [a]) which deals with the issuance of subpoenas by the court, is applicable only to those subpoenas issued pursuant to CPLR 2302 (subd. [a]) providing for the issuance of subpoenas without court order by &quot;any member of a board, commission or committee authorized by law to hear, try or determine a matter&quot; not granted specific power to issue subpoenas. Since the hearing committee here was given specific authority to issue subpoenas by section 7406 (subd. 3) of the Education Law, CPLR 2307 was not a limit on said committee's power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Section 7406 (subd. 3) of the Education Law provides that at any hearing in disciplinary proceedings, respondent shall have &quot;the right to produce witnesses * * * and to have subpoenas issued by the committee.  The complainant likewise shall have similar power to produce witnesses and to have any necessary subpoenas issued by the committee.&quot; Under this language petitioner did not have the unqualified right to have subpoenas issued on his behalf.  The issuance of subpoenas upon the request of respondent or complainant is a matter within the discretion of the hearing committee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Petitioner sought the subpoena to show that his conviction under the Federal statute was not a crime within the meaning of the Education Law but only a crime of gratuity. Section 7406 (subd. 1, par. [c]) requires only a conviction in a court of competent jurisdiction of any crime with no distinction between types of crimes.  Since the issuance of the subpoena could not support petitioner's claim, the denial was not an abuse of discretion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. As a second reason for seeking the subpoena, petitioner sought to establish that the regulation under which this charge was brought was not properly filed and published.  Contrary to such claim, the rule defining unprofessional conduct, having been adopted by the Commissioner of Education and approved by the Board of Regents, was filed in the office of the Secretary of State and was published in 8 NYCRR 70.5.  Since such reason is without merit, the hearing committee's denial was likewise proper.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff apartment house owners brought suit against defendant municipal officials contending that New York City, N.Y., Admin. Code &sect;&sect; 892-1.0 - 897-2.0, an ordinance regulating the use of fuel burners and refuse incinerators, was unconstitutional. The Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the Second Judicial Department (New York) affirmed the grant of summary judgment to the officials, and the owners appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Apartment house owners claimed that a municipal ordinance requiring upgraded pollution controls was unconstitutional because state law preempted local pollution control legislation. They also argued that it was impossible to comply with the ordinance's deadlines, that the cost of compliance was prohibitory, that penalties under the ordinance were confiscatory, and that no rational basis existed for the ordinance. The officials defended the ordinance as a reasonable exercise of the municipality's police power. The court held that the ordinance was constitutional because the government could attack massive problems such as air pollution piecemeal and the choice of reasonable courses of action was within the domain of legislative and executive discretion. State law was not preemptive because N.Y. Envtl. Conserv. Law &sect;&sect; 10, 14 recognized local government's role in controlling pollution. The owners' arguments that the ordinance would not achieve its goals and was too costly did not affect the constitutionality of the legislative choice made in the ordinance. Unless it was shown that compliance was in fact impossible, the provisions for cumulative penalties were not confiscatory.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the order of the appellate division.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional law -- reduction of air pollutants -- municipality has power to regulate use of fuel burners and refuse incinerators by multiple dwellings to control emission of air pollutants -- pollution by such equipment is not of trivial effect -- wisdom of measures required by municipal</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> ordinance was within legislative discretion -- cumulative penalties provided by ordinance are valid -- plaintiffs have not shown they are aggrieved by time requirements of ordinance -- outlay required for correction is not so disproportionate as to be </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">unconstitutional</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> -- State has not pre-empted subject matter -- under </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">statute,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> provisions for summary sealing of equipment are not </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">unconstitutional;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> hearing and notice are provided.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. A municipality has power by local ordinance to regulate the use of fuel burners and refuse incinerators by multiple dwellings to control the emission of air pollutants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Pollution caused by incinerators and oil burning equipment is not of trivial effect.  Even if there is a 2% daily contribution of pollutants by private apartment houses, this contribution aggregates over 186 tons per day.  Moreover, government is and must be entitled to attack massive problems piecemeal, and to select those most susceptible areas which permit of the least destructive effect on the economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The wisdom and practicality of the rigorous measures required by the ordinance were within the domain of legislative and executive discretion.  So long as there is reasonable basis in available information, and rationality in chosen courses of conduct to alleviate an accepted evil, there is no constitutional infirmity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The cumulative penalties provided in the ordinance constitute a valid means of control.  Absent a showing of impossibility of compliance with the requirements of the ordinance the cumulative penalties are not confiscatory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Because plaintiffs do not contend that they, rather than all owners of multiple dwellings, found timely performance impossible because of a shortage of pollution control engineers, they fail to show that they are aggrieved. Statutes will not be struck down unless plaintiffs are actually aggrieved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. The outlay of sums ranging from $ 3,500 to $ 19,000 to upgrade fuel burners and incinerators, considering the serious health hazard represented by air pollution, is not disproportionate to the capital investment or the benefits to be obtained.  There is no unconstitutionality involved and the balance to be struck is a legislative and not a judicial obligation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. The Environmental Conservation Law (L. 1970, ch. 140) has not pre-empted the subject and explicitly recognizes that local governments are intended to function in the air pollution area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. The ordinance authorizes summary sealing in the case of specified classes of fuel burners and incinerators for which permits have not been obtained and whose operation has thus become unlawful.  A hearing for the affected owner, even after the summary sealing, obtainable by judicial proceedings of a summary or plenary character is sufficient to insure constitutionality so long as the health hazard to be controlled is sufficiently widespread and grave and immediate action is desirable.  As to other equipment, there must be notice and hearing before the offending equipment may be sealed on the ground that it is emitting noxious substances.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Criminal Court of the City of New York, Kings County (New York), entered judgment convicting defendant of menacing in violation of N.Y. Penal Law, &sect; 120.15, possession of a dangerous weapon in violation of &sect; 265.05, and unlawful mutilation of the American flag in violation of N.Y. Gen. Bus. Law &sect; 136(d).On review, the Appellate Term of the Supreme Court, Second Judicial Department, affirmed. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On the evening of August 3, 1968, a policeman observed defendant affixing an American flag to a vacant building. As a crowd of about 40 to 50 people looked on, defendant proceeded to saturate the flag with lighter fluid and then ignited it, Upon being informed by the policeman that he was under arrest, defendant took a knife from his trouser pocket, warned him to stay away, and then lunged at the officer. On appeal of his subsequent convictions and the affirmance of those convictions by the appellate term, defendant contended N.Y. Gen. Bus. Law &sect; 136(d) was unconstitutional both on its face and as applied. The court affirmed because the record unequivocally established the sole basis for defendant's conviction was his act of burning the flag, not his words.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment that in part convicted defendant of unlawful mutilation of the American flag.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional law -- defilement of flag -- defendant, who uttered protest words as he burned flag, was not convicted of defiling flag based both on his words and deed, which is constitutionally impermissible, but only on his act of burning flag.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Subdivision d of section 136 of the General Business Law has been held constitutional insofar as it renders criminal the act of any person who publicly mutilates, defaces or defiles the flag. It has also been held that a defendant could not be convicted of defiling the flag for both his words and his deed. Even though defendant, when he burned the flag, stated that &quot;I am going to burn Johnson, Humphrey and Wallace just as I am going to burn this flag&quot;, defendant was not convicted for his words.  The information charged only the commission of an act, that of defiling the flag, and made no reference to defendant's words, and the entire record establishes unequivocally that the sole basis for defendant's conviction was his act of burning the flag. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state sought review of two decisions by the Supreme Court of New York, Appellate Division, which reversed the trial court's adjudication of two defendants as youthful offenders and ordered a new trial in each case.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court adjudicated the two defendants to be youthful offenders. The intermediate appellate court reversed the adjudications based on the United States Supreme Court's decision in Duncan v. Louisiana, 391 U.S. 145 (1968). The Duncan court held that N.Y. Code Crim. Proc. &sect;&sect; 913-g(3) and 913-h, which require a youngster between the ages of 16 and 19 to consent to a trial without a jury in order to render him eligible for youthful offender treatment, were unconstitutional. In affirming the intermediate appellate court's judgment as to one defendant, the court held that &sect;&sect; 913-g(3) and 913-h were unconstitutional insofar as the sections compelled a defendant to consent to a trial without a jury in order to render him eligible for youthful offender treatment. As to the other defendant, however, the court held that the defendant's adjudication as a youthful offender antedated the Duncan decision, which had prospective effect only, by approximately two months. Thus, the court ordered reinstatement of the trial court's adjudication of the defendant as a youthful offender.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Infants -- youthful offenders -- jury trial -- youthful offender, exposed to possibility of four-year reformatory sentence of imprisonment, is entitled to trial by jury -- State may not demand his consent to trial without jury as condition to affording him benefits of youthful offender treatment -- </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">statutes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> compelling defendant to consent to trial without jury to render him eligible for youthful offender treatment are </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">unconstitutional</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> -- decision in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Duncan v.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The Sixth Amendment as applied to the States through the Fourteenth Amendment requires that defendants charged with &quot;serious crimes&quot; be afforded the right to a trial by jury ( </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Duncan </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">v.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10"> Louisiana</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 391 U.S. 145). Where the possible penalty exceeds six months' imprisonment, the offense is deemed sufficiently &quot;serious&quot; to require the grant of a jury trial ( </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Baldwin </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">v.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10"> New York</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 399 U.S. 66, 69). A youthful offender, such as one of the defendants herein who was indicted for criminal possession of a dangerous drug in the second degree, a class D felony (Penal Law, former &sect; 220.15), and is exposed to the possibility of a four-year reformatory sentence of imprisonment (Penal Law, art. 75; Code Crim. Pro., &sect; 913-m, subd. 1, par. [d]), is entitled to a trial by jury (cf.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">In re Winship</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 397 U.S. 358).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Although any defendant, including a youthful offender, is free to consent to a trial without a jury, a State may not demand that such consent be given as an absolute precondition to affording him the benefits of youthful offender treatment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Sections 913-g and 913-h of the Code of Criminal Procedure, insofar as they compel a defendant to consent to a trial without a jury to render him eligible for youthful offender treatment, are unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The trial of one of the defendants antedated, by some two months, the Supreme Court's decision in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Duncan </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">v.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10"> Louisiana</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (391 U.S. 145), although he was adjudged a youthful offender subsequent to that decision.  In </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">DeStefano </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">v.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10"> Woods</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (392 U.S. 631), the court held that the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Duncan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> decision should receive only prospective application. Consequently, this defendant was not entitled to a jury trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. The in-court identification of the latter defendant was not influenced or affected by the lineup of which he complains.  If there was any error or impropriety in the procedure adopted, it may be disregarded under section 542 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Informations were filed against defendant alleging misdemeanor possession of a narcotic drug in violation of N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 220.05 and of the felony possession of a loaded weapon in violation of N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 265.05(2). Although defendant was to go before the grand jury on the felony charge, the district attorney filed another information against him charging both offenses. At defendant's arraignment with his counsel present he was advised of his right to proceed before the grand jury and waived it for a prosecution under the felony information. The foreman brought his petition under N.Y. C.P.L.R. 78 that raised the constitutional claim that defendant could not be prosecuted for a felony without an indictment by the grand jury. The court affirmed the order of the appellate division restraining the district attorney from prosecuting and restraining the judges from taking jurisdiction of the criminal matter until after the grand jury returned the indictment. The appellate division correctly agreed with the foreman's contention that the district court lacked jurisdiction based on the explicit grand jury requirement of N.Y. Const. art.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff landlords filed an action against defendant municipality seeking a declaration that New York City, N.Y., Admin. Code &sect; YY 51 was unconstitutional. The Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the First Judicial Department (New York) granted the landlords' motion for summary judgment, and the municipality appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The municipality enacted New York City, N.Y., Admin. Code &sect; YY 51 to control rising rental charges that were causing hardship to tenants living in the municipality. The landlords claimed that the rent control provisions were unconstitutional because they resulted in an unlawful delegation of legislative authority. They also claimed that the statute violated the Equal Protection Clause and that it exceeded the delegation of power by the state to the municipality for the enactment of rent control legislation because it vested the administration of controls on rents and evictions in a group other than a city agency. The court held that the statute was constitutional. The court ruled that (1) the statute closely circumscribed and regulated the powers of the real estate industry association in setting limits on rental charges and delegated no legislative power to the association; and (2) the statute did not violate the Equal Protection Clause because its classification scheme had a rational basis.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the grant of summary judgment in favor of the landlords and entered a declaratory judgment upholding the constitutionality of the administrative code provision.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Landlord and tenant -- rent regulation -- Rent Stabilization Law of 1969 of City of New York providing for rent control over post-1947 apartments is valid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The New York City Rent Stabilization Law of 1969 (Local Laws, 1969, No.  16 of City of New York; Administrative Code of City of New York, tit.  YY, ch. 51) which extends rent control to post-1947 housing constitutes a valid exercise of the legislative authority of the city.  There has been no unlawful delegation of power to a Real Estate Industry Stabilization Association.  The overall supervision of the regulatory process is vested in the Housing and Development Administration which is expressly authorized to enact rules and regulations for the implementation of the statute, to approve the code of a Real Estate Industry Stabilization Association and to discipline an association.  The right of any member aggrieved by action of an association to review before the Conciliation and Appeals Board, whose members are appointed by the Mayor, shows that no judicial power has been given the association.  While the funds to pay the salaries of the board and the expenses of the office are provided by the association, it does not involve an invalid delegation of the taxing power.  Since there is a rational basis for the difference in regulatory treatment between pre-1947 and post-1947 housing, there has been no denial of equal protection of the laws.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, individuals who participated in scheme to purchase insurance company, appealed judgment of Appellate Division of Supreme Court in First Judicial Department (New York), which affirmed defendants' convictions for violating N.Y. Ins. Law &sect; 78, subd. 2, and one defendant's conviction for forgery and criminal misconduct of officer of corporation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, individuals who participated in scheme to purchase insurance company, appealed appellate court judgment which affirmed defendants' convictions for pledge of insurance company assets in violation of N.Y. Ins. Law &sect; 78, subd. 2, and one defendant's conviction for forgery and criminal misconduct of officer of corporation. Defendants purchased insurance company's stock by using proceeds from sale of insurance company's government bonds. Indictment charged defendants with allegedly concealing this transaction by issuance of, and manipulations with, certificates of deposit. Court reversed convictions. After purchasing insurance company's stock, defendants arranged complex offsetting loans, and deposits of loan proceeds were made to procure certificates of deposit to secure such loans. However, insurance company never owned these certificates. N.Y. Ins. Law &sect; 78, subd. 2, required that assets pledged be those of insurer. Convictions for forgery and misconduct of corporate officer were reversed because they were based on certificates being insurance company's assets.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After finding defendants concealed fraudulent purchase of insurance company's stock by arranging offsetting loans and deposited loan proceeds to procure certificates of deposit to secure such loans, court found insurance company never owned these certificates. New York Insurance Law was not violated because defendants had not pledged insurer's assets; therefore, judgment reversed.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- assets of insurance company -- proof showed that certificates of deposit in name of insurance company were not assets of said company; hence proof, as limited by indictment and by theory of trial, failed to show that defendants pledged assets of insurance company (Insurance Law, &sect; 78, subd. 2) or falsely certified that assets were unencumbered (former </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Penal Law, &sect;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> 665</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">, subd. 3, and &sect; 889), or conspired to commit those crimes; judgments of conviction reversed and indictment dismissed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The first-named defendant Begole (who died before trial) purchased all the stock of a domestic casualty insurance company from its sole owner, in exchange for a bank's check for $ 5,000,000 payable to said seller; and said purchaser elected himself and a codefendant as directors of the insurance company and authorized the insurance company to sell its government bonds and to use the proceeds to buy, for the insurance company, a bank's certificate of deposit; but instead, he and his codefendants gave the bonds to the bank, which sold them; and thus the bank was paid for its $ 5,000,000 check, and thus said deceased defendant used the insurance company's own assets to pay for his purchase of its stock.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The defendants concealed this misappropriation of the insurance company's bonds, by means of several circular or &quot;wash&quot; transactions among themselves and among different financial corporations.  These transactions produced a series of offsetting book entries.  In these camouflage transactions, no assets of the insurance company were passed or were moved,  but several bank certificates of deposit were issued in the name of the insurance company, and some of those nominally owned certificates of deposit were pledged. The original misappropriation seems to have become time-barred from prosecution, and it has not been shown that the subsequent concealment of the misappropriation further eroded the company's assets; and in any event, that is not for what the defendants were indicted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The defendants were indicted and convicted of pledging securities of the insurance company for a loan for which the insurance company did not receive the proceeds (Insurance Law, &sect; 78, subd. 2), and of forgery in the third degree and misconduct by a corporate officer, consisting of false statements in the company's books and in its reports to the Superintendent of Insurance, to the effect that certificates of deposit owned by the company were not encumbered or pledged (former Penal Law, &sect; 889; &sect; 665, subd. 3), and of conspiring to commit those crimes.  Section 78 (subd. 2) of the Insurance Law requires that the assets pledged be those of the insurance company; and the judgments of conviction of the other crimes concededly depend also on &quot;assets&quot;.  But the proof, as limited by the indictment and theory of the trial, showed that those certificates were never &quot;assets&quot; of the insurance company.  Accordingly, the judgments of conviction should be reversed and the indictment dismissed. </SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the judgment. The court held that defendants willfully refused to testify before a grand jury after being offered complete immunity. Furthermore, it held that the grand jury was lawfully and statutorily constituted.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. In order to sustain a claim of an illegally constituted jury, intentional and systematic discrimination must be proved and a showing of mathematical disparity, without more, is insufficient.

By choosing jurors on the basis of these factors, rather than race or ethnic background, his action was consistent with the policies embodied in the Equal Protection Clause.  The Grand Jury was a lawfully constituted body, chosen without regard to race or other discriminatory factors.

While the County Clerk's office did intentionally exclude welfare recipients, persons adjudged guilty of adultery and persons under the age of 35, it may not be said that any of these criteria is so totally lacking in reasonable justification as to be constitutionally invalid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. All but one of the defendants was convicted on multiple counts of contempt,  even though each of them made it clear, at the outset, that he would not answer any questions concerning the alleged conspiracy, and concurrent sentences were imposed.  The court should have found the defendants guilty of but a single contempt, sentenced each of them for that crime and dismissed all the other counts.  This result may be accomplished, without the necessity of remanding for resentencing, by modifying the judgment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Where, as here, there has been compliance with the immunity statute, defendants, whether or not they were &quot;targets&quot; of the investigation as they claim, could be required to testify and be subjected to prosecution for contempt should they willfully refuse to do so.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant landlord challenged an order of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the First Judicial Department (New York), which affirmed an order that denied the landlord's petition to declare as unconstitutional the Emergency Repair Program of the New York City Department of Health, New York City, N.Y., Rules of the City of New York, tit. 564, &sect;&sect; 15.0 to 31.0.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The nuisance, a blocked toilet, was located in an apartment occupied and controlled by a welfare recipient. She asserted that she contacted the landlord's office but was refused repairs. An employee of respondent city telephoned the landlord, who stated that it knew nothing of the stoppage until it received a bill for repair of the toilet that he was required to pay. On appeal, the court modified the order that denied a declaration of the statute as unconstitutional, and it remanded for a hearing. There were contested issues of fact that involved notice to the landlord by both the tenant and the city. Further, an order to abate and forced payment could not be enforced with respect to a nuisance not created by the landlord other than one that he must have or should have known, because of actual control, or operation, unless the city made reasonable efforts to first notify the landlord, beyond a notice by general publication. Although entitled to notice and an initial opportunity to effect necessary repairs, the landlord was not entitled to a judicial determination of liability before his tenants were asked to make payments due from them as rent directly to the city.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The Administrative Code of the City of New York provides that a landlord be given personal service of an order to abate a nuisance, or, if necessary, service by mail or posting of the order on the offending premises (&sect; 564-21.0, subds. a, b).  The Board of Health is empowered, however, to declare that a nuisance is so widespread that the regular provisions for notice are not feasible, and, by general newspaper publication, without specification of names and addresses, the board may order that &quot;any such nuisance which may exist upon or in any real or personal property or place located within the area or areas specified in such order&quot; be abated (&sect; 564-21.0, subd. c).  The Board of Health published a resolution declaring buildings without effective sewage disposal facilities a nuisance, and ordered that adequate sewage disposal facilities be provided, throughout the city.  The pleadings reveal contested issues of fact involving the notice assertedly given the landlord by both the tenant and Department of Buildings.  An order to abate may not be enforced with respect to a nuisance not created by the landlord other than one of which he must have or should have known because of actual control, or operation, unless the department makes reasonable efforts to notify the landlord, beyond a notice by general publication made before creation of the nuisance in question.  The proceeding should be remanded for a resolution of the factual issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Although the landlord is entitled to notice and an initial opportunity to effect necessary repairs, he is not entitled to a judicial determination of liability before his tenants are asked to make payments due from them as rent directly to the department.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff appealed an order of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the Second Judicial Department (New York), which unanimously affirmed an order of the trial court, granting a motion by defendants to dismiss the amended complaint to challenge the constitutionality of a zoning ordinance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The issue was the constitutionality of certain parts of the town's zoning ordinance. The provisions challenged created a board of architectural review and required that each application for a permit to construct a new building, or to make alterations or additions of specified nature and cost, would be submitted to the board. Without first applying for a permit, plaintiff brought an action for declaratory judgment stating that the ordinance provided no standards for the guidance of the board, exceeded the permissible bounds of the police power, and was too vague and ambiguous to be enforced. In granting defendants' motion to dismiss, the trial court gave effect to defendants' argument that plaintiff's failure to apply for a building permit rendered its constitutional attack premature. The court affirmed, concluding that plaintiff should, indeed, be confined to its administrative remedy.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A town zoning ordinance creates a Board of Architectural Review and requires that each application for a permit to construct a new building, or to make alterations or additions of specified nature and cost, shall be submitted to the board.  Authority is conferred upon the board to disapprove any such application upon finding that the structure &quot;would, if erected or altered be so detrimental to the desirability, property values or development of the surrounding areas as to provide one or more of the harmful effects set forth in Section 1 [of the ordinance] by reason of * * * excessive similarity * * * excessive dissimilarity * * * or * * * inappropriateness in relation to the established character of other structures in the immediate area or neighboring areas&quot;.  Without first applying for a permit, plaintiff brought this action for judgment declaring the ordinance unconstitutional.  The causes of action are asserted prematurely where, as here, no application has been made for a building permit. Plaintiff should be confined to its administrative remedy in the first instance. Aesthetic considerations are not unlawful per se and unless and, until a building permit for a specific structure shall have been denied, even the existence of any present damage cannot be demonstrated.  Additionally, a decision rendered prior to the denial of a building permit would have to be reached without such help as might be obtained from knowledge of the board's practical construction of the ordinance and of the standards actually applied.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant hospital challenged an order from the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the Fourth Judicial Department (New York), which sustained the validity of the compulsory arbitration features of N.Y. Lab. Law &sect; 716 (1969) in its declaratory judgment action against respondent labor union representatives (representatives).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The hospital and the representatives failed to reach a collective bargaining agreement, and the dispute was submitted to compulsory arbitration pursuant to N.Y. Lab. Law &sect; 716 (1969). The hospital did not submit to arbitration because review of the arbitrator's decision under N.Y. C.P.L.R. 75, the only mode of review expressly provided by N.Y. Lab. Law &sect; 716 (1969), was inadequate to provide the hospital due process of law under the Fourteenth Amendment and N.Y. Const. art. I, &sect; 6. The lower court sustained the statute. The court affirmed and found that N.Y. C.P.L.R. 7511 permitted review if the arbitrator acted beyond his authority. Such review was sufficient to afford the parties due process in the context of compulsory arbitration as mandated by N.Y. Lab. Law &sect; 716 (1969). The court held that compulsory arbitration and the limited review under &sect; 716 was constitutionally justified and sufficient because the hospital was affected with a profound public interest directly related to the health and lives in the community and was dependent on governmental subsidies, reimbursements, and exemptions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the order sustaining the validity of the state's compulsory arbitration statute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Arbitration -- compulsory arbitration -- </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">section 716 of Labor Law</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> provides for compulsory arbitration for disputes in labor contract negotiations with private voluntary and nonprofitmaking hospitals -- application to confirm, modify, correct or vacate arbitration award must be made in accord with CPLR article 75 governing arbitration generally -- article 75, given broad interpretation encompasses standard of review sufficient to afford parties due process -- </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">section 716 of Labor Law</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> is accordingly valid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.  Section 716 of the Labor Law provides for the compulsory arbitration of disputes in labor contract negotiations with private voluntary or nonprofitmaking hospitals.  An application to confirm, modify, correct or vacate an arbitration award must be made in accord with CPLR article 75, the article governing arbitration generally.  Because article 75, if given a broad rather than a narrow interpretation, encompasses a standard of review sufficient to afford the parties due process in the context of compulsory arbitration as mandated by section 716 of the Labor Law, the statute is valid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.  CPLR 7511 (subd. [b]) provides in part: &quot;1. The award shall be vacated on the application of a party * * * if the court finds that the rights of that party were prejudiced by: * * * (iii) an arbitrator, or agency or person making the award exceeded his power or so imperfectly executed it that a final and definite award upon the subject matter submitted was not made&quot;.  Because of due process limitations affecting compulsory arbitration, the arbitrator is circumscribed by the data or evidence to support the award made by him.  His power derives from the statute which mandates upon the parties the arbitration or the agreement for arbitration. The arbitrator must be limited by the same constitutional requirements which limit the statute conferring power on him.  The scheme of section 716 is to provide for the resolution of contract negotiation disputes about conditions in the industry on the basis of evidence, hearings, and a record made.  This device for arbitration is a substitute for a determination of the dispute by an administrative or regulatory agency. As a substitute device, its objective may not be accomplished under lower constitutional standards than would be required of an administrative or regulatory agency. On this view, CPLR 7511 (subd.  [b]), in authorizing review of whether the arbitrator has exceeded his power, by necessary logical extension and without distortion of its literal terms, includes review in the case of compulsory arbitration (but only in such case) of whether the award is supported by evidence or other basis in reason, as may be appropriate, and appearing in the record.  Such a review is all that the plaintiff hospital is entitled to obtain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. A dispute arising from a failure to reach a collective bargaining agreement is akin to a regulatory or quasi-legislative resolution of the conditions of employment.  In such event the test must partake more of the elements associated with the validation of an exercise of legislative power under the standards expressed in the statute since the 1969 amendment (&sect; 716, subd. 7; L. 1969, ch. 526, &sect; 3).  The award may not be arbitrary or capricious, and this indirect exercise of the police power by the arbitrators must be justified by the public interest and reasonable conditions to effect that interest.  The arbitrators are not empowered to adopt any plan for the conditions of employment simply to satisfy or meet the wishes either of employer or employees.  Given a reasonable basis for the award, the court's power to review, under any theory or by any procedure, ceases.  On this interpretation, constitutional limitations are satisfied by the statute for the arbitrators may do no more than the Legislature could, and the review power is limited to the same power that exists to review legislative or quasi-legislative acts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Section 716 has devised a unique procedure for the admixture of administrative, regulatory, and quasi-judicial functions.  In that sense, the procedure is </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">sui generis</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and the fact that article 75 is by itself appropriate only to consensual arbitration should neither require the statute to be condemned as invalid nor, on the other hand, require translation of the concepts of consensual arbitration to compulsory arbitration as if there were no difference between the two.  The Legislature had the power to weld the two to the extent that they are compatible and the language of the statutes and the constitutional limitations permit.  Giving the &quot;excess of power&quot; clause in section 7511 of CPLR its ordinary meaning, it is sufficiently broad to cover the constitutional limitations.  So interpreted, section 716 is valid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. The statute is not a violation of equal protection of the law because it applies only to nonprofitmaking facilities.  </SPAN></P>

The court found that the zoning ordinance prohibited a &quot;heliport&quot; as a use in the industrial &quot;A&quot; district in which plaintiff's property was located. The court found that the appellate court properly held that, as fairly construed, the ordinance prohibited the activities which plaintiff's operations would necessarily entail.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant town challenged an order of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the Second Judicial Department (New York), which granted plaintiff developer's motion for summary judgment and directed judgment declaring the town's amended zoning ordinance was invalid for failure to follow statutory requirements. In granting the developer's motion, the trial court reversed a previous lower court decision denying the motion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The developer sought reapproval of two subdivision plans from the town's planning board, but the board denied reapproval based on a finding that the developer's purported use of the land was in conflict with an amended zoning ordinance. The developer alleged that the ordinance in question was invalid because the board failed to promptly enter a copy of the amended ordinance in the minutes. The trial court agreed, and granted the developer's motion for summary judgment. On appeal, the court reversed. The court held that in amending the ordinance, the town acted in accordance with the requirements of the governing statute,&nbsp;N.Y. Town Law &sect; 264. The court noted undisputed facts that the minutes were written and officially filed in the proper public office available for inspection in accordance with &sect; 264. The court also noted that while &sect; 264 required that a zoning ordinance be entered into the minutes of the town board, the &quot;minutes&quot; referred to was not necessarily the &quot;ordinance book,&quot; and held that the town clerk's failure to promptly put the ordinance into the ordinance book as required by N.Y. Town Law &sect; 30 was personal neglect which did not invalidate the board's public action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court's order granting summary judgment to the developer on the first cause of action seeking declaratory judgment that the amended ordinance was invalid. The court entered judgment for the town on that cause, with costs. The court also remanded the matter to the lower court for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Municipal corporations -- ordinances -- validity of enactment -- amendment of town's zoning ordinance complied with requirements of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Town Law ( &sect; 264</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">) including entry in minutes, even though not entered in &quot;ordinance book&quot;, so that defendants are entitled to judgment declaring ordinance valid -- order affirming denial of summary judgment to plaintiff and defendants is nonfinal and not reviewable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. An ordinance amending a town's Comprehensive Zoning and Building Ordinance was passed by a majority vote of its Town Board with a written copy before it for consideration.  A copy of the ordinance was duly and timely published in several newspapers circulating in the town and was duly posted. It was entered in the minutes of the board meeting by the clerk and kept by her in her official public office, available for inspection by the public.  It was not, however, physically incorporated in the &quot;ordinance book&quot; of the town until after October 23, 1967.  By every reasonable standard the enactment of the ordinance meets the requirements of section 264 of the Town Law. The neglect of a Town Clerk promptly to put ordinances adopted by the board in the &quot;ordinance book&quot; as required by section 30 of the Town Law ought to be deemed a personal neglect by the clerk insufficient to invalidate the board's action unless there is some resulting uncertainty to someone's detriment.  Defendants are entitled to judgment declaring the ordinance valid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Those parts of the order of the Appellate Division affirming the denial of summary judgment to plaintiff and defendants are nonfinal and not reviewable on this appeal by defendants.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment from the Appellate Term of the Supreme Court in the First Judicial Department (New York), which affirmed a judgment of the trial court that found defendant guilty of disorderly conduct in violation of N.Y.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of disorderly conduct in violation of N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 240.20(3),(6) and harassment in violation of N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 240.25 upon the complaint of the arresting officer who arrested defendant for loitering, which was affirmed on appeal. Defendant sought further judicial review. The court reviewed the record and concluded that there was sufficient evidence that defendant refused to obey an order by the arresting officer to move and stop loitering, which supported the disorderly conduct conviction. The court also noted that the refusal to obey such an order could have been justified only where the circumstances showed conclusively that the officer's direction was purely arbitrary and not calculated to promote public order, which was not the case under the facts. However, the court reversed and dismissed the charge of harassment because it was only based on comments by defendant directed against the officer upon defendant's arrest. The court held that defendant's mere comments only expressed his annoyance at being arrested and did not establish his intent to annoy or alarm the officer, or that he threatened to strike, shove, or kick the officer.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's conviction for disorderly conduct was affirmed because there was no evidence that an arresting officer arbitrarily ordered defendant to stop loitering. Defendant's conviction for harassment was reversed and the charge was dismissed because defendant's comments did not indicate defendant's intent to threaten, strike, or otherwise physically harm the arresting officer.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Defendant was convicted of disorderly conduct on the complaint of a police officer that he congregated with others in a public place, used abusive and obscene language, and refused to comply with the police officer's order to move on after several warnings.  The Appellate Term, in affirming the judgment of conviction, was correct in concluding that proof of the accomplished fact of public inconvenience, annoyance or alarm was not required.  Proof only from which the risk of it, recklessly created, might be inferred was required (Penal Law, &sect; 240.20, subd. 6).  The trial court could have found beyond reasonable doubt that defendant was aware of and consciously disregarded a substantial and unjustifiable risk that public inconvenience, annoyance or alarm might result from his use of abusive and obscene language in response to the officer's repeated requests to move on and his refusal to comply with such requests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Defendant's attack on the constitutionality of the statute is without merit, both as to a challenge of the statute on its face and as applied to the facts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. A complaint charging harassment is sufficient if the evidence establishes a violation of any one of the subdivisions of the harassment statute.  It is not necessary that the complaint refer specifically to any one of the subdivisions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The evidence on the harassment charge was insufficient.  The statute provides that &quot;A person is guilty of harassment when, with intent to harass, annoy or alarm another person: 1. He strikes, shoves, kicks or otherwise subjects him to physical contact, or attempts or threatens to do the same&quot; (Penal Law, &sect; 240.25, subd. 1).  The only evidence bearing upon the charge was the police officer's testimony that the appellant stated: &quot;I'll get you for this&quot;.  This statement did not suffice to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant &quot;with intent to harass, annoy or harm&quot; the police officer, attempted or threatened to &quot;strike, shove, kick or otherwise subject him to physical contact&quot;.  The complaint should be dismissed to the extent of the charge of harassment. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant landlord appealed the judgment of the County Court of Broome County (New York), which convicted him of violating the town code section prohibiting open storage of one or more inoperable vehicles. On appeal, the landlord argued that the ordinance was invalid insofar as it directed him, as an owner who by lease had relinquished the right to enter upon the property, to remove property placed upon it by the tenant.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A landlord leased part of his property to his son, who stored a number of inoperable vehicles on the land. After the lease was signed, the town passed an ordinance that prohibited residents from keeping inoperable vehicles on their land. The landlord was convicted of violating the ordinance. On appeal, the landlord argued that he had no right of re-entry on the leased property and that the ordinance was unconstitutional. The court reversed the landlord's conviction and held that the landlord had no right of re-entry on the land, so he could not be held responsible because he had no control over the property at the time he was served. The court also held that the ordinance was an arbitrary exercise of police power and violated due process protections. The court found that the ordinance was too harsh because it did not even allow for the storage of one car on a resident's premises, and the word &quot;inoperable&quot; in the ordinance was too vague for residents to know how to conform their behavior to the ordinance.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Municipal corporations -- ordinance prohibiting storage of vehicles not in operating condition -- town ordinance which prohibits storage, on private property, of motor vehicles not in operating condition invalid insofar as it directs defendant owner who, by lease, relinquished right to enter upon private property, to remove motor vehicles on leased premises -- landlord had no right of entry for such purpose -- defendant could be responsible only if he had right of entry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant, owner of a 30-acre tract of land in the Town of Vestal, leased 20 acres to his son for an indefinite term which could be terminated by a 60-day notice given by either party.  On the leased premises, the son stored approximately 100 disabled motor vehicles. Subsequent to the execution of the lease, an ordinance was enacted by the town which provided that: &quot;Open storage of one (1) or more motor vehicles which are not in operating condition for legal use on the public highways shall not be permitted on private property within the Town of Vestal.&quot; Written notice was given to defendant owner to remove these vehicles and, upon his failure to comply, he was prosecuted for a violation of this ordinance. The ordinance is invalid insofar as it directs defendant, as an owner who, by lease, has relinquished the right to enter upon the property, to remove property placed upon it by the tenant. Defendant may be held responsible only if he had a right of entry at the time that notice was served upon him.  That right must be found in the lease or in a statute.  It may not be found in the ordinance either directly or impliedly, for the Legislature has not authorized that kind of interference with the landlord-tenant relationship.  In the absence of a reserved right of entry, the landlord has no common-law right to enter upon the demised premises. Defendant has reserved such a right only for nonpayment of rent.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant employees challenged the constitutionality of N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 253-a which authorized a grand jury to submit a report to the court concerning non-criminal misconduct by public officers. The Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the Fourth Judicial Department (New York) affirmed trial court orders denying motions for inspections of grand jury minutes.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found that the employees were entitled to have their constitutional question passed upon by the court of appeals as of right. The court found that N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 517-a could not have been invoked to interfere with the appeal on that question even if the proceeding was deemed criminal in nature. On the merits of the appeal, the court found that a reversal was required where the court had denied employees' motions for inspection of the minutes of the grand jury upon which its report was based. The court found that the trial court's denial of the motion, premised on the ground that it lacked authority to grant such an application limited the accused employees to a bare unsupported and unsubstantiated list of charges and allegations against them, which would have served to deprive them of that opportunity to be heard which is guaranteed to them by the Due Process Clause of the state constitution, N.Y. Const. art. I, &sect; 6. The court, however, refused to find N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 253-a unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The orders appealed from were reversed and the matter remitted to the trial court for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Grand Jury -- report -- State Constitution does not warrant invalidation of section 253-a of Code of Criminal Procedure which authorizes grand jury to submit report to court concerning noncriminal misconduct or neglect in office by public officer or employee -- court did not lack authority to grant motions for inspection of minutes of grand jury upon which its report was based -- appeal properly before Court of Appeals whether proceeding under section 253-a is regarded as criminal or civil -- Code of Criminal Procedure (&sect; 517-a) does not prevent challenge</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> to constitutionality of procedure authorized by section 253-a.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Section 253-a of the Code of Criminal Procedure authorizes the grand jury to submit a report to the court concerning noncriminal misconduct or neglect in office by a public officer or employee.  Although the State Constitution does not itself vest the grand jury with power to make a report charging non-criminal misconduct, it does not prohibit the enactment of legislation authorizing such a report.  Nothing in section 6 of article I or section 1 of article III of the Constitution warrants invalidation of this statute.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The demands of due process and a regard for fundamental fairness dictated that the evidence before the Grand Jury relating to the appellants should have been made available to them not only before they went forward with their appeals but before they were required to file their answers.  Unless the grand jury minutes contain matter that must be kept confidential or unless disclosure of those minutes would be inimical to the public interests, the motions to inspect the minutes should have been granted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The appeal, taken both by permission (Code Crim. Pro., &sect; 520) and as of right ( CPLR 5601, subd.  [b]), is properly before the Court of Appeals, whether the proceeding under section 253-a be regarded as criminal or civil.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. While section 517-a of the Code of Criminal Procedure recites that the Appellate Division in such a proceeding &quot;shall be the sole court having jurisdiction of * * * an appeal&quot; and that its order &quot;shall not be subject to [further] review&quot; (subd. 7), that provision was intended merely to limit further review and consideration as to the sufficiency of the evidence supporting the grand jury's report and not to preclude and prevent a challenge to the constitutionality of the procedure authorized by section 253-a.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, as proprietor of an art gallery, publicly displayed sculptures that prominently incorporated the American flag in their expression of protest against the Vietnam War. He was convicted of violating the state's flag desecration statute, and the intermediate appellate court affirmed that judgment. On appeal the court affirmed, holding that the statute did not violate defendant's First Amendment right of free speech. Whether or not defendant thought so, the acts portrayed in the sculptures dishonored the flag, and the trial court could have properly found that implicit in the invitation to view the sculptures was the opportunity to join in the protest, or in counter-protest, with the consequent potential of public disorder. The court agreed with the trial court's conclusion that the legitimate interest of public peace that the statute was designed to protect was threatened by the violation of which defendant was convicted. Although defendant may have held a sincere ideological viewpoint, he was required to find ways to express it that did not violate a valid law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Defendant, proprietor of an art gallery who publicly displayed and exposed for sale, certain constructions, comparable to sculptures,  which had been fashioned, as protests against the Vietnam war, out of the American flag, was properly found guilty of violating paragraph d of subdivision 16 of section 1425 of the former Penal Law, which proscribes the public defilement of the American flag by act.  The statute here involved does not impinge on defendant's right of free speech under the First Amendment. Defendant may express his ideas but may not break a valid law to do so.  The flag desecration statute is aimed at keeping the public peace. The public peace was threatened by defendant's violations.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of New York in the Second Judicial Department, which affirmed a judgment of the trial court convicting defendant, on his plea of guilty, of attempted burglary in the third degree. Defendant's motion to suppress the evidence because of an unlawful search was denied.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A policeman saw defendant and his companion enter and later leave an apartment building carrying a bag. Upon being questioned, defendant told police that he did not know what was in the bag. He said that he got it around the block and took police to the apartment where the lock to the door was broken. Defendant was arrested and indicted for attempted burglary in the third degree. The trial court denied defendant's motion to suppress the evidence because of an unlawful search. The appellate division affirmed this judgment. On appeal, the court held that there was no violation of defendant's Fourth Amendment rights or N.Y. Code Crim. Proc. &sect; 180-a. There existed reasonable grounds to arrest defendant, at least for larceny, from the moment defendant made the highly suggestive answer that he did not know what was in the bag he had just carried out of the house. The police only asked questions until the answers themselves gave probable cause for a search and detention. The professional experience of the police dictated, to a large extent, what was unusual enough to warrant inquiry.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- attempted burglary -- police inquiry -- policeman observed defendant and another enter apartment building, empty handed, and when they came out carrying suitcase and shopping bag, officer made inquiries -- as result of questioning and investigation, he found that material in bags belonged to tenant in apartment -- Code of Criminal Procedure (&sect; 180-a), which authorizes police officer to stop citizen and question him where he has reasonably grounded suspicion, does not limit previously existing broader common-law basis for police inquiry -- inquiry here was lawful -- no violation of defendant's constitutional rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While on patrol a policeman observed defendant and another man enter an apartment building empty handed. A short time later, he saw the two men coming out of the building carrying a suitcase and a shopping bag. The officer asked the men what was in the package and, as a result of his questioning and subsequent investigation, he found that the material in the bags belonged to a tenant in one of the apartments. Defendant and his companion were arrested and indicted.  Section 180-a of the Code of Criminal Procedure which authorizes a police officer to stop a citizen and demand of him certain specific explanatory information where there is a reasonably grounded suspicion that the citizen is or was committing or will commit a felony or certain serious misdemeanors does not prescribe the full scope of police activity. It should not be read to narrow down the normal duty of police to find out by suitable inquiry what is happening in the public streets. The right of inquiry upon grounds less compelling than those which would justify an arrest and less compelling than those stated in the statute was a previously existing common-law basis for police inquiry. This right continues and is not impaired by the provisions of the statute.  The inquiry in this case itself was lawful and the answers to the inquiry afforded sufficient ground to look further.  There was no violation of defendant's constitutional rights. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the First Judicial Department (New York) reversed the decision of the trial court denying appellant husband's motion to dismiss the complaint and granting respondent wife's cross motion.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The two actions were brought about because the couples had been living apart for more than two years. The appellate court had held in both cases that N.Y. Dom. Rel. Law &sect; 170(5) did not apply to pre-existing judgments of separation. The court held that the legislature intended that &sect; 170(5) should be applied retroactively in the sense of encompassing pre-1966 decrees and that it did not offend due process, the equal protection of the law, or any other constitutional provision. The court held that the operative fact was that the parties had actually lived apart for two years after September 1, 1966, pursuant to separation decrees. The court held that equal protection rights were not violated by making &sect; 170(5) prospective because the differentiation between a party to a pre-1966 separation decree and a party to a pre-1966 separation agreement rested upon some rational consideration which was not arbitrary. The court also noted that a marriage was not a contract for the purposes of the Contracts Clause of the United States Constitution.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Husband and wife -- divorce -- retroactive application of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">statute</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> -- section 170 (subd. [5]) of Domestic Relation Law, which provides as grounds for granting divorce that husband and wife have lived apart for two years after grant of separation judgment or decree intended to apply</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> retroactively -- immaterial whether party is &quot;innocent&quot; or &quot;guilty&quot; -- no vested rights of defendant wife adversely affected and no denial of due process -- no denial of equal protection of laws where Legislature distinguished between decrees and agreements -- no </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">unconstitutional</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> impairment of contract rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Section 170 (subd. [5]) of the Domestic Relations Law provides, as grounds for granting a divorce, that a husband and wife have lived apart for a period of two years (subsequent to September 1, 1966, L. 1966, ch.  254, &sect; 15) after the granting of a separation judgment or decree (L. 1966, ch. 254, eff. Sept. 1, 1967).  The provisions of subdivision (5) are available where the decree was rendered prior to the enactment of the new statute. The Legislature intended that subdivision (5) of section 170 of the Domestic Relations Law should be applied, retroactively, in the sense of encompassing pre-1966 decrees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. It makes no difference whether it is the &quot;innocent&quot; or &quot;guilty&quot; party who seeks to convert the judicial separation into a final divorce. The Legislature intended to abandon the traditional fault approach to divorce and permit the termination of marriages even where both parties are at fault -- except in cases of adultery (Domestic Relations Law, &sect; 171).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Marital rights have always been treated as inchoate or contingent and may be taken away by legislation before they vest.  A wife's prospective right of inheritance is inchoate, expectant and does not become vested until the death of her husband.  A spouse has no vested rights in the marital status or in social security or pension benefits.  The State, having the power directly to limit or abolish rights of succession to the property of a living person, may do so indirectly by providing a new ground for divorce. Since no vested rights of the defendants have been adversely affected, there has been no denial of due process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The Legislature, by making subdivision (5) retroactive and subdivision (6), which involves separation agreements, prospective, did not unreasonably differentiate between a party to a pre-1966 separation decree and a party to a pre-1966 separation agreement. There is no denial of equal protection of the laws since the differences between separation decrees and separation agreements justify the distinction which has been made.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. The statute did not unconstitutionally impair contract rights.  Marriage is not a contract within the meaning of the provision of the Federal Constitution which prohibits the impairment by the States of the obligation of contracts.  </SPAN></P>
