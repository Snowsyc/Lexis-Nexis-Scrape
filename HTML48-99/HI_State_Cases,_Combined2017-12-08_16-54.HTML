</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court entered judgment in favor of plaintiffs-appellees, ruling that the sex-based classification in Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 572-1 (1985) was unconstitutional by virtue of being in violation of the equal protection clause of Haw. Const. art. I, &sect; 5, and that the Department of Health was therefore enjoined from denying an application for a marriage license because applicants were of the same sex. Subsequently, the state legislature amended the state constitution, investing in the legislature the power to reserve marriage to opposite sex couples. On appeal, the court held that the marriage amendment validated &sect; 572-1 by taking the statute out of the ambit of the equal protection clause of the Hawai'i Constitution, at least insofar as the statute, both on its face and as applied, purported to limit access to the marital status to opposite-sex couples.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the circuit court was reversed and the case remanded for entry of judgment in favor of appellant-defendant; the marriage amendment rendered the plaintiffs' complaint moot.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, who was charged with murder and other offenses, was deemed incompetent to stand trial due to mental disability. The trial court, after finding appellant incompetent, granted appellee state health department's motion to forcibly administer antipsychotic medications. On appeal, the trial court's order was affirmed. The court noted that although individuals retain the statutory right to decline to be administered medications, the statute in question expressly exempted involuntary medication pursuant to a court order. As to appellant's federal and state constitutional rights to bodily integrity, the court observed that precedent held that involuntary medication was permitted if it was established, by clear and convincing evidence, that the subject was a physical danger to himself or others, if the treatment was in the subject's medical interest, and if less intrusive measures were inadequate. Since those matters were established here, presumably by clear and convincing evidence, the trial court's order was appropriate.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff owned two boats in poor condition, which were impounded and eventually destroyed. Plaintiff sued defendant state and defendant state officials, arguing that his right to procedural due process was violated, that the impoundment of one vessel was an unconstitutional taking, that he was entitled to damages against the defendant state officials pursuant to 42 U.S.C.S. &sect;1983, and that the defendants lacked statutory authority to charge an impoundment fee and a disposal fee. The trial court found in favor of the defendants and plaintiff sought review. The court vacated and remanded. It found that plaintiff's right to procedural due process was violated because he did not receive a hearing prior to the permanent deprivation of his property. However, the court found that the impoundment of one vessel was not a taking because the vessel was sinking and obstructing a waterway and its removal was a lawful exercise of the police power. Furthermore, plaintiff was not entitled to damages from the defendant officials because they had qualified immunity. Finally, the court found that the fees for impoundment and disposal were not authorized by statute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant vacation club challenged the Tax Appeal Court's decision to affirm administrative denial of appellant's challenge to taxes that appellee county assessed against appellant's property. Appellant claimed that the taxes, which were assessed according to a differential tax rate structure, were improper because Haw. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 248-2 (Michie 1993) required the county to maintain a single rate of property tax.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant vacation club challenged the taxes that appellee county assessed against appellant's property. The county assessed taxes according to a new classification system that included a differential tax rate structure. Appellant claimed that Haw. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 248-2 (Michie 1993) required the county to maintain a single rate of property tax. According to appellant, although Haw. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 246A-2 (Michie 1993) transferred real property taxation power to the counties, &sect; 246A-2 did not by implication repeal &sect; 248-2. The Tax Board of Review and tax appeal court ruled for appellee, holding that Haw. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 3 granted the county all powers related to real property taxation, including the power to set differential rates. The state supreme court affirmed, explaining that although &sect; 248-2 precluded differential tax rates, both art. VIII, &sect; 3 and &sect; 246A-2 were enacted later in time. Because art. VIII, &sect; 3 and &sect; 246A-2 embraced the entire law on the matter of property taxation, &sect; 248-2, which was in conflict with them, was repealed by implication. As a result, appellant's challenge to the tax assessment notices was properly denied.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">State supreme court affirmed administrative and lower court rulings to deny appellant's challenge to taxes that appellee county assessed against its property. Although one statute precluded the differential tax rate structure that appellant challenged, other statutes, which were enacted later in time, allowed the county to establish such a structure. The earlier statute was repealed by implication, so appellant's challenge was properly denied.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of harassment for slapping his biological son in the face, after becoming angry and yelling at him, for the son's repeated refusal to come when called. The reviewing court reversed his conviction, holding that, as a matter of law, his slap was not disproportionate to the misconduct being punished. The reviewing court first determined that defendant retained the right to invoke the parental discipline defense under Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 703-309(1), where he retained visitation rights with his son and was visiting him at the time of the incident underlying his harassment charge because the right to discipline during a period of visitation was a residual parental right under Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 571-2. The reviewing court then held that the prosecution adduced insufficient evidence to negate defendant's parental discipline defense. Specifically, the court held that it could not agree with the family court's assessment, that, as a matter of law, a single, mild slap to the face was not reasonably proportional to a child's refusal to come when repeatedly directed to do so.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed defendant's conviction of harassment, holding that the prosecution failed to adduce sufficient evidence to rebut defendant's parental discipline defense where defendant, a noncustodial parent with visitation rights, mildly slapped his child on the face for his repeated refusal to come when called and the prosecution failed to disprove this defense beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>

Defendant filed a motion in his criminal case to enjoin enforcement of a local ordinance which provided for collection of a fee from persons convicted of misdemeanors and felonies. The trial court granted the motion and enjoined collection of the fee saying that the local government lacked the authority to assess a tax. The city appealed, arguing that the charge was a fee authorized by Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 46-1.5(8). The court affirmed, holding that the charge was a tax rather than a fee. The court adopted a three part test for distinguishing permissible fees from impermissible taxes that involved analysis of whether the charge (1) applied to the direct beneficiary of a particular service, (2) was allocated directly to defraying the costs of providing the service, and (3) was reasonably proportionate to the benefit received. The court rejected the city's argument that defendants benefited from their conviction, but based its ruling on the fact that the funds collected were not devoted to the costs incurred, but instead could be diverted to the general fund.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the lower court's order enjoining the collection of a fee from defendant upon his conviction of a crime because the local government lacked the authority to collect such a charge. The charge was deemed to be a tax rather than a fee because the funds collected could benefit the city's general fund instead of being applied to defray the cost of a particular service.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, convicted of attempted second-degree murder by the First Circuit Court (Hawaii), sought reversal of her conviction on multiple grounds, primarily the trial judge's refusal to provide an extreme mental and emotional disturbance instruction and the accuracy of its attempted second-degree murder instruction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged her attempted second-degree murder conviction, raising multiple grounds for appeal. The court rejected all of appellant's contentions, and affirmed her conviction. Appellant's primary claims were that the trial court erroneously failed to instruct the jury, sua sponte, that they could convict appellant of attempted manslaughter resulting from extreme mental and emotional disturbance, and that the instruction for attempted second-degree murder was incorrect. The court held that there was insufficient evidence supporting an extreme mental and emotional disturbance manslaughter verdict, and thus the trial judge correctly refused to provide such an instruction. The court also overruled prior precedent, which required such an instruction whenever, as here, the accused asserted self-defense. Finally, the court held that the attempted second-degree murder instruction was accurate, and the mere fact that it diverged from the pattern instructions did not make it erroneous. Appellant's other claims were rejected without discussion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant's conviction for attempted second-degree murder was affirmed. An extreme mental and emotional disturbance instruction was inappropriate because she had failed to present evidence of such a condition, and the attempted second-degree murder instructions were accurate in all respects.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Police searched defendant's home on the strength of a search warrant, and seized an amount of crystal methamphetamine and several glass pipes. Defendant was charged with promoting a dangerous drug in the first degree and unlawful use of drug paraphernalia. At trial, defendant filed a motion to suppress the evidence seized under the search warrant on the ground that the warrant was unconstitutionally vague and overbroad. The trial court denied the motion and granted defendant permission to take an interlocutory appeal of the decision denying the motion to suppress. The court noted that the right of appeal in a criminal case was purely statutory and existed only when given by some constitutional or statutory provision. Hence, compliance with the methods and procedures prescribed by statute was obligatory. Haw. R. App. P. 4(b) governed the appellate process for criminal actions and required that the notice of interlocutory appeal be filed within 30 days. Because defendant's notice was filed 64 days after entry of the order denying her motion to suppress, it was dismissed as untimely.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiff alleged the rules were improperly promulgated, in excess of the statutory authority granted defendant and unconstitutional. Plaintiff's complaint was dismissed.

The court found that, although the amendment granted defendant authority to set GA benefit levels, the legislature's grant of authority was not a conveyance of unbridled discretion.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted defendant's petition for a writ of certiorari to review the decision from the Intermediate Court of Appeals (Hawaii), which affirmed the circuit court's findings of fact, conclusions of law, and order denying defendant's motion to dismiss a second degree murder charge based on an alleged violation of the Double Jeopardy Clause of the United States and Hawaii Constitutions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with second degree murder, but a jury found him guilty of manslaughter due to extreme mental or emotional disturbance (EMED manslaughter) pursuant to Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 707-702(2). The conviction was reversed due to trial error. On remand, the circuit court denied defendant's motion to dismiss, which was based on an allegation that a new trial violated Haw. Const. art. I, &sect; 10 and U.S. Const. amend. V. The court held that, because the EMED manslaughter conviction was deemed an acquittal of murder, double jeopardy principles barred reprosecution for second degree murder but did not preclude a second trial for the included offense of reckless manslaughter. Defendant's successful use of the extreme mental or emotional disturbance defense entitled him to an acquittal of second degree murder, but made him criminally culpable for manslaughter. The court disagreed with the appellate court's conclusion that defendant could be retried for second degree murder, but if found guilty, his conviction was to be limited to EMED manslaughter. This judicial gerrymandering of the penal process was unconstitutional, as it subjected defendant to the embarrassment of a murder trial.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the term &quot;sell&quot; was defined in other statutes in the state and had a definite widely-understood meaning.

Defendant argued that &sect; 702-230 was an evidentiary provision and was, therefore, unconstitutional in its application because it deprived defendant of presenting relevant evidence regarding the requisite state of mind for the charged offense. He claimed that the trial court erred, inasmuch as it patterned the jury instruction on self-induced intoxication after the statute. The court affirmed defendant's convictions, holding that &sect; 702-230 was constitutional. The court noted that the trial court instructed the jury that self-induced intoxication could not be used to negate state of mind sufficient to establish the mens rea element of the offense. The court further noted that such an instruction, derived from &sect; 702-230, had been found to be constitutional by both the U.S. Supreme Court and by the court in an earlier opinion.

Consequently, appellant filed a personal injury action against appellee. The trial court entered summary judgment for appellee, finding that appellant's suit was precluded for failure to meet any of the tort threshold exceptions enumerated in Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 431:10C-306(b). Despite noting that &sect; 431:10C-306 could not survive constitutional challenge based on legislative declaration alone, the court affirmed because the statute did not violate the constitutional right to the equal protection of the laws as applied to persons ineligible for no-fault benefits. In the absence of &quot;suspect&quot; or &quot;quasi-suspect&quot; classifications, the court upheld &sect; 431:10C-306 because the legislature rationally could have believed that the statute would promote its objective of encouraging participation in the no-fault insurance system.</SPAN></P>

Appellees ordered that the construction be halted. Appellant challenged this finding on numerous grounds. The court found, inter alia, that the appellee director had correctly refused to make a declaratory ruling because at the time the issues raised by appellant were substantially the same as those being litigated in another action in connection with its variance application. Additionally, the court found that appellee director did not abuse its discretion in refusing to grant appellant's application for a variance because 1) the saddle shaped roof of the temple was not within the sprit of the zoning ordnance which allowed exemptions for spire like structures; 2) the height exceeded the allowable limit; 3) the temple would still have reasonable use of the land without a height variance; and 4) there was significant evidence that the neighbors objected to the height of the temple.</SPAN></P>

The trial court denied the motion and found the convicted criminal guilty. The court of appeals denied his appeal and the court grant certiorari. The court held that Haw. Rev.

The court found that the right to possess and use marijuana was not a &quot;fundamental&quot; right that was implicit in the concept of ordered liberty and a compelling state interest was not required. The convicted criminal failed to meet his heavy burden of demonstrating that &sect; 712-1249 lacked any rational basis and thus, the statute was presumed to be constitutional. Further, the right to privacy did not exist because the convicted criminal was not in the privacy of his own home when he was arrested for possession of marijuana.

The affirmed judgment held that the prosecution's anticipatory search warrant was constitutionally impermissible, having failed the first, fourth, and fifth prongs of a certain six-prong test.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The case involved a package of drugs sent by package, that an officer working on a narcotics detail intercepted at the airport prior to its delivery. Based on her belief that probable cause of criminal activity would exist after delivery of the parcel, the officer sought a warrant to search defendant's residence once a controlled delivery occurred. The prior court affirmed a judgment that held that the anticipatory search warrant failed to pass constitutional muster. Upon appeal, the court held that, without addressing constitutionality, that anticipatory search warrants were impermissible under Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 803-31 (1993) and Haw. R. Penal P. 41(a). The plain language of the statutes required that the articles were in the possession of the person whose premises were to be searched. The parcel containing the contraband drugs was (1) in the possession of the police officers at the time the search warrant was issued and (2) not with the person whose premises were to be searched. The expectation that the parcel would be at the premises at the time of the future search was insufficient under the plain wording of the statutes.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The police arrested defendant, who was in a pickup truck with three companions, shortly after an attempted robbery. After receiving defendant's consent to search the truck, an explosive device was recovered. Without giving Miranda warnings, a police officer asked defendant about the object. The trial court granted defendant's motion to suppress the statements he gave to the police officer. On appeal, the court affirmed in part and reversed in part. The court held that the trial court properly granted defendant's motion to suppress the statements that he gave in response to the police officer's questions about the explosive device. The court found that defendant was subjected to a custodial interrogation without being informed of his rights under U.S. Const. amend. V and Haw. Const. art. I, &sect; 10. The court further held that &sect; 134-8 was not unconstitutionally vague or overbroad because the statute described with reasonable clarity the acts that it proscribed, was limited to the possession of items intended to be used as weapons, and did not infringe upon any constitutionally protected activity.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was originally charged with promoting a detrimental drug in the second degree and prohibited acts related to drug paraphernalia. The second count was dismissed. Defendant filed a motion to dismiss the first count. He argued that the charged crime, a misdemeanor, necessarily constituted a violation of the felony offense under Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 712-1247 (1993), and defendant's rights to due process and equal protection were violated when the prosecution was given the unfettered discretion to charge the identical conduct as a violation of either the felony or the misdemeanor offense. The district court dismissed the count, but the court vacated the order of the district court on appeal. The court held that defendant, who was charged with violating the misdemeanor offense, could not successfully claim a denial of his rights to due process and equal protection. Because defendant was charged with the misdemeanor offense and not the felony offense, he was not threatened with unbridled, capricious, or prejudicial prosecutorial discretion. Thus, his constitutional rights could not have been violated, and the district court erred in granting defendant's motion to dismiss.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants argued that the police failed to expressly demand entrance in violation of Hawaii's search warrant knock and announce statute, and that the police forced entry into the apartment of one of the defendants two seconds after the announcement in violation of their constitutional right against unreasonable searches and seizures. The court reversed the circuit court's order as well as defendants' respective judgments of conviction. The court held that the plain and unambiguous language of Haw. Rev.

The court explained that failure to do so rendered the entry illegal and required suppression of all of the evidence seized.

The director asked the court to conclude that financing agreements and related agreements developed in accordance with &sect; 37D would not constitute debt as that term was used in the Hawaii Constitution and would not be counted against the constitutional debt limit. The court concluded that because the legislature required a nonappropriation clause, future legislatures were not required and should not feel compelled to fund the financing agreements. The court determined the definition of bond indicated a bond was an instrument that required an unconditional payment and was a future, fixed obligation of the state. The court held the financing agreements, implemented in accordance with &sect; 37D and containing nonappropriation clauses and clauses that made clear to any participant or purchaser that the agreements were not unconditional obligations of the state, were not backed by the full faith and credit of the state.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Police seized contraband from defendant's apartment when they executed a search warrant for a multiple occupancy dwelling. Defendant filed a motion to suppress the contraband, claiming that because the door to his rented bedroom had been locked at the time of the search and seizure, his bedroom constituted a residential unit that was separate and distinct from the rest of the dwelling and, thus, he had a reasonable expectation of privacy within his bedroom that was beyond the scope of the search warrant. The trial court granted defendant's motion to suppress. On appeal, the court vacated the suppression order and remanded. The court found that the warrant utilized to search defendant's bedroom was constitutionally valid at the time of its issuance. The court further concluded that the search warrant was valid with respect to defendant's bedroom because objective facts available to the police officers at the time they obtained the search warrant did not reasonably suggest that the bedroom was a residential unit that was separate and distinct from the remainder of the dwelling.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the handgun was not suppressible. According to the court, statutory and case law authorized the police to arrest defendant for DWOL. The court determined that Haw. Rev. Stat. ch. 286 and 803 provided for citation arrests and custodial arrests. The court also determined that Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 803-5, 803-6, and 286-10 authorized police officers to order individuals out of vehicles for traffic criminal offenses, but not for traffic violations. According to the court, DWOL was a traffic-related criminal offense. Therefore, the court held that the police officer's exit order was lawful insomuch as defendant had committed a criminal offense. Accordingly, the court held that the handgun was not suppressible because it was not sighted in plain view after the police officer properly ordered defendant out of his vehicle.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that the lower court was correct in concluding that the statute of limitations for conspiracy to commit murder was three years, but that it erred in concluding that the statutory scheme failed to give notice of the applicable statute of limitations. The court found that the statutory scheme gave clear and unambiguous notice to persons of reasonable intelligence that, for sentencing purposes, conspiracy to commit second degree murder was a class C felony and subject to the sentencing provisions of Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 706-660. Therefore, the court found that the statutory scheme governing the offense of conspiracy to commit second degree murder was not unconstitutionally vague. The offense of conspiracy to commit murder in the second degree as charged terminated upon the death of the victim, and it was from that date that the three-year statute of limitations began to run. Defendants were indicted approximately 3 years and 11 months following the death. The court therefore affirmed the trial court's order dismissing count III of the amended indictment with prejudice for failure to bring the charge timely.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was indicted on charges of attempted rape, attempted murder, attempted sodomy, kidnapping, and sexual assault.

On appeal of the ICS's decision to vacate and remand the trial court's order, the court reversed. The court found that the trial court's denial of defendant's discharge motion was proper. The court held that: (1) the allocation of the burden on defendant to prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, that he was no longer mentally ill or dangerous did not violate defendant's right to due process or equal protection of the laws; (2) there was sufficient evidence for the trial court to conclude that defendant had failed to prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, that he was no longer mentally ill or dangerous; and (3) although the trial court misapplied the standard of proof and put the burden of proof on the state, the error was harmless and actually benefited defendant.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the convictions, holding that defendant made no attempt after he took the appeal to reconstruct or modify the record or to cure inaudible trial transcript entries pursuant to Haw.

The term &quot;associated with&quot; contained in &sect; 842-2(3) was not unconstitutionally vague where a person of ordinary intelligence would know that by acting as a collection enforcer for a bookmaker for the purpose of collecting an unlawful debt, his conduct would constitute being &quot;associated with&quot; that enterprise. A proper foundation was laid for the prosecution to introduce evidence consisting of the names of alleged organized crime figures to impeach defendant's credibility.

The court affirmed the district court's affirmance of the lifetime revocation, because: (1) the director entered express written findings, which were supported by the record, that the licensee was subject to administrative driver's license revocation under HARDLA; (2) it was undisputed that, at the time of his arrest, his driving record showed 3 or more prior alcohol contacts during the 10 years preceding the date of that arrest, thus, he was a member of the class of persons enumerated in &sect; 286-261(b)(4); and (3) the director had no statutory alternative but to impose a lifetime revocation, and the written administrative record was not deficient in any respect.</SPAN></P>

Appellant's lawsuit sought a decree that appellee's designation of the acquifer as a water management area was improper. The trial judge dismissed appellant's lawsuit, finding it lacked jurisdiction. The court then affirmed. It held that contrary to appellant's understanding of the law, the proper method of challenging an adverse administrative ruling was to take an appeal to an appellate court, not to seek a declaratory judgment in a trial court. The time limits for seeking judicial review by an appellate court of appellee's decisions are set by statute, and they could be thwarted if a declaratory judgment action could be brought.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged his convictions and sentences for attempted murder, attempted manslaughter, and unlawful possession of a firearm. The court affirmed his attempted murder conviction, but reversed his attempted manslaughter convictions and his sentence for the firearm count. It held that appellant's speedy trial rights under state law were not violated, and that the trial judge's refusal to disclose to appellant's counsel the full name of venirepersons and their precise address was necessary due to prior jury tampering. Further, telephone calls to jurors advocating conviction did not impermissibly taint the verdict, and the trial court's evidentiary rulings were correct. However, appellant's attempted manslaughter convictions were overturned due to the fact that there was no such crime, and his firearms sentence was vacated owing to the fact that it was more severe than that imposed for the original conviction of that charge.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant state sought review of a judgment of the First Circuit Court (Hawaii), which granted defendant's motion to dismiss an indictment with prejudice as to the state's claim that he operated a crap game on a continuing basis in violation of the state's racketeering laws, under Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 842-2(3), 842-3 (1993).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The prosecution argued that the circuit court applied an incorrect definition of the term &quot;enterprise&quot; when it dismissed the indictment against defendant. The prosecution contended that the circuit court should have applied the statutory definition found in Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 842-1 rather than the definition found in federal common law. The prosecution argued that because the statutory definition was clear and unambiguous on its face, the circuit court should have applied the statute's plain meaning. The court affirmed the dismissal, concluding that there was no evidence that the crap game was part of an enterprise because the prosecution failed to satisfy the three elements required for a conviction under statutory or common law. The court held that the enterprise element distinguished Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 842-2 from the predicate offense accomplice liability, or conspiracy. In order to prove that defendant engaged in an enterprise, the prosecution was required to prove that the enterprise had a continuity of structure and personnel, as well as a structure that was distinct from the racketeering activity.</SPAN></P>

Defendants, journalists and the Office of Information Practices (OIP), intervened. The journalists filed, the First Circuit Court (Hawaii) granted summary judgment, denied it to OIP, and held that issues regarding the Uniform Information Practices Act could not be relitigated. The parties appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Uniform Information Practices Act (UIPA), Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 92-F, was designed to allow public access to government documents and &sect; 89-19 (1993) was the state collective bargaining law. The court held that (1) &sect; 92F-1 was not a conflicting statute on the same subject matter as the collective bargaining law, within the meaning of &sect; 89-19, and was not preempted by &sect; 89-19 or any collective bargaining agreement (CBA); (2) a condition of employment cannot be subject to negotiated agreement if the agreement would require a public employer to fail to perform a duty imposed upon it by statute; (3) the confidentiality provision in the CBA with the city prevented the police from performing its duties under the UIPA and was unenforceable; (4) whether the CBA prohibited disclosure of disciplinary records was not a genuine issue of material fact because it was the provisions of &sect; 92F-1, rather than those of the CBA that governed the duty of disclosure; and (5) the trial court erroneously denied the OIP's motion for summary judgment because there were no genuine issues of material fact and the OIP was entitled to judgment as a matter of law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed in part and vacated in part the grant of the journalists' summary judgment motion.

It vacated the trial court's order in the first case and granted in part and denied in part the OIP's motion for summary judgment. It allowed relitigation of the constitutionality of UIPA.</SPAN></P>

Defendant's motion to suppress statements and the cocaine was granted by the circuit court. The prosecution appealed. Upon review the court affirmed the circuit court. The court held that on the record, the officer who testified as to his reason for initially making an investigative stop of defendant lacked specific and articulable facts sufficient to warrant a person of reasonable caution in believing that defendant was engaged in criminal activity; thus, the officer was unjustified in initiating an investigative encounter with defendant. Further, the court held that the prosecution failed to satisfy its burden of proving that defendant voluntarily submitted to the investigative encounter. Rather, the court held that in light of the totality of the circumstances, the police officer placed defendant in a position that was inherently coercive, calculated to overbear defendant's will and critically impair his capacity for self-determination.</SPAN></P>

Defendant asserted that the circuit court erred in its refusal to instruct the jury on a lesser included offense, its denial of the motion to suppress, and its denial of the motion for a mental examination of the complaining witness.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of sexual assault in the third degree, in violation of &sect; 707-732(1)(b), of a 13 year old boy and appealed the conviction. On appeal, the court held that the circuit court did not err in refusing to instruct the jury on the lesser included offense of sexual assault in the fourth degree because sexual assault in the fourth degree was not included in the charged offense as defined by Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 701-109(4). The court stated that &sect; 707-732(1)(b) did not require proof that defendant had knowledge of the attendant circumstances of the victim's age, so the fact that defendant may not have known that the victim was 13 years old was not a rational basis for acquitting him of sexual assault in the third degree. The court held that the circuit court properly denied defendant's motion to suppress statements that defendant claimed were involuntarily given because the statements were given freely and voluntarily. The court ruled that the circuit court's denial of defendant's motion for a mental examination of the victim was not an abuse of discretion because there was no compelling reason given for a mental examination.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Three defendants were indicted on drug and conspiracy charges related to an alleged conspiracy to distribute marijuana and heroin. Officers from Hawaii were informed that in California, where an undercover transaction took place, no warrant was needed to video monitor a hotel room. The three defendants were extradited to Hawaii. The trial court granted the motion of two defendants to suppress evidence of the video taped encounter with Honolulu police because the warrantless video surveillance was a violation of Hawaiian law. The third defendant had the indictment against him dismissed because he allegedly committed no acts in furtherance of the conspiracy within the state of Hawaii. However, the appellate court, in reversing the lower court's decisions, held that the video surveillance was valid under the laws of California and there was no statute prohibiting the participation of Hawaii law enforcement in the warrantless surveillance outside of the jurisdiction of Hawaii. The appellate court also held that a collect call made by the third defendant was sufficient to find that the defendant committed an act in furtherance of the conspiracy within the state of Hawaii.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decedent, a disabled veteran, committed suicide. Before his death, he was seeing the counselor, who worked for the office of veterans' services and was not a trained or licensed psychiatrist or psychologist. The estate brought suit against the counselor and the state after the deceased's suicide and alleged that the counselor breached his duty to prevent or warn about the decedent's suicidal tendencies. The trial court disagreed and granted summary judgment to the counselor and the state because it found no duty on the part of the counselor. On appeal, the court affirmed the summary judgment and held that the counselor did not have a duty to prevent the suicide because the decedent was not in the custody of the counselor or the state. The court held that there was no duty to noncustodial clients regardless of whether their suicides were foreseeable. Because there was little state law focusing on the type of special relationship required to impose a duty to prevent a suicide, the court based its ruling largely on the authority of other states. The court also noted that public policy considerations supported the court's refusal to extend a duty to noncustodial counselors.</SPAN></P>

The prosecution also filed a claim for administrative forfeiture of defendant's car pursuant to the provisions of Haw. Rev. Stat. ch. 712A. Defendant failed to file a claim to the car and it was forfeited to the state. Defendant thereafter filed a motion to dismiss the criminal charges, claiming that the double jeopardy clauses of U.S. Const. amend. V and Haw. Const. art.

The court reversed, holding that jeopardy did not attach because defendant failed to file a claim to the car and thus never became a party to the in rem forfeiture proceeding. The court also determined that the double jeopardy clauses were inapplicable because forfeiture proceedings under ch. 712A were civil and the sanctions were not so punitive as to be essentially criminal in nature.</SPAN></P>

One officer then told defendant's mother that a search warrant &quot;could be gotten to search the house&quot; and that a search &quot;would be done anyway.&quot; While the officer stood in the doorway to defendant's bedroom and watched, the mother walked to a closet in the bedroom and retrieved a revolver. The trial court denied defendant's suppression motion and convicted him. On appeal, the appellate court reversed, granted the motion, and vacated the convictions, holding that the mother acted as a government agent, and her actions resulted in an unconstitutional warrantless search. On further appeal, the court affirmed, although it held that the appellate court improperly considered the motivation of the mother when determining whether the mother was a de facto agent for the government. Nevertheless, the court found that, under the totality of the circumstances, the mother did act as such an agent because the purpose of the statements was to convince her to retrieve the gun for the police without the aid of a warrant.</SPAN></P>

The officers discovered that defendant was staying in a hotel and was planning to leave the island.

When the door was opened, the officers saw defendant standing in the room and went after him. No force was used to gain entry to the room. Once defendant was handcuffed, the officers saw a white powdery substance in clear plastic bags. Defendant was charged with drug-related offenses and filed a motion to suppress on the grounds that the officers violated Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 803-11 (1993). The trial court granted the motion and the state appealed. The court reversed and remanded, holding that &sect; 803.11 was not implicated where entry was gained through an open door without force. The court also ruled that using a ruse to obtain entry was not unconstitutionally unreasonable and, thus, did not violate defendant's fourth amendment protections.

The court affirmed in part and reversed in part. The court held that: (1) the prosecution was not required to seek a judicial determination that the rented video was pornographic for minors, because it received the video from the minor's mother and did not seize it from the store; (2) the grand jury was presented sufficient evidence to conclude that the video appealed to prurient interest and lacked serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value; (3) defendant lacked standing to challenge the seizure of the search warrant evidence; and (4) even if the identification procedure was unduly suggestive, the minor's identification of defendant was sufficiently reliable, and, therefore, the circuit court erred in granting the motion to suppress pre-trial identification.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from his conviction by the Second Circuit Court (Hawaii) of the misdemeanor offense of unlawful possession of a firearm under Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 134-4(b) (1993). Defendant argued that &sect; 134-4(b), which required citizens to obtain a permit to possess a firearm, violated his individual right to keep and bear arms under the state and federal constitutions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An employee of a hotel found a pistol in the room where defendant had stayed. Defendant purchased the gun from the registered owner but never acquired a permit as required by &sect; 134-4(b), and he was thus convicted of unlawful possession of a firearm. The court first found the Second Amendment was inapplicable, as it was a limitation only upon the power of Congress and the federal government, and not upon that of the states. Then the court held that the right to bear arms under the Hawaii Constitution could be regulated by the state in a reasonable manner, and the requirement for a person to obtain a permit under Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 134-2 prior to acquiring a firearm was rationally related to the legitimate government interest of ensuring that only mature, law abiding, and competent citizens could possess firearms. Further, there was no authority to support defendant's assertion that requiring firearm permit applicants to provide certain personal information amounted to an unreasonable restriction of the constitutional right to bear arms. Thus, the court held that defendant had failed to meet his burden of showing unconstitutionality of the statute beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction of the offense of unlawful possession of a firearm without a permit.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A nurse working in a hospital's intensive care module suffered injuries while she assisted other staff members in subduing a violent patient. The nurse brought suit against the doctor who was in charge of the unit, alleging that he engaged in wilful and wanton misconduct by allowing the module to become overcrowded with patients and furniture. The court held that the circuit court erred in holding that the doctor was entitled to summary judgment on the nurse's claims. The plain meaning of the words used in the term &quot;wilful and wanton misconduct&quot; in Hawaii's workers' compensation statute,&nbsp;Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 386-8, included reckless conduct that did not require a specific intent to cause injury within its scope. The court held that allowing suits between co-employees based on reckless conduct did not contravene the purpose of co-employee immunity in Hawaii's workers' compensation scheme. Genuine issues of material fact existed regarding whether the doctor had knowledge of the risk of injury stemming from the alleged overcrowding, that he had knowledge that injury was a probable, as opposed to a possible, result of the danger and that he consciously failed to avoid the peril.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court vacated the circuit court's order granting summary judgment in favor of the doctor and remanded the cause for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The applicant applied to the HPC for a special management use permit in order to pursue the development of a resort complex. The shoreline organization opposed the issuance of a permit and requested contested case hearings. The HPC denied the request and issued the permit.

The HPC based its denial of contested case hearings on its belief that the shoreline organization and the individual did not have interests clearly distinguishable from those of the general public. First, the court determined that the lower court had jurisdiction to determine the issues raised in the case. The HPC argued that it had no obligation under the Coastal Zone Management Act (CZMA), specifically, Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 205A to consider the protection of traditional and customary Hawaiian rights. The court held that the interests asserted by the shoreline organization were protected by the CZMA. In addition, the HPC was obligated to protect customary and traditional rights under the Haw. Const. art. XII, &sect; 7 (1978). The court examined the specific relevant traditional rights.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was indicted for burglary in the first-degree and pled guilty. He was initially sentenced to probation for five years with conditions. Over the next seven years, the lower court granted the prosecution's four motions for revocation of probation, resentencing, and issuance of bench warrant. Defendant convinced the lower court to reconsider the first two sentences imposed against him. After several other procedural steps including denial of his motions, he sought review of the lower court's order granting the prosecution's motion to revoke his earlier probation sentence and resentencing him to probation with a special condition. He also sought review of the lower court's order revoking his earlier sentence and resentencing him to 10 years imprisonment. On appeal, the court affirmed the first order resentencing him to probation with a special condition, vacated the second order resentencing him to 10 years imprisonment, and remanded for a determination of the credit due defendant for time served. The court held that Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 706-623(2) pertained to periods of detention served following arrest and prior to the sentence imposed by the court in the first instance.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, defendant first argued that there was insufficient evidence to support her conviction. The court held that the evidence was sufficient for a reasonable trier of fact to have found her guilty. Defendant solicited an undercover police officer. Next, defendant contended that a geographic restriction that prohibited her from entering an area during the evening hours was unconstitutional because it was overbroad, vague, and ambiguous. The court determined that the geographic restriction was a part of defendant's bail and was not a part of her sentence. Hawaii Revised Statutes &sect; 804-7.1(2) gave the district court the authority to prevent defendant from going into certain described geographical areas. The court concluded that defendant presented no evidence that the restriction actually caused her harm. The restriction was sufficiently definite such that the average person was provided adequate notice of what behavior was prohibited. The court concluded that the restriction was valid.</SPAN></P>

In a retrial, defendant was found guilty of sexual assault in the third degree, in violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes &sect; 707-732(1)(b) (Supp. 1991), in a retrial by the First Circuit Court (Hawaii), and he appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with sexually assaulting his five-year old grandniece. Immediately after the incident, the child ran to her mother in an emotional state. Two days later, a police detective conducted an interview of the child that was videotaped. During the first trial, the victim, who was then seven years old, testified, and the circuit court denied the prosecution's motion to show the videotaped interview to the jury. At the retrial, the circuit court admitted the videotape as evidence pursuant to Hawaii Rules of Evidence 616(b) and 802.1(4) (1985). The victim was then cross-examined by the defense, and she testified that she could not recall some of the events. The prosecution was permitted to conduct a re-direct examination, and defendant was found guilty. The court reversed, holding that the use of the videotape violated defendant's rights under the Confrontation Clauses in Haw. Const. art. I, &sect; 14 and the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution. The right to a face-to-face confrontation could only be abridged where there was a case-specific finding of necessity, and the prosecution failed to prove that the victim was unavailable because of a lack of memory.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Housing Finance and Development Corporation (HFDC) of Hawaii sought to condemn properties belonging in fee to owners who only allowed leased fee interests of their properties. The HFDC brought actions under the Hawaii Land Reform Act, codified at Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 516 (1985 &amp; Supp. 1992 &amp; 1993 Comp.), which allowed such eminent domain proceedings. The trustees of the landowners contested the proceedings, but lost when the lower court granted partial summary judgment in all of the series of similar cases to the HFDC. On appeal, the trustees contested the constitutionality of the Act but the court affirmed the decisions. The court found that the Act was created to satisfy a public purpose, that being to provide the opportunity to allow more citizens to purchase fee simple estates. The court found that the few fee simple holders who refused to sell property but would lease it could be properly subject to eminent domain because the state's interest in fee simple ownership to more citizens was rationally related to such condemnation.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was convicted of promoting a dangerous drug in the second degree, in violation of Hawai'i Revised Statutes (HRS) &sect; 712-1242(1)(c).

The court held that &quot;to buy&quot; or &quot;to offer to buy&quot; did not fall within HRS &sect; 712-1240's definition of &quot;to distribute.&quot; Noticeably absent from the definition in &sect; 712-1240 was &quot;to buy&quot; or any of its obvious synonyms, e.g., &quot;to purchase&quot; or &quot;to acquire.&quot; Virtually all of the words the legislature used to define &quot;to distribute&quot; conveyed a sense of relinquishing possession, whereas &quot;buy&quot; meant to acquire possession.

The appellate court affirmed, determining that a presumption existed that the person whose property was damaged would not consent to the destruction of the property. Although the court held that the appellate court's reasoning was erroneous, the court affirmed defendant's conviction because a reasonable trier of fact could have concluded beyond a reasonable doubt that the prosecution had proved that defendant intentionally damaged the front door to an individual's apartment without that individual's consent. Lack of the individual's consent to the damage to his front door was a material element of the offense. The appellate court impermissibly shifted the burden of proof to defendant on the issue. At most, the proposition that a person whose property was allegedly damaged would not consent to the violent destruction of the property was a &quot;permissible inference of fact&quot; under HRE 306(a) (Hawaii), which the trier of fact was permitted, but not compelled, to draw from common experience and the evidence as a whole.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the judgment of the Second Circuit Court (Hawaii), which convicted defendant of two counts of theft in the first degree and one count of theft in the second degree pursuant to Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 708-830(6)(a) and sentenced him to concurrent and consecutive indeterminate terms of imprisonment and restitution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was an attorney, and the theft charges arose out of his misuse of clients' funds. On appeal, defendant alleged that &sect; 708-830(6)(a) was unconstitutional and that the trial court erred in imposing consecutive sentences. The court held that &sect; 708-830(6)(a) was neither unconstitutionally vague nor overbroad because the statute described with reasonable clarity the acts proscribed, provided fixed standards for adjudging guilt, and gave persons of ordinary intelligence a reasonable opportunity to know what conduct was prohibited. However, the court held that the trial court abused its discretion by sentencing defendant to consecutive indeterminate terms of imprisonment for the sole purpose of maximizing the supervisory power of the state parole authority over defendant in an attempt to facilitate the collection of the ordered restitution. The legislative history indicated that consecutive prison sentences were to be imposed only to achieve retributive, incapacitative, and deterrent objectives.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction, vacated his sentence, and remand the matter to the trial court for resentencing.</SPAN></P>

App. P. 14, plaintiff, the convention center authority, instituted an original proceeding against defendants, the state director of finance and several counties, seeking to obtain a determination as to whether the bonds authorized by the state legislature to build and operate a convention center would be exempt from the constitutional debt limit.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1993, the state legislature authorized a one percent increase in the transient accommodations tax (TAT) and reimbursable general obligation bonds for the development and construction of the proposed convention center. When the director refused to issue the bonds, the authority filed an original action in the state supreme court. The court held that the one percent increase in the TAT earmarked for financing the expenses associated with the development and construction of the state convention center was &quot;substantially derived&quot; from the convention center and, therefore, qualified as a &quot;user tax.&quot; Because the earmarked portion of the TAT qualified as a &quot;user tax,&quot; the revenue bonds authorized by the state legislature pursuant to &sect; 23 of Act 7 qualified for exclusion from the debt limit mandated by Haw. Const. art. VII, &sect; 13. The aforementioned holdings notwithstanding, the court further held that the reimbursable general obligation bonds did not qualify for exclusion under Haw. Const. art. VII, &sect; 13(6) because the convention center had not been constructed and in actual operation for at least one fiscal year.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In an original proceeding brought by the authority, the court held that the one percent increase in the TAT qualified as a &quot;user tax&quot; that was exempt from the constitutional debt limit, but the reimbursable general obligation bonds were not so exempt.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant filed a petition for a writ of certiorari to the Intermediate Court of Appeals (Hawaii), which reversed defendant's drug-related convictions, affirmed his conviction for driving without a license in violation of Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 286-102 (Supp. 1992), and vacated and remanded for a new trial the conviction for driving without no-fault insurance in violation of Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 431:10C-104 (Spec.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When defendant was stopped for a traffic offense, the officer discovered that defendant did not have a driver's license or a no-fault insurance card and was carrying drugs and drug paraphernalia. Defendant was driving a friend's vehicle and assumed the friend had insurance. Defendant was convicted of drug charges, driving without a license, and driving without no-fault insurance. The appellate court reversed the drug convictions, affirmed the driving without a license conviction, and vacated and remanded the driving without insurance conviction. Defendant filed a petition for a writ of certiorari, which the court granted. The court reversed the driving without insurance conviction, vacated and remanded for further proceedings the driving without a license conviction, and left undisturbed the reversal of the drug convictions. The court overruled its previous interpretation of the lack of knowledge defense and concluded that the state was required to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant actually knew that the vehicle was uninsured at the time he was operating it. Because the state had not done this, defendant's conviction for driving without no-fault insurance was in error.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted defendant's application for writ of certiorari, affirmed the appellate court's reversal of defendant's drug convictions, reversed the driving without no-fault insurance conviction, and vacated and remanded the driving without a license conviction. On remand, the lower court was directed to determine whether the officer had had an objectively reasonable suspicion that the muffler ordinance had been violated.</SPAN></P>

That man implicated himself and placed responsibility for the robbery on defendant. After being arrested, defendant initialed a written waiver of Miranda warnings.

Defendant sought unsuccessfully to suppress the confession. Defendant pleaded no contest to robbery in the second degree under Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 708-841 (1991) subject to this appeal. The court affirmed the conviction. The court held that the fact that defendant had a learning disability did not make a waiver involuntary. The court did not believe defendant's allegation that the officer had threatened him. The court also held that the trial court did not err in finding that defendant did not invoke his right to remain silent. The testimony was conflicting and the trial court believed the detectives.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowners' property was zoned as &quot;country&quot; and any commercial eating establishments were prohibited. Three times a zoning inspector observed a lunch wagon operating on the property. The landowners were issued a notice that described the violation, ordered correction thereof, and assessed fines for noncompliance. The violation was affirmed on administrative appeal and was later affirmed by the lower court. The court also affirmed and determined that the landowners filed a timely notice of appeal, pursuant to Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 91-14(b) (1985). The court determined that an agency's conclusions of law were reviewed under the clearly erroneous standard if it involved a mixed question of facts and law. The issuance of the violation and assessment of fines prior to administrative and judicial review did not violate the landowners' due process rights because they were afforded a meaningful opportunity to be heard. The constitutional &quot;tolling&quot; doctrine did not apply because the fines challenged were not triggered by the pursuit of the review process.

The court rejected the employee's claim that his discharge violated the public policy of Hawaii against employment discrimination. The court found that the employee failed to adduce any evidence that the employer acted unreasonably in the course of discharging him.

After a trial de novo, the lower court entered judgment in favor of defendant and imposed monetary sanctions against plaintiffs pursuant to Haw. Arb.

On appeal, the court ruled that the lower court did not err by denying plaintiff's motion for directed verdict and a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict because defendant's liability was a question of fact. The lower court did not abuse its discretion by denying plaintiff's motion for a new trial because the jury verdict was not against the manifest weight of the evidence. The lower court properly imposed sanctions because plaintiff was the nonprevailing party and there was no abuse of discretion in assessing the sanctions.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant met his estranged wife, their two children, and the wife's friends in a parking lot and tried to take his son from the wife by force. A fight ensued between defendant and one of the wife's friends in which the friend was beaten. Defendant was convicted of assault, and the conviction was affirmed. Defendant filed a petition to set aside or correct the judgment, alleging that he was denied effective assistance of counsel, and he requested court-appointed counsel. The petition and request were denied, and defendant appealed. The court affirmed, holding that the petition was correctly denied without an evidentiary hearing. Defendant failed to show that his trial counsel's alleged errors in the discovery and exclusion of photographs and failure to develop evidence on defendant's physical impairment resulted in prejudice to defendant. Defendant, not his counsel, had precluded discovery of his son's observations of the fight. The court did not consider issues raised for the first time on appeal. Newly discovered evidence did not present a colorable claim. Defendant failed to show that the trial court's findings on trial counsel's alleged intoxication were clearly erroneous.</SPAN></P>

The revocation was affirmed by both an administrative hearing, and then by the district court. On appeal, the court affirmed and held that: (1) Haw. Const. art.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The First Circuit Court (Hawaii) reserved questions of law for the state supreme court, pursuant to Haw. App. R. 15, to determine whether 1993 Haw. Sess. Laws 179 properly eliminated the right to a jury trial for first time offenders for driving under the influence of intoxicating liquor and whether the new law applied retroactively to the defendants. One defendant sought a writ of mandamus to challenge the law in the supreme court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants requested jury trials for their individual cases of first-offense driving under the influence of intoxicating liquor (DUI), Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 291-4 (1985). Later, the legislature amended the statute to lower the penalty for first offense and retroactively eliminated the right to a jury trial. The prosecution filed a motion to remand defendants' cases for bench trials. The trial court consolidated the cases and reserved issues of law, whether the new law eliminated the right to jury trial in first offenses and whether such elimination applies retroactively, pursuant to Haw. App. R. 15, to the supreme court. The court decided that the new law did eliminate the right to a jury trial and that the law did apply retroactively. The court determined that the first offense DUI was a petty offense, for which the Sixth Amendment guarantee of a jury did not apply. The reduction in the length of the sentence avoided an ex post facto difficulties. Finally, the retroactive statute also survived equal protection problems because, under the rational basis test, the court found a rational relationship to a legitimate government interest, the overloaded DUI docket for first offenders.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court answered in the affirmative the questions whether the new law eliminated jury trials for first offenders driving under the influence of intoxicating liquor and eliminated the trials retroactively. The court dismissed the writ of mandamus sought by one defendant. The court determined that the retroactive elimination of jury trials for petty offenses did not violate the Sixth Amendment, due process or equal protection.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with the murder of his step-father and was convicted by a jury. On appeal, the conviction was reversed and defendant was subsequently convicted of a murder a second time in a non-jury trial. After defendant's appeal was denied, he filed for post-conviction relief and after an evidentiary hearing was held, the circuit court denied defendant's petition and the court affirmed. The court found that defendant was not denied effective assistance of counsel at trial because the evidence showed that his waiver of a jury trial was knowing and voluntary. The court determined that defendant was not denied effective assistance of counsel on appeal because the evidence that counsel should have allegedly objected to was admissible. The court concluded that although the circuit court erred by failing to state appropriate findings of fact and conclusions of law, a review of the evidence, including defendant's testimony showed that the error was harmless. The court found that the retrial after the reversal of defendant's original conviction for trial error did not violate the constitutional protection against double jeopardy.</SPAN></P>

Appellants, prosecutor and city, successfully moved for summary judgment on all claims. The court held that appellee prosecutor had absolute prosecutorial immunity from 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 liability because the alleged violations occurred while appellant was acting within the scope of his prosecutorial duties. The court held that the doctrine of respondeat superior was inapplicable in the context of &sect; 1983 claims, so appellee prosecutor's immunity did not relieve appellee city's liability based upon allegations that its policies and customs are responsible for a deprivation of rights protected by the constitution. However, appellants failed to demonstrate that appellee city acted in complete indifference to the rights of incarcerated defendants awaiting trial, therefore summary judgment was proper.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When appellee district attorney (DA) disclosed investigative results about appellant kingpin, the kingpin and associates sued him and his employers, the city, the county, and two individuals (city), under the Fair Information Practice Law (FIPL), Haw. Rev. Stat. ch. 92(E). After a defense verdict in the First Circuit Court (Hawaii), the kingpin appealed the denial of judgment n.o.v. (JNOV) and new trial motions on his claims against the city.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">During the DA's campaign for Congress, he publicly decried the kingpin as a &quot;godfather&quot; and allegedly disclosed unflattering items from official criminal files. The kingpin sued him and the city claiming FIPL violations. After defense verdicts, the lower court granted a new trial on claims against the DA but denied motions for JNOV or a new trial on claims against the city. On the kingpin's appeal, the court affirmed. It rejected claims that liability under the FIPL &sect; 92E-11(c) was required to have been decided by the court, not the jury, ruling that the city had a right to a jury trial. The court held that the statutory claim, which pertained to an invasion of privacy, was a suit at common law under Haw. Const. art. I, &sect; 3 because the relief sought was legal, not equitable. Moreover, any right that the kingpin had to a non-jury trial had been waived. The court also rejected the kingpin's claim that the grant of a new trial on his claims against the DA required the same result as to his claims against the city. The two rulings were not inconsistent because the lower court had found that sufficient evidence existed that the DA's acts were outside the scope of his employment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court noted that the case was a question of first impression: what were the constitutional constraints placed upon the state's power to prosecute a criminal defendant for the offense of &quot;harassment,&quot; in violation of &sect; 711-1106(1)(b), by the &quot;fighting words&quot; doctrine. The issue arose in the context of the minor's claim that the evidence presented at his adjudication hearing, pursuant to the petition filed by the state, was insufficient to permit the district family court to adjudge him a law violator. The court reversed and remanded for dismissal of the petition. The court found that the evidence was insufficient as a matter of law to establish that the minor violated &sect; 711-1106(1)(b). The court opined that, whatever the minor's intent may have been, the minor's challenge to the officer was not uttered in a manner likely to provoke a violent response on the officer's part, therefore, as a matter of law, there was insufficient evidence to support the adjudication of harassment.</SPAN></P>

The question was certified from the United States District Court for the District of Hawaii as to whether Honolulu, Haw., Rev. Ordinances &sect; 38-1.2 (Apr. 1992 Rev.) (ordinance) conflicted with the statutes.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trustees were in favor of preemption while defendants, a city and county, were not. The ordinance provided for the condemnation of a lessor's leased fee interest in leasehold condominiums, cooperative housing, and planned unit developments, and the transfer of such fee simple interests to lessees. The court found that, according to state law, the ordinance was not preempted by Haw. Rev. Stat. chs. 46, 101, 516, 516D, 519, 514A, or 421H, as interpreted in conjunction with the Hawaii Constitution. Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 46-61, 46-62, and 101-2 neither limited the counties' general power of eminent domain nor divested them of the authority to enact ordinances allowing for the condemnation of land for any particular public purpose. The city did not impermissibly delegate its power of eminent domain. The ordinance did not cover the same subject matter embraced within a comprehensive state statutory scheme disclosing an express or implied intent to be exclusive and uniform throughout the state. Nor did the ordinance conflict with state law on the basis that it entered an area fully occupied thereby or that it was duplicative with respect thereto.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of orders of the Intermediate Court of Appeals (Hawaii), which affirmed the trial court's denial of a motion to suppress evidence and defendant's conviction for one count of promoting a dangerous drug in the first degree in violation of Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 712-1241(1)(a)(i) (Supp. 1992) and one count of promoting a dangerous drug in the second degree in violation of Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 712-1242(1)(b)(i) (Supp. 1992).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The charges against defendant arose from an encounter with a police officer at the airport, shortly after his arrival. The officer approached defendant and after identifying himself, asked to see defendant's ticket and driver's license. The officer first searched defendant's luggage, and then asked for consent to search his person. When defendant refused, the officer initiated a drug dog sniff, which alerted to a package of cocaine and heroin strapped to defendant's back. The circuit court's refusal to suppress that evidence was affirmed by the appellate court. On appeal, the court vacated the convictions because the evidence, seized without probable cause, should have been suppressed. Defendant was seized when he was advised that the officer was investigating drug smuggling and asked to produce his ticket and identification. The search might have been constitutional, if defendant had consented to the seizure. However, as he was given no opportunity to decline the encounter, he could not have consented to either the seizure or the search. Because the encounter met none of the other exceptions to the warrant requirement, the search violated Haw. Const. art. I, &sect; 7.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court vacated defendant's convictions, reversed the order denying his motion to suppress, and remanded to the circuit court for the entry of an order dismissing the charges against him. In addition, the court ordered depublication of the appellate court's opinion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant food importer challenged a judgment from a tax appeal court (Hawaii), which granted in part and denied in part the food importer's motion for summary judgment in an action contesting the constitutionality of Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 237-24(18)(C) (1992). Although appellee state tax director later conceded the statute was unconstitutional, the tax appeal court denied the food importer's motion for sanctions pursuant to Haw. R. Civ. P. 11.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The food importer challenged a judgment that granted in part and denied in part its motion for summary judgment in an action contesting the constitutionality of general excise taxes (GET) and use taxes made by the state tax director on the sale and use of certain imported food products. The food importer contended that the assessment was illegal because sales of competing local products were exempt pursuant to Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 237-24(18)(C) (1992). The tax appeal court found that the statute was unconstitutional, but denied the food importer's motion for sanctions, which argued that the director was aware that the tax was unconstitutional. The tax appeal court also limited the food importer's remedy to the difference between the GET it paid and the GET it would have paid. The tax appeal court also held that the food importer was not entitled to a use tax refund. While affirming the judgment as to the use tax, the appellate court vacated and reversed all other aspects of the judgment because the tax appeal court abused its discretion in denying sanctions and erred in quantifying the refund to which the food importer was entitled by way of summary judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed that part of the judgment that held that the food importer failed to prove the use tax was discriminatory. Holding the food importer was entitled to a refund of taxes on sales of food consumed out-of-state, the court reversed other aspects of the judgment because there was an issue of fact as to the amount of the food consumed out-of-state. The court also held that the food importer was entitled to sanctions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state appealed the dismissal of defendant's indictment by the circuit court. Because the court agreed with the state that the circuit court committed reversible error, the court vacated the circuit court's order granting defendant's motion to dismiss and remanded for further proceedings. The court held that the circuit court was incorrect, and therefore erred, when it concluded that Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 707-716 required a threat to be communicated &quot;directly or indirectly&quot; to the target thereof and that communication of the threat to a third party was insufficient as a matter of law to establish that terroristic threatening had been committed. The court held that the evidence presented to the grand jury was sufficient to support the charges of terroristic threatening as set forth in the indictment. The court further held that defendant's statements to his fellow teachers were not protected by the right of free speech guaranteed by the first amendment to the United States Constitution.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. &sect; 602-5 (1985, Supp. 1992) to seek public access to the lists of nominees submitted to the governor and chief justice of the Hawaii Supreme Court (appointing authorities) for the filling of judicial vacancies (lists).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The JSC denied the applicant's request for the lists on the grounds that Haw. Judicial Selection Comm'n R. 7 (1992) prevented their disclosure. The applicant claimed that Rule 7 was unconstitutional under Haw. Const. art. VI, &sect; 4, which only required that the commission's deliberations were to be confidential. The court ruled against the applicant regarding the lists' disclosure by the JSC because they were confidential. The court reasoned that the framers' intent of &sect; 4 was not proven beyond a reasonable doubt to require the lists' disclosure and that their confidentiality encouraged the non-partisan selection of judicial appointees. Thus, Haw. Judicial Selection Comm'n R. 7 (1992) constrained the JSC from the lists' disclosure. However, the court ruled for the applicant in that Rule 7 did not apply to the appointing authorities after the JSC had submitted the lists to the appointing authorities. Thus, the appointing authorities retained sole discretion whether to disclose the lists. The court reasoned that partisanship would not have affected the JSC's decision by the time that the lists were submitted to the appointing authorities.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed and held that the Administrative Revocation Program (ARP) did not facially violate the driver's due process rights and that the ARP was constitutional. The ARP did not limit the issuance of subpoenas for an administrative hearing solely to the officials who submitted sworn statements. Further, the sworn statement form submitted by the intoxilizer supervisor met the requirements of the ARP and created a rebuttable presumption that the intoxilizer was working properly for 30 days from and after the day of its accuracy test. The arresting officer had reasonable suspicion to stop the driver given her erratic driving. Last, the district court was within its discretion when it denied the driver's motion to reinstate her appeal.

Plaintiffs alleged it was unconstitutional as violative of equal protection; invidiously discriminated against persons based on their race; and was preempted by federal law. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court found that Act 313, &sect; 4 passed constitutional muster under the rational basis test because (1) it was undisputed that the Bays were heavily used for a variety of ocean activities, and (2) it was passed to further the legitimate governmental purposes of water safety and environmental preservation in the bays. The court also found that because the purpose was legitimate, the reform could take one step at a time, and address itself to the phase of the problem which seemed most acute to the legislative mind. Therefore there was no equal protection issue in that Act 313, &sect; 4 was aimed only at commercial crafts.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were postal workers. They were charged with counts of gambling in violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) &sect; 712-1223 (1985) and one was charged with promoting gambling in the second degree in violation of HRS &sect; 712-1222 (Supp. 1992) (Hawaii) and one count of possession of gambling records in the second degree in violation of HRS &sect; 712-1225 (1985) (Hawaii). Much of the evidence against them resulted from video surveillance conducted in the break room where defendants worked by the police department. The activities in the break room were recorded for more than a year and was prompted by letters received by a postal inspector, which he conveyed to the police. The trial court found defendants had a reasonable expectation of privacy in the break room making the video surveillance unconstitutional. The break room was not covered by the &quot;open view&quot; warrant exception. Additionally, there were no exigent circumstances permitting a warrantless search given the duration of the surveillance and the employer could not consent to the violation of defendants' expectations of privacy.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner drivers brought an action against respondent director for review of its administrative decisions. After a negative ruling, the drivers sought review of the judgments of the District Court of the First Circuit, Honolulu Division (Hawaii), which affirmed their driver's license revocations pursuant to Haw. Rev. Stat. ch. 286, Part XIV (Supp. 1992) and found the Administrative Revocation Program constitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The issues raised by the drivers were whether the Administrative Revocation Program facially violated drivers' due process rights because it was deficient by failing to provide sufficient procedural protections and whether the application of the Administrative Revocation Program violated the drivers' rights. The court noted a protected interest in a driver's license; thus, it found that due process was required. To determine the appropriate process required, the court considered: the private interest that would be affected by the official action; the risk of an erroneous deprivation of such interest through the procedures used and the probable value of additional safeguards; and the government's interest, including the function involved. The court affirmed and found the procedures to provide sufficiently reliable results and that additional safeguards were not necessary to exonerate the public policy interests. The court found the interest in a driver's license was not so great that more than an administrative review and hearing were needed to comport with due process. The sworn statements and transcription were sufficient, and the traffic stop of one defendant was justified.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the holding that Hawaii's Administrative Revocation of Driver's License law was constitutional and was applied in a constitutional manner to each of the drivers.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff marriage applicants sought review of a decision from the First Circuit Court (Hawaii), which granted defendant Department of Health's motion for judgment on the pleadings, resulting in the dismissal of plaintiffs' action alleging that defendant's denial of their marriage licenses, pursuant to Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 572-1 (1985), on the basis that they were same-sex couples was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff marriage applicants were denied marriage licenses pursuant to Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 572-1 (1985) by defendant Department of Health because they were same-sex couples. The trial court granted defendant's Haw. R. Civ. P. 12(c) motion for judgment on the pleadings. The court determined that the trial court's grant of defendant's Rule 12(c) motion was improper because the trial court made evidentiary factual findings and formulated conclusions of law. The court vacated the trial court's decision and remanded the action. Although the right to marry was a fundamental freedom, under Haw. Const. art. I, &sect; 6, the right to privacy did not include a fundamental right to same-sex marriage. However, because Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 572-1 (1985) discriminated on the basis of sex by limiting marriage licenses to male-female couples, plaintiffs were entitled to an evidentiary hearing to determine whether &sect; 572-1 furthered compelling state interests and was narrowly drawn to avoid unnecessarily violating plaintiffs' equal protection rights under Haw.

The circuit court dismissed the taxpayer's petition with prejudice and concluded that Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 604-2 was constitutional. The taxpayer appealed. The court affirmed the circuit court order dismissing the taxpayer's petition. The court found that a distinction had historically been made between full-time and part-time judges and that the constitutional proscription against private practice applied only to full-time judges. The court held that the term &quot;judge&quot; as used in Haw. Const. art. VI, &sect; 3 meant full-time judges. The court noted that the codes of professional responsibility and judicial conduct protected the court's impartiality by prohibiting per diem judges from practicing before the court they served or before a different court in which his/her impartiality could be questioned. The court found that the per diem judge was properly appointed and there were no assertions that he violated any of the terms of his appointment.</SPAN></P>

He asserted that the partiality of appellee Board of Trustees of the Employees' Retirement System of the State of Hawaii (trustees) denied him due process of law and that the finding of no evidence of permanent incapacitation was error.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The worker was injured in a motor vehicle accident while driving a truck within the scope of his employment with the city. The trustees denied his claim for service-connected total disability benefits under Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 88-77 (1985) and he sought review. The trial court affirmed the denial of his application finding no evidence of causation between the accident and his psychological impairment. He appealed asserting that the bias of the trustees violated his due process rights and that the finding of no evidence of causation was error. The court held that because the worker failed to establish a &quot;disqualifying interest&quot; on the part of the trustees, he failed to overcome the presumption of lack of bias. Nevertheless, it reversed because it found that uncontroverted, reliable, probative, and substantial testimonial evidence left a definite and firm conviction that a mistake had been made. The trustees erred in finding that the worker's total incapacitation from gainful employment was not work-related. The report of the medical board's expert sufficed to establish a causal link between the worker's disability and the accident.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the order affirming the denial of service-connected total disability benefits and remanded to the trial court the worker's action seeking to review the trustees' decision with directions to enter judgment in his favor.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. &sect; 712-1241(1)(a)(i) (Supp. 1991).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was approached by an officer and questioned in an airport terminal. Drug evidence was obtained when the defendant later fled from the officer. Defendant's pre-trial motion to suppress evidence was denied and defendant argued on appeal that the motion should have been granted because the evidence recovered was the product of an illegal seizure and that he did not voluntarily consent to seizure because he felt compelled to submit to officer's questions. The lower courts determined that no seizure occurred. On appeal, the court reversed the conviction and remanded the case because defendant's right to be secure against unreasonable seizures under Haw. Const. art. I, &sect; 7 had been violated and his seizure was unlawful and nonconsensual. The court determined that: (1) the incriminating evidence obtained after defendant fled was inadmissible, (2) the &quot;voluntary conversation&quot; evolved into an interrogation after the officer's pretextual questions became more intrusive, (3) the officers sought to bootstrap their investigation into discovery of possible criminal activity by the group, and (4) the state failed to meet its burden of proof that consent was voluntary and uncoerced.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed defendant's conviction, ordered the evidence suppressed, and remanded the case to circuit court for further proceedings.

After determining that the association met the requirements for standing, the court held that the association's &sect; 1983 claims were barred by the two-year statute of limitations under Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 657-7 because they were best characterized as personal injury actions and because the association knew of the exchange more than two years before commencing the action. The association was also barred by res judicata and collateral estoppel from seeking retrospective relief on its breach of public trust and constitutional claims because those claims had been considered in a prior federal court action. However, the court held that the association may have had a valid claim that the rights of its native Hawaiian members were violated under article XII, &sect; 7 of the Hawaii Constitution if it could have been shown that those members sought and were denied access to undeveloped areas of the exchanged lands to exercise customary and traditional subsistence, cultural, and religious practices.</SPAN></P>

The court enjoined the governor from placing the proposed amendments upon the election ballot. The court held that Act 294 directed amendment to the Hawaii State Constitution in a manner contrary to Haw. Const. art. XVII, &sect; 3. The primary election element of Act 294 constituted an unlawful referendum and an impermissible delegation of legislative authority to the electorate. There was no indication that the legislature specifically adopted each alternative as a proposed amendment as mandated by Haw. Const. art. XVII, &sect; 3. According to the Act, actual adoption of one or the other alternative had to await the primary election results. Such practice was directly contrary to the unambiguous mandate of Haw. Const. art.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from his conviction, after a jury trial was held in the First Circuit Court, Hawaii, for assault in the first degree, in violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes &sect; 707-710. Defendant argued that the circuit court erred by, over objection, employing the &quot;struck jury&quot; method, in contravention of the express terms of Hawaii Revised Statutes &sect; 635-26(a), which provided for jury selection by the &quot;strike and replace&quot; method.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Prior to the voir dire, the circuit court indicated that the 40 names of the jurors were to be drawn before any voir dire was conducted. Then, as each juror was excused for cause, a new name was to be drawn and placed at the bottom of the list, to move up one notch as each succeeding juror was excused. The circuit court overruled defendant's objections to the method. When voir dire was finished, 38 jurors remained, 14 seated in the box with two alternates, plus 24 in the jury room. In the jury's absence, the parties exercised their peremptory challenges and as each juror was excused, the next juror in line went into the box in the excused slot and all remaining jurors moved up one notch. On appeal, the court held that &sect; 635-26(a) provided that the clerk was to draw by lot 12 names from the box and that if any of the 12 was excused, the clerk was to continue to draw by lot from the box until 12 impartial jurors were obtained; each replacement juror was to be drawn by lot after a preceding juror was excused. By using the &quot;struck jury&quot; method, the circuit court denied defendant's right to have the jurors selected in accordance with the statute; prejudice need not have been shown.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court vacated defendant's conviction and remanded the case to the circuit court for a new trial.</SPAN></P>

The family court rejected a defense claim that defendant was entitled to relief from prosecution under &sect; 702-236(1)(b) and convicted him as charged. Defendant appealed, and the court reversed his conviction and dismissed the charges against him. In so ruling, it held that the family court had abused its discretion in failing to dismiss the case under the exception in &sect; 702-236(1)(b) for conduct causing harm &quot;too trivial to warrant the condemnation of conviction.&quot; Noting that the standard of review was that of abuse of discretion, the court held that while, contrary to defendant's claims, prosecutions thereunder were not limited to interference with divorce-based custodial arrangements and while defendant's conduct in fact fell within the literal parameters of &sect; 707-727(1)(a), the family court should have applied &sect; 702-236(1)(b) to relieve him from prosecution.</SPAN></P>

The trial court asked defendant to step forward when the officer did not identify him. On appeal, the court affirmed defendant's conviction. The court found that the officer's process of checking the driver's license picture against the driver's face constituted a prior identification of defendant. The court concluded that the identification was admissible pursuant to Haw. R. Evid. 802.1(3) because the officer testified at trial regarding the circumstances of his prior identification, vouched for its accuracy, and was available for cross-examination. The court found that the trial court, in requesting that defendant step forward in court, simply complied with the mandate of Haw. R.

The court noted that HRS &sect; 706-906 provided a minimum jail sentence of 48 hours for defendant's crime and that &sect; 706-606 described the factors to be considered in imposing a particular sentence. The court acknowledged that the trial court had wide discretion in sentencing, but held that the trial court abused its discretion in rigidly applying the family court's sentencing guidelines, which were issued without legislative authority. Additionally, the court noted that the sentencing judge stated that he based his sentence on the belief that the victim lied for defendant. The court held that there was nothing in the record showing that defendant asked the victim to lie in court or that he threatened her concerning her court statement.

The court affirmed the conviction holding that &sect; 702-230 was constitutional. The court determined that the operation of &sect; 702-230 did not deprive defendant of the opportunity to present evidence to rebut the mens rea element of the crime but merely prohibited the jury from considering self-induced intoxication to negate defendant's state of mind and defendant could still have attempted to convince the jury that he did not act intentionally or knowingly as required for murder in the second degree.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After defendant entered a plea of guilty to burglary in the first degree, defendant was given a sentence of probation, a condition of which was to submit to periodic urinalysis testing for drugs. Defendant failed two drug tests and the State sought to revoke defendant's probation. Defendant sought to exclude evidence of the urinalysis testing, but the motion was denied and defendant's probation was revoked. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that while urinalysis was a search under the Hawaii Constitution, such testing was proper of a person on probation due to a reduced expectation of privacy and the State's interest in controlling offenders on probation. The court held that the discretionary condition of period drug testing was explicitly permitted pursuant to Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 706-624(2)(m).

The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court granting summary judgment in favor of the employer. The court rejected appellants' claim that they should have been allowed to bring an action against the employer based in strict liability, under the dual capacity doctrine. The court held that state legislature, by adopting Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 386-5, intended that the workers' compensation system be the exclusive remedy for work-related injuries and deaths. The court also rejected appellants' contentions that the exclusivity provisions of &sect; 386-5&nbsp;unconstitutionally and impermissibly denied them equal protection and due process of law by denying any recovery to non-dependent relatives, while dependent relatives could recover benefits. The court found that the legislature had a rational basis for precluding claims by non-dependent parents.</SPAN></P>

An issue was the propriety of consecutive mandatory minimum sentences, which eliminated possibility of parol during one hundred thirty-six years of imprisonment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was sentenced under Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) &sect;&sect; 706-661, 706-662 to eight consecutive life terms plus 200 years. The consecutive mandatory minimum terms eliminating parole were imposed under HRS &sect; 706-660.1(a). Section 706-660.1(a) directed the minimum terms at felonious commission while, inter alia, using or possessing a firearm, but the additional terms were mandatory only after being imposed using discretion. The court held that under &sect; 706-660.1(a) imposition of consecutive mandatory minimum terms of imprisonment was authorized despite there being no express addressing of consecutive sentences by that section. The court also held that &sect; 706-660.1 was cruel and unusual facially neither under the Eight Amendment to the U.S. Constitution not the Hawaii Constitution. However, that did not prevent appellate review of the sentences for any plain, manifest abuse of discretion. The court ruled that imposition of the respective maximum term consecutively for every count of which defendant had been convicted was excessive.</SPAN></P>

Appellant non-profit corporation, whose members resided adjacent to the park, filed a complaint against appellees, contending that the proposed agreement was a breach of a public charitable trust. The trial court awarded summary judgment to defendants. On appeal, the court reversed. First, the court held that members of the public, as beneficiaries of the trust, had standing to bring the action, when the attorney general and counsel for appellee city had not. The court further held that the park was a public charitable trust and that the instrument establishing the trust expressly prohibited the trustees from entering into leases of the trust lands. The legislature did not have the power to confer upon appellee city the authority to make leases of the trust lands as was provided under Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 171-11. To so allow would have violated U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 10 and equity. The concession agreement had all of the indicia of a lease.

They argued that the statute was unconstitutionally vague or overbroad, violated the State constitutional right to privacy, and that the State failed to submit expert testimony with surveys to rebut evidence that the magazines were not obscene.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants sold adult magazines to undercover officers. At trial, they presented experts and surveys to prove that the magazines were not obscene. The State moved to exclude surveys while defendants moved to dismiss for violations of the right to privacy and statutory vagueness. The trial court denied all motions and ruled that the magazines were pornographic and violated prevailing community standards. Thus, the trial court excluded the surveys and expert testimony. The court overturned the convictions. The court held that the Hawaii Constitution excluded obscenity from protected speech. The court determined sua sponte that defendants had standing to assert the privacy rights of buyers of pornography. The court found that the personal decision to have pornographic material in the privacy of one's own home was protected by the State constitution. If the constitution recognized the right to view pornographic items at home, there was a correlative right to purchase these materials for this personal use. Defendants carried their burden of proving the unconstitutionality of the statute as applied to the sale of pornographic materials to a person intending to use them at home.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant guardian challenged the order of the Circuit Court of the First Circuit (Hawaii), which granted appellee driver's motion for summary judgment pursuant to its ruling that the guardian's wrongful death cause of action was barred by the no-fault statute of limitations contained in Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 294-36(b)(2).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The guardian instituted the instant wrongful death action for decedent's death in an accident while riding as a passenger in a van driven by the driver nearly eight years after the accident. In her action, the guardian alleged that as a direct and proximate result of the driver's gross negligence, his children were deprived of parental care, training, guidance, education, and support of the decedent. The court reasoned that the foregoing allegations were determinative of a wrongful death cause of action and, therefore, the wrongful death limitations period applied as opposed to the statute of limitations applicable to the no-fault accident law. Moreover, the court found that the legislature, in enacting the no-fault law, did not intend to supercede the statutory wrongful death cause of action contained in Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 663-3, and thus did not intend that the no-fault law apply to the guardians' wrongful death claim. Finally, the court reversed summary judgment to the driver and applied caselaw rationale in holding that the two year limitations period for each of the children's claims began to run upon that child's eighteenth birthday, as such was tolled during their infancy.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court's order granting the driver's motion for summary judgment and remanded the cause for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

The Pele practitioners contended that the board violated their rights under U.S. Const. amend. I and Haw. Const. art. I, &sect; 4, and failed to consider the criteria in Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 205-5.2(d)(3) (1985).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The board approved an application for a geothermal energy sub zone development. It permitted the production of up to 25 megawatts of geothermal energy, and exploration for future development of an additional 75 megawatts. The Pele practitioners contended that building plants that tapped a volcano's heat source would desecrate the body of the goddess Pele and interfere with their ritual practices. The court affirmed the board's decisions. Approval of the sub zone development did not directly burden their beliefs or inhibit their religious speech, and it did not affirmatively compel them to refrain from religious conduct. There was no showing of the objective danger to free exercise that U.S. Const. amend. I was meant to prevent. The development would be five to 10 miles away from where Pele was said to reside. Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 205-5.2(b)-(c) (1985), which contemplated the board using its discretion to determine the boundaries of geothermal resource sub zones, was adequately clear to comply with due process. There was enough evidence for the board to find that development of 25 megawatts of energy was economically feasible and that the island's energy needs would increase.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In the Pele practitioners' action against the board and the applicants concerning the free exercise of religion, the court affirmed the board's decisions allowing energy development.</SPAN></P>

The distributor appealed to the circuit court, asserting that the finding was erroneous and, for the first time on appeal to the circuit court, that the foregoing section of the Act, on its face and as applied, was constitutionally infirm. The circuit court found that judicial review of the agency determination was confined to issues properly raised in the record of the administrative proceedings. Thus, because the constitutional issues were not matters of record, the circuit court affirmed the board's decision and order without passing on the constitutional challenges. On review, the court vacated the judgment and remanded, holding that the distributor's decision to challenge the statute's facial validity at the same time as it challenged the administrative action was timely and appropriate. Further, the court noted that the constitutionality of the section was a legal question originally cognizable in the circuit court. In addition, the administrative agency was not empowered to pass on the validity of the statute; nor was it qualified to adjudicate the propriety of its own action.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. &sect; 516-70, as amended by 1975 Haw. Sess. Laws &sect; 19 of Act 184. On appeal, the court reversed the order of the trial court and remanded the case. The court held that Haw. Rev.

The court found that &sect; 516-70 was an attempt by the legislature to change contractual remedies and obligations to the detriment of all lessors and to the benefits of all lessees, without advancement of a broad societal purpose.

The court held that the statute's language &quot;to any dower or curtesy in the former spouse's real estate&quot; and &quot;to any share of the former spouse's personal estate&quot; modified the prior portion of the statute that required resolution of such issues within one year.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from an order of the First Circuit Court (Hawaii), which convicted him of promoting a dangerous drug in the first degree in violation of Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 712-1241(1)(a)(i). Defendant claimed that the circuit court erred in denying his motion to suppress evidence by finding that a police detective's surveillance of his activities inside a closed toilet stall did not violate his reasonable expectation of privacy.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant claimed that he had a reasonable expectation of privacy inside a closed toilet stall and the detective violated that expectation by standing on an adjacent toilet and peering over the partition. Therefore, defendant asserted that the evidence the detective found as a result should have been suppressed. The circuit court denied defendant's motion to suppress and convicted him. Defendant appealed the decision, which the court reversed. The court found that an expectation of privacy in a closed toilet stall was one that society recognized as objectively reasonable and that defendant exhibited a subjective expectation of privacy by closing the stall door. The court held that the detective lacked the requisite probable cause to climb on the seat of the adjacent toilet and look over the partition, and thus, the circuit court erred in finding that reasonable grounds and exigent circumstances combined to justify the warrantless surveillance of defendant's toilet stall, as despite the fact that the detective was suspicious of defendant's request to use the bathroom, nothing in the record could have given him probable cause to believe that defendant was about to destroy evidence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed defendant's conviction for promoting a dangerous drug in the first degree because defendant's right to privacy was violated when the police detective looked over the partition. The subsequent search of the toilet stall was tainted by the officer's illegal surveillance, and the cocaine found during that search should have been suppressed as fruit of the poisonous tree.</SPAN></P>

The officer ordered defendant to get out of his car.

Defendant failed a field sobriety test and the officer arrested him. At the police station, defendant refused to submit to a breathalyzer test. Defendant alleged that the officer ordered him out of his car without probable cause or an articulable basis to believe that a crime had been committed. The court concluded that the police action was unconstitutional. The court held that, pursuant to Haw. Const. art. I, &sect; 7, a police officer must have a reasonable basis of specific articulable facts to believe that a crime has been committed to order a driver out of a car after a traffic stop. The court ordered the suppression of all evidence obtained after the police officer illegally ordered defendant out of the car.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The insureds challenged the constitutionality of Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 294-2(10). On appeal, the court affirmed the finding that &sect; 294-2(10) was constitutional and that one of the insureds was not entitled to compensation for chiropractic services and massage therapy. The court held that there was a rational basis for treating the insureds, as public aid recipients, differently from other no-fault policyholders. The court reasoned that it was a policy decision to have public aid recipients receiving payments from social services to also receive Medicaid compensation for automotive injuries from social services. The court further opined that having public aid recipients obtain all their payments avoided the danger of a public aid recipient receiving double coverage for the same damages arising out of an automotive accident. The court found that the fact that chiropractic services and massage therapy were licensed under similar statutory schemes and were so alike in definition and practice, led to the conclusion that they were &quot;therapy&quot; within the meaning of &sect; 294-2(10)(B). Thus, the court held that chiropractic services and massage therapy were not covered services.</SPAN></P>

The court found the requirement under &sect; 2-91.1 that the regulatory employees had to submit disclosures of their income and financial interests to the county board had not deprived the regulatory employees any constitutional rights. The trial court did not err in not employing the strict scrutiny test in judging the constitutionality of &sect; 2-91.1 because there was no violation of a fundamental right to privacy. The people of Hawaii had a legitimate expectation of privacy under Haw. Const. art. I, &sect; 6 only where their personal financial affairs were concerned.

The trial court convicted one defendant of illegal massage and both defendants of prostitution, in violation of Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 712-1200 (Supp. 1984). Defendants appealed, contending that the conduct of a police agent who was a party to the sexual encounters which led to defendants' convictions denied defendants due process of law.

On appeal, the court affirmed and held that the trial judges evaluated the police practices and properly found no due process violation and that the police conduct did not have the probable effect on a &quot;reasonable person&quot; of inducing her to engage in prostitution were she not ready to do so.

The trial court, after deferral of the trial for over a year, granted a motion for acquittal and the prosecution sought review. The court reversed the judgment and remanded the cause for further proceedings, and held that: (1) defendant was relieved of criminal responsibility if at the time of the conduct he suffered from a mental disease that substantially impaired his capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law; (2) experts could testify on mental state but not on its impact on legal accountability; (3) several experts gave conflicting testimony on the issue of sanity and the issue was one for the jury; and (4) under Haw.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employees had filed an action against the university for its policy of mandatory retirement at age 65. The court held that the policy was unconstitutional. On remand, the employees filed a motion for class certification, which was denied.

The court affirmed as to the denial of class certification and intervention, but reversed as to the grant of summary judgment. The court held that the commencement of a class action suspended the applicable statute of limitations as to all asserted members of a class who would have been parties had the suit continued as a class action. Therefore, the court stated that the motions for interventions were not time-barred. The court held that the employees had failed to establish that there had been an abuse of discretion as to certification, and had failed to establish that they were entitled to intervention under Haw.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother filed a paternity action to establish the putative father as the natural father of her nine-year-old child. At the time, Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 584-7 (1975) provided for a three-year statute of limitations as to all petitioners. While the appeal was pending, the legislature amended &sect; 584-7. As amended, the law gave the child or the child's personal representative up to three years after the child reached majority in which to file a paternity action. The issue before the appellate court was whether Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 584-7 (1983), as amended, was applicable to this case. Concluding in the affirmative, the court found the issues on appeal were moot. The court held that the legislature intended to provide for revival of previously barred paternity actions, although such actions could not have been brought before the amended law. The court held that there was nothing in the record to indicate that the putative father was induced by the expiration of the three-year statute of limitations into reliance of a kind that would make its retroactive extension so oppressive as to violate due process, so held the amended law was specifically applicable to this case.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant claimed that the state invaded a constitutionally protected area of privacy when it prosecuted her for prostitution under Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 712-1200 on the basis of sexual conduct involving two consenting adults and occurring in her home. On appeal, the court affirmed defendant's conviction. The court held that the trial court properly denied defendant's motion to dismiss the charge. The court held that defendant failed to meet her burden of showing that the criminal offense of prostitution was unconstitutional beyond a reasonable doubt and she did not demonstrate that a decision to engage in prostitution was recognized as a fundamental right. The court stated that one aspect of the &quot;liberty&quot; protected by the Due Process Clause of U.S. Const. amend. XIV was a right of personal privacy, which included the interest in independence in making certain kinds of important decisions. The court stated that state laws that burdened an individual's recognized right to privacy may be justified only by a compelling state interest, but only personal rights that were deemed &quot;fundamental&quot; or implicit in the concept of ordered liberty were included in this guarantee of personal privacy.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The higher court certified six state law questions determinative in appellees' lawsuit against appellant. The court held that a Hawaii state official could not execute on the judgment entered in McBryde and enjoin appellees' water use because the court did not consider whether the interests and circumstances involved indicated a need for diversion restraint. The court held that an action to quiet title was not the appropriate means to adjudicate water rights. The court held that appellant could claim res judicata as to the parts of the McBryde judgment not disturbed on appeal. The court held that the McBryde rulings, with respect to water ownership and water diversion, had binding precedential effect on the Hawaii state courts. The court held that the McBryde decision precluded appellees from bringing an action in state court alleging that their property was taken without compensation in violation of U.S. Const. amend. V because appellees were given an opportunity to present arguments and had their day in court. The court held that the preclusive effect of the McBryde appeal extended only so far as the issues decided in that case.</SPAN></P>

The trial court ruled that because the alleged victim was not eligible to receive no-fault benefits, he was required to bring his action within two years of the accident pursuant to Haw. Rev.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The complainants sought declaratory and injunctive relief against landowners and tenants for preventing the use of beach trails alleged to be public rights of way. Primarily claiming rights accruing to them as members of the public, under Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 7-1 and other grounds, the complainants were found to have standing to assert such rights and the suit was certified as a class action. The landowners and tenants appealed. The court affirmed, holding that a member of the public had standing to sue to enforce public rights, although his injury was not different in kind from that of the public generally, where he showed that he suffered an injury in fact and that the concern of multiplicity of suits was met by such means as a class action. Having been prevented from using the trails the complainants alleged injury to a recreational interest, which was sufficient to include them among the injured. Thus, all class members suffered an injury in fact. The class definition, which was based on specific acts of members having been prevented from using the trails, met Haw. R. Civ. P. 23, as class membership could be determined. Also, the class action was appropriate given the issues.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><BR><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">DISPOSITION:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Reversed and remanded with instructions to enter summary judgment for Appellant and to order revocation of the condominium and hotel building permits, to restrain any further construction on the Nukolii site, to mandate refund by the County of the &quot;in lieu&quot; fee paid by the Developers pursuant to the resort zoning ordinance, and to hear requests for such other relief as the court deems proper.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14"><SUP>22</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR><BR><BR><BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c12">22&nbsp;No argument or evidence has been presented respecting the remedy of a mandatory injunction compelling the removal of any completed improvements on the Nukolii site.  We are therefore unprepared to provide specific instruction regarding the issuance of such an injunction.  However, as the issue is likely to arise on remand and this court has yet to pass on the issuance of such injunctions for zoning violations, we feel that a brief discussion of the matter is appropriate the provide further guidance to the trial court.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c17"><SPAN CLASS="c12">Mandatory injunctions are, of course, permitted as an appropriate remedy for zoning violations.  Jurisdictions differ however in their willingness to grant such injunctions.  At one extreme it is presumed that such an injunction is the appropriate remedy and it is the defendant's burden to prove that such enforcement would not be of benefit to the health, safety and welfare of the public.  City of Chicago v. Handler, 288 N.E.2d 714 (Ill. App. 1972). Conversely, it has been held that such an injunction should normally issue &quot;only in cases of necessity where serious injury is being inflicted or will be inflicted.&quot; City of Dallas v. Gaechtner, 524 S.W.2d 400, 402 (Tex. Civ. App. 1975). </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c17"><SPAN CLASS="c12">We conclude that where, as in this case, a defendant does not intentionally violate underlying zoning, the latter rules should serve as the standard governing the issuance of a mandatory injunction for the removal of a completed improvement.  For, absent conscious wrongdoing, we believe that the severity of the remedy should be reserved for circumstances where the waste engendered by the destruction of a completed improvement is clearly justified by preservation of the interests protected by the zoning involved.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c18">See e.g.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">&nbsp;Zelios v. City of Dallas, 568 S.W.2d 173 (Tex. Civ. App. 1978) (mandatory injunctive relief is proper when defendant acts with full knowledge that his acts are wrongful).  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c17"><SPAN CLASS="c12">This is not to say the complainants are without recourse in the absence of a demonstration of &quot;serious injury&quot;.  Alternative remedies available to them include damages or the fashioning of other injunctive relief which would mitigate any harm caused by the offending structure.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Developers were authorized to build a resort. A committee submitted a referendum petition, and a county referendum nullified the zoning ordinance. The court reversed the order granting summary judgment to the developers. It held that the referendum decision repealing the resort zoning ordinance had to be given full effect. The facts precluded estoppel to defeat the zoning policy. Because the government had not taken final discretionary action authorizing the developers' project before the referendum was certified, the county was not estopped from enforcing prior zoning that prohibited resort development. There was no official assurance on which the developers had a right to rely in making expenditures. The expenditures made toward commencing construction before the referendum vote fell short of good faith. The zoning referendum satisfied constitutional requirements.</SPAN></P>

Laws 284 (Act 284) that provided a sentencing court with the discretionary authority to impose a lesser mandatory minimum sentence and defendant asked the court to consider the statute's applicability.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of promoting a dangerous drug in the second and third degrees and one year later was again convicted of promoting a dangerous drug in the second degree. The trial judge sentenced defendant pursuant to &sect; 706-606.5, which then required that the trial court sentence a second offender to a mandatory minimum term of imprisonment without the possibility of parole. Act 284 amended &sect; 706-606.5 to provide that the sentencing court could impose a lesser sentence than that mandated by &sect; 707-606.5. In determining whether Act 284 applied to defendant, the court first determined that the act was ameliorative in its intent and effect and that its application in this case would neither be detrimental nor materially disadvantageous to defendant. After reviewing the legislative history, the court found that the legislature intended to remedy the inflexibility of the mandatory sentencing provisions and concluded that the application of the new, more flexible law to prosecutions, like defendant's, that had not yet reached final judgment would be in keeping with this legislative objective.</SPAN></P>

Defendant also argued that Haw. Rev.

The court affirmed the conviction and sentence. It disagreed with defendant's representation that the only evidence that linked him to the victim was the alleged inadmissible evidence. The court concluded from its examination of the record that the error, if any, did not contribute to the verdict obtained and therefore was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. Further, &sect; 706-606 required the sentencing judge to impose the maximum penalty of life imprisonment with possibility of parole, except that the sentencing judge was given the discretion to reduce it to twenty years if there were mitigating factors or circumstances which would warrant a lesser sentence. There was no constitutional infirmity in such a sentencing scheme.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was searched during the arrest but no weapons were found. The police officer was informed by defendant's girlfriend, with whom he had been in the altercation leading to his arrest. The police officer went back to the scene and saw what appeared to be a gun in defendant's parked car, obtained the keys to the car, and seized the handgun that was inside. During his trial, defendant moved to suppress the evidence of the handgun alleging that the seizure was unconstitutional because it was obtained pursuant to an illegal arrest. The circuit court suppressed the evidence and the State appealed. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded, ruling that that the evidence established that the arrest upon which the seizure was based was a legal, warrantless arrest and that probable cause and exigent circumstances were demonstrated to justify seizure of the handgun following defendant's arrest.</SPAN></P>

Appellee was indicted on a charge of attempted peddling in violation of Honolulu, Haw., Rev.

The trial court entered an order declaring &sect; 26-6.2(b)(7) unconstitutional as violative of the free speech rights provided by U.S. Const. amend. I and Haw. Const. art. I, &sect; 4, and as void for vagueness in violation of the due process clauses of U.S. Const. amend. IV and Haw. Const. art. I, &sect; 5. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that the ordinance impermissibly restricted commercial free speech because: (1) it was not limited as to time, place, or manner; (2) it was not content neutral; (3) it did not leave open alternative channels of communication; and (4) the state's rationale of preventing nuisances to enhance tourism did not justify the total suppression of commercial speech that was not false, misleading, or illegal.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decedent owned real property at his death and he died intestate. Certain heirs lived on the land for a length of time, and at other times the land was vacant. Property taxes were allowed to go unpaid for several years before payment was made, but the tax collector mailed the bills to two heirs. When the tax went unpaid again, the property was sold at foreclosure sale. The tax authority published notice and posted a notice on the property as required by statute. However, no heir ever received actual notice. The buyers bought the land from purchasers at the foreclosure sale and discovered the heirs on the land. The buyers brought an action for ejectment, and the trial court granted them summary judgment. The court reversed. Although the tax authority complied with the statutory notice provisions, they were not enough under the circumstances. Because the tax collector had the names and addresses of two heirs, it violated due process by failing to contact them about the sale. The notice solely by publication and posting was not reasonably calculated under all the circumstances to apprise the heirs of the pending sale and afford them an opportunity to present their objections.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The estate adminstratix brought a wrongful death action against the city, which alleged that the city was responsible for the death of the decedent. The decedent committed suicide while in jail under suspicion of robbery. The trial court denied a motion by the estate administratix for partial summary judgment on the issue of the constitutionality of the statute under which the decedent was held in jail. The trial court also denied a motion by the estate adminstratix for an in limine ruling by the court or, in the alternative, a summary adjudication that the arrest and detention of decedent by the police constituted negligence as a matter of law or false imprisonment as a matter of law. The trial court issued an order granting an interlocutory appeal of its rulings. The court reversed the order and remanded for trial. The court held that the interlocutory appeal was merely a request by the trial court to have the court intervene in regard to tentative and incomplete decisions of the trial court in an unfinished and incomplete case.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The police raided two theaters that showed adult films. They seized several films and arrested defendants, who worked at the theaters. Defendants were charged with promoting pornography.

One circuit judge suppressed one of the seized movies, otherwise denied the motions to suppress, and declined to rule on the constitutionality of &sect; 712-1216(1). Another circuit judge denied the motions to suppress, but declared &sect; 712-1216(1)&nbsp;unconstitutional. On appeal, the court found in favor of defendants, holding (1) the seizure and retention of the films violated defendants rights under U.S. Const. amend. I and IV because they were not afforded a prompt post-seizure hearing to determine the obscenity vel non of the films, (2) suppression of the films was an appropriate remedy for the constitutional violation, and (3) Haw.

The court held that, if the offense was not punishable by life imprisonment and two defendants were jointly on trial for such offense, each defendant was entitled to two peremptory challenges, pursuant to Haw. R. Penal Proc. 24(b). The court found that courtroom identifications could be inadmissible if the post-indictment lineup was held in violation of the Sixth Amendment right to counsel at critical stages of the criminal prosecution. However, the court held that there was no Sixth Amendment right to counsel at a showup conducted after defendant had been arrested but before he had been indicted or formally charged because it was not a critical stage of the criminal proceeding.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the issue was the constitutionality of a section of Hawaii's general witness immunity statute that provided immunity in exchange for potentially incriminating information from a witness. The court reversed and remanded for dismissal of the indictment. The court found that the definitive interpretation on the Fifth Amendment and immunity prevailing when the Hawaii Constitution was drafted and adopted lent substantial support for a conclusion that the statutory protection afforded by Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 621C-3 was inadequate to terminate the constitutionally endowed privilege against self-incrimination. The court also found that it could not, with reasonable assurance, state that &sect; 621C-3 placed a witness in substantially the same position as though he had not been compelled to produce evidence. The court determined that the statute gave the government access to otherwise unavailable information by nullifying a constitutional privilege and, while it precluded the use of the information, the witness remained subject to prosecution.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, corporation, husband, and wife, challenged the trial courts conviction of defendants for openly burning automobiles in violation of Haw. Admin. Reg. ch. 43, &sect; 7. They claimed that the state enforced the open burning ban in a discriminatory manner against defendant corporation, and that it was error for the trial court to have held defendants, husband and wife, personally liable. The court affirmed the convictions, as the law was not discriminatorily applied against defendants, and in view of the standard of care imposed upon corporate officers, defendant husband and defendant wife were personally liable for the violations by defendant corporation. Defendants failed to prove that the law was applied in a discriminating manner, as others similarly situated were also subjected to enforcement proceedings and there was no evidence in the record or racial, sexual, political, or other improper discrimination. Given defendant husband's admissions that he performed the open burning, he was personally liable for defendant corporation.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant drove two sisters to a cliff, brandished a knife, and told them he would throw them off the cliff unless one of them slept with him in return for their release. At his house, defendant showed the older sister a pistol. The court held that the sex-based classification in Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 707-730 (1976) neither denied equal rights to men nor did it violate the Equal Rights Amendment. Punishing males for nonconsensual intercourse with women was substantially related to the important governmental objective of protecting women from nonconsensual intercourse. Insofar as rape was defined as forced intercourse by a male with a female, it was based on a physiological characteristic unique to males. In view of the strength of the evidence of defendant's guilt, the trial court committed harmless error by not allowing defendant's wife to testify to his good character for honesty and nonviolence on the basis that she did not know him until after the offenses occurred. The trial court properly denied a motion for judgment of acquittal, as there was sufficient evidence to sustain the finding of forcible compulsion. Defendant was not without effective assistance of counsel.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Both defendants were sentenced under the enhanced imprisonment provisions of Act 181 for their third burglary convictions. On appeal, the court rejected defendants' argument that Act 181 violated the Eighth Amendment's prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment because the repeat offender sentencing in Act 181 was not disproportionate to defendants' crimes. On defendants' Equal Protection Clause challenges, the court rejected the argument that Act 181 was void for failing to include more serious violent crimes because legislative intent accompanying Act 181 indicated a concern that that burglaries could turn violent and required heightened deterrence. The punishments imposed under Act 181 were not arbitrary and capricious classifications for persons who committed burglaries. Prescribing criminal sentences was properly within the legislative sphere, and the passing of Act 181 had not stripped the trial court of sentencing discretion. Legislative history indicated that convictions prior to Act 181 were to be considered in the sentencing process. Defendants were entitled to ordinary sentencing procedures, including notice, which they had received.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the statute was not vague, and was sufficiently definite to satisfy due process with regard to the charge against defendants. Further, the statute was not overly broad as applied to defendants. Defendants' participation in cockfighting, which was prohibited by the statute, was not protected conduct.

In the instant appeal, however, defendant argued that the statute was unconstitutional both on its face and as applied. The state moved to dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction. The court agreed with the state that the family court's order should have been appealed from prior to commencement of the criminal action, but the court denied the state's motion to dismiss due to the lack of clear direction in previous cases. The court affirmed defendant's convictions. The statute was not void for vagueness because it merely dealt with a procedural function and provided adequate guidelines for a judicial determination of waiver of jurisdiction. The statute was not void as applied because the family court's waiver order, together with its oral statements, adequately set out the reasons for the waiver of jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>

The court held that constitutional amendments ratified by the electorate was to be upheld unless they it could be shown to be invalid beyond a reasonable doubt. The court stated that the burden of showing this invalidity was upon the party challenging the results of the election and every reasonable presumption was to be indulged in favor of a constitutional amendment, which the people had adopted at a general election. The court determined that the ballots in question did not mislead the voters, nor were the ballots unfairly biased.

Consequently, the fee owner was not substantially prejudiced by the lack of notice.

The court first held that board regulations which restricted corporal punishment did not conflict with Haw. Rev.

The court then held that the teacher was not entitled to a new hearing, because in an administrative hearing, the strict common-law rules of evidence did not apply, and the admission of incompetent and irrelevant matter was not reversible error if there was substantial evidence to sustain the decision of the hearing body. The board had produced substantial evidence of the teacher's violations of the rules, the hearing officer and the board did not rely upon the irrelevant evidence, and hence the teacher was not prejudiced.

The visitor brought an action against the prison officials pursuant to the Hawaii equal rights provision at Haw. Const. art. I, &sect; 21, the Hawaii Administrative Procedure Act, the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, and its state counterpart, Haw. Const. art. I, &sect; 4. The trial court dismissed the visitor's action, and the court affirmed the decision. The court found that the directive was substantially related to the achievement of the important governmental objective of prison security and met the test under the Fourteenth Amendment. The court concluded that the compelling state interest test would be satisfied if it were held to be applicable. The avoidance of the difficulties of requiring conventional undergarments only in the cases of women visitors with sexually provocative physical attributes, the court held, justified application of uniform dress standards to all women visitors. The court also held that the exception to sex discrimination for physical characteristics unique to one sex was applicable.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner mothers sought a determination of the paternity of their minor children against defendant fathers. The First Circuit Court (Hawaii) granted a dismissal to one father pursuant to the statute of limitations provision of Hawaii's Uniform Parentage Act, Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 579-10 (1955), whereas the other father, who had been absent from the state for nearly three years, was not granted a dismissal. The parties appealed the judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mothers petitioned the trial court for a paternity determination of their minor children. Each father sought to dismiss on the ground that the statute of limitations under Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 579-10 (1955) constituted a bar to the action. The court affirmed the denial of the motion as to one father and reversed the grant of the motion to the other father. The court held that a cause of action once barred by the expiration of the statute of limitations could be revived by a subsequent legislative enactment extending the original time period on a case by case basis because the legislature obviously intended that the three-year statute of limitations provision was to operate retrospectively. If Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 584-7 was to apply only in the case of children born after its effective date, then it was meaningless for the legislature to have specified that whichever of the three-year periods that occurred later was the applicable period of limitation. Furthermore, it did not violate due process to extend the limitations period, as the lapse in time did not invest either party with title to real or personal property.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer brought an action in the tax appeal court to recover amounts that the taxpayer paid in assessed additional use taxes over a four year period. The tax appeal court upheld the validity of the assessment. On appeal, the taxpayer's two basic contentions were that its use tax liability by reason of the importation of parts in connection with its service business should be determined according to Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 238-2(2)(A), which imposed a one-half of one percent rate, rather than Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 238-2(3), which imposed a four percent rate; and that the use tax against it unduly discriminated against the taxpayer in violation of the commerce clause. The court concluded that the parts that the taxpayer imported in connection with its service business were imported for use and were consumed by the taxpayer in the performance of its service business rather than imported for resale to the taxpayer's customers and that, therefore, the taxpayer was not entitled to treatment under &sect; 238-2(2)(A). The court also concluded that the use tax did not discriminate against the taxpayer because equal treatment was accorded to similarly situated in-state taxpayers.</SPAN></P>

Laws 58 was an enactment to adjust the salaries of all state officers and employees.The taxpayers brought an action seeking a permanent injunction to stop its implementation. The taxpayers alleged that the statute was invalidly enacted in violation of the Hawaii Constitution and legislative rules. The trial court granted the state officers' motion for summary judgment. On appeal, the court affirmed. The taxpayers failed to overcome the presumption of validity that attached to the Act. There was no violation of the single subject requirement of Haw. Const. art. III, &sect; 15. All parts of the Act embraced one general subject, salaries. The parts were so connected and related to each other as to be parts of or germane to that general subject. The title to the Act fairly indicated to the ordinary mind its general subject, was comprehensive enough to reasonably cover all its provisions, and was not calculated to mislead. The legislature was not constitutionally required to consider and enact separate bills in order to give the governor an opportunity to exercise his power of veto. An alleged violation of legislative rules was within the province of the legislature itself.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant corporation taxpayer sought review of an order of the Tax Appeal Court (Hawaii), which affirmed the validity of appellee director of taxation's tax assessments against the corporation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A corporation challenged tax assessments on its income derived from a license agreement executed on the mainland. On appeal, the court held that the tax assessments were valid. The court determined that the corporation leased to a local television station not only film prints but the intangible telecast rights of the films. The court found that the telecast rights were wholly consumable and only consumable in Hawaii within specific time limits. Thus, the court ruled that even though all activities in the consummation of the agreement occurred on the mainland, it was done so with the intent that performance would occur almost entirely in Hawaii. Thus, the court ruled that there was sufficient business activity by the corporation in Hawaii in its licensing agreement to justify the privilege tax. The court further ruled that the corporation extended its activities, with respect to the film prints and the telecast rights of those film prints, so as to avail itself of the protection, opportunities and benefits afforded by Hawaii.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment, which held that the tax assessments against the corporation were valid.</SPAN></P>

The court held: (1) an extended term sentencing hearing was a separate criminal proceeding apart from the trial of the underlying offense; (2) the state was required to establish all relevant issues beyond a reasonable doubt; (3) defendant was entitled to the full panoply of the relevant protections which due process guaranteed in state criminal proceedings; (4) ordinary rules of evidence applied to the extended term sentencing hearing, and the trial court erred when it admitted into evidence a presentence report; and (5) the record failed to show that defendant was represented by counsel during the alleged prior offense of which he was convicted or that he intelligently and voluntarily waived his constitutional right to counsel.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, university and officials, sought review of a decision of the Third Circuit Court (Hawaii), which issued an order enjoining them from discharging appellee professor from his employment for attaining the age of 65. The professor brought the action for an injunction against the university policy of re-appointing professors over 65 only if they were found to be of superior competence and their services were found to be necessary.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The professor contended that the policy violated the equal protection guarantees of the state and federal constitutions. The university and officials argued that the policy husbanded state funds, and that singling out professors older than 65 was reasonable because of the relationship of age with the ability to perform work. The court affirmed the judgment. The court rejected the argument on savings because it was unwilling to make the unlikely assumption upon which it was based and because the choice of age as the criteria would be inconsistent with state policy regarding age and employment of older residents. The court concluded that while the use of a certain age as a cut-off point in employment might be justified when uniformly applied without provision for individual evaluation, the provision permitting continued employment of a post-65 faculty member upon a showing of superior competence, provided that his services were needed, was not reasonably related to a state interest and was totally arbitrary. The court held that the policy as a whole and as interpreted and implemented in the case was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court enjoining the university and officials from discharging the professor under the university policy on age-based retirement.</SPAN></P>
