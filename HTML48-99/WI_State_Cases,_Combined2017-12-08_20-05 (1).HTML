<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff hospitals brought an action against named and presently unknown defendants, manufacturers, distributors, and installers of asbestos containing materials, seeking compensatory and punitive damages on a number of grounds, including negligence and strict liability. The hospitals requested a class certification generally described as all hospital entities in the United States.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The hospitals proposed a three-phase proceeding. A class trial would proceed on strict liability and negligence; the second phase would establish a trust with the level of funding to be determined; and the third phase would involve individual damage recovery steps. The court looked to the three criteria of Wis. R. Civ. P., Wis. Stat. &sect; 803.08 and determined that (1) the named parties had a right or interest in common because it was not necessary that the interests of every class member were identical; every class member desired the same outcome; and proof would be common in either the strict liability and the negligence contexts; (2) the hospitals' attorneys would adequately represent the interests of the absent class members; and (3) it would be impracticable to bring all interested hospitals before the court. However, given that around 97 percent of the class members would be from outside the state, with minimal, if any, contacts with the state, a material conflict existed with regard to the law to be applied. The court balanced the difficulties inherent in the hospitals' proposal and concluded that a nationwide class action would not be manageable, fair, or more convenient.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied the hospitals request for certification of a class for a nationwide class action. The court specifically did not dismiss the claim of any named hospital or preclude any class member from filing an action on its own behalf.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant city sought review of an adverse declaratory judgment from the Circuit Court for Milwaukee County (Wisconsin) granted pursuant to Wis. Stat. &sect; 806.04, which enjoined enforcement by arrest or citation of Milwaukee, Wis., Code of Ordinances &sect; 106-31(1)(a) (1979), prohibiting loitering.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested pursuant Wis. Stat. &sect; 800.02(6) for loitering in violation of Milwaukee, Wis., Code of Ordinances &sect; 106-31(1)(a). The trial court granted a declaratory judgment enjoining police officers from enforcing the loitering ordinance because it violated equal protection and due process guarantees and because it was vague and overbroad. The city argued that a defendant who sought declaratory relief had to file a separate civil suit. The court found that once disputed conduct had taken place, the equities of the declaratory relief remedy could be properly litigated in defense to a prosecution. However, the court reversed the judgment, finding that a violation of the loitering ordinance might give rise to probable cause to believe that a crime had been committed and that an arrest for such a violation did not necessarily violate the constitutional probable cause requirement. The court held that because defendant's conduct fell within the &quot;hard core&quot; of the ordinance, he could not be heard to complain that its provisions were unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 767.32(1). On appeal, the court held that 1977 Wis. Laws ch. 105, &sect; 62(1) did not permit the retroactive application of &sect; 767.32(1) to a judgment that was entered under Wis. Stat. &sect; 247.32 (1975). The court determined that ch. 105, &sect; 62(1) permitted the modification of orders only, not final judgments. Because the parties' rights, with respect to the term of maintenance, had been determined by a final judgment, &sect; 62(1) did not apply and the extension of maintenance was prohibited by &sect; 247.32 (1975).</SPAN></P>

Defendants were arrested by a city police officer and charged with trespassing when they refused to leave the courthouse after the closing hour, despite a request from a federal security guard. On appeal, the court determined that the trial court erred in concluding that the defense of legal justification was unavailable to defendants, but found that the trial court's error was harmless because defendants' belief that violating the city trespass ordinance was the only means of preventing bodily harm to them and others was not objectively reasonable. The court found that defendants failed to show that justice compelled a decision on the issue of the constitutionality of &sect; 23.07(2), which was the only means for appellate review as the issue was raised for the first time on appeal. The court determined that the record established that the security officer had authority to order defendants to leave and that he did so.</SPAN></P>

A police officer witnessed one bird in particular speaking loudly out of the front window.

Appellant questioned whether there was sufficient evidence to support her conviction pursuant to Wis. Stat. &sect; 805.17(2). On appeal, the court affirmed. The court noted that appellant's own witness testified that the birds could be heard half a block away from appellant's house. Moreover, the court's search of the record revealed evidence that appellant kept many birds, and that the birds caused frequent noise, disturbing her neighbor's &quot;comfort or repose.&quot; In addition, the court held that the ordinance clearly reached negligent conduct so that appellant's lack of intent was not a defense. Finally, the court rejected appellant's argument that the ordinance was unconstitutional because it did not adopt a precise means of measuring sound by using a meter because she cited no authority to support her proposition, a violation of Wis.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the landowner made alterations to an artificial outlet ditch on his property, a riparian landowner filed a complaint that the ditch was lowering the water level of the lake. Subsequently, the DNR ordered the landowner to restore and maintain the ditch to protect the riparian landowner's private property. On administrative review the order was affirmed, and the landowner sought judicial review. The trial court affirmed the DNR's order, and the landowner sought further review. On appeal, the landowner contended that the DNR's order constituted an unconstitutional taking of property and a denial of due process. The landowner also contended that the DNR was required to follow the procedures under Wis. Stat. &sect; 30.03(4)(a) before it could issue such an order. The court held that &sect; 30.03(4)(a) was inapplicable because there was no alleged violation of any statute relating to navigable waters. However, the court held that the order effectively deprived the landowner of substantially all beneficial use of this portion of his land. Therefore, the court ruled that the DNR's order was invalid because it constituted a taking of the landowner's property without statutory authority.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was stopped and issued citations for violating municipal ordinances regulating traffic. In preparation for transporting defendant to the police station to post bond, a police officer performed a weapons search. The officer found a &quot;military&quot; knife with a seven-to-nine-inch blade under defendant's clothing. Defendant was arrested for carrying a concealed weapon. The trial court convicted defendant after he pleaded no contest. On appeal, the court affirmed and held that the search was proper as incident to a lawful arrest, the weapon was admissible, and that the trial court properly denied defendant's motion to suppress. The court found that defendant was properly and lawfully arrested prior to the search. The court concluded that even if the arresting officer violated Wis. Stat. &sect; 345.23(2)(c) by transporting him to the station, the statutory violation could not form the basis for suppression of the knife. The court noted that there was no constitutional bar to searches incident to noncriminal traffic arrests.</SPAN></P>

The county executed a tax deed conveying all interest in the property to itself. The trial court initiated an eviction action in response to which the possessor and her ex-husband asserted the county's claim to the property was illegal and that its tax deed was false. The trial court found that the defensive allegation was a counterclaim under Wis.

No money was paid, and the trial court entered a judgment in favor of the county.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant owner challenged the judgment of the Circuit Court for Dunn County (Wisconsin) that evicted him from property owned by the county. The county treasurer purchased the property's tax certificate pursuant to Wis. Stat. &sect; 74.44(1) after the owner and his ex-wife failed to pay property taxes. The trial court treated the owner's defensive allegation as a counterclaim challenging the validity of the tax deed pursuant to Wis. Stat. &sect; 75.61(1).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court conditionally issued a judgment of eviction against the owner and his ex-wife if they failed to post the required payment. Neither made payment, and the eviction judgment was entered. The owner, appearing pro se, objected to the trial court's requirement that he post sums required by Wis. Stat. &sect; 75.61(1) as a condition of seeking relief and challenged the constitutionality of the tax deed statutes. In affirming, the court held that the provisions of &sect; 75.61(1) applied because the owner challenged the deed's validity. While the statute spoke of a &quot;plaintiff,&quot; the intent of the legislation prevailed, so the fact that the owner was a &quot;defendant&quot; was unimportant. Therefore, the owner was properly required to post payment. The court noted that Wis. Stat. &sect; 74.44, which authorized the county treasurer to be the exclusive bidder and purchaser of lands sold for delinquent taxes, had long been held constitutional despite due process and equal protection challenges. Furthermore, the framers of the constitution did not intend Wis. Const. art. I, &sect; 14 to restrict the legislature's power to enforce taxation because the power to tax was an absolute necessity to the sovereignty.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that the stop, seizure, and search of his vehicle and person were unconstitutional. On appeal, the court reversed the trial court's denial of defendant's motion to suppress and found that the police officers did not have probable cause to stop, seize, or search defendant's vehicle because there was no reasonable basis for the officers to conclude that defendant was committing, was about to commit, or had committed a crime, thereby allowing a temporary stop under Terry or Wis. Stat. &sect; 968.24. The court determined that the warrantless search and seizure might have been valid under the community caretaking exception to the warrant requirement but that the record on appeal did not support such a finding where the evidence had not been fully developed. The court remanded the case for a determination of whether the officers were performing a bona fide community caretaker function when they detained defendant and searched his vehicle. While police contacts with citizens seeking to resolve or defuse private disputes were within the community caretaker function, the court suggested that the stop of defendant's vehicle was a subterfuge.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff corporate taxpayer appealed from an order of the Circuit Court for Dane County (Wisconsin), which granted summary judgment to defendant, the Secretary of the Wisconsin Department of Revenue. The trial court found that the Wisconsin corporate franchise tax, Wis. Stat. &sect; 71.04(3) (1981), calculated by net income without credit for any windfall profit tax paid, did not violate Wis. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 1.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer was engaged in producing and marketing of crude oil and natural gas, and refining and marketing petroleum products. As a domestic oil producer, it was required to pay the federal windfall profit tax as set forth in the Crude Oil Windfall Profit Tax Act of 1980. However, Wis. Stat. &sect; 71.04(3) (1981) provided that the taxpayer could not deduct the windfall profit tax in calculating net income for the purpose of determining its Wisconsin corporate franchise tax. The taxpayer alleged that this was unconstitutional under the income tax provisions of Wis. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 1. The court disagreed, finding that the tax was not an income tax and thus not affected by income tax calculations. Instead, it was a franchise tax enacted under the &quot;privileges&quot; clause of the state constitution. Consequently, the legislature's decisions regarding possible exemptions only had to be &quot;reasonable&quot; which the court found to be true in the case at hand. The Wisconsin legislature was within its discretion to measure the corporate franchise tax by the taxpayer's net income without deducting the windfall profit tax.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment in favor of the Secretary and against the taxpayer, finding the franchise tax constitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff inmate sought review of the decision of the Circuit Court for Dane County (Wisconsin), which denied his motion for reconsideration of the dismissal of his complaint that had alleged that Wis. Admin. Code &sect; HSS 309.49(3), which dealt with money inmates kept in their prison accounts, was unconstitutional because of the way it was enforced.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The issues on appeal were whether the order denying reconsideration was appealable and whether the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction for the inmate's failure to serve the joint committee for review of administrative rules under Wis. Stat. &sect; 227.05(5) and for failure to serve the attorney general. The court first held that the trial court's order denying the inmate's motion for reconsideration met the new issues test and therefore the order was appealable. The court noted that failure to serve the attorney general had the effect of depriving a trial court of subject matter jurisdiction, when the constitutionality of a statute or an ordinance was attacked under Wis. Stat. &sect; 806.04(11). An action for declaratory judgment as to the validity of an administrative rule was a creature of statute and consequently strict compliance with the procedural requirements of the statute was required. Wis. Stat. &sect; 227.05(5) required service upon the joint committee for review of administrative rules. Therefore, because the statutes were not strictly complied with, the trial court lacked jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An inmate was placed in protective placement under Wis. Stat. &sect; 55.06 because her developmental disabilities and other incapacities made her incapable of providing for her own care and created a substantial risk of harm to herself. Two years later, a hearing was held and the trial court authorized her continued placement. On appeal, the court affirmed and held as follows: The inmate's constitutional issues all arose from her original placement. However, because the inmate did not appeal the original placement within the time specified in Wis. Stat. &sect; 55.06(18), the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over those issues. A psychiatrist and a social worker testified that the inmate suffered from serious mental disorders, could not address her daily living needs without help and supervision, and needed 24-hour supervision in order to prevent her from harming others. Therefore, the evidence was sufficient to meet the dangerousness element of protective custody specified in Wis. Stat. &sect; 55.06(2)(c).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Wis. Stat. &sect; 125.69(1)(a) prohibits an intoxicating liquor wholesaler, among others, from holding a direct or indirect interest in a retail &quot;Class A&quot; liquor license or establishment, and a retail &quot;Class A&quot; liquor licensee from holding a direct or indirect interest in a liquor wholesale permit or establishment, except that if such prohibited interest existed on October 3, 1963, licenses and permits which would otherwise be in violation of the restriction shall continue to be renewed unless other cause is shown for nonrenewal. Seventeen of the trade association members were in existence before October 3, 1963, but held no interest in a retail &quot;Class A&quot; liquor license. Several members who held a liquor wholesaler's license also held a retail &quot;Class A&quot; liquor license under the grandfather clause contained in &sect; 125.69(1)(a). A declaratory judgment was entered in favor of the Department of Revenue and the associated individual regarding the constitutionality of &sect; 125.69(1)(a). On review, the court reversed. The court held that the grandfather clause contained in &sect; 125.69(1)(a) created a classification without a rational basis and was a denial of the equal protection of the laws.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant taxpayers, comprised of a league of financial institutions, savings and loan associations, and other similar corporations, sought review of the summary judgment granted by the Circuit Court for Dane County (Wisconsin) for respondents, the Wisconsin Department of Revenue and the Department Secretary, finding that Wis. Stat. &sect; 71.01(2) (1983-1984), which imposed an annual franchise tax on domestic corporations, was constitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In computing net income subject to a corporate franchise tax under Wis. Stat. &sect; 71.01(2) (1983-1984), the Department included all income earned on stocks and obligations of the United States. The taxpayers contended that to the extent that &sect; 71.01(2) was a tax imposed on income earned on federal obligations, it violated the Supremacy Clause, U.S. Const. art. VI, cl. 2, and the Borrowing Clause, U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 8, cl. 2. On review, the court held that the inclusion of tax-exempt income in the measure of a corporate franchise tax does not invalidate the tax and therefore that Wis. Stat. &sect; 71.01(2) (1983-1984) did not violate the Supremacy or Borrowing Clauses. The court rejected the taxpayers' contention that &sect; 71.01(2) was invalid because the principal purpose of the statute was to reach and tax otherwise unreachable federal income and concluded that the legislative purpose in enacting the taxing statute was irrelevant as long as the tax operated in a constitutional way. Because &sect; 71.02(2) imposed a nondiscriminatory franchise tax on corporations, it was excepted from the exemption for stocks and obligations of the federal government extended by 31 U.S.C.S. &sect; 3142.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 343.44(1). He appealed from the judgment of the Circuit Court for Kenosha County (Wisconsin), contending that the trial court had no jurisdiction over him because the State of Wisconsin could not deprive him of his constitutional right to travel the public roads.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was stopped by a police officer for speeding. When asked for his driver's license, defendant explained his belief that he was not required to be licensed by the State in order to exercise his constitutional right to travel. He presented a typed document entitled &quot;Constitutional license&quot; and was arrested and cited for operating a motor vehicle after revocation. The court held that &sect; 343.44 was constitutional. The licensing requirement did not interrupt the right to pass. Wis. Stat. &sect; 343.05(2)(c) specifically exempted nonresidents licensed in other states from the requirement of a Wisconsin license. Thus, there was no provision of Wisconsin Law that interfered with the right to travel guaranteed by the United States Constitution. Further, the driving of a motor vehicle upon public highways was a privilege, not a right, and thus was subject to reasonable regulation under the State's police power in the interest of public safety and welfare. That police power was exercised by enacting Wis. Stat. &sect; 343.05(1)(a), which established a policy that no person could operate a motor vehicle upon a highway in the State unless a license had been issued that had had not been revoked.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a replevin action, a complaint against the sheriffs for seizing certain cattle and farm equipment was dismissed. The sheriffs then filed an action on the bond issued by the corporation pursuant to Wis. Stat. &sect; 810.03, to recover their legal expenses. The trial court granted the corporation and the association's motion for summary judgment. On appeal, the court reversed the judgment, holding that the bond required the corporation and the association to indemnify the sheriffs for their legal expenses in the district court. The court ruled that since &sect; 810.03 does not expressly prohibit a sheriff from demanding indemnification, if a sheriff has a reasonable doubt regarding the lawfulness of the replevin ordered by the court, the sheriff may ask the replevin plaintiff for indemnification. The sheriffs' complaint pled the issuance of the bond, the replevin, the federal district court action and its disposition, and the sheriffs' expenses in defending the action; thus, it stated a claim. The court concluded that the answer to the complaint stated a defense and raised issues of material fact. Therefore, the case was remanded for denial of the motion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At a supplemental hearing to collect on a judgment against him, defendant testified that he did not know who owned a corporation and that he never owned that corporation. At a later John Doe hearing, defendant testified that he owned the corporation when certain property was transferred to the corporation. As a result, defendant was convicted of violating Wis. Stat. &sect; 946.32(10(b) by knowingly making inconsistent statements under oath. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that defendant was the only incorporator of the corporation and its sole shareholder for over one month. Although the property was transferred before the Wisconsin Secretary of State issued the certificate of incorporation, the jury was entitled to consider matters occurring after the date of transfer to determine defendant's knowledge. The statements made at the two hearings directly contradicted each other. Thus, the circumstantial evidence was sufficient to show that defendant knew that one statement was false.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court limited the mother's visitation to visits within the State of Wisconsin.

The court affirmed the trial court's order. Under Wis. Stat. &sect; 767.245(1), non-custodial parents were entitled to reasonable visitation. They did not have an inviolate right to any particular visitation arrangement. That Wis. Stat. &sect; 767.245(6) provided that the non-custodial parent had the right to seek to prohibit the custodial parent from removing the child from the state for extended periods of time did not mean that the legislature intended to deny a court the power to limit visitation to a particular geographic area, and such a limitation did not unconstitutionally infringe upon the mother's right to travel.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff would-be candidate appealed a summary judgment of the Circuit Court for Washburn County (Wisconsin), which dismissed his action to compel the County and its Clerk to place the office of county surveyor on the general election ballot for a particular year. The main issue was whether Wis. Stat. &sect; 59.12, as amended by 1969 Wis. Laws 499, &sect; 1, was unconstitutional under Wis. Const. art. VI, &sect; 4, as amended 1882.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Section 59.12, as amended, provided that a county could appoint a surveyor in lieu of electing one. On appeal, the court noted that art. VI, &sect; 4, as amended, had been declared to be ambiguous in a 1907 Wisconsin Supreme Court decision because, if read literally, it would work an absurd or unreasonable result by impliedly repealing the appointment powers granted the legislature in Wis. Const. art. XIII, &sect; 9. The court construed art. XIII, &sect; 9 together with art. VI, &sect; 4 in order to harmonize the provisions. Under the Supreme Court's decision, the phrase &quot;all other county officers&quot; in art. VI, &sect; 4 included all those officers considered as elected county officials under the constitution and the early statutes. After 1882, the previously statutorily elected county officers became constitutionally elected officers, and the legislature could create new county offices under Wis. Const. art. XIII, &sect; 9 and fill them as they saw fit. But the court pointed out that the office of county surveyor had existed since 1849 and had constitutional status. A 1982 amendment of art. VI, &sect; 4 merely clarified existing law. The court referenced other external sources in support of its analysis.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court upheld the Board's denial of the business owners' request for a zoning variance to operate a cat shelter. On appeal, the judgment was affirmed as to the denial of the variance. The court ruled that because Milwaukee, Wis., Ordinance &sect; 78-1 (1979) afforded proper notice, and because there was a reasonable basis in the evidence for the Board's determination that the owners' facility had a detrimental impact on the appropriate use of abutting properties and the neighborhood. The court remanded for further proceedings, because the Board failed to determine whether the facility was a pet shop or a kennel. The court held that &sect; 78-1 was written with sufficient clarity to allow citizens to reasonably recognize what precise activity was regulated and to demonstrate to those who enforce the ordinance what type of activity to regulate. The court concluded that the burden of proof had not been met; thus, the constitutional challenge for vagueness failed.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 893.89.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee of the mill was standing on the upper endless belt when the conveyors were set into motion causing him to fall backward onto the conveyor belt. Unable to free himself, he was pulled into the machinery, which amputated his leg. He brought suit against various defendants, based on negligence in the design and supervision of the sawmill renovation. This action was filed more than six years following the substantial completion of the renovation. Defendants filed a motion for summary judgment on the grounds that the suit was not commenced within six years of substantial completion as required by Wis. Stat. &sect; 893.89. The trial court granted the motion and dismissed the action. The employee appealed. The court affirmed after it concluded that the machinery and equipment, specifically the conveyor system, were improvements to real estate as defined by &sect; 893.89. The conveyor system increased the value of the real estate, and while it could have been removed without damage to the property, it functioned as an integral component of the entire manufacturing process. The court also held that the statute was constitutional because it was unambiguous and not unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant farmer appealed from a judgment and an order of the Circuit Court for Taylor County (Wisconsin), which found him guilty of producing milk not properly protected from filth, dust, or other contaminants contrary to Wis. Stat. &sect; 97.10(2). The farmer challenged the constitutionality of Wis. Stat. &sect; 97.12(2) that authorized the search and asserted that the search conducted was a violation of his federal and state constitutional rights.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Wisconsin Department of Agriculture received a complaint that the farmer's milk contained excessive amounts of sediments and other particles. Department agents arrived at the farm at approximately 11 a.m., introduced themselves, and inspected the dairy barn, milkhouse, and milking equipment, taking photographs and specimens. The farmer challenged the constitutionality of Wis. Stat. &sect; 97.12(1), which authorized the agents to inspect and obtain samples at his barn and milkhouse, alleging that it violated his right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures under the Fourth Amendment and Wis. Const. art. I, &sect; 1, and that it was unconstitutionally overbroad because it authorized searches of private homes and vague because the terms &quot;farm&quot; and &quot;places&quot; were indefinite. The court disagreed, finding the statute to be constitutional. There was a substantial interest in keeping the marketplace free from contaminants to protect the public's health. Milk production was a closely regulated industry. The inspection was conducted at a reasonable time and limited to those areas that were involved in milk production. The farmer's overbreadth and vagueness arguments were rejected.</SPAN></P>

Defendant testified that he hired the friend to scare his ex-wife. The friend pled guilty to first-degree murder, while defendant and his hairdresser were convicted of first-degree murder. On review, the court affirmed. The court held that based on the evidence the trial court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to instruct on aiding and abetting because the thrust of the evidence was clearly on conspiracy.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee was injured in the course of his employment.

On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's judgment. The court ruled that Wis. Stat. &sect; 102.53(2) was applicable because the employee's rights to compensation vested and the obligation for payment was fixed as of the date of his injury, not the date that he filed his claim for benefits.

Defendant alleged that the state driver licensing and registration requirements interfered with her right to drive on public highways. The court concluded that the circuit court had subject matter jurisdiction and affirmed defendant's convictions and the denial of her motions. The court was bound by the state supreme court's decision that citizens did not have a constitutional right and had only a privilege to drive automobiles on public highways. The licensing requirement did not completely lack a reasonable basis because it appeared to increase the likelihood that drivers were competent and responsible. The court held that defendant was not denied due process of law because she acknowledged that she had timely notice when she received two written traffic citations and notice of the return dates. Defendant failed to make a timely appearance at the hearing date or to reschedule the hearing on the citations, and there was no need for the appearance when she did not contest the facts of the case.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed orders of the Circuit Court of Milwaukee County (Wisconsin), which convicted him of robbery while possessing a dangerous weapon in violation of Wis.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant claimed that he was denied due process because the robbery charge was improperly enhanced under &sect; 939.63(1)(a)(2), which resulted in his conviction for robbery while possessing a dangerous weapon. In addition, he contended that he was denied his state and federal due process rights when the prosecutor raised the issue of his post-arrest silence during both cross-examination and closing argument. On appeal, the court affirmed defendant's convictions. The court held that the issue of whether &sect; 939.63 could be used in conjunction with &sect; 943.32 was a question of statutory construction, which was a question of law. The court found that both statutes were clear and unambiguous. The court held that &sect; 939.63 could be applied to a charge of robbery under &sect; 943.32(1) so defendant was not denied due process when he was convicted under both &sect;&sect; 943.32(1)(b), 939.63(1)(a)(2).The court ruled that the prosecutor's comments did not infringe on defendant's due process rights under the state and federal constitutions to remain silent because the comments were aimed at defendant's credibility and were not aimed at his silence at the time of arrest.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, mother, husband, and children by their guardian ad litem, sought review of the order of the Circuit Court for Dane County (Wisconsin), which required them and respondent putative father to submit to blood tests to determine the paternity of the children. The trial court also denied appellants' motions to dismiss the putative father's paternity action and for summary judgment recognizing the husband as the father of the children.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The issue was whether the trial court erred in ordering the blood tests or denying the motions. The court rejected appellants' contention that the paternity statutes should be construed to require a finding that continuation of the action was in the child's best interest before a blood test could be ordered. The court dismissed appellants' contention that the constitutional rights of an unmarried male who has not been adjudicated a father depended on his participation in the rearing of his child. The court held that if it was determined that the putative father was the children's father, the best interest of the child standard would be applied before the putative father was afforded custody or visitation. The court held that the trial court's interpretation of Wis. Stat. &sect; 767.48(1) did not deprive appellants of due process. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment when it denied the motion for judgment on the pleadings as material facts were disputed in the putative father's petition and the mother's response as to whether the putative father was the father.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant landowners sought review of an order from the Circuit Court for Portage County (Wisconsin), which dismissed an inverse condemnation action against respondent town and granted costs to the town.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowners appealed from a judgment dismissing their inverse condemnation action against the town and from an order granting cost to the town. The dispute concerned a town road which was mistakenly laid out so that it encroached on a strip of land owned. On appeal, the court reversed the judgment in part. The court held that based on the undisputed facts, the landowners had no cause of action against the town, and a reasonable and impartial jury could come to no other conclusion. Because the court found nothing in the statutes or the case law which prohibited portions of the same public highway from being created under both Wis. Stat. &sect; 80.01(1) and (2), the court rejected the landowners' argument that the town could not legally acquire the land when it laid out the road. The trial court erred in giving the town title to the land upon which the road encroached. Absent a statute expressly providing for acquisition of title, or a deed expressly conveying title, the landowner retained title to the underlying land when a road was established by prescription or adverse use. The public acquired only an easement to use the land.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order of the lower court dismissing the landowners' inverse condemnation action was reversed to the extent that it gave title to land upon which the road encroached to the town.</SPAN></P>

The victim, who was 48 years old, was four feet nine inches tall, weighed 90 pounds, had poor eyesight, and wore thick glasses.

Defendant was convicted and appealed. He argued that the trial court erred in instructing the jury on the victim's disability. The court held that defendant's failure to object to the instructions waived his right to challenge them. The court rejected defendant's argument that the evidence was insufficient to convict. The direct evidence of the victim's injuries from the victim's and the physician's testimony sustained the conviction. Moreover, the physician's testimony that the victim had a discernible physical disability would also have allowed the jury to presume the ultimate fact that defendant's conduct created a high probability of great bodily harm to the victim.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Circuit Court for Waukesha County (Wisconsin) that convicted her of homicide by intoxicated use of a motor vehicle in violation of Wis. Stat. &sect; 940.09(1)(a) and from an order that denied her any postconviction relief. An issue presented on appeal was whether or not rejection of the defense based on Wis. Stat. &sect; 940.09(2) was sufficiently supported by evidence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the victim had suddenly moved into the roadway so that his death would have ensued, regardless of whether or not she was under the influence of an intoxicant or had a certain blood-alcohol level. Wis. Stat. &sect; 940.09(2) provided an affirmative defense if the death would have happened regardless of intoxication. The court found based on an eyewitness and a pathologist's testimony that the victim had been dragged a substantial distance before defendant stopped her car. This testimony supported the inference that the intoxication caused defendant not to stop immediately after impact and that the dragging contributed to the death. The court stated the jury's rejection of the defense of &sect; 940.09(2) was supported by sufficient evidence. The court rejected defendant's other arguments, including one that posited that it was an error for the trial court to refuse her request to instruct the jury on the emergency doctrine and avoidability of accidents. The court ruled that those instructions were proper for civil cases but not justified in this case because a driver's negligent operation of a vehicle was not an element of the crime defined by Wis. Stat. &sect; 940.09.</SPAN></P>

The parole agent searched defendant's apartment and discovered the nude body of a 14-year-old boy in the closet. Defendant gave a confession in which he admitted that he killed the boy while the two were engaged in anal intercourse. At the trial, because the State failed to prove second-degree sexual assault with a person whom defendant knew to be unconscious, the State was allowed to amend the information to charge second-degree sexual assault, sexual contact or sexual intercourse with a person contrary to Wis. Stat. &sect; 940.225(2)(e) to conform to the proof. Defendant was convicted of second degree murder and second-degree sexual assault. His postconviction motion was denied. On review, defendant's major assertion was that the amendment to the information was error. The court affirmed.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner former professor appealed an order of the Circuit Court for Portage County (Wisconsin), which affirmed a decision by respondent, the Board of Regents of the University of Wisconsin System, not to hold a formal hearing to review the chancellor's denial of tenure to the professor. On appeal, the professor contended that faculty members who had been denied tenure had rights under Wis. Admin. Code &sect; UWS ch. 3.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The professor had a series of yearly probationary contracts for seven years; the eighth year was her &quot;up or out&quot; year in which she had to become tenured or her employment with the university would terminate. The chancellor decided not to renew her employment or grant tenure. The professor argued that she met the tenure criteria set in Wis. Admin. Code &sect; UWS 3.06(1)(b). She also argued that because tenure density was not an enumerated criterion, the chancellor exceeded his authority in considering it. On appeal, the court affirmed. It concluded that the chancellor properly applied the tenure criteria and that the professor had not met the requirements for a contested case hearing, as set forth in Wis. Stat. &sect; 227.064(1) (1981-82). The court found that the professor had merely a &quot;unilateral expectation&quot; of becoming tenured, not a &quot;substantial interest.&quot; Furthermore, a contested case hearing before the Board regarding the denial of tenure was not required because the legislature intended to deny nonrenewed probationary faculty members a hearing, having specified in &sect; 227.064(1) when such a hearing was required.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of the trial court's conviction judgment and denial of his request for post-conviction relief for his violation of &sect; 346.63(1)(a). Defendant asserted that the trial court gave a jury instruction which created a mandatory presumption, thereby reducing the state's burden of proof in violation of his due process rights. He also contended that he had ineffective assistance from his trial counsel. The court on appeal affirmed the conviction decision of the trial court based on its conclusion that, even though the trial court erred in its phrasing of the instruction about the concentration of alcohol in defendant's blood, the instruction did not improperly reduce the state's burden of proof because it did not deal with an elemental fact. Therefore, defendant's constitutional rights were not violated. As to an alleged statutory violation occasioned by the erroneous instruction, the court on appeal concluded that no prejudice resulted. The appellate court also determined that defendant's trial counsel was not ineffective and no prejudice was shown to have disadvantaged defendant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant entered a plea of no contest to the charge of stealing two sheep and agreed to the five year sentence with probation. When he violated the terms of his probation, it was revoked and the five year sentence was imposed. The trial court denied his motion for a sentence reduction, and on appeal, the court affirmed, holding that the sentence was not cruel or unusual punishment under either the Wisconsin or United States constitutions. The court concluded that the sentence was proportionate to the crime in light of defendant's extensive prior record and the fact that he had violated probation. Defendant's agreement to the sentence was also relevant in determining that the sentence was not unduly harsh. The court found that Wisconsin's penalty for theft of livestock was not extreme in relation to penalties for similar crimes in other states. The court refused to reverse in the interest of justice under Wis. Stat. &sect; 752.35. Defendant was not entitled to use that statute to raise the issue of abuse of discretion in sentencing that could not have been raised in his motion to reduce the sentence under Wis.

The district attorney did not refer to defendant's silence, but to the absence of other evidence to impeach the State's witnesses. Some of the remarks were improper, such as derogatory remarks about the victim's mother, who was defendant's girlfriend. However, the remarks did not deprive defendant of a fair trial.

Stat. &sect; 893.55(1)(b). Plaintiff wife appealed from the denial of her claim for loss of society and companionship.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The patient was allegedly rendered sterile during surgery performed when he was an infant. He first discovered his injury 22 years later when he sought medical advice for a fertility problem. The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of the clinic in the patient's medical malpractice action on the ground that the patient failed to file his claim within the statute of limitations, &sect; 893.55(1)(b). On appeal, the court declared the statute unconstitutional in its application to the patient and reversed. Under &sect; 893.55(1)(b), a medical malpractice claim could never be commenced more than five years from the act or omission. Thus, the patient's claim expired before he could have discovered his injury with reasonable diligence. Therefore, he was deprived of a remedy for his injuries contrary to Wis. Const. art. I, &sect; 9. The court rejected a contention that the controlling statutes of limitation were those that existed at the time of the patient's injury. His medical malpractice claim did not accrue at the time of his injury but only after discovery. The court rejected the wife's claim for loss of society and companionship because it was raised but not briefed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment dismissing the patient's claim. It summarily rejected the wife's claim.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment from the Circuit Court for Sauk County (Wisconsin). The trial court denied his motion to dismiss charges of violating Wis. Stat. &sect; 346.63(1)(a) by operating a motor vehicle under the influence of an intoxicant and Wis. Stat. &sect; 346.63(1)(b) by operating a motor vehicle with a blood alcohol content of .10 percent or more. Defendant contended that the State had failed to timely prosecute the action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant first unsuccessfully moved to dismiss his case on the grounds that the statutes under which he was charged were unconstitutionally vague. The trial court adjourned the case until a ruling on appeal was made. For some reason, the trial court did not consider the case again for almost three years, when it denied defendant's second motion to dismiss for failure to prosecute. On review, defendant contended that the trial court had abused its discretion in denying his motion and had failed to adequately state its reasons for denial on the record. Noting that a first violation of &sect; 346.63(1) was a civil forfeiture and not a criminal proceeding, the court found no abuse of discretion. The court ruled that any speedy trial argument was misplaced and that while the reason for the delay was not clear on the record, it appeared that defendant's actions contributed to it. The court also noted that the record contained adequate evidence of the trial court's exercise of discretion, considering the extensive briefing and arguments of counsel.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant asserted that &sect; 52.05(1) was unconstitutional. Preliminarily, the court ruled that it was neither unconstitutional nor a violation of the equal protection of the laws.

Defendant argued that the trial court insufficiently explained the elements of the crime to him. The court refused to hold that the trial court had an unequivocal duty in every case to explain every element of the charged crime to the accused. The court determined that defendant understood the nature of the charge upon making the plea. The court relied on, inter alia, the written plea negotiation that defendant had signed, which included his admission that he understood that an inability to provide support was a defense to the allegations against him.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The issues were: (1) whether the trial court erred in allowing a transcript of the preliminary hearing testimony of one of the child victims to be read to the jury; (2) whether the evidence was sufficient to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant had sexual contact with the victims with the intent to become sexually aroused or gratified; (3) whether defendant's six-year sentence was so excessive and harsh as to constitute an abuse of the trial court's discretion; and (4) whether a new trial should have been ordered in the interest of justice. The court resolved all issues against defendant, and affirmed. The evidence presented was sufficient for a finding of guilt. Also, considering the record and the trial court's articulation of the reasons for the sentence imposed, the court could not say that it was so excessive, unusual, and so disproportionate to the offense committed as to shock public sentiment, and violate the judgment of reasonable people concerning what was right and proper under the circumstances.

At trial, defendant argued that his actions were privileged because the children they were in danger of imminent physical harm. On appeal, defendant argued that &sect; 946.715(2)(a) was unconstitutionally vague because it failed to specify what constituted &quot;imminent physical harm.&quot; The court held that &sect; 946.715(2)(a) was constitutional because it used common terms and sufficiently alerted a person of ordinary intelligence that if a child was in close danger of bodily injury, a parent could conceal that child from the other parent in order to protect the child from that danger. The trial court erred by including the words &quot;necessary&quot; and immediate&quot; in its instruction because &sect; 946.715(2)(a) did not contemplate the use of such terms within the context of the privilege.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The worker sustained a work-related injury. Medical treatment left him a quadriplegic; he was permanently and totally disabled. The worker settled a medical malpractice claim against his treating physician. The employer sought subrogation rights in the settlement because it was obligated to pay worker's compensation for the injury as enhanced by the physician's negligence. The trial court held that &sect; 102.29(3) violated equal protection of the laws and was unconstitutional. The worker appealed. The court noted that &sect; 102.29(3) denied subrogation to a limited class of employers: those whose employees' work related injuries were caused or aggravated by the negligent treatment of physicians, chiropractors, or podiatrists. All other employers whose employees' injuries were aggravated by a third party could recover under &sect; 102.29(1). The court held that the limited application of &sect; 102.29(3) denied certain employer equal protection of the law because it was arbitrary and not rationally related to a legitimate state interest.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State appealed from an order of the Circuit Curt for Green Lake County (Wisconsin), which granted defendant's motion to dismiss a prosecution for theft in violation of Wis. Stat. &sect; 943.20(1)(a). The main issue was whether, after a prior dismissal of a charge of theft by fraud, Wis. Stat. &sect; 943.20(1)(d), the subsequent prosecution for theft was unconstitutional because jeopardy had attached.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The original complaint contained three charges. After numerous amendments to the complaint and the information, the trial court engaged in a dialogue with the State and defendant, during which the State agreed to proceed only with the original information charging theft by fraud, Wis. Stat. &sect; 943.20(1)(d), (3)(c), but broadening the theft by fraud charge to a longer time period. The prosecutor told the trial judge that he was not planning to recharge defendant in any way regarding the other counts and agreed with the judge's statement that the theft by fraud charge was the only charge that the prosecutor would be proceeding against defendant on. However, after the theft by fraud charge was dismissed, the State filed a new complaint against defendant alleging theft in violation of &sect; 943.20(1)(a). On appeal, the court held that, under any standard of review, the State's promise not to recharge defendant barred the State from prosecuting him further on the same facts. A prosecutorial promise was considered binding and had to be fulfilled. The State's failure to keep its promise was a deprivation of defendant's right to due process.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant driver appealed a judgment of the Circuit Court for Milwaukee County (Wisconsin), which denied the driver's motions to dismiss and his request for an evidentiary hearing. The driver also appealed the trial court's order that declared the driver to be a habitual traffic offender under Wis. Stat. ch. 351, thereby revoking his operating privileges for five years.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The driver appealed the trial court's order, which revoked his operator's license for five years for being a habitual traffic offender. The court held that where the driver specifically raised the issue of whether due diligence was actually exercised prior to service by publication, the driver raised not only the legal issue of due diligence, but factual issues that could only be resolved by an evidentiary hearing. Thus, the trial court erred in failing to hold an evidentiary hearing on the issue of the trial court's personal jurisdiction over the driver. Wis. Stat. ch. 351 was not unconstitutionally vague because a person of ordinary intelligence was able to determine when he or she fell under ch. 351. Minor out-of-state traffic offenses could be used as a basis for convicting an individual as a habitual traffic offender in Wisconsin under the clear language of Wis. Stat. &sect; 351.02(1)(c). The driver was not deprived of his right to a jury trial under Wis. Const. art. I, &sect; 5 because habitual traffic offender proceedings were not known to the common law when the state constitution was passed; thus, there was no right to a jury trial in such proceedings.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment of the trial court, which denied the driver's request for an evidentiary hearing on the issue of personal jurisdiction. The court remanded to the trial court with directions to hold an evidentiary hearing to determine whether the State exercised due diligence in its attempt to personally serve the driver prior to using service by publication. The court affirmed the remainder of the trial court's judgment.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the plain meaning of &sect; 895.035 imposed an absolute liability, not subject to exceptions or defenses, on the parents of a minor child for that minor's wilful, malicious, or wanton acts.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant county sought review from a judgment of the Circuit Court for Brown County (Wisconsin), which affirmed an order of respondent Employment Relations Commission. The commission had concluded that that the county had committed a &quot;prohibited practice,&quot; in violation of the Municipal Employment Relations Act (MERA) by refusing to bargain with respondent union concerning the employment of nonunion personnel in a youth home.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The county argued that because of the Commission's limited experience in like situations, the court should apply MERA to the facts without deference to the Commission. The court disagreed, finding the Commission's conclusion should be upheld. A private corporation responsible for the operation of a youth home, which had been previously run by the county, hired only one of the county's previous employees when it took over the group home. The court held that a rational basis supported the Commission's conclusion that the county's decision to subcontract its youth home services related primarily to wages, hours, or conditions of employment. When the county decided to move the youth home to a smaller location, it had a choice of employing its own personnel or employing personnel hired. Because the county chose to allow the private corporation to provide a nonbargaining unit staff for the new youth home, and because the new youth home's operation required essentially similar staff skills, the Commission had a rational basis for concluding that the county's decision primarily affected the county employees' wages, hours, or conditions of employment.</SPAN></P>

The judgment was entered on stipulations after the trial court struck defendant's defense that the insured vehicle was used without the owner's permission because defendant failed to comply with Wis.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs' action alleged that a vehicle insured by defendant struck the individual's vehicle. Defendant attempted to comply with Wis. Stat. &sect; 344.15 (1983-84), which required it to advise the Department of Transportation if there was no coverage because the vehicle was driven without the owner's permission, by filing a statement signed by the vehicle's owner. The statement was rejected because the signature was not notarized. On appeal, the court held that the statute was mandatory and that the doctrine of substantial compliance was not applicable. The statute was mandatory because it was: (1) clear and unambiguous, (2) included a penalty for noncompliance, (3) was not a remedial statute, and (4) was directed to private individuals who controlled their own compliance with the statute. Because the deadline was part of the statute's substance, filing the notarized affidavit after the deadline was not substantial compliance. The court refused to address defendant's constitutional arguments because defendant failed to notify the state attorney general, a prerequisite to such a challenge, and failed to adequately brief the issue.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant employee sought review of an order of the Circuit Court for Forest County (Wisconsin), which affirmed the decision of respondent, a state labor and industry review commission, to deny the employee's application for unemployment compensation benefits, on the ground that his physical limitations rendered him unavailable for work in his labor market area, pursuant to Wis. Stat. &sect; 108.04(2)(a) and Wis. Admin. Code ILHR &sect; 128 (1984).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After 40 years of employment with respondent employer, the employee was laid off from his job. The employee sought unemployment compensation benefits, and an investigation revealed that he had a heart condition, which restricted the type of work he could do. At a hearing on the employee's application, a job counselor familiar with the employee's labor market testified that he was only physically able to perform about 10 percent of all available jobs in the area. For this reason, the commission denied the employee's request for benefits. On appeal from the circuit court's affirmance of the commission's decision, the employee contended that the compensation eligibility standard provided by Wis. Stat. &sect; 108.04(2)(a) and Wis. Admin. Code ILHR &sect; 128 (1984), which rendered persons ineligible for benefits if they were limited to less than 15 percent of the opportunities available in the area, violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The court determined that the eligibility standard did not violate equal protection principles because the standard created a reasonable classification to ensure a solvent state compensation fund.</SPAN></P>

The alleged progenitor sought review challenging the constitutionality of Wis. Stat. &sect; 767.48(4), regarding the right to present the alleged evidence of the mother's other sexual encounters. The court affirmed the directed verdict, holding that the alleged progenitor failed to notify the attorney general, thus could not challenge the constitutionality of the statute.

The court held that defendant had no standing to raise the constitutionality of Wis. Const. art.

Evidence of defendant's driving at a high rate of speed, weaving, and crossing the centerline established probable cause for his arrest. The court ruled that the trial court properly concluded that defendant's conduct during the administration of the breathalyzer test constituted a refusal to take the test. It was not clearly erroneous for the trial court to conclude that defendant was not suffering from a debilitating ailment, which prevented him from successfully completing the breath test.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parent had been committed for drug treatment in a residential rehabilitation program, pursuant to Wis. Stat. &sect; 48.45. However, she did not complete the program. Ultimately, the court found her in contempt and placed her in jail, except for the time she spent in the rehabilitation program. The parent contended that such commitments were governed exclusively by Wis. Stat. &sect; 51.001 and that the trial court's actions deprived her of her constitutional rights. The county alleged that, under its inherent powers, it was authorized to take the action that it did, and that Wis. Stat. &sect; 48.45 was the applicable statute. The court found that it was the legislature's intent to unify the system to combat drug and alcohol disorders by Wis. Stat. &sect; 51.001. Further, no class of citizens was exempt from that statute's mandates. Thus, &sect; 51.001 applied, and it preempted other legislation regarding involuntary commitments. Therefore, the trial court erred. Additionally, the inherent powers of the county did not apply because the commitment of the parent was not necessary in light of available alternatives.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowner's lot was created by a predecessor in title's illegal split-off of two acres from a 10-acre parcel zoned for agriculture use. The landowner purchased the lot knowing that the predecessor had not complied with a county ordinance requiring an approved certified survey map. The circuit court found that the landowner was estopped from seeking rezoning because of the predecessor's failure to obtain an approved map. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment against the landowner despite the circuit court's erroneous conclusion that the town board could disapprove a rezoning application due to the absence of an approved map. The court upheld the town's decision to deny the rezoning request due to highway safety and erosion reasons and to limit residential development pursuant to the town's land use plan. By failing to prove that no profitable use could be made of lots less than 35 acres, the landowner was unable to challenge the constitutionality of the agricultural zoning classification. The landowner could not prematurely claim monetary damages for a regulatory taking because his hardship was self-created and he had not sought a variance or claimed inverse condemnation.</SPAN></P>

The court concluded that the jury had sufficient evidence to infer beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant had either committed the murder or had aided and abetted a third person in murdering the victim. As to defendant's argument that he was prejudiced because the State did not indicate that it would request a party-to-the-crime instruction until after defendant rested his case without calling witnesses, the court ruled that the State had no duty to notify defendant of its intent to rely on the party-to-a-crime instruction where the evidence supporting such an instruction came to light in the middle of a trial. The court further ruled that the trial court did not err by admitting preliminary examination testimony of a witness who invoked the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution at trial where the jury had a reasonable basis for judging the reliability of the witness's prior statements. Also, the trial court did not err in denying defendant's motion for a new trial in the interests of justice where defendant failed to show that the real controversy had not been tried.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed an order from the Circuit Court, Dane County, Wisconsin. The order denied defendant's motion for postconviction relief pursuant to Wis. Stat. &sect; 974.06 from his convictions for first-degree murder and armed robbery. Defendant argued: (1) the trial court lacked jurisdiction because the judge did not honor his request for substitution; (2) ineffective assistance of counsel; and, (3) erroneous jury instruction on intent.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial judge did not honor defendant's substitution request under Wis. Stat. &sect; 971.20 (1971). While the request deprived the judge of authority to act further, it did not deprive the trial court of jurisdiction. Failure to honor the request for substitution was not a cognizable claim under Wis. Stat. &sect; 974.06. The judge's insistence that an accomplice testify against defendant pursuant to a plea bargain did not show a bias against defendant. Attorneys from the same agency represented defendant and codefendants. Defendant did not raise the ineffective assistance issue at trial or in prior postconviction motions. He did not meet his burden to show that his defense was prejudiced by the multiple representation. The jury instruction on intent was harmless error at most. Defendant was charged under Wis. Stat. &sect; 939.05(1) (1971) as a party to first-degree murder. He was implicated as part of a conspiracy to rob a tavern and was identified as a robbery participant. His personal intention to kill the victims who were shot during the robbery was irrelevant. He was liable for the robbery he agreed to commit and the murders that resulted as a natural and probable consequence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The prosecution argued that the trial court's order derived from an errant application of the rape shield law, Wis. Stat. &sect; 972.11(2). Defendant prevailed. Section 972.11(2) was ambiguous, in that it was capable of being construed in two different ways by reasonably well-informed persons as to whether a written or verbal communication or expression having a sexual basis or connotation could be, or described as, conduct or behavior relating to sexual activities. The ambiguity of Wis. Stat. &sect; 972.11(2) compelled a determination of the legislature's intent from the language of the statute in relation to its scope, history, context, subject matter, and the object sought to be accomplished. Legislative history was extrinsic evidence to be used in divining the legislature's intent. The court reviewed these sources and concluded that: (1) the act of writing about sexual desires or activities was not itself prior sexual conduct; (2) acts of composing or copying notes of a sexual basis or connotation were not prior sexual conduct; and (3) written expressions of sexual desires were not conduct or behavior. The notes were therefore admissible under &sect; 972.11(2).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant from a judgment and an order of the Circuit Court for Milwaukee County (Wisconsin), which convicted him of second-degree murder, contrary to Wis. Stat. &sect; 940.02, and from an order denying his motion for a new trial. Defendant claimed that the trial court's refusal to instruct the jury on self-defense manslaughter was error.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At his trial on a charge of first-degree murder defendant contended that he believed that the person he shot to death had a gun and was going to shoot him, and that his use of deadly force was necessary to defend himself. Defendant's attorney requested that the trial court give Wis. JI--Criminal 1141, entitled &quot;First Degree Murder -- Self-Defense Manslaughter.&quot; The trial court declined to give Instruction 1141, but instead used Wis. JI--Criminal 1140, although the Committee Comment to Instruction 1141 stated that Instruction 1140 was withdrawn and should not be used. Defendant's attorney did not specifically object to the use of Instruction 1140. Although defendant's counsel waived any objection he might have had to Instruction 1140, the court addressed and rejected defendant's contention that the erroneous instructions were so prejudicial as to constitute plain error justifying a reversal of his conviction. The ailing instruction by itself did not result in a conviction that violated due process, because the error, if any, was rendered harmless by other parts of the instructions, and there was no reasonable possibility that absent the error the verdict would have been different.</SPAN></P>

He argued that the term &quot;attending&quot; was ambiguous. He claimed that he could not leave his name with the trooper because the trooper was attending the driver, not the driver's car. The court found that the failure to define the word &quot;attending&quot; did not offend due process. The jury's determination of &quot;reasonable assistance&quot; did not render &sect; 346.67(1)(c)&nbsp;unconstitutionally vague. Defendant waived objections to jury instructions.

The administrator argued on appeal that the charging statute,&nbsp;Wis.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An adult at the administrator's school was convicted of sexually assaulting boys who resided there. At trial, a school counselor testified that he had informed the administrator several times that the adult was making &quot;advances&quot; toward the boys. On appeal, the administrator argued that there was insufficient evidence to convict him of failing to report suspected child abuse. He also claimed that &sect; 48.981's phrase &quot;reasonable cause to suspect&quot; was ambiguous and vague. The court concluded that &sect; 48.981 was constitutional and that there was sufficient evidence to convict. The phrase &quot;reasonable cause to suspect&quot; was a readily understandable standard. The court reversed, however, because the trial court's error in failing to instruct on the wilful element of the offense violated the administrator's constitutional right to due process. As a result, the jury was allowed to convict the administrator simply because he had failed to report suspected child abuse.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff retailer sought review of a judgment from the Circuit Court for Pierce County (Wisconsin), which declared that an ordinance promulgated by defendant village was valid. The ordinance, Ellsworth, Wis., Code &sect; 12.06(3)(a) (1980), limited &quot;Class A&quot; retailers' licenses for the sale of fermented malt beverages to retailers who primarily sold groceries.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The village refused to renew the retailer's license to sell fermented malt beverages to be consumed off the premises because the retailer failed to establish that it was &quot;primarily&quot; a grocery store as required by a recently enacted ordinance. On appeal of a judgment declaring the ordinance valid, the court affirmed. The court rejected the retailer's argument that the ordinance was enacted without authority because Wis. Stat. ch. 125 had preempted the subject matter. The village was authorized to regulate its local affairs by the Home Rule amendment, Wis. Const. art. XI, &sect; 3 and by Wis. Stat. &sect; 62.11(5). Additionally, Wis. Stat. &sect; 125.10 specifically authorized the village to incorporate state law governing the sale of alcohol and to prescribe additional regulations not in conflict with Wis. Stat. ch. 125. The ordinance did not deny equal protection of the laws. No fundamental right or suspect classification was involved. The ordinance's limitation of a Class A license to those retailers who primarily sold groceries rationally related to the legitimate public purpose of limiting the availability of alcohol. Nor was the ordinance unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>

The trial court adopted, without comment, the State's claim that petitioners had failed to establish that they shared a common interest with other members of the proposed class in obtaining a judicial determination that psychotropic drugs were being unconstitutionally administered to them. In light of the State's concession that it had used, and would continue to use, psychotropic drugs on involuntarily committed individuals, regardless of their competency, the court reversed and concluded that the putative class shared a common interest and that the trial court's finding in this matter were clearly erroneous. The court held that the unauthorized use of psychotropic drugs to treat mental illness not only infringed upon the right to bodily autonomy, but could also cause actual harm due to adverse side effects.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's discretionary judgment on the intervention issue. The court reversed on all other issues because petitioners' claim fell within a well-established exception to the mootness rule. The trial court misused its discretion in denying class certification, and the court found that involuntarily committed citizens retained the right to exercise informed consent before psychotropic drugs were administered.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, the conservator of a mentally ill individual, sought review of an order of the Circuit Court for Juneau County (Wisconsin) holding the individual's estate liable for the expenses of his institutionalization. The trial court entered an order for payment that authorized the sale by respondent, the Wisconsin Department of Health and Social Services, of the individual's homestead to satisfy the expenses of hospitalization.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The conservator argued that Wis. Stat. &sect; 46.10(2), which authorized the State to collect the costs of care from persons admitted or committed to state institutions, violated Wis. Const. art. I, &sect; 17, and that the order should be vacated on equitable grounds. The court affirmed the order. It reasoned that there was no conflict with the homestead exemption statute,&nbsp;Wis. Stat. &sect; 815.20(1), because by specifically authorizing sale of a homestead in Wis. Stat. &sect; 46.10(2), the legislature had created an exemption as permitted by the homestead statute. The court held that by allowing a trial court to release all or a part of the homestead to accommodate those in necessitous circumstances, the statute neither abrogated the homestead exemption nor contradicted the underlying purpose of Wis. Const. art. I, &sect; 17. It also held that where the conservator offered no evidence as to the individual's financial status or need, there was no evidence to support the argument that it would be inequitable for the Sate to seize his homestead or to apply the provisions of Wis. Stat. &sect; 46.10(2),(3) that allowed the trial court to release all or part of the individual's property if necessary for his support.</SPAN></P>

The trial court denied defendant's motion to suppress the evidence seized pursuant to the execution of the warrant. Defendant appealed and claimed that the nighttime execution of the search warrant was not valid. The court affirmed and held that the execution of the search warrant was in compliance with statutory and constitutional standards. The court held that the execution of a search warrant in the nighttime was statutorily permitted and did not violate the Fourth Amendment. The court held that the midnight search was reasonable because defendant did not challenge that probable cause existed that contraband was likely to be on the property at the time in question.</SPAN></P>

In challenging the Board decision, the officers raised several issues, including a claim that Rule 4, &sect; 98 was impermissibly vague and that the Board's decision was not reasonable. The court affirmed in part the trial court's order, agreeing that Rule 4, &sect; 98 was not unconstitutionally vague and that the first officer's actions fell within the zone of conduct prohibited by the regulation.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was sentenced as a second offender for an alcohol related driving offense despite being convicted only once of driving while intoxicated. The trial court based the enhanced sentence on the fact that defendant had a previous revocation of his license for failure to take a blood alcohol test on a prior occasion under Wis. Stat. &sect; 343.05. Defendant appealed, claiming that Wis. Stat. &sect; 346.65(2)(b), which provided that a person was a repeat offender and subject to harsher penalties if the total revocations under Wis. Stat. &sect; 343.05 and convictions equaled two in a five year period, was unconstitutional because it denied him equal protection. The court ruled that defendant was not denied equal protection and the sentencing provision in Wis. Stat. &sect; 346.65(2)(b) was not discriminatory where there was a reasonable basis to justify the different legislative treatment. By refusing the blood alcohol test, defendant deprived the State of relevant evidence to which it was legally entitled. Thus, the legislature had a legitimate public purpose in enacting &sect; 346.65(2)(b) to provide incentives for taking the blood alcohol test by punishing those like defendant, who did not take it.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court held that: (1) a vodka bottle found in defendant's car during a search conducted pursuant to a defective search warrant was admissible where it inevitably would have been discovered during an inventory search of the car; (2) because Minnesota law governed the means by which the blood test evidence could be obtained, noncompliance with Wis.

The child's claim was settled and at trial, the jury was presented with the issue parents' derivative damage claims. When the jury returned a verdict for the parents, defendants appealed. The court affirmed, holding that defendants had waived any objection to the verdict reference sheet by failing to make a specific objection as required by Wis. Stat. &sect; 805.13(3). Further, defendants failed to object to the fact that the trial court did not submit written jury instructions. The trial court properly concluded that only the verdict awards concerning medical, therapy, rehabilitation, and skilled care were future medical expenses within the meaning of Wis.

Defendant was still awaiting trial on the June 7, 1982 charge when, on August 22, 1983, a summons and criminal complaint alleging a second OMVWI offense within a five-year period were issued.

The statute manifested the legislature's intent that its sanctions be applied in a manner different from repeater penalties in general. The statute did not require a fine and imprisonment only where a second offense followed a first offense within a five-year period, it required a fine and imprisonment if the number of convictions equaled two in a five-year period regardless of the order in which the offenses were committed. Section 346.65(2)(b) mandated a fine and imprisonment for defendant when he was convicted of the June 7 OMVWI charge.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a decision of the Circuit Court for Columbia County (Wisconsin) convicting him of first-degree sexual assault and denying his postconviction motion. Defendant argued the trial court erred in admitting inculpatory statements he made to police while in custody, in refusing to allow him to inquire into an alleged prior false allegation of sexual assault by the victim, and in excluding evidence that the victim said she had herpes.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant called his attorney after being arrested and was told not to make any statements. Defendant's wife and her friend testified that police told them the investigation was focused on other individuals and defendant would get probation if he cooperated. They also testified police told the wife to convince defendant to talk to them. Police denied these allegations. Defendant made inculpatory statements after talking with his wife. His motion to suppress was denied. He also could not introduce evidence that, while making out at a party, the victim started screaming and acting as though she had been sexually assaulted nor could he introduce alleged statements by the victim that she had herpes. The court reversed and remanded because the trial court did not consider the Lee factors in denying the motion to suppress. The court held there was no abuse of discretion in excluding the alleged prior false allegation of sexual assault because the proffer did not support a conclusion that the victim was alleging that she had been sexually assaulted. The court found the victim's alleged statement regarding herpes was properly excluded as defendant did not know how herpes was transmitted.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant cotenant appealed the judgment of the Circuit Court for Milwaukee County (Wisconsin), which, in plaintiff tenant's discrimination suit against the cotenant under the Wisconsin Open Housing Law, Wis.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The tenant sued the cotenant claiming that the cotenant discriminated against her in violation of the Wisconsin Open Housing Law, Wis. Stat. &sect; 101.22 and federal law. The trial court awarded the tenant compensatory and punitive damages. The cotenant appealed arguing that because the trial court did not find that she segregated, separated, excluded, or treated the tenant unequally because of race, she could not be found in violation of &sect; 101.22(2)(f). The court held that under &sect; 101.22(2)(f), it was unlawful for any person to discriminate by refusing to renew a lease, causing the eviction of a tenant from rental housing or engaging in the harassment of the tenant. Pursuant to &sect; 101.22(1m), &quot;discriminate&quot; and &quot;discrimination&quot; meant to segregate, separate, exclude or treat any person unequally because of race. Therefore, the trial court's finding that the cotenant engaged in racially motivated harassment and intimidation was a finding that the cotenant treated the tenant unequally because of her race. Further, because &sect; 101.22(2) applied to any person, it created no impermissible classification.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee initiated an action for declaratory and injunctive relief alleging that the DOR could not discipline him for smoking at work under administrative directives issued pursuant to the Wisconsin Clear Indoor Act, Wis.

Therefore, pursuant to Wis. Stat. &sect; 227.01(11)(a), the DOR did not have to follow statutory rule-making procedures in issuing the directives. The court reversed the circuit court's judgment enjoining the DOR from enforcing the directives through its internal disciplinary system. The Act did not limit the DOR's authority to issue internal work rules that regulated smoking. The court also rejected the employee's constitutional claims that the Act violated the employee's right to equal protection of the law and interfered with his right to contract.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 351.06.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Subsequent to the effective date of Wis. Stat. &sect; 351.02(1), the motorist accumulated three major violations contemplated under &sect; 351.02(1)(a). Following the 1984 amendment to the statute, he accumulated one additional major violation. Based upon the total of four major violations, the county district attorney petitioned the circuit court to determine that the motorist was a habitual traffic offender and to revoke his license. On appeal, the motorist argued that the original statute required proof of not only the four major violations contemplated under subsection (1)(a) but also the 12 or more convictions contemplated under subsection (1)(b). He also argued that use of the three major violations prior to the amendment of the statute constituted an ex post facto application of the amended statute and was therefore a violation of Wis. Const. art. I, &sect; 12, and U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 10. The court concluded that the 1984 amendment to the statute did not change the computation procedures but was only a clarification of the statute's original language. Therefore, the court concluded that statute was not unconstitutionally applied to the motorist and affirmed the circuit court's order.</SPAN></P>

The trust argued that summary judgment was improper because material facts were in controversy. According to the trust, the fact in dispute was a discrepancy in a valuable consideration. The bank supposedly created the money it loaned. The court held that the source of the money loaned to the trustee was irrelevant to the issue whether the trustee defaulted on the note.

Stat. &sect; 351, Wisconsin's Habitual Traffic Offenders Act. The driver had been convicted of reckless driving and of operating a motor vehicle while intoxicated.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The driver argued that the 14-month delay in commencing the action denied him due process of law. In affirming the judgment, the court found that the driver was not denied due process by the delay and his conduct of his defense was not prejudiced. The State's burden in a habitual traffic offender case was simple. Under Wis. Stat. &sect; 351.06, when the trial court found that appellant was the same person who committed the previous offenses, revocation was automatic. The only defense was that the driver was not the person who accumulated the prior convictions. That defense was not prejudiced by a 14-month delay in prosecution. Additionally, there was no showing that the State intentionally delayed to gain some tactical advantage over the driver. Further, Wis. Stat. &sect; 351.04, did not provide a remedy for district attorneys' lethargy. The only requirement of &sect; 351.04, was that the district attorney file the petition. He did. Though delay could eventually trigger a statute of limitation or deny due process, the latter did not happen and the driver did not assert the former. Section 351.04 did not require a dismissal of the order to show cause.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant store sought review of a judgment of the Circuit Court for Rock County (Wisconsin), which rendered summary judgment for respondent City in an action the City brought against the store for a number of unlicensed closing out sales in violation of City of Janesville ordinance &sect; 5.32, adopting Wis. Stat. &sect; 66.35(1). The City cross-appealed the dismissal of some claims and the amount of the forfeiture on each established claim.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city made 16 claims against a store based on its advertisements. Under Wis. Stat. &sect; 66.35, a store was required to obtain a special license to advertise a &quot;closing out&quot; sale. The city claimed the store did not obtain the required license when so advertising. The trial court found that seven of the claims by the City were unfounded, but rendered summary judgment for the City on the nine remaining claims. The court agreed with the trial court on all but one of the claims. The court held that such phrases as &quot;has to vacate&quot; and &quot;must liquidate&quot; told the reasonable reader that the company was forced to sell, and based on the impression the advertisement would leave with the reader, the company was required to obtain a closing out license. The intent of the owner of the business was not relevant because the statute looked to the advertiser's representation. Wis.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When defendant was asked by police to lower the volume on his radio, he refused, shouted obscenities, and resisted a police officer who tried to take him into custody. He was charged with resisting an officer and disorderly conduct. In the charging section of the complaint, it erroneously cited defendant for resisting the police officer who had accompanied the arresting officer, but the probable cause section correctly identified the arresting officer. The evidence introduced at trial concerned the arresting officer's confrontation with defendant. In initially instructing the jury, the trial court informed them that defendant was charged with resisting the accompanying officer rather than the arresting officer. However, in defining the elements of the resisting charge, the trial court used the correct name. The complaint was amended after the jury returned its verdict. The court affirmed the judgment, holding that defendant was not denied due process. He was not prejudiced by the technically incorrect complaint or by the amendment of the complaint. Furthermore, because any errors at trial were later corrected, he was not prejudiced by those errors.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff landlord appealed a decision of the Circuit Court for Walworth County (Wisconsin), which dismissed the landlord's complaint and entered a judgment in favor of defendants, a city and a utility. The landlord had filed a 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 claim for relief as well as other claims and a motion for default judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landlord brought an action against defendants after his tenant's delinquent electric bill was added to his property tax statement. Despite the fact that defendants were late in serving their answer and were in default, the trial court proceeded on the merits of the complaint. Further, the trial court spoke only to the &sect; 1983 claim for relief and dismissed the whole action, despite the fact that there were other claims. The court affirmed the decision in part, holding that the trial court was correct in dismissing the &sect; 1983 claim without first deciding whether there was excusable neglect for failure to timely serve the answer. Further, a &sect; 1983 claim could only be maintained absent a state remedy, and the landlord's failure to allege the non-existence of such a remedy rendered the complaint insufficient. The defect was fatal to the motion for a default judgment. The court concluded, however, that there was much more to the landlord's complaint than a &sect; 1983 action and held that the trial court erred in dismissing the whole complaint on the same basis as the &sect; 1983 claim. The trial court was to consider the merits of the other issues that were raised.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the dismissal of the &sect; 1983 claim, reversed the dismissal of all the other claims, and remanded to the trial court to decide the other issues on the merits.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 346.48 was unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant passed a school bus that was stopped in an oncoming lane after waiting children had entered the bus but before the driver turned of the flashing lights and retracted the stop sign. Defendant claimed that he had not violated Wis. Stat. &sect;&sect; 346.485, 346.48(1) because the bus was not a school bus. Defendant reasoned that words &quot;school bus&quot; were not painted on the front and back of the bus as provided by Wis. Stat. &sect; 347.44 and it was thus not equipped within the meaning of Wis. Stat. &sect; 347.25(2). On appeal, the court held that the bus was in fact a school bus, reasoning that Wis. Stat. &sect; 347.25(2) required a school bus to be equipped with flashing lights. Because defendant had passed the bus while it was stopped and displaying flashing lights, the court held that defendant violated Wis. Stat. &sect; 346.48(1) regardless of whether the words &quot;school bus&quot; were painted on the front and back of the bus. The court held that the statute was constitutional and that the directed verdict was proper because defendant's claim that the driver should have extinguished the lights after the children boarded was not a cognizable defense to the illegal passing charge.</SPAN></P>

Regardless of whether police had reason to stop defendant pursuant to Wis.

The court held that the test to determine whether a seizure had occurred was objective, so the fact that police had decided to detain defendant was irrelevant, because there was no evidence that defendant knew this. Accordingly defendant abandoned the property before any seizure occurred, and neither U.S. Const. amend. IV nor Wis. Const. art. I, &sect; 11, was implicated.</SPAN></P>

Respondents filed a cross-appeal, alleging infringement of their rights of free expression under Wis. Const. art. I, &sect; 3.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondents distributed letters to the mall merchants soliciting support, after their request to conduct a performance of a dance, which depicted the results of nuclear warfare, was denied. Appellants filed an action seeking damages and injunctive relief. Respondents filed a counterclaim. Several respondents violated a pretrial temporary injunction by leafleting and by performing the dance. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's judgment that permanently enjoined respondents from performing but denied appellants' request for damages. The majority of the court held that the state constitution secured the right to free expression against both private infringements and state action. Appellants' property and free speech interests under the federal constitution were adequately protected by balancing them against respondents' competing expressional interest. Respondents' dance activities were properly enjoined because they had, on balance, interfered with the use of and diminished the value of appellants' property. The trial court did not abuse its discretion by limiting the injunctive relief to the dance activities or by refusing to hold a leafleting participant in contempt.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 940.02(1) as a lesser-included offense of first-degree murder. The key issue was whether defendant's Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination had been violated after sheriff's interrogators failed to honor his Sixth Amendment request for counsel.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The victim was bludgeoned to death with a stick. After the body was found, defendant accompanied officers to town for questioning and admitted that he and another man had been with the victim the night he was killed. During interrogation, he was Mirandized and later asked for an attorney, but none was provided. He said the second man had killed the victim but admitted helping hide the body. His oral and taped statements were admitted at trial. On appeal, the court upheld defendant 's conviction for second-degree murder. The trial court correctly refused to suppress any statements given after defendant requested counsel because he was not in custody, having been told he was free to leave the station at any time. Defendant's statements were voluntary; he was not psychologically &quot;coerced&quot; when officers asked him to &quot;narc&quot; on his accomplice out of deference to the victim's family. Because he was not subjected to custodial interrogation after he invoked his Sixth Amendment right to counsel, his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination was not violated A homicide by reckless conduct instruction was properly refused because the victim's injuries were intentional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant tenants appealed a judgment of the Circuit Court for Milwaukee County (Wisconsin), which evicted them from a mobile home lot owned by plaintiff landlord and awarded the landlord double rental damages pursuant to Wis. Stat. &sect; 704.27. On appeal, the tenants asserted that the double rental damage provision of &sect; 704.27 violated their due process rights and the Equal Protection Clause.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parties' lease, which was a month-to-month tenancy, contained a provision allowing the landlord to terminate the lease if the tenants breached it, but required the tenants have been given five days to remedy the breach. The landlord served the tenants with a 28-day notice terminating the tenancy due to the tenants continuous noise, arguments, profanity, and disorderly conduct. When the tenants refused to vacate, the landlord filed an eviction action and was awarded double rental damages pursuant to &sect; 704.27. On appeal, the tenants asserted that the lease required they have been given five days to cure and that &sect; 704.27 was unconstitutional. The court held that the 28-day notice for termination of month-to-month tenancies in Wis. Stat. &sect; 704.19(3) applied and superseded the 5-day notice provision because the lease provision only applied to terminations based upon a breach. Section 704.27 was constitutional because it did not deny the tenants access to the courts and there was a compelling governmental justification to establish minimum damages for the cost and inconvenience of a landlord's lawsuit and the difficulty of proving loss of rental opportunity.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of a judgment from the Circuit Court for Milwaukee County (Wisconsin), which convicted him of first-degree sexual assault in violation of Wis. Stat. &sect; 940.225(1)(b), second-degree sexual assault in violation of Wis. Stat. &sect; 940.225(2)(a), and armed robbery in violation of Wis. Stat. &sect;&sect; 943.32(1)(b), (2). Defendant also appealed from the trial court's order denying his postconviction motions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with sexually assaulting three victims, who had all identified him as their assailant during pre-trial line-ups. After defense counsel impeached one victim's identification by asking her if she had seen defendant after the lineup but before trial, and she said she had not, the State cross-examined defendant, who admitted that his attorney had advised him not to appear at a preliminary hearing. On appeal, the court held that the State's cross-examining defendant about his waiver of his right to be present at the pretrial hearing did not violate his Sixth Amendment right to be present at trial or his attorney-client privilege. Under Wis. Stat. &sect; 906.11(2), the State was entitled to cross-examine defendant on his waiver of his right to be present at a pretrial hearing, which was not analogous to commenting on defendant's exercise of his right against self-incrimination. The cross-examination was necessary to show that defendant's absence at the pretrial was not caused by the State and to mitigate defendant's attack on the witness's ability to identify defendant. Also, the State did not delve into the details of defendant's conversation with his attorney.</SPAN></P>

Subsequently, the applicant requested a renewal of his alcoholic beverage license from the city. The city council held a hearing, at which the testimony from the criminal proceeding was read. The city refused to renew the applicant's license because he was a habitual law offender under Wis. Stat. &sect; 125.04(5)(b). The applicant petitioned the trial court for a writ of certiorari and contended that the city's action was arbitrary, capricious and discriminatory. He also sought a permanent injunction ordering the city to renew his license. The trial court denied the petition and injunction. The applicant appealed. The court held that nothing in the language of the statute mandated a conclusion that the applicant had to be convicted of a law violation in order to be classified as an habitual offender. The statute prohibited the issuance of an alcoholic beverage license to habitual law offenders and convicted felons. The record contained the applicant's own testimony regarding his habitual violations of the controlled substances law.</SPAN></P>

In 1985 the board petitioned the trial court to extend the commitment for one year; the trial court dismissed the petition on the ground that respondent received no notice of her rights upon return from her conditional transfer under Wis.

Stat. &sect; 756.04(3), and, if so, whether the method was unconstitutional because it compartmentalized prospective jurors into specialized panels, e.g., civil, juvenile, and criminal court and the like for their whole tour of duty.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant argued that the procedure was contrary to the plain meaning of &sect; 756.04(3). On appeal, the court recognized the rule of statutory construction that clear and unambiguous language should be given its ordinary and accepted meaning but pointed out that courts could construe a statute whose meaning was clear if literal application would lead to an absurd or unreasonable result. The court noted that the words &quot;sitting&quot; and &quot;term&quot; were used interchangeably in Wis. Rev. Stat. ch. 97, &sect;&sect; 8, 9 (1949), the former of which was the forerunner of Wis. Stat. &sect; 756.04(3). Thus, the term &quot;sitting of any court&quot; in &sect; 756.04(3) meant the same as &quot;term of any court&quot; and the county's practice of drawing panels four or five times per year conformed, as nearly as possible, with the law. Substantial compliance with the jury selection law was all that was required. The court rejected appellant's argument, for which he offered no legal authority, that selecting panels for various branches of the circuit court was unconstitutional if those branches were confined to specialized areas of the law. The Supreme Court of Wisconsin had rejected a similar argument. Nor had appellant shown prejudice.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The county's termination of parental rights petition alleged that the parents' children were in continuing need of protection or services. At the fact-finding hearing, the trial court permitted the guardian ad litem to question prospective jurors at voir dire, make preemptory strikes, and make an opening statement to the jury. However, the trial court precluded the guardian from making a summation to the jury. In lieu of a closing statement, the trial court permitted the guardian to indicate how she wanted the jury to answer each question of a special verdict. The jury failed to find that the county made a diligent effort to provide required services. The court reversed and remanded and agreed with the guardian that the trial court unduly restricted her participation at the fact-finding hearing. The court noted the limitation of Wis. Stat. &sect; 805.10 to two attorneys per side, but noted that because the county had only one attorney argue to the jury the guardian the trial court erred in not giving the guardian the opportunity to make her summation. The guardian's summation may have persuaded the jury that the county made diligent efforts to provide services.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court affirmed the convictions and concluded that the sales of liquor on three separate occasions gave rise to separate violations of the ordinances because the legality of the land use during each transaction must have been determined separately. The court rejected defendant's claims that &sect; 125.66(1) was unconstitutionally vague and overbroad, and affirmed the convictions under that statute. However, the state conceded that the trial court erred in concluding that the multiple convictions were second or subsequent convictions under the repeat offender provision of &sect; 125.66(1).

The court found that the trial court based its decision to disqualify on the reports of both defense counsel and the district attorney. The court rejected defendant's argument that even if an actual conflict had existed, he should have been permitted to waive the conflict. The court held that defendant had not sufficiently objected to the disqualification. The court found that the record merely indicated a willingness to continue the attorney-client relationship. The court found nothing in the record to indicate that defendant was objecting to the disqualification, that defendant could waive the conflict, that defendant wanted to waive the conflict, or that defendant wanted a waiver proceeding.

The fireman was a lieutenant. He made a vulgar statement in the presence of a woman firefighter indicating that women did not belong in the fire department.

The court held that under the plain meaning of the term he was a supervisor. He had control over the other firefighters within his company. The court held that the directive was neither overbroad nor vague. The fact that the fireman was the only city employee disciplined for violation of the directive did not indicate selective enforcement because it had only been in effect for six months. Abridgement of the fireman's free speech rights was justified because he was in a policymaking position and did not make the comment in private, but in the presence of firefighters under his direct supervision.</SPAN></P>

The corporation claimed that the Commission's interpretation of Wis. Stat. &sect; 71.04(3) (1975), to disallow the deduction was erroneous.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that the conclusions of the Commission were based on extensive findings of fact. The court's independent review of the record confirmed that there was substantial and credible evidence to support the Commission's findings and, therefore, its conclusions of law. In particular, the court concurred with the Commission's conclusion that adoption of the corporation's interpretation would lead to an absurd and unreasonable result. It was uncontroverted that legislators believed they were enacting a revenue-enhancing amendment, yet the corporation acknowledged that its interpretation of the amendment would have entailed a revenue loss to the state of a substantial amount of money. The court was required to look to the common sense meaning of a statute to avoid unreasonable and absurd results. To adopt the corporation's argument the court would have had to adopt a statutory construction in derogation of common sense. The requisite rational basis existed for the Commission's interpretation of the statute, and thus the court rejected the corporation's &quot;plain meaning&quot; argument and affirmed both the Commission and the trial court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant State challenged a judgment of the Circuit Court for Jefferson County (Wisconsin) that dismissed its claims that appellee corporation violated Wis. Admin. Code &sect; 154.11(6) by emitting solvent emission from its plant presses, and that denied injunctive relief against future violations. The corporation cross-appealed challenging the constitutionality of &sect; 154.11(6).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Wis. Admin. Code &sect; 154.11(6) limited the opacity of emission plumes. However, it did not specify if it pertained to particulate matter emissions. The court resolved that ambiguity by considering the position of &sect; 154.11(6) within Wis. Admin. Code &sect; 154.11, and because the entire regulation dealt with particulate matter and how to control its emissions, &sect; 154.11(6) encompassed particulate matter. Next, the only presses that released particulate matter for purposes of &sect; 154.11(6) were &quot;new direct sources&quot; under Wis. Admin. Code &sect; 154.01(137)(b) because at standard conditions the solvent emissions were liquid. Further, because liquids were included in the definition of particulate matter subject to opacity limits on July 1, 1975, only those presses installed after that date were within &sect; 154.01(137)(b). The court overruled the corporation's constitutional challenges to &sect; 154.11(6) because a reasonable relationship existed between opacity limits and air pollution control, and the regulation was not vague. The court affirmed the denial of the State's injunction request because even if the emissions were a public nuisance Wis. Stat. &sect; 144.98 gave the trial court discretion in the matter.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed that part of the judgment that denied the State's request for injunctive relief against the corporation. The court reversed a part of the judgment that held certain of the corporation's presses emitted emissions that violated the State's regulation. The court also denied the corporation's constitutional challenge. Finally, the court remanded for recalculation of the forfeitures imposed in light of its decision.</SPAN></P>

In 1980, the employee suffered another period of disability related to the original injury. The LIRC determined that the employee should be paid at the rate prescribed in Wis. Stat. &sect; 102.43(7)(b), which was enacted after the employee's original injury and was intended to deal with the effects of inflation upon compensation rates. The court rejected the insurer's argument that the statute was not intended to be applied retroactively. The Act was remedial in nature and the statute itself reflected a legislative intent that it be applied retroactively. Even assuming the insurer was correct that retroactive application of &sect; 102.43(7), resulted in an impairment of the insurer's contract obligations, the court concluded that the impairment was not unconstitutional.&nbsp;Wis. Stat. &sect; 102.43(7) has a significant and legitimate public purpose and the statute is reasonable and appropriate, given its purpose. Retroactive application did not deprive the insurer of property without due process of law because the statute used a rational means to achieve a legitimate end.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The brewing company filed suit, seeking refunds of property taxes, against respondents, the State Department of Revenue, the county, and city, seeking a declaration that certain structural components of its beer cellars were &quot;manufacturing machinery&quot; and thus exempt from property taxation under Wis. Stat. &sect; 70.11(27). The trial court found against the company and it appealed, claiming that the trial court erred. The court held that the Department did not have sovereign immunity because the suit was not against the State, but one against the officers of the Department for acting beyond their authority. The court also held that the company had standing to file because it paid the taxes under protest and notice was given in advance. Finally, the court determined that the structural components of the beer cellars were manufacturing machinery and exempt from property taxation under &sect; 70.11(27) because the cellars contained and stabilized the precise environments required for the mass production of beer. The court concluded that the cellar's other uses were merely incidental to that primary and principal function and did not effects its exemption.</SPAN></P>

He also argued that Wis. Stat. &sect; 767.24(1)(b) was unconstitutional. Affirming the judgment, the court concluded that the record did not support the father's contention that the trial court used a gender-based preference. The court held further that the issue of the constitutionality of Wis. Stat. &sect; 767.24(1)(b) was not properly before the court because the attorney general was not given an opportunity to appear before the court and defend the law as constitutionally proper. The court then concluded that the trial court properly relied on the interaction and interrelationship of the children with his parents and other siblings in determining the children's best interests, according to Wis. Stat. &sect; 767.24(2)(b). The court determined that, based on the record, the findings of the trial court could be reasonably construed as a finding that these children, at the present time, had a greater need to be near their mother.</SPAN></P>

The issues included whether the ordinance was unconstitutionally vague and whether the City's motion to vacate the judgment was improperly denied.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The City's ordinance adopted Wis. Admin. Code &sect; Ind. 8, which regulated the use and storage of flammable and combustible liquids. The City did not dispute the property owner's statement in his affidavit filed with respect to the parties' cross-motions for summary judgment that he continued to use the tanks for private purposes. On appeal, as to the denial of its motion to vacate, the City argued that it should have been given an opportunity to brief the constitutional issue upon which the citations were dismissed. But, pointing out that the trial court had the power to sua sponte consider legal issues not raised by the parties, the court held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion. Further, given the nature of the owner's argument, the City should have been aware that he was raising the constitutional issue of vagueness. The court also agreed with the trial court that the terms &quot;out of service&quot; and &quot;abandoned&quot; were indefinite and vague such that an ordinary person would not be made aware that converting the tanks from commercial to private use would constitute taking the tanks &quot;out of service&quot; and, after 90 days, an abandonment of the tanks.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that Wis.

The court held that (1) a person of normal intelligence was able to reason that if he drank a substantial amount of alcohol he would run a serious risk of violating &sect; 346.63(1)(b) and thus, &sect; 346.63(1)(b) was not unconstitutionally vague; (2) the trial court properly excluded the blood alcohol chart because defendant did not provide the jury with sufficient evidence to allow it to use the chart without engaging in speculation; and (3) it was not error for the trial court to give jurors the falsus in uno instruction because it had a reasonable basis to conclude that the jury could find that one of the witnesses was lying.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Circuit Court for Kenosha County (Wisconsin) that convicted him of three counts of kidnapping and three counts of first-degree sexual assault. An issue presented on appeal was whether or not Wis. Stat. &sect; 940.225(1)(c), which made first-degree sexual assault with the aid of one or more persons a crime, was unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Four men, including defendant, abducted and raped three female hitchhikers, aged 16 to 19. On appeal, the court held that a challenge to the constitutionality of a statute on the basis of vagueness went to the subject matter jurisdiction of the trial court and could not be waived. Defendant argued that the words &quot;aided or abetted&quot; in Wis. Stat. &sect; 940.225(1)(c) were so unclear that a reasonable person could not determine whether he was committing first-degree or second-degree sexual assault. The court held that &sect; 940.225(1)(c) was not unconstitutional. Due process did not require a statute to be so definite as to inform a defendant in advance of exactly what the consequences of his act would be, other than to make it patent that his act would be criminal. The legislature intended the phrase &quot;aided or abetted&quot; in Wis. Stat. &sect; 940.225(1)(c) to have the same meaning as the phrase &quot;aids and abets&quot; in Wis. Stat. &sect; 939.05. The trial court did not err by refusing to instruct on the lesser-included offense of second-degree sexual assault because defendant's conduct, at the very least, aided and abetted the other men in sexually attacking the women.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment from the Circuit Court for Grant County (Wisconsin) convicting him of delivering a controlled substance, tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), a violation of Wis. Stat. &sect;&sect; 161.14(4)(t), 161.41(1)(b). An issue presented on appeal was whether or not &sect; 161.14(4)(t) denied defendant equal protection by irrationally classifying THCs, including those in marijuana, as Schedule I controlled substances.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Under the Uniform Controlled Substances Act, Wis. Stat. ch. 161, a drug was classified as Schedule I if it had a high potential for abuse and either no accepted medical use in treatment in the United States or lacked accepted safety for use in treatment under medical supervision. A preliminary issue was whether or not, by pleading guilty, defendant had waived the right to attack &sect; 161.14(4)(t) on equal protection grounds. On appeal, the court ruled that &sect; 161.14(4)(t) was not facially invalid; ergo, the equal protection challenge was nonjurisdictional. Defendant's guilty plea did not waive his right to his appellate equal protection attack on &sect; 161.14(4)(t), even though the statute was facially valid. However, it was rational for the legislature to classify THC as schedule I as long as its acceptance for medical use was an unsettled medical question. Defendant failed to establish an accepted medical use and conceded that debate continued in the scientific community about the effects of marijuana. Regarding sentencing, the court ruled that defendant's refusal to name his supplier was a proper factor to consider.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court found that, on its face, &sect; 971.17(3) did not provide for procedural due process. The same preexisting procedural due process rules that applied to probationers and parolees in revocation proceedings applied to insanity acquittees in recommitment proceedings. The court held that &sect; 971.17(3) was not unconstitutionally vague. Regarding the standard for recommitment under &sect; 971.17(3), which spoke in terms of the safety of defendant or the safety of others, the court held that there was no requirement of a finding of mental illness for recommitment of a conditionally released insanity acquittee. The proper standard for recommitment for those found not guilty by reason of a mental disease or defect was &quot;dangerousness.&quot;</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 60.81.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Wis. Stat. &sect; 60.81 provided a procedure whereby a town adjacent to &quot;a city of the first class&quot; could incorporate as a city if its resident population exceeded 5,000 and its equalized valuation exceeded $ 20,000,000. There was no question that the town met the population and valuation requirements. The question was whether the neighboring city of Madison was a city of the first class. Although Madison met the population requirements for being a first class city, it had not proclaimed itself to be a first class city, and had not made required changes in government. Wis. Stat. &sect; 990.001(15), passed after the town submitted its petition for incorporation, stated that meeting the population requirements for first class city status was not enough without the other required changes being met. The court rejected the town's argument that &sect; 990.001(15) could not be applied retroactively. The statute was procedural in nature. It related solely to Wis. Stat. &sect; 62.05, which specified the procedures by which a city, having reached the required population, may move up the classification ladder; it did not create, abolish, or otherwise regulate the ability of a city to so move.</SPAN></P>

Stat. ch. 351. The order was based on a petition alleging that over two years the driver was convicted of 15 moving violations or traffic regulations in eight states. The State introduced his certified driving record showing 15 convictions. The driver admitted some of the convictions and denied others. He contended that most of the convictions were based on no-contest pleas. The trial court nevertheless found that he was a habitual traffic offender and revoked his driving privileges. On appeal the court affirmed. The court held that there was no right to a jury trial under ch. 351 proceedings and that the certified driving record was a self-authenticating public record, and so was not inadmissible hearsay. The court also noted that the ch. 351 proceeding was not a criminal proceeding and that due process did not require that the state bear the burden of proof. The court held that the driver's due process rights were not violated by imposing on him the burden of disproving facts contained in the certified driving record.</SPAN></P>

The trial court concluded that the Department's ruling operated as an unconstitutional ex post facto law. On appeal, the court reversed, holding that the Department had the authority under Wis. Stat. &sect; 53.11(7)(b) to deny good time credit to the inmate and that the proceedings were not unconstitutional. The court concluded that &sect; 53.11(7)(b) gave the Department the right to deny credit to the inmate, as one who returned to prison as a mandatory release violator. The inmate did not have the right to call witnesses at a good time eligibility hearing. The Department could refuse to allow witnesses if their testimony would be irrelevant or unnecessary.

The town also appealed an order holding that the State of Wisconsin was not a necessary party and that the motion to add the State was frivolous.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The town and the individuals brought suit seeking declaratory relief to prevent the county's use of a site within the town as a sanitary landfill. The town later filed a motion to join the State of Wisconsin as a necessary party. The trial court found that the motion was frivolous, denied the motion, and imposed costs against the town. The trial court later granted the county's motion to dismiss the complaint on the ground that it was not ripe because the town had not exhausted its administrative remedies. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's determination that the town's claims were premature and therefore not ripe for disposition and that part of the trial court's order denying the motion to join the State as a party. The court held that, considering that the entire matter had yet to proceed through administrative channels and therefore could not have been acted upon with any certainty, neither the question of prospective injunctive relief nor that of the propriety of expenditures was properly before the courts. The court reversed that part of the trial court's order granting costs for frivolousness because the costs were not requested by the county in writing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The child was born eight and one half months after the parties separated.

The husband denied both paternity and intercourse. Blood test results favored the husband's paternity. The court held that: (1) the presumption of paternity arising from marriage contained in Wis.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a paternity case, the mother applied for an order requiring the father to pay child support. The court found that application of the one-child percentage to serial children living in separate households could render unreasonable results with a father of five such children required to pay 85 percent of his gross income in support. The court determined that (1) avoidance of financial hardship for the children of divorced or separated parents was the basic purpose of the child support laws; (2) the percentage guidelines established under Wis. Stat. &sect; 767.395(3) were developed by the Department of Health and Social Services on the assumption of intact, not serial, families; (3) in situations of successive children living in separate households a court could not use the guidelines but must hear the evidence and proceed to establish support by applying relevant criteria under Wis.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant stayed at a hotel and at the beginning of his stay, he paid on a daily basis. At a later point, the hotel manager agreed to allow defendant to pay his bill once a week or once every ten days. When he terminated his stay at the hotel he failed to pay the balance due at that time. He did not return to the hotel to collect his property and did not pay the balance due. After several unsuccessful attempts to collect payment, the hotel manager sought criminal prosecution. Initially, he was charged with violating Wis. Stat. &sect; 943.21(1)(b). After the preliminary hearing, however, the district attorney changed the charge to a violation of Wis. Stat. &sect; 943.21(1)(a). Defendant was convicted following a bench trial. The trial court withheld sentence and placed him on probation for two years. Subsequently, defendant's probation was revoked and he was sentenced to two years' imprisonment and ordered to pay a fine. He sought review. On appeal, the court upheld defendant's conviction and sentence. The court ruled that there was sufficient evidence to convict defendant, under Wis. Stat. &sect; 943.21(1)(a), because the hotel did not extend credit to defendant beyond the date of departure.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Circuit Court for Milwaukee County (Wisconsin) that affirmed a judgment of the Municipal Court of the City of Milwaukee that adjudicated him guilty of violating a parking-meter ordinance of the City of Milwaukee, which was Milwaukee, Wis., Code &sect; 101-32(6) (1972). Defendant argued that &sect; 101-32(6) was an unauthorized attempt by the State, via the City, to burden or tax the federal government.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was an army employee, and his argument regarding unauthorized attempt to burden was based on the requirement of &sect; 101-32(6) that he feed a meter for on-the-street parking. Elaborated further, he asserted that where the citation was not issued to a person but was against the license number, were he not to pay the ticket, probably the registration of the vehicle that he drove would have been suspended together with all other vehicles in Wisconsin owned by the army. He argued further, based on Wis. Stat. &sect; 341.04(1), that every person operating an army vehicle after such suspensions were imposed would be subject to a penalty for operating an unregistered vehicle as well as other possible legal penalties. The court was not convinced by this argument. It had not been established that the vehicle at issue was registered in Wisconsin under state law or that it or other vehicles owned by the army were required to be registered. Without such a showing, the court was unable to find a burden or interruption imposed on the federal government by a state government through a local municipality. The court rejected defendant's tax argument regarding &sect; 101-32(6).</SPAN></P>

The trial court affirmed decisions of respondent, the Wisconsin Tax Appeals Commission, which had granted summary judgment to respondent, the Wisconsin Department of Revenue, in the taxpayer's appeals of the Department's denial of his petitions for redetermination.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer filed his petitions for redetermination with the Department after it notified him that it was voiding his withholding exemption certificate and assessing him additional income tax for 1980 and 1981. The taxpayer's petitions raised the issues whether wages were income that the State could tax, whether the income tax unconstitutionally infringed on the fundamental right to work, and whether the State's power to tax could be so exercised as to make it a potential instrument of enslavement. The court held that: (1) pursuant to Wis. Stat. &sect; 71.02(2)(e), Wisconsin based its definition of income subject to taxation on the federal definition; (2) wages were taxable income because 26 U.S.C.S. &sect; 61(a) defined income to include compensation for services, which included wages; (3) both the federal and state constitutions granted Congress and the state legislature the power to tax income; (4) the imposition of a tax on the taxpayer's income was not &quot;enslavement&quot;; and (5) the taxpayer failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the State's tax on wages was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was stopped by a sheriff's deputy for a traffic violation. Defendant's driver's license was under suspension, and he was arrested. The deputy discovered bullets in defendant's pocket during a routine search and found a gun wrapped in a pair of jeans buckled to the saddlebag of defendant's motorcycle. Defendant was convicted for carrying a concealed weapon in violation of Wis. Stat. &sect; 941.23. Defendant appealed and contended that the trial court erred in refusing to admit his telephone conversations with unnamed employees of law enforcement agencies who told him that transporting a gun the way he did was legal. The calls were made after his arrest. The court affirmed. There was no indication in the record that the persons defendant talked to were authorized or required to give such legal advice. The court rejected the argument of mistake of law or fact under Wis. Stat. &sect; 939.43(1) because the only element of intent under Wis. Stat. &sect; 941.23 was that defendant had to be aware of the gun's existence. The court found the statute constitutional and that the weapon was within his immediate reach. There was no evidence that the gun was encased in the manner required by law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In consolidated appeals, defendant motorist disputed convictions in the Circuit Court for Winnebago County (Wisconsin) for operating a motor vehicle without a valid driver's license, Wis. Stat. &sect; 343.05(1), and operating an unregistered vehicle, Wis. Stat. &sect; 341.04(1).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The motorist received copies of the uniform traffic citations for each violation. On appeal, the court held that the circuit court had subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to Wis. Stat. &sect; 345.30 and the filing of the citations with the circuit court was sufficient to confer personal jurisdiction. The use of a citation did not violate the separation of powers doctrine. Wis. Stat. &sect; 345.11(1), (5) were presumed constitutional and the officer issuing a uniform traffic citation fulfilled only the law enforcement obligations of the executive branch. The requirement of a neutral and detached magistrate was limited to civil and criminal cases involving the issuance of search or arrest warrants. Defendant was not entitled to be represented by someone not licensed to practice law in Wisconsin. Also, because the charges were prosecuted as civil forfeiture actions, the right to counsel under U.S. Const. amend. VI had not attached. Because defendant's jury trial demand was not accompanied by the required fee, he had waived his right to a jury trial. The requirements of a driver's license and the registration of a vehicle were reasonable exercises of the State's police power.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An officer stopped defendant and noted the smell of intoxicants. Defendant was cited for driving while intoxicated after submitting to a breathalyzer test. Defendant entered a not guilty plea and filed a motion for suppression of the test results, claiming that the test was the result of physical force and coercion. The circuit court granted the motion and denied the State's motion to reconsider that was based on its failure to appear at the suppression hearing. The circuit court denied the State's motion and the State appealed. The court reversed the circuit court's decision. The court found that because probable cause to arrest was not disputed, the request that defendant submit to the chemical test, pursuant to Wis. Stat. &sect; 343.305(2)(b), was proper. Further, the officer was justified in promptly seeking to subject defendant to a chemical test of his blood, because an exigent situation, the body's rapidly metabolizing alcohol, existed. The officer was warranted in telling defendant that if he didn't consent to the breathalyzer test, he would be taken for blood to be drawn, as there was no proof that anything other than a proper blood test was suggested to defendant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner taxpayers, mostly telephone companies, appealed the decision from the Circuit Court for Dane County (Wisconsin), which entered summary judgment in favor of respondents, the Wisconsin Department of Revenue and the departmental secretary, in the taxpayers' suit challenging a sales tax under Wis. Stat. &sect; 77.52(2)(a)4 as an unconstitutional burden on interstate commerce.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The tax was imposed on telephone calls originating in Wisconsin and billed in the State. The taxpayers contended that there was insufficient evidence that the calls had a sufficient nexus with Wisconsin, that the tax created multiple taxation, that it discriminated against interstate commerce, and that the tax was not fairly related to services provided by the State. The court affirmed the judgment. The court began with the rule that taxing statutes were presumed constitutional. The tax was not a midstream tax that lacked a sufficient nexus to Wisconsin. Rather, it taxed calls at the point of origin. The fact that the tax was unapportioned did not render it unconstitutional. The fact that there was a potential for multiple taxation did not establish in fact that it was multiple. The existence of a gross receipts tax along with the sales tax did not create multiple taxation. Because the tax equally taxed both interstate and intrastate calls, the tax did not discriminate against interstate commerce. The taxpayers, as Wisconsin residents, received the benefits of the tax, particularly police and fire protection. A use tax was also constitutional under the same rules.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff patient filed a submission of controversy with the patients compensation panel, alleging that defendants, doctors and a hospital, negligently rendered medical services to her. After the panel dismissed her action for failure to comply with discovery rules, the patient filed a negligence action in the Circuit Court for Milwaukee County (Wisconsin). She appealed from the trial court's judgment of dismissal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants first sought dismissal by the panel when the patient failed to answer their interrogatories or to provide medical releases. The panel ordered her to comply with such requests or face dismissal. She complied but then ignored their later requests that she submit to a deposition. The panel cited the patient's uncooperative conduct in granting defendants' motion to dismiss her cause of action. When the patient filed her action in the trial court, defendants moved for dismissal again. The court upheld the judgment below. Pursuant to Wis. Stat. &sect; 655.04(1)(b), a medical malpractice claim could not be commenced in a circuit court unless it had been heard on the merits and findings and an order had been made by the panel. As to the patient's contention that the panels' order of dismissal was an order within the meaning of &sect; 655.04(1)(b), the court explained that the patient was not entitled to pursue a claim in a circuit court if the dismissal order was intended as a sanction for failure to comply with discovery rules. The panel's order was clearly intended as such. Finally, the court noted that Wis. Stat. &sect; 655 had been previously upheld as a constitutional provision.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 102.61.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee's award included eligibility for additional benefits and travel compensation, subject to continued progress and periodic review. The employer objected to the rehabilitation award and to the procedure followed by the Department of Industry, Labor, and Human Relations (DILHR). The court affirmed the award. The employee was not required to submit to an additional medical examination because the examination permitted to the employer by Wis. Stat. &sect; 102.13(1) had taken place. DILHR did not abuse its discretion in denying a continuance because the need arose from the employer's lack of preparation. DILHR was presumed to be impartial and there was no probability of prejudice from an ex parte communication. The employer was not denied a meaningful opportunity to be heard on the eligibility issue and there was no misrepresentation of facts in the eligibility determination. Amendments in the federal Vocational Rehabilitation Act (Act) were incorporated into Wis. Stat. &sect; 102.61 and the reference to the Act in &sect; 102.61 did not unconstitutionally delegate legislative authority. Wis. Admin. Code &sect; 80.49(3) did not apply because the record was compiled before its effective date.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff baseball club brought a declaratory relief and injunctive action against defendants, a corporation and related individuals and alleged that Wis. Stat. &sect; 46.05(10)(a), which designated a proposed prison site was unconstitutional. The Circuit Court for Dane County (Wisconsin) ruled that &sect; 46.05(10)(a) was constitutional and entered judgment in favor of defendants.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The proposed prison was to be built near the site where the baseball club played their professional baseball games. The baseball club claimed that the statute designating the proposed prison site, &sect; 46.05(10)(a), was enacted in violation of Wis. Const. art. IV, &sect; 18. The circuit court held that Wis. Stat. &sect; 46.05(10)(a) was neither private nor local and therefore was not subject to Wis. Const. art. IV, &sect; 18. On appeal, the court reversed, holding that &sect; 46.05(10)(a) was a local bill and that its enactment violated Wis. Const. art. IV, &sect; 18. Accordingly, the court declared &sect; 46.05(10)(a)&nbsp;unconstitutional. Under Wis. Const. art. IV, &sect; 18 no private or local bill passed by the legislature could embrace more than one subject, which had to be expressed in the title. Wis. Stat. &sect; 46.05(10)(a) originated as part of a budget bill. The budget bill embraced many subjects, and its title gave no indication that it contained legislation that would designate the proposed prison site. Thus, &sect; 46.05(10)(a) was enacted in violation of Wis. Const. art. IV, &sect; 18.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant employer sought review of a decision of the Circuit Court for Dane County (Wisconsin), which confirmed an order of respondent, the Wisconsin Labor and Industry Review Commission (LIRC), entered without a hearing, that an employee had sustained an injury arising out of his employment while performing service growing out of and incidental to that employment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee was injured at work. He sought compensation and, at a prehearing, the examiner discussed the necessity for filing an answer. The employer gave no reason for not filing an answer and the examiner ruled in favor of the employee without notice. The LIRC affirmed and the employer sought review, alleging that Wis. Stat. &sect; 102.18(1)(a) did not confer authority on the LIRC to order payment without a hearing. This argument was premised on the assertion that &sect; 102.18(1)(a) was ambiguous. The court affirmed. The court held that the employer's argument that &sect; 102.18(1)(a) was ambiguous was without merit as it did not limit the making of findings to instances in which a hearing had been held. Because the examiner had examined the relevant facts of record, applied a proper legal standard and, using a rational process, reached a conclusion that a reasonable factfinder could have reached, he did not abuse his discretion. The employer's argument that entry of the order without notice violated its due process rights was without merit because the warning that a default could issues, coupled with the discretion of Wis. Admin. Code &sect; Ind. 80.05(2), provided adequate notice.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The child was the illegitimate son of the father. Settlement of a paternity action was by an agreement approved by the Michigan circuit court in which the father was to pay medical expenses for the mother and a lump sum payment on the child's 18th birthday. The mother, via a guardian ad litem petitioned for support for the child. The father was unable to convince the trial court to honor the Michigan agreement. The father stipulated to a finding of paternity, and the trial court ordered monthly support payments. The court affirmed the order of the trial court. The court concluded that the Michigan statute was unconstitutional because it disadvantaged illegitimate children. The classification failed to bear an evident and substantial relation to a state interest. It invidiously discriminated against illegitimate children by denying them substantial benefits accorded children generally. Because the Michigan judgment and the statute on which it was based violated the equal protection clause of the federal constitution, the Michigan judgment was not entitled to full faith and credit.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was pulled over in his vehicle for having expired registration plates.

The court held that &sect; 941.23 did not violate the defendant's constitutional right to keep and bear arms under the Second Amendment to the United States Constitution. The court also held that while &sect; 941.23 may have, when it was originally enacted, reflected the intent of the legislators of that era to require proof of intent to cause harm, that version of the statute was no longer binding on the court. Finding that defendant was found carrying a concealed weapon within the State of Wisconsin, the court held that he was therefore subject to prosecution and punishment under the criminal law of Wisconsin in the trial court.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The selling corporation operated a dry cleaning business in Milwaukee. In 1982, the corporation installed machines that would reduce its air pollution emissions. It applied for and received emission reduction credits. It sold some of these credits to the buying corporation. In 1983, the DNR told appellants that it intended to adopt &quot;reasonably available control technology III&quot; (RACT III) rules. Under these rules, the DNR said, any unused credits would be reduced because the RACT III rules required emission controls similar to those voluntarily adopted by the selling corporation. Thus, the DNR said, the emission reductions for which credits were awarded did not constitute a surplus under the RACT III rules. Appellants sought judicial review and the trial court affirmed. Appellants again sought review and the court affirmed. The court held that the DNR's decision to reduce the credits was not inconsistent with anything it told either of appellants and did not violate a rule or established agency policy or practice. The court also held that the DNR's decision was neither arbitrary nor capricious or inconsistent with the federal Environmental Protection Agency's credit-trading policy.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a judgment and an order of the Circuit Court for Rock County (Wisconsin), which convicted him of disorderly conduct contrary to Wis. Stat. &sect; 947.01, and that denied his motion for postconviction relief.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The complaint stated that defendant harassed two young girls. He pleaded no contest to disorderly conduct under Wis. Stat. &sect; 947.01. Defendant contended that his no contest plea was taken by a court commissioner at his initial appearance, that the commissioner did not have the authority to accept the plea, and, therefore, that the plea was void. The court commissioner informed defendant of the charge against him at his initial appearance and ascertained, pursuant to Wis. Stat. &sect; 757.69(1)(a), that defendant made an intelligent waiver of his rights and that he understood the consequences of his decision. The commissioner then directed the case to the trial judge who adjudged defendant guilty. The court concluded that the commissioner merely informed defendant of his rights; the trial court actually accepted defendant's plea. While defendant's comments to the girls asking them if they used drugs, drank alcohol, and would go out with him did not constitute a crime, the statements carried sexual overtones and his repeated approaches, given the girls' ages, were sufficient to offend the senses and sensibilities of the average person.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Seeking to operate a second boat that would transport vacationers to an island during the summer tourist season, the carrier applied for a certificate of convenience under Wis. Stat. &sect; 195.45. The Commission found that the island community depended on the carrier's competitor for transportation services in the winter and that the competitor could provide essential year-round ferry service only if its summer profits subsidized its winter losses. On appeal, the court held that there was substantial evidence supporting the Commission's conclusion that the carrier failed to establish that its proposed service was in the public interest. Wis. Stat. &sect; 195.45 did not violate the forever free clause of Wis. Const. art. IX, &sect; 1, because the application process was a reasonable means to accomplishing the legitimate goal of ensuring that common water carriers acted in the public interest. The court concluded that Wis. Stat. &sect; 195.45's delegation of legislative power to the Commission was constitutional because the review proceedings set forth in Wis. Stat. ch. 227 provided procedural safeguards to ensure that the Commission acted to serve the public interest.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the creation of dead-end streets was not contrary to the motor vehicle code because it was not addressed in it. The court found that the dead-ends did not interfere with the free use of the streets, which was prohibited by Wis. Stat. &sect; 349.03(2). The court found that Wis.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Police seized 132 well-tended marijuana plants from a padlocked basement room in defendant's home. Defendant claimed that his farmhand rented the room but admitted to owning milk cans used as potting containers and heat lamps found in the room.

Possession of a controlled substance with intent to manufacture and possession with intent to deliver were distinct crimes; intent to deliver was not an element of the crime of possession of marijuana with intent to manufacture. The distinction between possession of marijuana, &sect; 161.41(3), and possession with intent to manufacture, &sect; 161.41(1m), was not unconstitutionally vague.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the commission rescinded its previous order directing a divided crossing at the intersection of a state highway and railroad tracks and ordered, instead, an at-grade crossing, the village and the railroad commenced separate review proceedings. The trial court reversed the commission's order. On appeal, the court reversed the trial court and reinstated the commission's order. The court held that res judicata did not prohibit the commission from rescinding the previous order because res judicata was inapplicable to commission orders. Moreover, permitting rescission did not interfere with judicial authority because persons adversely affected by the rescission of a previous order were entitled to judicial review. The court also held that the trial court lacked jurisdiction to decide whether the commission properly granted a rehearing.The court further held that a substantial change of circumstances was not necessary to justify rescission in a reopened proceeding. The commission's decision was supported by substantial evidence.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was arrested and filed a motion seeking to reduce the felony charge to a misdemeanor charge. The trial court granted the motion and dismissed the felony charge, holding that the felony abandonment statute was a violation of equal protection as applied to defendant. The State sought review. On appeal, the court upheld the order. A conviction under the felony abandonment statute violated the equal protection provisions of Wis. Const. art. I, &sect; 1, and the Fourteenth Amendment. The court ruled that the elements needed to support the charge were identical to those constituting the offense of failure to support under Wis. Stat. &sect; 52.055(1) and that there was no rational basis for the classification of those elements as a felony under Wis. Stat. &sect; 52.05(1).

Stat. &sect; 72.01(5) (1969) was unconstitutional and that a power of appointment possessed by the testator's daughter was not includable in her taxable estate.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The testator executed a trust agreement wherein he granted his daughter a power of appointment over certain trust assets. The daughter died without exercising the power of appointment either by will or any other written instrument during her lifetime. After the daughter's death, the State sought to apply Wis. Stat. &sect; 72.01(5) (1969) to the power of appointment that the daughter held at the time of her death. The trial court found that the statute was unconstitutional because the daughter was not provided with the same protection or opportunity possessed by donees of powers created before October 21, 1942. The language of the statute allowed certain exemptions for powers created before October 21, 1942 and after July 22, 1951, but not for the years in between. On appeal, the court affirmed, finding that application of the statute to the facts presented would violate the estate's right to equal protection. The court emphasized that its ruling was limited solely to that part of the statute that created an inability to utilize the procedural exception for modification to a tax-exempt class; the substantive portion of the statute creating the tax-exempt class remained valid.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 941.30. An issue on appeal was whether or not he should have been given credit by the trial court for time that he had spent in the county jail of LaFayette County, Wisconsin, on an unrelated matter.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Regarding endangering safety and resisting, defendant was released on bail from the jail of Rock County. Later, he was jailed in LaFayette County, during which time a detainer was filed for Rock County, and, when his probation was revoked on the endangering safety conviction, he sought to have credit on the sentencing for that charge credited with time served in Lafayette County. Wis. Stat. &sect; 973.155(1)(a) gave credit toward the service of a sentence for all days spent in custody in connection with the course of conduct for which sentence was imposed. The court rejected the argument that, because a detainer had been filed for Rock County while he was in the jail of LaFayette County, defendant was entitled to sentencing credit for his time in the jail in LaFayette County. Where a county filed a detainer in another county in which a defendant was confined, that defendant was not in custody in connection with the course of conduct for which sentence was imposed in the demanding county until his custody was surrendered to that county. The court rejected the argument that Wis. Stat. &sect; 53.12(1) violated the equal protection of the laws.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Before their marriage, the husband and the wife entered into an agreement providing the wife with certain personal property in lieu of alimony in the event of a divorce. The trial court found at the time of the parties' marriage, the husband had a net worth of $ 340,000, while the wife had a car, some furniture and her clothing. At the time of the divorce approximately eight years later, the husband's net worth had increased almost ten-fold. Notwithstanding the increase in wealth, the trial court held Wis. Stat. &sect; 767.255(11) applied to the parties' prenuptial agreement and the circumstances of its signing were equitable. Accordingly, the trial court ordered the distribution of the parties' property in accordance with the agreement. On appeal, the wife challenged the conclusion that &sect; 767.255(11) validated the prenuptial agreement entered before &sect; 767.255(11) was effective. She also argued the agreement was inequitable if it was enforceable. The court affirmed the division of marital property because the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it pronounced the prenuptial agreement between the husband and the wife to be equitable as to her.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 346.63(1)(a) and (b).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was pulled over for speeding. The officer asked defendant to submit to a preliminary breath screening test (PBT). The result indicated that defendant had a .10 percent BAC. A breathalyzer test was administered that showed defendant had a .12 percent BAC. Defendant was precluded from asking the officer at trial about the PBT. The court rejected defendant's contention that Wis. Stat. &sect; 343.303 was unconstitutional. The State's interest in protecting its citizens provided a reasonable basis for allowing a police officer to administer a PBT. Defendant's due process rights were not violated when he was precluded from asking about the PBT test at trial. The legislature determined that PBT tests were reliable enough to allow an officer to determine whether to arrest defendant, but not reliable enough to allow admission of the test at trial. The tests were therefore not relevant. Defendant was not prevented from pursuing his chosen line of defense. The exclusion of the PBT test did not render an unfair advantage to the state because the evidence was not admissible by either party at trial. There was no Brady violation because the state did not withhold the evidence.</SPAN></P>

Appellant contended, among other things, that simultaneously charging her with violations of Wis.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant allegedly caused the death of another person by driving while intoxicated.

The court found that, because there could be only one conviction under &sect;&sect; 940.09(a) and (b), charging under both paragraphs did not place appellant in double jeopardy. Appellant contended that the amended &sect; 940.09 was an attempt by the Legislature to permit the State to convict an individual for homicide by driving while intoxicated without having to prove a key element of the crime: that the individual was intoxicated. She contended that &sect; 940.09(1)(b) had the effect of creating a conclusive presumption that someone with a blood alcohol content (BAC) of 0.1 percent or more was under the influence of an intoxicant, and that this was a violation of due process. The court disagreed. In a prosecution under &sect; 940.09(1)(b), whether defendant was under the influence of an intoxicant was irrelevant because &sect; 940.09(1)(b) created a separate offense, that of causing a death by operating a vehicle while having a BAC of 0.1 percent or more.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the trial court properly reconsidered its original suppression order of the knife. The court ruled that the ownership factor was outweighed by defendant's absence from the property for months, its occupation of tenants, and the fact that the searched area was a septic tank located in the backyard. Thus, defendant had no reasonable expectation of privacy in the contents of the septic tank and the consent of the tenants validated the search. The court determined that defendant had no reasonable expectation of privacy in the loan documents admitted into evidence. The fact that defendant repeatedly forged her husband's name to obtain loans had some probative value as to her motive, but did not demonstrate conduct that the court could reasonably conclude would have inflamed the jury to convict on a first degree murder charge. Thus, the evidence was properly admitted. The court held that based on the State's evidence, the jury disbelieved defendant's version of the events on the day in question. And the jury could have inferred that defendant failed to provide her husband with any assistance.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Circuit Court for Racine County (Wisconsin) entered judgment in favor of plaintiffs, the administrators of two estates and other victims, against defendant drivers in an action arising out of an automobile accident. Plaintiffs appealed a judgment in favor of defendant passenger and defendants cross-appealed the finding that the vicarious liability statute for sponsors of minor drivers, Wis. Stat. &sect; 343.15(2), was constitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Several plaintiffs were injured and the decedents were killed when their van was struck by the drivers while the drivers were illegally racing. Plaintiffs argued that the passenger should have been jointly liable for their injuries. The parents of one driver also argued that they should not have been found vicariously liable for the driver, who was a minor. The court affirmed the judgment for plaintiffs. The trial court properly denied plaintiffs' motion for a new trial on the ground of newly discovered evidence. The statement was not independently probative but was corroborative of testimony already in the record and would not result in a different verdict. The court held that the passenger was not required to share responsibility for the injuries because his acquiescence did not make him a participant in the race. The court rejected the parents' argument that the vicarious liability statute was unconstitutional. There was a rational connection between imposing liability on parents and the conduct upon which the liability was predicated because juveniles did not possess mental discretion to the same degree as an adult and lacked the finances to cover any damage they might cause.</SPAN></P>

The court concluded that the petitions established prosecutive merit because the other individual's statement and confession showed a conspiracy to commit armed robberies and an act to effect its object. The court determined that appellant had not set forth a basis for attacking the reliability of the other individual's confession. The court decided that appellant did not meet his burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that &sect; 939.31 was unconstitutional.

The Circuit Court for Winnebago County (Wisconsin) dismissed plaintiff's complaint, which alleged negligence and a strict liability theory premised on the claimed unconstitutional entry into his house.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court jury found that plaintiff was more causally negligent than defendants and dismissed his complaint. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that plaintiff had expressly disavowed any civil rights or constitutional cause of action and that the trial court properly refused to instruct the jury on those matters. The court found that a statement by plaintiff's attorney that plaintiff's strict liability claim did not involve a violation of civil rights or federal law constituted an abandonment of any civil rights claim at trial. The court determined that the trial court properly refused to instruct on strict liability theory because plaintiff had conceded at trial that no case law supported his position that strict liability should have flowed from an unconstitutional entry. The court concluded that the only theory of recovery which was pleaded and put to the jury was whether defendants were negligent. The court found that the evidence supported the jury verdict on that question and that no new trial was warranted.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 341.63(3) by the Circuit Court for Dane County (Wisconsin) for failure to return his vehicle license plates to the Wisconsin Department of Transportation. The appeal challenged the constitutionality of the registration suspension procedure, Wis. Stat. &sect; 345.28.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Wis. Stat. &sect; 345.28 provided for the suspension of a vehicle's registration if, after two notices were sent to the owner's last known address, a nonmoving traffic violation remained unpaid, or the owner did not appear in court. Defendant received a parking ticket and two notices that, in order to avoid further action, he was required to pay or contest the citation. When defendant did not pay the fine or contest the ticket, his vehicle registration was suspended. He was then convicted of failing to return his license plates. On appeal, the court found that defendant had an opportunity for a fair hearing and was repeatedly notified of this fact so that he was not denied due process. The statute did not deny defendant substantive due process because the right to have one's vehicle registered was not a fundamental constitutional right and the statute was rationally related to the state's legitimate objective of controlling and sanctioning parking law violators. Finally, the statute did not violate the equal protection of the laws guaranteed by U.S. Const. amend. XIV, Wis. Const. art. 1, &sect; 1 simply because other municipalities used a different procedure.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee was terminated from his job as a policeman for conduct unbecoming an officer. He contended that the rules were unconstitutionally vague and overbroad.

After the trial court quashed his petition for a writ of certiorari, the employee sought review. The court determined that the rule prohibited continuous association with certain persons. The rule was not vague because both actual and constructive knowledge of a person's criminal behavior triggered the rule's prohibition. Moreover, the rule was not overbroad because it contained detailed exceptions for relationships that existed in the performance of official duties or associations that were unavoidable. The court determined that the employee was allowed to confront and cross-examine witnesses. In addition, the hearing was held before an impartial and detached decisionmaker. However, the court held that the employee's due process rights were violated because one of the charges was devoid of necessary facts to apprise the employee of his alleged violation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was required to file the returns because he was under 65 and received more than $ 5,200 income in each of the three years. He was prohibited under the motion in limine from addressing in any way the substantive merits of his belief that the State had no authority to tax him pursuant to federal law. Defendant argued that he was denied a fair trial because he was precluded from presenting a &quot;good faith&quot; defense. The court disagreed. Under Wis. Stat. &sect; 939.43(1), reliance on a mistaken view of the criminal law was no defense unless it negated the existence of the state of mind essential to the crime. The &quot;willfulness&quot; instruction was proper, and no showing of bad purpose of evil motive was required. Defendant waived his right to counsel and could not complain that his own representation was ineffective. The court noted that U. S. Const. art.

Under 12 U.S.C.S. &sect; 411 (1982), federal reserve notes were redeemable in lawful money and were taxable dollars. Defendant received federal reserve notes measured in dollars in excess of $ 5,200.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A battery was stolen from a parked car. Defendant experienced battery problems on the same night and in the same area. Defendant had a working battery within hours after his car broke down and he bragged about how easy it was to steal a battery. Two witnesses testified that defendant made admissions of guilt. One of the admissions specifically linked the stolen battery to the area where the crime took place. Defendant argued that the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction. He also argued that the trial court committed plain error when it gave a jury instruction that characterized a car battery as movable property without an affirmative showing by the State that the battery was movable property. The court held that: (1) the circumstantial evidence and testimony regarding two admissions of guilt by defendant were sufficient to support his conviction; (2) the trial court's jury instruction did not create a conclusive presumption regarding an element of the charged offense because the jury was still required to find that defendant took and carried away the property; and (3) the act of taking and carrying away an object necessarily implied that it was movable.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A fire started during a timber harvest on defendants' property. The blaze spread to the assured's property and damaged it. Plaintiffs sued in tort. After they lost at trial, plaintiffs appealed, asserting myriad errors. Defendants prevailed. Plaintiffs were not entitled to a negligence per se instruction under Wis. Stat. &sect; 26.12(6)(b) (repealed 1984) because its requirements on timber harvest remnants were not intended to apply in cases where parties other than a state or municipality sought recovery. Instead, the controlling statute was Wis. Stat. &sect; 26.21, and plaintiffs were not entitled to a jury instruction thereunder. Under Wis. R. Civ. P., Wis. Stat. &sect; 805.12(1), the trial court's instruction on one defendant's duty as a landowner was proper because it was correct and fully and fairly instructed as to its application regarding the facts. No instruction on principal contractor liability was in order because the timber harvest remnants were not a peculiar unreasonable risk of harm to others. Under Wis. R. Civ. P., Wis. Stat. &sect; 805.08(3), the trial court properly limited plaintiffs' number of peremptory strikes, and the statute survived attack on equal protection grounds.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The lower court entered judgment against the corporation and imposed forfeitures for eight violations of Wis. Admin. Code ch. Ag. 124, that regulated price comparison advertising. The corporation affirmed the summary judgment because the corporation was guilty of improper price comparisons. The court reversed and remanded for further consideration of the number of violations the corporation committed because each publication of an advertisement had to comply with Wis. Admin. Code ch. Ag. 124. The court found that a violation occurred each time an improper advertisement was published and that each newspaper edition constituted a separate publication. The court found that treating each publication as a separate violation was not a denial of due process because the audience size exposed was not intended to define a violation. The court found no discriminatory classification existed because advertisers in small newspapers were not treated differently from advertisers in large newspapers. The court found Wis. Admin. Code ch. Ag. 124 was not unconstitutionally vague because it clearly defined the conduct prohibited and the trier of fact did not have to apply its own standards of guilt.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee contended that there were insufficient facts to warrant a finding that his knee injury was not compensable and that the hearing board system under the city charter ordinance violated the separation of powers doctrine, making it unconstitutional. The employee filed a petition for a writ of certiorari. On appeal, the court held that his challenge to the constitutionality of the ordinance was required to be accompanied by service of the papers on the attorney general under Wis. Stat. &sect; 806.04(11) and that the his claim was one for declaratory relief, requiring service on the attorney general. The court then considered the merits of his claim, noting that certiorari review under Wis. Stat. &sect; 68.13 was limited to whether the board had acted according arbitrarily, oppressively, or unreasonably and whether the evidence supported the decision. The court held that, because the trial court found that the physician who testified that the employee's condition was the result of degenerative osteoarthritis in the knee was more credible than those who testified to the employee's injury, the decision was supported by substantial evidence.</SPAN></P>

The board contended that the trial court exceeded its authority under Wis.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The police officer responded to a complaint and, during a subsequent investigation, found marijuana cigarettes and a small bag of marijuana. Neither the cigarettes nor the bag was safeguarded as evidence. The chief of police imposed a 5-day suspension on the officer for violation of police department rules, regarding the preservation of evidence. The officer requested a hearing before the board, and the chief filed formal charges under Wis. Stat. &sect; 62.13(5)(b). The board found that the charges were sustained and imposed a 10-day suspension. The officer appealed under &sect; 62.13(5) (i) and the trial court set aside the order of the board, concluding that it did not have the authority to increase the penalty originally imposed by the police chief. The board appealed and argued that the trial court exceeded its authority under &sect; 62.13(5)(i) when it reviewed the jurisdictional issue of whether the board could impose a greater sanction. The court reversed and held that the trial court's review was limited to a determination of whether the order of the board was reasonable.

The trooper smelled a strong odor of intoxicants on defendant, noticed his manner of speech and movement, and arrested defendant for operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol. After being taken to the sheriff's department, defendant performed poorly in the field sobriety tests, and registered a .15 percent blood-alcohol concentration in a breathalyzer test. The trial court denied defendant's motion to dismiss on the ground that he lacked notice or knowledge that his conduct fell within the scope of &sect; 346.63(1)(b), and denied defendant's request to admit the department of transportation's blood-alcohol concentration computation wheel into evidence. Defendant was convicted and the court affirmed. The court rejected defendant's assertion of error in the admission of his breathalyzer tests into evidence and held that they emanated from an agency charged with maintaining the records, and were certified and therefore self-authenticated. The court held that the wheel was properly excluded because defendant's intent was not relevant to the charged offense.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed. Specifically, the court held that because the deputy did not raise his argument that a pre-termination hearing was required by statute, it would not consider the issue on appeal. Furthermore, the court found that where the deputy contested the constitutionality of Wis. Stat. &sect; 63.01, but he failed to make service, as required by Wis. Stat. &sect; 806.04(11), the trial court could not have considered the issue and, therefore, the court could not consider the issue on appeal.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A paternity action was commenced by the State. The father appeared before the court commissioner below and denied paternity. The commissioner ordered a blood test.

When the same thing occurred at a subsequent hearing, the commissioner issued a capias for the mother and order for the arrest of the father, pursuant to Wis. Stat. &sect; 767.465(2). The father moved to stay the order because the State had not posted the bond arguably prescribed by Wis. Stat. &sect; 818.05, the statute setting forth the bond requirement for arrests in civil actions. The commissioner held that &sect; 818.05 did not apply to paternity actions, and the father filed an emergency motion to quash the arrest warrant. The circuit court ruled that no order for arrest could issue before the State posted the bond. The State appealed and the court reversed. The court found that &sect; 818.05 did not apply to actions in which the State was the petitioner, or to an order for arrest in a paternity action, pursuant to 1983 Wis.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff employee filed a tort action seeking damages for the bad faith termination of his worker's compensation benefits by defendant insurance company. The Circuit Court for Milwaukee County (Wisconsin) granted the insurance company's motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction because the Worker's Compensation Act, Wis. Stat. &sect; 102.18(1)(bp) was the employee's exclusive remedy, and the employee appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee was injured in the course of his employment on August 3, 1981. His employer's insurance company began paying him temporary total disability benefits, but starting in June, 1982, the insurance company, allegedly in bad faith, unreasonably suspended and terminated his benefits and refused to pay all the benefits subsequently awarded by the Department of Industry, Labor, and Human Relations. The main dispute on appeal was which date the employee was injured. Wis. Stat. &sect; 102.18(1)(bp) provided the exclusive remedy for bad faith claims, but a judicial holding that bad faith constituted a separate injury remained in force. The law in effect at the time of the injuries determined the employee's right to compensation for any alleged bad faith denial of benefits. The bad faith injuries began to occur in June, 1982 and &sect; 102.18(1)(bp), which was effective at that time, was the employee's sole remedy. Because he had no vested right in his cause of action for bad faith termination prior to June, 1982, and because &sect; 102.18(1)(bp) was applied prospectively, not retroactively, the court rejected the employee's argument that his rights were unconstitutionally impaired.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the dismissal of the employee's tort action against the insurance company for the alleged bad faith termination of his worker's compensation benefits.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued his equal protection rights were violated when the increased penalties of &sect; 343.44(2)(b) was determined by the use of the conviction dates rather than violation dates. Defendant was cited May 2, 1978 for operating a motor vehicle after revocation and convicted January 19, 1981. He was again cited for the same violation on June 18, 1983 and convicted September 13, 1983. More than five years had elapsed between his first and second violations, bur defendant was sentenced as a repeat offender because his convictions were less than five years apart. The court held that a rational basis existed for specifying the date of conviction as the beginning of the five-year period in &sect; 343.44(2) as that was when the punishment was imposed which failed to deter a person from committing the crime a second time. The court concluded &sect; 343.44 was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

Defendant claimed that the trial court erred in instructing the jury that she had a duty to disclose shortages of money to her employer.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant served as an accounts receivable clerk for a school district. Her brother admitted to her that he had taken money from her office. She told her supervisor 11 weeks after she noticed the money was missing. She claimed that if she had a duty it was mandatory, and the real controversy was not tried. On appeal, the court held that as a matter of law an employee had a duty to disclose shortages of money to her supervisor, and therefore the trial court properly instructed the jury that the duty existed. The court found that defendant had a duty to disclose shortages to her employer, but how she did so was within her discretion. The court ruled that because defendant's power to determine the manner in which she exercised her duty was discretionary, the jury reasonably could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that her failure to exercise that discretionary power was a violation of Wis. Stat. &sect; 946.12(3). The court concluded that because defendant's duty was discretionary and the trial court correctly instructed the jury that a public employe had a duty to report shortages to her employer, the real controversy was tried.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 704.17(2). On appeal, the court held that these findings were not clearly erroneous and upheld them pursuant to Wis. Stat. &sect; 805.17(2); it held that the trial court was correct in finding that the tenants materially breached the lease and that the landlord was entitled to eviction. It also held that the tenants failed to meet the beyond a reasonable doubt standard of proof in regard to Wis. Stat. &sect; 704.27, as since they did not prove they were part of a class denied access to the court system, and it further held that they had not proved that they were denied either equal protection or due process where the eviction law required trial on the return date of the summons, the same as any other small claims action, and allowed the tenants any legitimate defenses. The court further held that because the tenants did not give notice to the attorney general as required by Wis. Stat. &sect; 806.04(11), their challenge to the constitutionality of the double rent statute should not have been heard by the trial court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Between August 1, 1980 and February 22, 1983, defendant incurred 12 moving traffic violations. Nine of these violations took place in California, while the remaining three violations occurred in Wisconsin. Upon the revocation of defendant's driving privileges, he contended that the Department of Transportation was estopped from bringing a proceeding under Wis. Stat. ch. 351 on the facts of this case, that the trial court abused its discretion by failing to exercise any discretion, that the State's delay in bringing the petition was a violation of due process, and that the habitual traffic offender statute was unconstitutional. The court affirmed, holding that it was not reasonable for defendant to assume that because he had obtained reinstatement, he would be immune from a habitual traffic offender action if subsequently convicted of an earlier offense. The court stated that courts were permitted no discretion in the administration of Wis. Stat. ch. 351. The court found that the delay in bringing the habitual offender proceeding was not unreasonable and that defendant was not prejudiced by the delay. The court found the habitual offender statute to be constitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of a judgment rendered by the Circuit Court for Dane County (Wisconsin), which found him guilty of operating a motor vehicle while having a blood-alcohol concentration of 0.1 percent or more by weight of alcohol in his blood, claiming that he was denied a fair trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A police officer pulled defendant over after he observed his vehicle speeding and drifting partially into the adjacent lane. The officer observed defendant stumble somewhat when he got out of his car, noted an odor of intoxicants on his breath and bloodshot eyes, and noted that he slurred his speech. After defendant failed his field sobriety tests, he was arrested for driving while under the influence of intoxicants. Defendant was administrated a breathalyzer test, showing a .12 percent blood-alcohol level. Defendant was found guilty and appealed his conviction. The court held that Wis. Stat. &sect; 885.235 created a rebuttable presumption that defendant's blood-alcohol level was 0.1 percent or more at the time of operating a vehicle if, within three hours thereafter, his blood-alcohol level was tested to be 0.1 percent or more. The court also stated that the presumption, standing alone, was sufficient in the absence of scientific rebuttal evidence by the defendant to sustain a directed verdict under the clear and convincing burden of proof. The court concluded that defendant failed to present evidence to overcome the presumption and therefore defendant's conviction was proper.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The funeral director received a call to take charge of the deceased's body. He was notified that an autopsy was to be performed, so he should only do an arterial embalming. The funeral director instead did a cavitary embalming, which made the autopsy impractical. When the family asked the funeral director about this, he made crass remarks about the autopsy procedure. The Board charged him with violating Wis. Admin. Code &sect; FDE 3.01(5), (2) and suspended his license. The trial court vacated the decision. On appeal, the court reversed. The court reviewed the Board's legal conclusions to determine if they were reasonable. The court found that substantial evidence supported the conclusion that the funeral director's conduct in embalming the body as he did was a wanton or reckless disregard of his duties. The court found that the Board's interpretation of its own regulation was entitled to controlling weight. The court found that the Board's finding that the funeral director's statements to the family were offensive was not clearly erroneous. The court found that the language in Wis. Admin.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A police officer stopped defendant after defendant attempted to enter southbound expressway traffic from a northerly direction. The arresting officer testified that defendant had trouble walking in the snow, her eyes were bloodshot, and there was an odor of alcohol on her breath. A breathalyzer test indicated that her blood alcohol concentration was .11 percent. Defendant testified that she had consumed some alcohol at her daughter's home prior to driving. The court affirmed defendant's conviction. Contrary to defendant's contention, Wis. Stat. &sect; 346.63(1)(b) was not constitutionally invalid due to vagueness. A similar argument had been raised in a prior case. The court dismissed the constitutional challenge in the prior case upon finding that a person of common intelligence could, with a fair degree of definiteness, believe himself or herself to be in jeopardy of violating the statute if a significant quantity of alcohol had been consumed. Any person with common sense would know when consumption approached a meaningful amount.

Defendant was arrested, and a breathalyzer test showed his blood alcohol concentration (BAC) was .15 percent. Defendant appealed from his conviction under Wis.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff property owners appealed a declaratory judgment entered by the Circuit Court for Dane County (Wisconsin), which upheld the validity of defendant city's 1969 zoning ordinance. The ordinance designated the property owners' property R-3, or two-family residence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property was located between multiple apartments that bordered a commercial area and single family residences. The property owners had a three-unit apartment building on part of their property. The city's 1969 ordinance zoned the property as a buffer between the higher and lower density uses surrounding it, restricting construction on a vacant portion to one- or two-family dwellings. The property owners alleged that the ordinance constituted illegal spot zoning and that it was arbitrary. The court upheld the trial court's judgment. The court held that the property owners were not denied equal protection of the laws because the different land use classification of the surrounding properties and the property owners' property was justified by the city's desire to buffer residential areas from commercial zones. Further, the property owners' property was not spot zoned because it shared the same land use privileges and restrictions as other properties in the vicinity. Finally, because the benefits of orderly land use planning and the use of buffer zones were great, and because the economic burden to the property owners was slight, the property owners were not denied due process.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Circuit Court for Waukesha County (Wisconsin), which revoked his driver's license privileges for his refusal to submit to a breathalyzer test upon his arrest for operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicants.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested for operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicants. He refused to submit to a breathalyzer test, and the trial court eventually revoked his driver's license privileges. He appealed, noting that the statute allowed up to three hours for taking the test. He therefore reasoned that the officer's conduct in demanding that he take the test promptly was contrary to statutory intent and was also a deprivation of due process. He claimed that there was no probable cause to arrest, so the breath sample was an unlawful seizure. The court affirmed the judgment and held that once defendant was arrested, and a citation was given for operation of a vehicle under the influence of intoxicants, custodial authorities had the duty to immediately warn him of the obligations and consequences of refusal. Defendant's obligation was to take the test promptly or refuse it promptly. The constitutionality issue was not considered because it was not presented at the trial court level. Ample probable cause existed to place defendant under arrest because the officer saw defendant's vehicle weaving in traffic, and defendant failed the field tests.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that &sect; 346.63(1)(b) was void for vagueness because it was not possible for a person to determine by his or her own senses whether his or her blood alcohol concentration of a &quot;legal&quot; 0.09 percent or an &quot;illegal&quot; 0.10 percent. The trial court agreed and found statute unconstitutional. On appeal, the court reversed. Defendant conceded that the statute satisfied the second prong of the &quot;void-for-vagueness&quot; test, as it provided a precise standard of law enforcement. With respect to the second prong, the court held that absolute precision was not required to prevent the statute from being declared vague. While a driver might not be able to determine that his or her blood alcohol content was 0.10 percent rather than 0.09 percent, a person of average intelligence could, with a fair degree of definiteness, believe himself or herself to be in jeopardy of violating the statute if a significant quantity of alcohol had been consumed. The court also took judicial notice of the fact that it required more than a small amount of alcohol to produce a 0.10 percent blood alcohol content.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the Circuit Court for Milwaukee County (Wisconsin), which convicted him of first degree murder and armed robbery, and from an order denying post conviction relief. On appeal, defendant argued that the trial court erred in refusing to give lesser-included offense instructions to the jury, and that the trial court erred in refusing to give the jury written instructions on all applicable substantive law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court instructed the jury on first degree murder and the intoxication defense but refused to submit a second degree murder instruction. Defendant testified that, on the night before the murder, he smoked a PCP cigarette, took two amphetamines, and drank a pint of whiskey. While this may not have been overwhelming evidence of intoxication at the time of the offense, the court could not conclude that the trial court abused its discretion in giving the intoxication instruction. The court also found that evidence of intoxication sufficient to merit an intoxication defense instruction could lead a reasonable jury to convict on either first or second degree murder. It therefore was error to instruct on intoxication but refuse to permit the lesser-included offense question to go to the jury. Finally, the court concluded that it was error for the trial court not to have submitted the intoxication instruction to the jury in writing. Such an instruction set forth a defense to a first degree murder charge. Given the gravity of the instruction's role in the case, the court could not reasonably say that, had the error not been committed, the verdict might probably have been different.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of falsely assuming to act as a town clerk and as a municipal judge after he purported to create a new township and took a number of actions indicating that he assumed to act as a public officer. The court affirmed his conviction and sentence. There was no error in the failure to appoint defendant counsel for an indigency proceeding because it was not a critical stage and, thus, he had no right to counsel at the proceeding. There was no prejudice in allowing the State to amend the complaint against defendant to charge additional counts supported by the original complaint without allowing defendant 10 days to challenge the amended complaint because defendant received sufficient notice of the nature and cause of the accusations. The fact that defendant assumed the offices of a nonexistent township did not make his actions outside of Wis. Stat. &sect; 946.69(1). Section 946.69(1) was not unconstitutionally vague or overbroad.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, a sign corporation and its president, appealed a judgment from the Circuit Court for Rock County (Wisconsin) in favor of defendant City of Janesville in the plaintiffs' action brought to obtain moving and other expenses as displaced persons under Wis. Stat. &sect; 32.19(2)(c) (1969) on account of condemnation of realty by the City.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Under Wis. Stat. &sect; 32.19(2)(c) (1969), &quot;displaced person&quot; meant any person that moved from realty on or after July 1, 1970, as a result of the acquisition of the realty for public purposes or reasonable expectation of acquisition of the realty subsequently acquired for public purposes. An amendment codified at Wis. Stat. &sect; 32.19(2)(c)(1971) removed the &quot;reasonable expectation&quot; language from the statute. The 1971 version was made retroactive to January 2, 1971. The trial court found that plaintiffs did not begin their move until January 2, 1971. Plaintiffs claimed that they moved in reasonable expectation of the acquisition of realty during the period of January 2, 1971, to January 2, 1972, and that they acquired vested rights under the 1969 version of the statute. On appeal, the court ruled that, because the amendment occurred before the property had been taken by the City in 1973, causes of action did not accrue to plaintiffs, who had no vested rights until the property was acquired by the City. A statutory cause of action could be taken away by the legislature before it vested. The retroactive application of &sect; 32.19(2)(c) (1971) was not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant State of Wisconsin sought review of an order of the Circuit Court of Rock County (Wisconsin), which suppressed evidence that resulted from defendant's arrest to secure his presence as a witness in a John Doe proceeding. The trial court held that the evidence could not be used against defendant in the criminal proceedings brought against him.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The John Doe judge issued a warrant for defendant's arrest, which required him to appear as a material witness. While in custody during the weekend, and after waiving his Miranda rights, defendant gave statements to the police and consented to a search of his business premises. The statements and evidence obtained from the search inculpated defendant. The pending charge resulted. A material witness arrest warrant under Wis. Stat. &sect; 969.01(3) could only be issued in a &quot;felony criminal proceeding.&quot; A John Doe judge was required to determine if any crime had been committed. The John Doe judge was not able to predict that a specific crime had been committed or that it was felonious. Accordingly, the court held that a John Doe proceeding was not a &quot;felony criminal proceeding.&quot; It followed that a John Doe judge was not allowed to issue a material witness warrant under &sect; 969.01(3). Therefore, the warrant authorizing defendant's arrest was invalid. The court held that defendant's arrest was unconstitutional under the Fourth Amendment. It was undisputed that the evidence sought to be suppressed was obtained as a result of defendant's arrest and was inadmissible against him.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner sought a writ of habeas corpus to require the trial court and both the Dane County District Attorney and Sheriff to release him from the county jail, where he had been incarcerated for failure to post cash bail on two misdemeanor charges. An issue presented was whether or not the $ 1,500 cash bail set by the trial court was excessive.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The criminal complaint for which bail was set alleged that petitioner had knowingly violated an injunction issued under Wis. Stat. &sect; 813.025(2), which misdemeanor was a violation of Wis. Stat. &sect; 940.33. A second charge against him was bail jumping. Apparently in contravention of the injunction, petitioner had contact with his wife, during which he stated to her that she looked good and that he still did not agree with what she was doing. The court ordered petitioner released on a writ of habeas corpus because of excessive bail. U.S. Const. amend. VIII and Wis. Const. art. 1, &sect; 6 prohibited excessive bail; claims of constitutional error could be heard by an application for habeas corpus. Bail set higher than necessary to adequately assure appearance at trial was excessive under the Eighth Amendment. In finding that bail was excessive in the instant case, the court focused on the fact that defendant's oral statements during the subject contact were made at a public place and conveyed no threat of violence. The court made other rulings, including one that the merits of the habeas petition had been properly decided by a single appellate judge.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Ruling in favor of petitioner, the court granted the writ of habeas corpus and directed the county sheriff to release petitioner from custody.</SPAN></P>

As part of the dispositional order she was required to attend school regularly without any unexplained absences or tardiness. Subsequently, the juvenile was found in contempt on three occasions. On the fourth occasion, the juvenile was ordered to spend 30 days in secure detention following an informal hearing in which a representative of the district attorney's office was not present and in which there was no order of proof or sworn testimony. On appeal, the court reversed finding that there was no sworn testimony and no proper order of proof was undertaken and therefore the procedures for executing contempt actions under Wis. Stat. &sect; 785 were not followed. The court rejected the county's argument that the juvenile court did not have to follow the procedures of &sect; 785. The court further rejected the argument that the juvenile court had discretion to apply whatever procedures it wanted, finding that such a contention was unworkable and contrary to the principles of due process. The fact that the case involved a juvenile did not require less due process than an equivalent adult proceeding.</SPAN></P>

After two witnesses identified him he was charged with criminal trespass, attempted robbery, and attempted burglary. Defendant pleaded guilty to attempted robbery and attempted burglary and was convicted. Defendant appealed, claiming that his constitutional rights to be free from unreasonable seizures were violated when he was forced to submit to a lineup following his arrest for an ordinance violation. In affirming the judgments, the court held that there was no distinction between an arrest for a civil violation and an arrest for a criminal violation where a lineup was concerned. As long as defendant was lawfully in custody and his constitutional rights were observed, he could be required to submit to a lineup for an unrelated criminal offense. In defendant's case, the police officers clearly had probable cause to arrest defendant for violating the loitering ordinance. Therefore, forcing defendant to submit to the lineup did not violate his constitutional rights.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The first insurer's insured and his wife were injured in a collision with the second insurer's insured. The first insurer paid the medical expenses of its insured's wife on August 20, 1979. It commenced the instant action on August 13, 1981 to recover the medical expenses. The first insurer's claim for contribution accrued when it made the payment. Thus, the contribution action was barred under Wis. Stat. &sect; 893.92, which required the first insurer to commence its contribution action within one year of accrual. The first insurer was not entitled to a three-year limitation under Wis. Stat. &sect; 893.12 on its contribution action because the first insurer's payment was a final settlement, not an advance payment. The trial court improperly rejected the indemnification claim because factual issues existed. The first insurer made payment pursuant to an insurance policy. Thus, it was not voluntary, but compelled by law. Therefore, the indemnification claim was proper. The first insurer's claim was not barred by the statute of limitations if it was one for indemnity; an apportionment of negligence would have determined whether the claim was for indemnity or contribution.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The driver's car struck the insured's car. The insurer paid the car loss to its insured, subrogated to the insured's claim, and filed an action against the driver.

The driver appealed. The court held that the driver had no right to challenge the constitutionality of Wis. Stat. &sect; 806.09(1) because he failed to give the attorney general notice of his challenge. Section 806.09(1) did not deprive the driver of due process because he received a full jury trial before the second judgment was entered. The court held that the trial court properly refused to instruct on subrogation, which was determined on the prior appeal, and properly decided the damages issue as a matter of law. The court held the verdict was supported by sufficient evidence that the driver proceeded into the intersection when the insured had the right of way. The court reduced the judgment by the amount of the insured's negligence and the salvage value the insurer received for the car as offset against the towing and storage charges.</SPAN></P>

The mobile home park discontinued the practice and the trial court dismissed the case because the mobile home park had discontinued using the restriction so no threat of future harm, a necessary element of proof in injunction actions, could be shown. The court reversed and remanded and held that threat of future harm needed only be alleged and proven in common law actions for injunctions. It was not necessary where the authority for the injunction was found in a statute that did not make threat of future harm a prerequisite to relief. The court found that the statute at issue here specifically provided the court with the authority to issue an injunction if an order had been violated. .</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employees had worked as police officers for the City. At the time that they entered employment, they resided in the City in compliance with Madison, Wis., General Ordinance 3.27, but they later moved to the suburbs. The employees maintained apartments in town and registered to vote there. The employees continued living in the suburbs even after City officials circulated a memorandum that advised that the ordinance in question would be strictly enforced. After due warning, the employees' positions were vacated. One of the employees filed a grievance, which was dismissed. Upon appeal of the denial of declaratory relief, the court concluded that the employees were not City residents as defined by the ordinance in question. The City was not estopped by alleged assurances that had been made to the employees by superior officers. Madison, Wis., General Ordinance 3.27 was constitutional facially and in its application to the employees. The availability of the grievance procedure culminating in a full evidentiary hearing satisfied due process requirements. The employees were not denied due process through a deprivation of an impartial decision-maker.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, the mother of a child, sought review of a judgment of the Circuit Court for Milwaukee County (Wisconsin), which denied her petition to terminate the parental rights of respondent, the father of the child. On appeal, the mother asserted that the trial court erred in reserving the question of unfitness to the dispositional phase of the action and erred in excluding the testimony of police officers regarding the father's violent conduct.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Upon learning of the pregnancy, the mother's relationship with the father deteriorated to the point that he drove the mother's car into ditch, pushed her down, and had threatened to kill her. Throughout the pregnancy, the mother kept the father at a distance, generally refusing contact with her, and then with the baby after its birth. She filed an action seeking the termination of the father's parental rights after she decided to place the baby for adoption. Pursuant to Wis. Stat. &sect; 48.242(3), the trial court reserved the issue of the father's fitness for the dispositional phase, allowing the jury to only find whether any grounds for termination existed. On appeal, the mother challenged the constitutionality of &sect; 48.242(3) by asserting that it was error for the trial court to reserve the question of unfitness to the dispositional phase. She also asserted that the testimony of two police officers regarding the father's violent nature should have been admitted. The court held that the mother failed to meet the high burden of proving the unconstitutionality of &sect; 48.242(3). The proposed evidence, while relevant and admissible, was cumulative, making its exclusion harmless error.</SPAN></P>

An issue on appeal was whether or not there was a violation of a constitutional right by the disclosure without appellant's consent of his school photograph for use by the victim to identify him such that her out-of-court identification of him should have been suppressed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The victim had been assaulted sexually by three assailants while she was departing from a high school. She had seen one assailant. A school principal allowed the victim to identify the assailant from about 1,200 photograph-identification cards. The victim also identified the assailant through glass from inside a school office. The court found that the show-up procedure was not impermissibly suggestive but that if it were given the circumstances in toto of the procedure the identification was reliable. However, the court ruled that testimony about the out-of-court identification should have been suppressed on account of the Fourth Amendment as far as the photograph identification had been procured by an illegal search of appellant's school records. Appellant had a reasonable expectation of privacy via Wis. Stat. &sect; 118.125(2), which required the confidentiality of school records; notwithstanding the trial court's opinion, a pupil's photograph was indubitably a pupil record under Wis. Stat. &sect; 118.125(1)(d). The court could not say that the erroneous admission of the inadmissible evidence was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Ruling in favor of appellant, the court reversed the trial court's orders and remanded the case to the trial court for a new trial.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, a mentally disabled patient, challenged two orders from the Circuit Court for Brown County (Wisconsin), which ordered his continued protective placement under Wis. Stat. ch. 55.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The patient was ordered protectively placed in 1982. After a second review hearing in 1983, the circuit court ordered the placement continued without change. The issue on appeal was whether Wis. Stat. &sect; 55.06(10)(a) required a circuit court reviewing a protective placement to determine if the conditions warranting placement still existed. On appeal, the court affirmed the orders. The court held that Wis. Stat. ch. 55 made no requirement of periodic court review of placements ordered under Wis. Stat. &sect; 55.06(9)(a). Since the circuit court was under no obligation to review the patient's placement, it likewise had no statutory duty on review to determine if the conditions warranting placement continued to exist. The court found that although no court review was required, &sect; 55.06(10)(a) did require the agency responsible for a protective placement to review his status at least every 12 months after admission, unless a court required more frequent review. Further, the court noted that the patient could at any time petition the circuit court for termination of protective placement on grounds that the conditions warranting placement were no longer present.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant client challenged an order of the Circuit Court for Waukesha County (Wisconsin), which dismissed his counterclaim for negligent representation. The trial court granted summary judgment to plaintiff attorneys, who sought attorney fees for services rendered in the client's divorce action, and awarded costs and attorneys fees to the attorneys for their defense to the client's counterclaim, pursuant to Wis. Stat. &sect; 814.025.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The client argued that the attorneys' motion for summary judgment was brought beyond the eight-month limit allowed by Wis. Stat. &sect; 802.08(1). The court held that the attorneys' motion was for judgment on the pleadings under Wis. Stat. &sect; 802.06(3), for which there was no time limit. Because the trial court considered matters outside of the pleadings, it properly treated the motion as one for summary judgment pursuant to &sect; 802.06(3). The court held that, because no issue of material fact was in dispute, the attorneys were entitled to judgment. Further, the client's claim that the attorneys were negligent for failing to argue for a date other than the date of the divorce degree for the valuation of the marital estate had no merit. In the court's view, the client did not set forth any &quot;exceptional circumstances&quot; that suggested that a deviation from Wisconsin law was appropriate. However, the failure of the attorneys to argue that the client's company stock bonus was income after the divorce degree was a possible claim, and the trial court did not make findings sufficient to support its dismissal on that point. Finally, Wis. Stat. &sect; 814.025 was not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the dismissal of a portion of the client's counterclaim and remanded for further findings as to whether the attorneys failed to present a legitimate argument in the client's divorce action. Thus, whether the entire counterclaim was frivolous and whether the attorneys were entitled to attorney fees and costs was for further review by the trial court. Otherwise, the court affirmed the judgment of the trial court.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the Circuit Court for Milwaukee County (Wisconsin), which found him guilty of operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of an intoxicant contrary to Wis. Stat. &sect; 346.63(1) and, because it was his third conviction within five years, sentenced him to 30 days in the House of Correction. Defendant claimed, inter alia, that the statutes under which he was convicted were unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with his third violation of operating a motor vehicle on February 23, 1982, while under the influence of an intoxicant, contrary to Wis. Stat. &sect; 346.63(1). A jury found him guilty on February 15, 1983. The first violation occurred October 25, 1977, with defendant being convicted on December 7, 1977. The court rejected defendant's argument that, because Wis. Stat. &sect; 346.65(2) made a third offense a criminal violation without requiring proof of the first two offenses beyond a reasonable doubt, Wis. Stat. &sect; 346.63(1)&nbsp;unconstitutionally permitted a conviction without proof of every element of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt. The fact of the prior violations was not an element of the crime of violating &sect; 346.63(1). The court also rejected defendant's contention that Wis. Stat. &sect;&sect; 346.65(2) and 343.307 were ex post facto laws because they existed before the violation appealed by defendant. Finally, the court held that the five-year period referenced in Wis. Stat. &sect; 346.65(2)(b) was to be measured from and to the dates of the refusals or violations which resulted in the revocation or convictions, not from and to the dates of the convictions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city adopted an ordinance that distinguished between &quot;residential&quot; refuse collection and &quot;commercial&quot; refuse collection. The ordinance included within its definition of commercial properties multiple dwelling units and imposed a fee for commercial collection services. Respondents brought an action contending that the city exceeded its statutory authority and that the ordinance was unconstitutional. The trial court held for respondents and the city sought review. The court reversed the decision. The court found that Wis. Stat. &sect;&sect; 66.049 and 66.60(16)(a) authorized a city to collect refuse from classes of property and to impose fees for its services. Thus, the court said, the city did not exceed its authority by creating refuse collection districts defined by the particular class of property served and employing different methods of payment as between districts. The court also held that the classification scheme did not violate the Equal Protection Clause. The court said that refuse collection is not a &quot;fundamental right&quot; and that the owners of multiple dwelling units were not a suspect classification. The court also found a rational basis for the classification scheme.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee argued that he should have been trained for the job, that he was disciplined for exercising his free speech rights, and that his discharge was excessive discipline. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment because the record supported the Commission's findings that the employee was trained, that the discharge was based on his incompetence and failure to improve, and that discharge was a proper sanction. The court found that the employee was expected to be able to do the job at the time he entered the position. The testimony of the employee's supervisor amply evinced the assistance given to the employee on a daily basis. The court also found that the employee had minimal experience in the area of public bonds. The record was replete with evidence that despite assistance from his supervisor, over the five-month period of his employment, he consistently failed to adequately complete or perform required tasks. The court found that there was substantial evidence to support the Commission's finding that the discharge was not excessive or inappropriate discipline. Further, his earlier reprimand for a speech-related activity had no link to his later discharge.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State appealed from an order dismissing a criminal complaint against the defendant for one count of misconduct in public office contrary to Wis. Stat. &sect; 946.12(2). The issue was whether an act of consensual sexual intercourse between a prison guard and a prisoner, occurring when the guard was on duty, was punishable as an act done and forbidden to be done in the guard's &quot;official capacity.&quot; On appeal, the court agreed with the trial court's determination that, under the circumstances of the case, it was not. It might be a violation of ethics and good conduct for a public officer in such a capacity to use his influence upon a board, but it would not be bribery. Because defendant's act did not inherently implicate the power of her public office, it did not fall within the prohibition of &sect; 946.12(2).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The horse owners failed to properly maintain a portion of a fence on the border of their property. Four horses crossed over onto the neighbor's property and damaged his corn and hay crops. The neighbor held the horses, pursuant to Wis. Stat. ch. 173. The horses were transferred to respondent livestock dealer until damages were paid or the horses were sold. The owners sued for recovery of their horses after posting the damages. The trial court dismissed their complaint for damages and their motion to declare ch. 173 unconstitutional. On appeal, the judgment was affirmed. The court held that the owners were not entitled to damages because the neighbor and the dealer acted in good faith under ch. 173, which had not been declared unconstitutional. The court ruled that because the horses had been returned, there was no remaining due process controversy. There was sufficient evidence for the trial court to find that the owners failed to prove the allegations in their complaint.</SPAN></P>
