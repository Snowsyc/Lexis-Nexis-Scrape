<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant sought review of a decision of the Circuit Court of Buchanan County (Missouri), which convicted him of attempted rape. He challenged the constitutionality of the rape shield statute,&nbsp;Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 491.015 (1978), and the admissibility of certain evidence under that statute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was charged with attempted rape. He claimed that he was at home with his family watching television when the crime occurred. In an offer of proof, he sought to cross-examine the complainant and to introduce extrinsic evidence in order to establish that she had told another person approximately three hours before the alleged attempted rape that someone with the initials R. G. had just raped her. The trial court excluded the evidence and defendant was convicted of attempted rape. The court found that the evidence was admissible under the rape shield statute and did not address the constitutionality of the statute. It found that defendant's proffered evidence fell within one of the enumerated exceptions to the presumption that evidence of the complainant's prior sexual conduct was irrelevant, as it was evidence of the immediate surrounding circumstances of the alleged crime. The trial court also erred in denying the admission of the evidence based upon its determination of the witness's credibility and that the story was incredible, as the jury was the sole judge of the credibility of witnesses.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed defendant's conviction for attempted rape and remanded the matter to the trial court.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed from his conviction in the Circuit Court of Jasper County (Missouri) for one count of forcible rape. Defendant was sentenced to a term of five years.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">At trial, defendant's defense was that he did not achieve penetration and that in any case the complainant had given consent. The complainant asserted that defendant and three others raped her sometime during a two-day period. At the trial, defendant sought to introduce evidence that on the night before, the complainant had had sexual relations with one of the persons who allegedly raped her. The trial court excluded the evidence. On appeal, the court reversed, finding that the evidence was admissible under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 491-015.2 because it was probative of material issues, namely, complainant's ability to perceive and to recall the alleged events and whether she had consented to the sexual acts. The &quot;rape shield&quot; statute, &sect; 491-015, created only a &quot;presumption&quot; that evidence of a victim's prior sexual conduct was irrelevant. The evidence supported a finding that at all times that the complainant was observed early in the morning, later that day, and early in the next morning, she was quite intoxicated on drugs and alcohol. The jury should have been permitted the opportunity to infer that the complainant had confused the events and that defendant had never raped her.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed defendant's capital murder conviction and death sentence because (1) the jury properly found an aggravating circumstance under Mo. Rev.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed from his conviction for capital murder entered by the Circuit Court of St. Louis County (Missouri), arguing, among other things, that the trial court erroneously sustained the state's challenge for cause of two veniremen, improperly admitted into evidence photographs of the victim's dead body, and erred in sustaining the state's objection to defendant's request to introduce evidence that another person committed the murder.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant objected to the late filing of a substitute information because it contained &quot;endorsed&quot; witnesses who had not been listed on the indictment and to the statutory aggravating circumstance filed immediately before trial. Defendant also alleged that the reduction in the number of peremptory challenges was an invalid ex-post facto law, and that the sentence was excessive. The court found no reversible error because (1) the second sheet of witness was not with the indictment by reason of clerical error and that there was no evidence of bad faith or intent to work a disadvantage on defendant by the state, (2) the state informed defendant a full month before the trial of its intent to seek the death penalty, (3) the veniremen were objectionable because they unequivocally opposed the death penalty , (4) the peremptory strikes amendment was not an ex-post facto law because it involved procedure and not a substantive due process right, (5) the photos were relevant and not legally inflammatory, (6) defendant's confession was direct evidence of his guilty; therefore, evidence that someone else committed the crime was not admissible, and (7) the sentence followed the statutory scheme.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the Circuit Court of St. Charles County (Missouri), which convicted defendant of one count of forcible rape and one count of kidnapping and sentenced him to terms of 20 years and 5 years respectively with the terms to run consecutively.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">At defendant's trial, he proffered evidence that the complainant had had sexual relations with her boyfriend sometime within two or three hours of the alleged rape. The trial court had excluded the evidence under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 491.015 (1978), the &quot;rape shield&quot; statute. Defendant contended that the evidence was admissible under the statute and, alternatively that the statute was unconstitutional. The court concluded that the evidence was admissible under the statute and did not reach the constitutional issue. The court found that the evidence was highly probative of the issue of consent, which was central to both the rape and the kidnapping charges, and of defendant's mental state and that it was evidence of immediate surrounding circumstances. The evidence was not offered to show the complainant's general inclination to have a sexual experience, but rather to prove a specific motive to have sex, to lie, and to go to a hospital for fear of pregnancy. The evidence was extrinsic to defendant's own testimony, tended to corroborate that testimony, and concerned statements and sexual acts that occurred in very close temporal proximity to the alleged rape.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the judgments on both counts and remanded the case to the trial court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The victim was raped by another man. While the rapist was in jail, he offered defendant money to kill the victim to keep her from testifying against him. Defendant stole a gun, watched the victim for several days, and bragged to others that he was going to kill her. He kidnapped the victim, robbing her and her boyfriend, then killed her by hitting her in the head with a brick, then shooting her. He then told several people what he had done and went to the rapist's family's home to collect his pay for the killing. When he was arrested, he waived his Miranda rights three times, then he gave three confessions. The court held that the trial court properly refused to instruct the jury as to first-degree murder because that crime was not a lesser-included offense of capital murder, and was not charged in the indictment. There was probable cause to arrest defendant, validating the warrantless arrest. Under the totality of the circumstances, the confessions were voluntary, as evidenced by defendant's waiver of his rights three times, together with his detailed, consistent confessions.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant was convicted of three counts of forcible rape and two counts of forcible sodomy. The Circuit Court of Stoddard County (Missouri) found the appellant was a persistent offender and sentenced him to a term of 65 years imprisonment on each count to be served concurrently without probation or parole. The appellant challenged his conviction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The appellant's primary issue was the constitutionality of Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 491.015, commonly referred to as the &quot;rape shield&quot; statute. The statute, with certain exceptions, proscribed admission of evidence of prior sexual conduct of the complaining witness. The appellant alleged that his confrontational rights as guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment were violated in that he was denied an opportunity to present evidence of the complainant's reputation in the community for engaging in indiscriminate consensual sexual activity as relevant to the issue of &quot;consent,&quot; and he was denied an opportunity to present evidence as to specific sexual relations between the complaining witness and a third party which would have tended to show a motive for her to falsify her testimony and charge of rape. On appeal, the court held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in failing to permit the admission of the tendered evidence, and that the rape shield statute was constitutional. The court also ruled that the sentence imposed on the appellant as a habitual sexual offender did not amount to cruel and unusual punishment.</SPAN></P>

However, one of the court of appeals' dissenting judges certified the case to the court. The court affirmed the court of appeals' judgment. The court held (1) that the admission of defendant's confession was not erroneous, as the officers who had questioned defendant respected his desire not to talk about the bank robbery charge and defendant subsequently and knowingly engaged in a discussion with the officers about the deceased victim; (2) that defendant's constitutional right to a speedy trial was not violated, as the passage of 15 months between the charge and trial was not ipso facto an inordinate delay and six of those months were the result of the inadvertent and mistaken filing of the proper detainer papers with the wrong authorities; and (3) that defendant was not denied the right to counsel at critical stages of the prosecution, as his counsel had made extensive preparation, filed pretrial motions, and gave effective trial representation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On appeal, defendant argued that &sect; 195.200 was unconstitutional. The court found that the persistent offender provisions of &sect; 195.200 did not impermissibly abridge defendant's constitutional rights to a trial by jury. The court held that &sect; 195.200(4), which prohibited judicial clemency for persistent offenders of Missouri's controlled substances law, did not violate federal and Missouri constitutional prohibitions against cruel and unusual punishment. The court rejected defendant's contention that the trial court erred in refusing defendant's request for a mistrial after a witness for the state in a non-responsive answer volunteered information concerning &quot;stolen guns&quot; which violated the trial court's ruling on a motion in limine. The court found that the trial court employed appropriate curative measures short of declaring a mistrial. The court found that no prejudicial error resulted from overruling defendant's objection during closing argument. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment and found that defendant was not entitled to his proposed instruction because Mo. Rev.

The victim alleged that the district failed to provide him with a safe environment in which to work or failed to warn him of impending dangers. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's order for summary judgment in favor of the school district. The court found that the victim failed to carry his burden to show that the sovereign immunity statute was arbitrary or invidious in its limitations on victims of public torts injured because of the dangerous condition of property. Section 537.600 did not violate the victim's due process and equal protection rights under the Fourteenth Amendment because it did not affect a fundamental civil right, involve suspect classifications, and possessed a rational relationship to the governmental interest expressed by the General Assembly. The General Assembly sought to balance the need to protect governmental funds against the desire to allow redress for claimants injured in certain accidents that involved public entities.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The county adopted a budget for 1982 that increased certain fees. The resident filed a declaratory judgment action alleging that the ordinances adopting the increased fees violated Mo. Const. art. X, &sect; 22. The trial court found in her favor and enjoined enforcement of the ordinances. The resident was also awarded attorneys' fees and costs. The county and its executive appealed from that judgment, which was affirmed. Under Mo. Const. art. X, &sect; 22(a), a provision of the Hancock Amendment, a county was prohibited from levying any new or additional tax, license, or fees without voter approval. The court rejected the argument that a county could impose a license or fee under an enabling authority that set no specific dollar amount or rate without needing voter approval. The Amendment did not violate Mo. Const. art. XII, &sect; 2(b), which specified that a constitutional amendment could not contain more than one subject and matters connected therewith. Furthermore, Mo. Const. art. X, &sect; 23 gave the resident standing to contest the ordinances and authorized the trial court to reimburse her for all of her out-of-pocket expenses.</SPAN></P>

The court held that this evidence was sufficient to sustain the conviction. The court also upheld the admission of a shotgun found in the trunk of the stolen car because it was relevant to explain the manner in which the crime was committed. In addition, the court upheld the admission of the victim's credit cards, driver's license, and testimony regarding the victim's body. Although defendant's attorney advised the police not to take his statement, the police questioned him repeatedly about any evidence that remained at the arrest site and took defendant to the site. However, the evidence was not discovered and seized until a later search. On the basis of the entire record, the court held that the effect of the admission of the credit cards and driver's license was, at worst, minimal, and that the lower court's failure to exclude this evidence constituted harmless error.</SPAN></P>

The court held that evidence of the subsequent assault upon another officer was admissible both to show motive and to prove the State's theory that the attacks were a part of a common scheme or plan. Although evidence of defendant's diminished mental capacity was introduced, it was not necessary for the trial court to give an instruction on diminished mental capacity because defendant's expert also testified that defendant was able to form the intent to kill, that he was able to know that he was practically certain to cause the death of another, and that he was able to consider taking the life of another and to reflect thereon coolly and carefully before doing so.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant challenged his conviction entered in the Circuit Court of Grundy County (Missouri). He was found guilty of burglary in the second degree under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 569.170 (1978). The appeal was filed in the Missouri Court of Appeals, Western District, and transferred to the court by the court of appeals prior to opinion because one of the points asserted was that Mo. Rev.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A co-defendant engaged in forced entry into the apartment of the victims. Once inside, defendant assaulted the victims by kicking and punching two of them. The evidence showed that defendant arrived after the door to the apartment had been kicked in. The trial court found defendant guilty of burglary in the second degree. On appeal, the court affirmed the conviction. The court held that Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 569.170 (1978) was not unconstitutional. The statute was not vague and did put defendant on notice as to the crime charged. The crux of the statute was that a person was guilty who knowingly entered unlawfully or knowingly remained unlawfully in a building or inhabitable structure for the purpose of committing a crime therein. The trial court did not have to prove the highest degree of assault. It was not necessary for a conviction that defendant participated in the forced entry or that an entry was forced at all.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant, an inmate serving a life sentence for murder, challenged his conviction from the Circuit Court of Randolph County (Missouri), for capital murder pursuant to Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 565.001 (1978) of a fellow inmate, and his sentence of death pursuant to Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 565.008(1).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued that the trial court erred in overruling his motion for judgment of acquittal at the close of the State's evidence and in submitting the capital murder verdict directing instruction, because there was no credible evidence upon which the jury could have found him guilty. The court found that while no witness testified that he saw a knife in defendant's possession, nevertheless, there was evidence linking defendant to the knife and linking both defendant and the knife to the attack. Defendant was seen standing over the victim, and making stabbing motions. Defendant was later found wiping blood off his hands. The knife was found in a locked room close to doors defendant was seen entering. There were no detectable fingerprints on the knife, but the knife was still wet with the victim's blood, and the blood on defendant's clothes matched the victim's. The jury could have found from the seriousness of the stab wound that defendant knew he was practically certain to cause the victim's death. Finally, the jury could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that the killing occurred after premeditation and deliberation, which might be inferred from the circumstances.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The employer contended that the commission's order was erroneous because Mo. Rev.

The court held that the legislature had not unconstitutionally delegated judicial powers to the commission in violation of Mo. Const. art. II, &sect; 1. The court found that the legislature had established standards for the commission to apply; that the back pay award was an appropriate remedy for enforcing the important public policy of eliminating racial discrimination in employment; and that the legislature had provided a check on the exercise of quasi judicial power by the commission by providing that all decisions of the commission could be reviewed. The court further held that the statutory scheme of Mo. Rev. Stat. ch. 296 did not violate Mo. Const. art. I, &sect; 10, either facially or as applied and found that the employer was given a hearing of which it had notice, presented witnesses and cross examined witnesses, and received review of the commission's decision.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The owner, who had never held a license to practice dentistry, referred to himself as a &quot;denturist&quot; and had been constructing, repairing, and adjusting prosthetic dentures without written orders or impressions from a licensed dentist. The owner argued that Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 332.071 and 332.081 constituted an unauthorized exercise of the state's police power and denied appellants equal protection and due process of law. The court held that the state's regulation of the practice of dentistry was well within its police power. The statutes were intended to protect the health and general welfare of the citizenry and used reasonable means to effectuate such purpose. Thus, the court held that &sect;&sect; 332.071 and 332.081 were a legitimate exercise of the state's police power and were not violative of the equal protection or due process clauses of U.S. Const. amend. XIV or Mo. Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 2 and 10. The statutes also did not constitute an unconstitutional interference with contracts or a local or special law.

He was sentenced to life imprisonment.

The court reversed on appeal and remanded. The court held that upon receiving notice of the federal control, &sect; 195.015.4 required the state agency to decide whether to object, and if not, to control similarly the substance in the state.

The trial court properly employed the statutes and jury instructions that were in effect when defendant committed his crime and that the instructions fully and fairly apprised the jury of the elements of capital murder. The trial court properly excluded prospective jurors who admitted that they would not have voted for the death penalty under any circumstances. The instant court found that certain comments made by the prosecutor did not constitute reversible error, noting that the comments were made during the punishment phase and constituted a permissible plea for strict law enforcement. The instant court rejected defendant's contention that the phrase &quot;depravity of mind&quot; was unconstitutionally vague and found that substantial evidence supported the finding that defendant's actions were vile, horrible, and inhuman.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiffs, more than 90 savings and loans and four individual account holders, sought review of a judgment in favor of defendant Director of Revenue (Missouri) by the Circuit Court of Cole County (Missouri), which determined that Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 148.480 (1978) constitutionally imposed an intangible property tax on savings and loan accounts.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiffs argued that the statute violated Mo. Const. art. X, &sect; 4(b) because it did not base the tax on the entire annual yield of the intangible property, but based it instead only on the taxable portion thereof. The court agreed, noting that the tax applied a fraction that varied from association to association and excluded from the intangible property income of the association income or yield derived from obligations of the United States. The Director argued that &sect; 4(b) did not require that the intangible property tax be levied against 100 percent of the yield any more than it required that real or tangible personal property be taxed on 100 percent of its value. The court rejected that argument as specious, noting that &sect; 4(b) referred to the &quot;value or such percentage of its value as may be fixed by law&quot; of real and tangible personal property but made no such allowance for a percentage of the annual yield from intangible property. Because the second sentence of Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 148.480 was void and unenforceable and the first sentence standing alone was incomplete and incapable of being executed in accordance with the legislative intent, the court struck down the entire section.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the judgment and remanded with directions to the trial court to enter a judgment that reflected the unconstitutionality of the tax.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 455.010 - .085 (Supp. 1980). She also appealed the trial court's dismissal of her petition filed under the Act.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court found that although the wife had an unqualified right to the relief, it did not grant it because it held that the Act was unconstitutional and unenforceable under the Missouri Constitution. The court held that the Act was constitutional. The court found that (1) the orders that pertained to child custody, support, and maintenance were related to the purpose of aiding victims of domestic violence and preventing future incidents of adult abuse; (2) the ex parte order provisions complied with due process requirements because they were a reasonable means to achieve the state's legitimate goal of preventing domestic violence, and they afforded adequate procedural safeguards, prior to and after any deprivation occurred; (3) the Act was not vague because it provided sufficient direction and guidance for the judges to apply it, the protection orders issued only when an immediate and present danger of abuse was found, and a trial court was fully aware of the standards for granting relief and how to apply the Act; and (4) the Act did not violate separation of powers principles because the determination of whether a litigant was entitled to relief was a judicial function.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 545.780 (1978).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A jury convicted defendant of capital murder. The court affirmed his conviction and found that he was not deprived of his right to a speedy trial pursuant to the Act. Although a major part of the delay was the time involved in the pretrial determination of his mental capacity, &sect; 545.780(3)(1)(a) excluded that time from the 180-day trial period. The court rejected his attack on the numerous continuances of the psychiatric hearing, which was based on the ground that the circuit court did not make the findings that were required by &sect; 545.780(3)(5). That section related to continuances of trial settings, but continuances of psychiatric hearings did not require such findings to justify their exclusion. There were delays besides the competency evaluation that pushed the trial date past the 180-day maximum, but defendant did not meet his burden under &sect; 545.780(5) of showing that the failure to bring him to trial within the required time was &quot;occasioned&quot; by the State. The only delay that obviously was attributable to the State was a continuance due to the unavailability of an essential witness, which was an excludable period under &sect; 545.780(3)(2).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On appeal, defendant contended that he had the right to defend himself and to resist an unlawful arrest and that therefore instructions concerning those defenses should have been given.

Stat. &sect; 557.215 (1969) no longer gave an arrestee the right to resist an unlawful arrest by a known police officer, defendant had no such right, and his resistance could not be condoned by reducing the degree of the resulting offense; (2) the trial court properly determined as a matter of law that defendant was not entitled to an instruction on self-defense; (3) the facts as stated in defendant's confessions did not support a finding that excessive force was used; (4) the failure of a strategy knowingly and voluntarily pursued by defendant did not entitle him to another try under the guise of ineffective assistance of counsel; (5) the indictment sufficiently stated the elements of capital murder under Mo.

Defendant appealed, contending that the evidence was insufficient to support the conviction, that his motions to suppress and for a new trial were improperly denied, and that &sect; 571.115 was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

In affirming defendant's conviction, the court ruled that: (1) the evidence, that defendant could easily place the gun under seat while sitting in the seat, permitted the inference that he could reach the gun while driving and that it was thus within his easy reach and convenient control, and thus was sufficient to support the conviction; (2) the stop of and subsequent search of defendant's truck were lawful and thus defendant's motion to suppress the gun was properly denied; (3) no manifest injustice occurred from the prosecutor's statements, in closing argument, that the gun was an &quot;illegal type of weapon,&quot; that the gun was between defendant's feet, and requesting that the jury place defendant &quot;back&quot; in prison; and (4) based upon a prior decision, &sect; 571.115 was not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

Affirming the conviction, the court ruled (1) that the instructions were properly composed and correctly stated the law that the required mental state for aider liability was the purpose to promote the commission of the offense; (2) that the record supported the trial court's finding that defendant voluntarily gave a tape recorded statement and that the statement was not made in return for an implied promise that defendant would be released; and (3) that the trial court's use of Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 546.180 (1980), which was in effect at the time of trial and afforded defendant a lesser number of peremptory challenges than the statute in effect at the time the offense occurred, did not violate his right to a jury trial under U.S. Const. amend.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner filed a Mo. R. Crim. P. 27.26 motion, which alleged that he was denied effective assistance of trial counsel and requested appointment of counsel on his motion. The Circuit Court of the City of St. Louis (Missouri) denied the request for counsel and denied the Rule 27.26 motion. Petitioner appealed and filed a mandamus action, which sought an order directing the trial court to appoint counsel for the Rule 27.26 motion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The issue could be adequately decided on the appeal, and the court dismissed the petition for writ of mandamus. The sole issue was whether the trial court should have appointed counsel for petitioner on his Mo. R. Crim. P. 27.26 motion. The State argued that Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 600.071 prohibited the appointment of counsel unless constitutionally required. The court held that Mo. Rev. Stat. ch. 600 was concerned primarily with payment to appointed counsel and not the appointment of counsel as such. The question of the legislature's authority to prohibit the judicial branch of government from requiring the appointment of private counsel for Rule 27.26 movants, where the judicial branch deemed it necessary to efficient court proceedings, did not need to be reached because &sect; 600.071 neither prohibited the appointment of, nor payment to appointed counsel, in Mo. R. Crim. P. 27.26 proceedings. The only subsection, which contained any prohibition of appointed counsel, was Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 600.071(4), which only spoke of parole revocation proceedings. That matter was not involved in this case. Accordingly, the State was required to appoint counsel for petitioner.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was convicted of violating Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 571.115. Defendant asserted that &sect; 571.115 violated the equal protection clause of the Federal and State Constitutions because &sect; 571.115 provided an exception to persons traveling in a continuous journey peaceably through the state. Defendant also contended that &sect; 571.115 was unconstitutionally vague. The court affirmed defendant's conviction. The court held that the classification of travelers for the purpose of granting the exemption had a rational basis because the legislature recognized that the evil sought to be remedied did not require the application of the prohibitory provisions to travelers and recognized that travelers needed extra protection because they were not among neighbors and acquaintances. The court concluded that the exemption was a matter of a legitimate state interest and the classification was not irrelevant to the legislative objective. Finally, the court concluded that the term &quot;continuous journey through the state&quot; as used in &sect; 571.115 was clear and provided adequate notice.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. &sect; 144.190 (1969) was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The company erroneously computed and paid sales taxes to the state department of revenue. The company applied for a refund or credit of such erroneous payment, and the department denied this application on the basis that the one-year limitation for refund or credit found in Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 144.190 (1969) had expired prior to the filing of the claim. The company appealed this decision to the commission, arguing that in view of the fact that a claimant for refund of an erroneously paid use tax would have, under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 136.035 (1969), two years in which to file a claim for a refund, the one-year limitation applicable to sales tax claimants unreasonably and arbitrarily discriminated against such claimants. The commission affirmed the director of revenue's decision, and the company filed an action seeking review of this determination. The court held that the one-year limitation applicable to sales tax claimants found in Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 144.190, before its amendment making it applicable to both sales and use taxes, did not evidence a constitutional infirmity. The sales and use tax laws were not required to operate uniformly, as both taxes arose out of different incidents.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After a turbulent relationship, defendant's paramour took their two children and married another man. Defendant harassed the entire family, including the second husband's father who lived there, using threatening telephone calls and sniper shots. The second husband was shot in the back and the father's face and hands were burned when a firebomb was thrown through his bedroom window. Defendant tried to abandon a long box containing a rifle with a homemade silencer after being stopped by police, so he had no legitimate expectation of privacy in the box. The court found that charging both arson in the first degree and assault in the first degree was not double jeopardy because each required proof of a fact that the other did not, so the test for lesser-included offenses failed. The court noted that ample evidence showed that defendant's actions were the result of a single, continuing motive of revenge by harassment for the loss of his paramour and children, and because the evidence was not complex, the acts occurred at different times, and the jury could distinguish the law and evidence applicable to each offense, the court saw no abuse of discretion in refusing to sever the offenses.</SPAN></P>

The instant court found that the sheriff did not.

Rev. Stat. &sect; 566.030 (1978). Defendant contended that the rape shield statute,&nbsp;Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 491.015 (1978), was unconstitutionally used to bar testimony.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant contended that the jury should have heard the victim's former boyfriend testify that the victim once said, &quot;Oh, please don't rape me,&quot; and that the victim had been raped at age 10. The court was able to resolve the questions without considering whether &sect; 491.105 was constitutional. The boyfriend's statement was facially irrelevant and clearly inadmissible. It was argued that the victim's rape at age 10 was relevant to the defense claim of her vindictiveness and resultant motive to fabricate a rape charge. The court held that it was fatal to defendant's contention that no other attempt was made to show the relevance of the alleged incident occurring years prior to his offense. The trial court properly ruled that the proposed evidence fell beyond the permissible range of interrogation. Defendant also contended the trial court erred in failing to instruct, on its own motion, as to sexual abuse in the third degree, as found in Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 566.120 (1978), contending it was a necessarily lesser included offense of rape. The court held that sexual abuse in the third degree was not a lesser included offense of rape because intent was not an element of rape.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the robbery conviction because it found no merit to appellant's claim that Mo. Rev.

The court found defendant was not denied due process or equal protection of law when the trial court refused to instruct the jury as to the Disability of the Mind test. The lower court did not err in not suppressing a statement made by him that he admitted the picture taken by the surveillance camera was of him. The court found the admission of line up identification testimony was not error because it was not unduly suggestive or conducive to irreparable misidentification.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued that the Circuit Court unduly restricted his voir dire examination of the jurors by refusing to allow him to inquire on whether they would consider his coercion defense. The court distinguished precedent relied on by defendant because he failed to assure the Circuit Court that he would not refer to facts he intended to prove. The court held that the Circuit Court did not abuse its discretion by refusing to permit the questioning. Defendant argued that the prosecution sought by inflammatory appeals to arouse personal hostility and fear of him. The court found that the prosecution's appeal to the jury to do justice was not inflammatory; therefore, the Circuit Court did not abuse its discretion in overruling defendant's objection. Defendant argued that the Circuit Court erred in giving accomplice instructions to the jury because there was no evidence that defendant was associated with another man at the time of the murder. The court found that there was sufficient evidence that the two men cooperated with each other during the incident. Further, there was no evidence that defendant was under the domination of the other man. Therefore, the convictions were affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The victim obtained a tap on her phone following repeated calls from defendant proposing prostitution. The court concluded that the terms, purpose, frighten, and disturb, used in &sect; 565.909 were words of common usage and definition and a person of ordinary intelligence would know by reading the statute that if he acted with the purpose of upsetting another, he subjected himself to criminal liability. An actor did not have to guess or speculate whether or not his intentional act would adversely affect another. Accordingly, there was no vagueness in this portion of the statute. Similarly, the court found that the phrase, coarse language offensive to one of average sensibility, was sufficiently definite to give notice of the proscribed conduct. As the statute applied only to protect the privacy of persons within their own homes, the statute was not overbroad and did not deny due process upon the possibility that its application might otherwise be applied to protected speech. The record suggested nothing to indicate that the jury instructions deprived defendant of a lesser punishment as the jury assessed his punishment at the maximum allowed, or one year's confinement.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Division alleged that the employees received overpayments of unemployment compensation benefits and sought to recover the overpayments pursuant to Mo.

The court reversed the judgment. The court held that resolution of the suggested constitutional questions was not necessary to the decision of this case because the Missouri Employment Security Law, Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 288.340(11), 288.160(2) and 288.170(1), as applied to the employee resulted in a denial of due process under U.S. Const., amend. XIV, &sect; 1, and Mo. Const., art. I, &sect; 10. The court stated that the Division was aware that the employees had not received notice of the determination of overpaid benefits because the certified mail was returned undelivered and no attempt was made to personally serve the employees. The court also stated that the subsequent notice sent by regular mail did not comply with &sect; 288.160(2) and was ineffective.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted and sentenced by a jury, and he appealed. The court affirmed, holding that: (1) review of the questions and answers exchanged between the State and five veniremembers excused for cause who expressed opposition to the imposition of the death penalty indicated that each made it &quot;unmistakably clear&quot; that they would not impose the death penalty under any circumstances and thus, their exclusion from the jury did not violate defendant's rights under the Sixth or the Fourteenth Amendments; (2) there was no evidence to establish a prima facie violation of the fair-cross section jury requirement as those chosen to be jurors in no way indicated that they were biased for the State or against defendant; (3) the stipulation regarding a prior victim's rape charge against defendant was admissible as it was necessary to establish defendant's motive and to corroborate accomplice testimony in the case; and (4) independent evidence of a suppressed mattress cover supported the State's cross-examination of defendant on the matter.

Rev. Stat. &sect; 195.145 (1978), after it was used to transport heroin. The constitutionality of the statute was questioned. The trial court had overruled a motion in limine to suppress evidence and found the vehicle a public nuisance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The police officer saw the vehicle slow and reach the intersection. A man jumped from the car and yelled to the officer for help, stating that someone in the vehicle had a gun. The officer pursued the vehicle. Two plastic bags filled with brown powder, which was found to be heroin, were affixed to metal inside the dashboard with magnets. Part of a .22 caliber revolver protruded from a nearby heating vent. The court concluded that the officer had probable cause because the man called on him to take action, and the officer was not required to verify the man's credibility before acting. The court opined that when no weapon was found in a pat-down search, the man's claim regarding a gun reasonably led the officer to conclude that the weapon was somewhere in the vehicle and, when it was not in open view, that it was concealed in the vehicle; therefore the vehicle's contents offended against the law according to Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 195.145 (1978). The court observed that a post-seizure judicial hearing satisfied due process requirements. The court found that the absence of any specified time for bringing the forfeiture action did not render the statute facially unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the trial court's judgment, which ordered forfeiture of the owner's vehicle after it was used to transport heroin.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">This was the consolidation of three appeals. Appellant corporations sought review of judgments of the Circuit Courts of St. Louis County, Marion County, and the City of St. Louis (Missouri), which sustained respondent Collector of Revenue's motion to dismiss the corporations' action to recovery merchants' and manufacturers' license taxes for 1979 after paying those taxes under protest.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The taxes paid by two of the companies were assessed pursuant to Chapter 150 of the Missouri statutes. The taxes paid by the other company additionally involved Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 92.040, 92.041 - 92.047. In the actions by the first two companies, the trial courts sustained the Collectors' motions to dismiss. In the case of the third company, the circuit court ruled that the statutory scheme for the taxation of merchants and manufacturers did not violate Mo. Const. art. X, &sect; 3, 4(a), or 6 and entered judgment for the Collector. The court affirmed. The court stated that letters of protest had to strictly comply with the statute,&nbsp;Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 139.031, which one of the companies did not. The court held that the different treatment prescribed for merchants and manufacturers with respect to time of assessment under &sect; 150.040 and &sect; 150.310 resulted in no difference in taxation, but only in the method of assessment of the tax. The differing identification procedures of &sect; 150.040 and &sect; 150.310 thus did not violate the uniformity clause of Mo. Const. art. X, &sect; 3. The court also held that the other provisions did not violate the state's constitution.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The employee worked for the employer as a fast food restaurant manager. When a prospective franchisee inspected the employee's restaurant and noted its sanitation problems, the employee told the franchisee that the employer artificially limited the overhead expenses to increase the profit margin, and the restricted labor costs caused the sanitation problems. The franchisee complained about the employer's practices, and the employer granted the employee extra help to improve the restaurant. Once the improvements were made, the extra help was stopped, and the problems recurred. The employee was transferred, then terminated. The employee requested a service letter under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 290.140, which stated that the employee caused low morale that caused a decline in profits. The employee filed an action alleging the employer illegally lied in the service letter. The trial court awarded the employee damages, and the employer sought review. The court found that &sect; 290.140 was not unconstitutional and did not infringe on the employer's free speech rights and that the employer was not permitted to lie in the service letter.</SPAN></P>

The claims were made before the effective date of Mo. Rev.

In a separate proceeding, the court declared this chapter unconstitutional because it imposed a procedure as a precondition to access to the courts, in violation of Mo. Const. art. I, &sect; 14. The court ordered the statute of limitations tolled as to those claims submitted to the board after the effective date of the chapter. In all three of the claimants' cases, the health care providers filed motions to dismiss the claims, raising as a bar the two-year statute of limitations contained in Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 516.105 (1976) barred the actions. On denial of the motions, the health care providers obtained preliminary writs of prohibition. The actions were transferred to the court.

The court noted that at no place in either the Missouri Constitution or in the implementing statutes was any court granted the power to enjoin an amendment from being placed on the ballot upon the ground that it would be unconstitutional if passed and adopted by the voters. The court concluded that there was substantial compliance with the provisions of the constitution and the implementing statutes in the placing of the amendment on the ballot where it was approved by the people and, thereby, became a validly adopted amendment to the Constitution of Missouri.</SPAN></P>

Appellant telephone company filed a third-party petition seeking a declaration that it possessed a public easement. The Circuit Court of the City of St. Louis (Missouri) entered a partial summary judgment declaring Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 392.080 (1974) unconstitutional. The telephone company appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The city passed three ordinances purporting to convey to the municipal corporation certain real estate. The telephone company claimed a &quot;real property public easement&quot; in portions of the real estate under &sect; 392.080 and refused to relocate its underground cables and conduits absent an agreement by the municipal corporation to reimburse it for all costs incurred. On appeal the ultimate question was whether the trial court correctly concluded that &sect; 392.080 was unconstitutional. The court held that: (1) the city was a &quot;person&quot; for purposes of Mo. R. Civ. P. 87.05, and thus it could seek a declaration as to the constitutionality of &sect; 392.080; (2) the 1974 amendment to &sect; 392.080 was unconstitutional on the ground that it was retrospective in its operation because it purported to convert a &quot;permissive use&quot; of a public street easement into a &quot;real property public easement&quot; and had the effect of changing the telephone company's interest in the city's streets and alleys; and (3) the 1974 amendment violated the ban on local or special laws found in Mo. Const. art. III, &sect; 40(28) because it did not include and benefit all companies which distributed their services beneath the public ways.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the imposition of defendant's extended term did not involve making new findings of fact because it had been determined at the trial that defendant acted in a violent manner under Mo.

The trooper issued defendant a traffic ticket. On the date set for the hearing, a continuance was granted at the request of defendant. The next day, defendant filed an application in a magistrate court for a change of venue and change of judge. That motion was overruled. Defendant later filed a motion to disqualify the associate circuit judge, and that motion was sustained. Another associate circuit judge was appointed to hear the case. The case was subsequently heard, and defendant was found guilty and was assessed a fine of $ 25. Defendant filed a motion for trial de novo and affidavit of qualification. The case was transferred, another trial was held, and defendant was found guilty and was assessed a fine of $ 35. Defendant contended that Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 304.009 was unconstitutional. Defendant raised his constitutional objections for the first time at the de novo appeal.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The daughter claimed that she was a child of the deceased born out of wedlock and that the deceased had recognized her as his child during her lifetime. The daughter sought to inherit from the deceased's estate and filed a petition for determination of heirship. The administratrix filed a motion to dismiss, which the probate court granted on the ground that the petition did not state claim upon which relief could be granted. On appeal to the trial court, the daughter raised for the first time the argument that the statute precluding inheritance by an illegitimate child, Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 474.060, was unconstitutional. The trial court refused to consider the constitutional question and denied the daughter relief. The daughter filed an appeal, which the court dismissed. The issue on appeal was the timeliness of the daughter's constitutional attack on &sect; 474.060. The court held that the trial court properly refused to consider the issue because it had not been properly raised with the probate court. The daughter could not raise the issue for the first time on appeal to the trial court. The court concluded that this was not a case in which the daughter's failure could be excused.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The attorney general initiated an investigation of the owner's practices with regard to the advertisement and sale of franchises for the vending of hot foods and drinks. Pursuant to &sect; 407.040 the attorney general issues a CID with a statement that the material requested was to be delivered to an office of the attorney general. The owner failed to respond, and the attorney general filed a petition with the trial court for an order of enforcement. The trial court granted the petition, and the owner challenged the decision. The appeal was transferred to the court from the appellate division, and the court affirmed. The statute in question was not unconstitutional because the appellate procedure called for was repugnant to the limited jurisdiction of the court. The appellate procedure had become obsolete by constitutional change but the provisions of the statute were severable. The owner failed to make an effort to modify or set aside the demand and thus waived any discrepancies in the statute regarding the place for production of the requested documents. Finally, no due process or other constitutional protections were violated by the statute.</SPAN></P>

Defendant appealed his conviction and sentence, contending insufficient evidence supported the verdict against him and that the robbery instruction was erroneous because it submitted taking by putting the victim in fear of immediate injury whereas the information charged taking by force and violence to the person of the victim. The court found that the victim's testimony that his billfold was surrendered because of fear and physical attack and the fear of immediate injury was sufficient evidence to support defendant's conviction. Six men had been involved in the incident. Four of the men took the victim to the local deputy sheriff. Defendant and his brother were the two participants in the incident who left. Defendant was identified as the person who took the wallet from and kicked the victim. The court found no reversible error in the sheriff's selection of jury venire panelists where there was no showing of bias or prejudice to defendant.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The subsidiaries, owners of towboats and barges, apportioned their rental income on the basis of one-half of the total transportation fees charged by the operating lessee corporations for trips originating and ending in Missouri. The department of revenue rejected their allocation of income and declared that they were to be taxed on 100 percent of their lease income as constituting income from sources within Missouri. On appeal, the subsidiaries claimed, inter alia, that the Commission's decision did violence to the intent and purpose of Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 143.040 (1969) and Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 143.451 (Supp. 1973) in that it sought to tax that portion of rental income having its source entirely outside the state of Missouri. The court reversed and set aside the judgment, holding that the right of a taxpayer to allocate and apportion its income was determined under the Multistate Tax Compact by whether it had income from business activity that was taxable both within and without the state. The court remanded the action so the subsidiaries could have an opportunity to show whether other states had jurisdiction to subject them to taxes on the income in question.</SPAN></P>

The taxpayer filed a quo warranto petition challenging the constitutionality of the Act and the legality of the development proposed by the Authority. On review, the court held that the Act, by authorizing the issuance of revenue bonds, was not invalid for allowing public funds to be used in aid of private corporations. The court found that the improved economic conditions resulting from the development of the port would directly benefit the public and that, therefore, the Act served a proper public purpose. The court noted that any aid to private corporations was merely incidental to the public purpose. The legislature did not exceed its power by authorizing the Authority to exercise the right of eminent domain in relation to the proposed development. The legislature was authorized to exercise the power of eminent domain or to delegate that power to the Authority as it deemed necessary.</SPAN></P>

Defendant had been convicted of first-degree murder in violation of Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 559.010 (1959) and assault with intent to kill with malice in violations of Mo. Rev.

The court held that Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 211.071 was constitutionally valid because it did provide a standard as to whether a juvenile was not a proper subject to be dealt with under the provisions of the juvenile code. Further, no evidentiary hearing was necessary on whether his plea was knowing, intelligent, and voluntary because the record showed that the trial court informed him of his rights and the consequences of his plea. In addition, the court held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying defendant credit for the time he spent in jail prior to his sentencing. There was no record that defendant requested bail, and due to the nature of the crimes, defendant probably would not have received bail. Finally, the trial court did not err by dismissing his petition to have jail time credit without first appointing counsel because defendant did not plead facts, only conclusions.</SPAN></P>

However, the lover testified against defendant at her trial, and the trial court entered a judgment that convicted defendant of capital murder. The court affirmed the judgment of conviction, and held that it was not error for the State, in anticipation and by way of explanation, on direct examination, to disclose the plea bargain entered into with the lover. The court determined that defendant failed to meet her burden to establish that the legislatively prescribed punishment in &sect; 565.008.1 was unconstitutional. Defendant was not entitled to the individualized consideration in U.S. Const. amend. VIII because the death penalty was not imposed in her case.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The retailer challenged the constitutionality of &sect; 578.110 because it treated different areas differently with regard to procedures for becoming exempt from Missouri's Sunday sales or &quot;Blue Law,&quot; Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 578.100, 578.105. The trial court denied declaratory and injunctive relief, finding &sect; 578.110 to be constitutional. Reversing, the court held that &sect; 578.110 violated Mo. Const. art. VI, &sect; 8, because it did not apply uniformly to all counties of the same class. The court found that the St. Louis area was improperly treated differently from the only other first class county not covered by special legislation.

The man was shot by all four men, gasoline was poured on him, and the gasoline was ignited. Defendant was charged with capital murder. A jury found defendant guilty and he appealed. Defendant contended that the statement which he gave to officers following his arrest was involuntary and that his motion to suppress his statements should have been sustained. The court found the conclusion of the trial judge that defendant's statements to the special agent and the trooper were voluntary was fully supported by the evidence. The state's evidence showed that defendant was informed of his constitutional rights, that he was capable of understanding those rights, and that no physical force, threats, promises, or coercive tactics were used to obtain the statements. The trial court properly found that defendant's arrest was valid because there was an outstanding warrant for his arrest for escape from jail.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The building department issued an order to the homeowners to repair a dwelling house owned by them so that it would not constitute a public nuisance under city ordinance. When repairs were not undertaken to the satisfaction of the building department, the homeowners were notified that the building department intended to demolish the structure. The homeowners filed an action to enjoin this remedy. The trial court issued a temporary injunction, but upon the building department's motion to dismiss, treated as motion for summary judgment, the trial court found against the homeowners, dissolved the temporary injunction, and dismissed the petition. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment of the trial court. The court found that the finding by the building department, that repairs could not be made or that the cost of repairs equaled or exceeded 50 percent of the value of the building, was sufficient. The court also found that the trial court attempted to avoid the harsh remedy of demolition by allowing the homeowners to demonstrate a good faith effort to place the property in good repair. However, the homeowners simply failed to cooperate.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">At issue was the admissibility of defendant's confession and the constitution of the jury. The court noted that defendant failed to move for a new trial. Therefore, his contentions could only be considered if there was plain error that affected substantial rights from which manifest injustice or miscarriage of justice resulted. Contrary to defendant's contention, the court noted that defendant requested the police interview, he was informed of his rights twice during the statement, he signed a written statement waiving those rights including right to presence of counsel, he was not subjected to any physical or mental coercion or abused in any way, and that he willingly gave the same statement twice. While defendant argued that eight of the 12 jurors should have been excluded because the had some prior knowledge of the case or they had discussed the case with family members, the court held that defendant failed to demonstrate any bias on the part of the jurors. To invalidate a jury verdict on the reasoning that the jury was improperly impaneled, defendant had to show unconstitutional discrimination that arose out of systematic exclusion. Failing to do so, the argument lacked merit.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant county collector challenged an order of the Circuit Court of St. Louis County (Missouri), which held that the State's manufacturers' license tax statute was unconstitutional under Mo.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The circuit court reasoned that the State's manufacturers' license tax was unconstitutional and held in the taxpayers' action for a recovery from the collector that they were entitled to a tax refund. The court reversed that judgment on appeal and remanded the action with directions to transfer the impounded taxes to the appropriate agencies. The court concluded that the proceedings during the convention in which Mo. Const. art. X, &sect; 4(a) was adopted clearly showed that it was a grant of additional authority to classify property for tax purposes rather than a limit on preexisting taxing authority. The court also held that the classification of property under art. X, &sect; 4(a) meant putting property of a certain nature into one class or subclass and other property into a different class or subclass and then taxing them differently. The court further reasoned that Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 150.310, 150.320 did not unconstitutionally subclassify personal property based on the owners' nature and business because the taxpayers' enumerated tangible personal property was not taxed at different rates or on the basis of different percentages of value than other owners' tangible personal property.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The criminal defendant was charged with capital murder, kidnapping, armed criminal action, burglary first degree, and two counts of flourishing a deadly weapon. The State sought the death penalty, but the jury directed that defendant be sentenced to life imprisonment. The trial court granted defendant's motion for retrial. The State filed its motion to again seek the death penalty. The judge refused to allow the State to seek the death penalty. The judge argued that because the jury in the first trial convicted the criminal defendant of capital murder but sentenced him to life, the State was constitutionally precluded from continuing to seek the death penalty. The court determined that nothing in the federal constitutional guarantee against double jeopardy prevented the State from seeking the death penalty on the criminal defendant's retrial for capital murder. The court found that the due process clause was not violated by all possibilities of increased punishment upon retrial, but only by those that posed a realistic likelihood of vindictiveness. The court further found that Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 565.014.3(3) did not prohibit the State from seeking the death penalty on retrial.</SPAN></P>

Police Manual R. 9, &sect; 9.037.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The officer was suspended without pay for the physical abuse of a prisoner , 75-year-old man. Because the rule from the police manual was not offered or introduced at the administrative hearing, the appellate court held that substantial and competent evidence was not introduced at the administrative hearing and the trial court properly reversed the board's decision. While a court could not take administrative notice of the board's own rules, the board could take &quot;official notice&quot; of its own rules, pursuant to Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 536.070(6). Contrary to the police officer's contention, the court held there was sufficient evidence to support a finding that the police officer violated the rule. While the police officer argued the rule was vague and indefinite, it failed to provide any reasonable standard of enforcement, and did not advise him of what acts were prohibited, the court held otherwise. The police officer alleged that the imposition of the suspension without pay was not authorized by law. The court held that this charge was refuted by Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 84.170.2, which gave the board the ability to forfeit an officer's pay for a violation of the board's rules.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant selected supplies and asked it he could be given 30 days credit in which to pay for them. He was allowed the credit upon his signing of his ticket. Defendant never paid. An action was brought alleging the perpetration of a confidence game, in which he was convicted in the trial court. On appeal, he asserted that the information failed to charge an offense, that the evidence was insufficient, that the prosecution violated his Fifth Amendment rights, and that he was improperly sanctioned. The court found that the information tracked the elements required in the statute. The court also found that the prosecution properly proved his intent to defraud by the introduction of other similar acts by defendant. It was not improper for the prosecutor to comment in closing argument that defendant did not present any evidence because he had no defense. Finally, sanctions were appropriate under Mo. Sup. Ct. R. 25.34 for failing to list defendant's wife as a potential witness because that rule only excluded defendant; the fact that she could not have been compelled to testify due to the marital privilege was immaterial.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The St. Louis District Court of Appeals (Missouri) made absolute its writ which directed respondent circuit judge to dismiss an underlying action against relator company herein, because &quot;venue&quot; did not lie in the county. The judge made an application for the proceeding in prohibition to be transferred to the court. The issue was whether venue lay in St. Louis County.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The company was a Delaware corporation with its principal place of business in Texas. It was registered also in Missouri and did business there. An office was maintained in St. Louis County and there was a statutorily required registered agent in the city of St. Louis. The company was engaged in a barite mining operation and a settling basin, with holding ponds collecting the waste, ruptured causing pollution to surrounding waterways. The state brought an action in nuisance against the company. Service was at the office of the registered agent in St. Louis. The judge overruled the company's motions to dismiss. The main contentions for the writ of prohibition were that the state could not recover damages in common-law nuisance, that Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 204.006 et seq. pre-empted the field of public nuisance, was unconstitutional, and that venue was improper. The court held that there was no preemption of the field of water pollution. A strict construction of Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 204.076.1 did not make the venue provision mandatory. St. Louis County was an approved forum, the judge had jurisdiction over the subject matter and the &quot;person&quot; of the company.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court vested custody of the mother's children with a county welfare department after it found the children to be neglected. The trial court subsequently overruled the mother's motions to set aside the trial court's custody and support orders. The mother sought review of that order and the trial court's order allowing the foster parents, who had been caring for one of the children as foster parents for several years, to intervene in the proceedings. The foster parents intervened because they desired to adopt that child. The court reversed the trial court's order granting the foster parents' motion to intervene in the custody proceeding because they did not have the requisite interest relating to the subject of the action to intervene in the proceeding as required by Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 507.090.1 (1978). However, the court affirmed the order overruling the mother's motions to set aside the custody and support orders because the trial court had jurisdiction under Mo. Rev.

The Division reduced the amount of ADC that the claimant was receiving for herself and the child from the previous marriage after the Division recalculated their eligibility using half of the step-father's income pursuant to Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 453.400. The claimant filed an action against the Division that contended &sect; 453.400 was unconstitutional because it was in conflict with the Social Security Act. The trial court affirmed the Division's reduction of the claimant's benefits. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's decision. The court found that pursuant to 45 C.F.R. &sect; 233.90(a), a statute that created a stepparent duty of support was valid when it created a duty for a stepparent who was legally obligated to support the child under State law of general applicability. The court concluded that the Missouri's stepparent duty of support law is one of general applicability in satisfaction of requirements of the Social Security Act, and not unconstitutional, thus the reduction of the claimant's benefits was proper.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the requisite element of fear was charged in the information and that defendant used a gun as his means of creating use fear. It was not necessary that the means of creating the fear be charged in the information. Furthermore, the trial court did not prevent defense counsel from making a full and complete inquiry into the legal qualifications of the jurors. The trial court's ruling, which prohibited questions seeking what reasonable doubt meant to jurors, conformed with the policy that reasonable doubt could not be defined by the trial court, let alone by a juror. Moreover, a judge could not comment upon the phrase and was forbidden from giving any other instruction than that provided by the Mo. Approved Instructions-Crim. 2d 2.20. Finally, no error on voir dire occurred when the trial court refused to allow defense counsel to question jury panelists on biographical data because such information had already been provided.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The credit union moved for a declaratory judgment against the director seeking to determine whether Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 370.300.1 was violative of Mo.

Judgment was rendered for the director and the credit union appealed. On review the court noted that the legislative history of Mo. Rev.

The court affirmed, holding that the action was covered by Mo. Rev.

Also, the trial court was entitled to punish by imprisonment for contempt the failure of a person to comply with orders for payment of maintenance. Therefore, the judgment was not an imprisonment for debt under Mo. Const. Art. I, &sect; 11. Finally, Mo. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The circuit court ordered the foreclosure of the tax lien on the landowner's parcels that the collector of revenue sought and overruled the landowner's motion to dismiss, which was based on the assertion that the MLRL was facially constitutionally defective because it did not provide for personal service of process on owners of tax delinquent property or for an affidavit that stated that the owner was unavailable.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant successor law firm challenged the judgment of the Circuit Court of Jackson County (Missouri), which awarded to appellant original law firm attorney fees of 25 percent of a recovery by plaintiff employee in a federal employers liability action (FELA), and 40 percent to the successor firm, with 25 percent taken from the successor firm's percentage.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The employee was injured twice while working for a railroad company. The employee hired the original firm to file a claim, but became dissatisfied with its efforts. The employee then hired the successor firm, which had more experience with FELA claims. The successor firm added an additional count for the second accident, claiming a violation under the Safety Appliance Act. The jury found in favor of the employee only as to the second accident. The trial court awarded the original firm 25 percent, to have been taken out of the successor firm's fees. The court reversed the judgment and held that the original firm was not entitled to 25 percent of the employee's award because it had not filed a claim under the Act, upon which the jury found in favor of the employee. There was no contingent fee with the employee as to the second accident, which was where recovery was obtained. The court did award attorney's fees in quantum meruit according to the amount of work done by the original firm because there had been a contingent promise to the employee by the successor firm to have paid the original firm any fees owed to the original firm in return for a 40 percent fee on any recovery.</SPAN></P>

Although reversing the trial court, the Missouri Court of Appeals, Western District, transferred the case to the court on the owners' application. The court considered the case as though on direct appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The owners filed suit for a declaration that annexations by a city, a constitutional charter city, were unreasonable and void. The trial court invalidated the annexations. The city appealed. The owners argued, inter alia, that the Sawyers Act (Act), Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 71.015, impliedly repealed the previously existing legislative discretion of cities to resolve the reasonableness of and necessity for annexation. The court reversed, holding that the Act did not limit the legislative discretion of all cities in the annexation process. Also, there was no denial of equal protection in requiring citizens to institute suit attacking annexation by constitutional charter cities and to proceed with the evidence therein. Further, regardless of which party had brought suit and had the burden of proceeding with the evidence, the standard of review required a deferral to the legislative determination of reasonableness and necessity if the evidence indicated a fairly debatable issue. The court held that substantial evidence showed that the reasonableness of and necessity for the legislative decision by the city to annex the territory was at least fairly debatable. Thus, the annexations were valid.</SPAN></P>

Respondent trial judge indicated his intention to sustain employer's motion to dismiss the petition based on the immunity provided by Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 287.120.1 (1978), and the subcontractor brought a proceeding in prohibition and a preliminary rule in prohibition issued.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The employee's survivor's brought their action against the subcontractor when the employee was killed at a construction site by the explosion of a space heater allegedly due to the subcontractor's negligence. The employee's employer was the contractor. The employer asserted that the subcontractor's third-party petition against it had to be dismissed because the employer's liability under the workmen's compensation law excluded all other liability under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 287.120 (1978). Quashing its preliminary rule in prohibition, the court held that the employer was not liable to the subcontractor for any sums that the subcontractor was liable for to the survivors of the employee in tort. Section 287.120.1 statutorily immunized the employer from common-law liability to the subcontractor. The court also rejected the subcontractor's constitutional challenge. The court adopted the reasoning of the Florida Supreme Court upholding a similar statute, which in turn adopted the reasoning of a federal court regarding a constitutional challenge under federal law. The court held that &sect; 287.120.was not unconstitutional under Mo. Const. art. 1, &sect;&sect; 2, 10, 14 and U.S. Const. amends. 5, 14.</SPAN></P>

Furthermore, defendant argued that the trial court erred in permitting an eyewitness' in-court identification and testimony as to her out-of-court identification; and that the trial court improperly admitted certain evidence seized in violation of defendant's state and federal constitutional rights. Affirming the conviction, the court held that defendant was not twice put in jeopardy for the same offense. Charges of armed criminal action and armed robbery arising from the same incident did not put him twice in jeopardy for the same offense in violation of the U.S. Const. amend. V, and Mo. Const. art.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The engineering corporation had brought this equitable action to enforce its lien, naming as defendants the development corporation, holders of various deeds of trust on the affected real estate and the excavating corporation, which had previously filed a mechanic's lien against the property. In this proceeding, the engineering corporation brought a constitutional challenge to Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 327.401.2 wherein it argued that the statute unconstitutionally discriminated against professional engineering corporations by requiring them to secure a certificate of authority while professional engineering partnerships were not so required. The court held that the constitutional validity of statutes that neither touched on fundamental civil rights nor involved suspect classifications had to be upheld if a rational basis for the legislative classification existed. The court held that the Supreme Court of the United States, applying the rational basis standard, had rejected a similar equal protection challenge to a Missouri statute.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Act established a way for educational and health institutions to obtain funds for improvements or refinance existing indebtedness under terms more favorable than that in the private market. The court held that the Act did not violate the state or federal constitution. Authority was not the State and the credit of the State was not being lent to not-for-profit corporations. Bonds issued by the authority were payable solely from revenues and receipts generated by the sale or lease of the facilities involved, and not from taxation, and thus, the bonds did not constitute a debt or liability of the State or any political subdivision thereof. Moreover, the financing sought by not-for-profit corporations was for public purposes and grants of public money to private entities were permitted by the Act if the grants were for a public purpose, such as the encouragement of higher education. Nor did the Act violate the Equal Protection Clause because the distinction in the Act between not-for-profit and for-profit corporations was not unreasonable because the differences in structure and organization between the two formed a reasonable basis for legislative distinction.</SPAN></P>

The victim was later taken to the sheriff's office where she claimed that defendant raped and sodomized her against her will. Defendant claimed that there was no sodomy and that their sexual activity was consensual. On appeal of his conviction, defendant argued that the trial court erred in sentencing him under the Habitual Criminal Act, Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 556.280 (1969). The court affirmed and held that the allegations in the information were sufficient to invoke the provisions of the act where defendant had been convicted of an offense punishable by imprisonment in the penitentiary. Further, defendant's constitutional challenge to the state sodomy law, Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 563.230 (1969), was not preserved for appeal and failed to show &quot;plain error.&quot; Hence, it was not considered on appeal. Finally, the trial court's admission of testimony regarding a witness's attack by defendant's brother on the night in question did not cause undue prejudice to defendant and was not excludable under the &quot;res inter alios acta&quot; rule as irrelevant evidence of third parties' transactions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The private hospital had determined that the only options available to it for lateral expansion were over a public highway and into an adjacent park. An ordinance was enacted by the city's prior administration that granted the hospital an easement of the air over the highway and allowed for the transfer of the city's fee simple interest in a portion of the park. When the new administration took office, the mayor prohibited the transfer, causing the hospital to file suit. The trial court found in favor of the hospital and the city appealed. On review, the court found that the city did not have the constitutional authority to give title to a public street to a private entity, such as the hospital, pursuant Mo. Rev. Const. art. 1 &sect; 27, and Mo. Rev. Const. art. 6 &sect; 23. Those provisions only allowed the sale of property, not the giving away of the city's interest, as was contemplated here. Further those provisions prohibited the giving away of public property to private entities. Because the city operated under a charter, it had wide latitude concerning its own roads and what it chose to do with them. However, the action proposed was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed and remanded with directions to deny relief to the hospital and to enter judgment for the city.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. &sect; 287.240.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The widower's wife was killed in an accident while working for the employer. The widower made a claim for workmen's compensation death benefits. The Commission denied the widower benefits because no dependency on his wife's wages was shown. The trial court reversed and held that because &sect; 287.240 afforded a conclusive presumption of total dependency to a widow upon her husband's work-related death, it constituted a denial of equal protection to require a widower to prove dependency and to deny that same presumption to a husband whose wife died in a work-related incident. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded. The court held that there was not a sound basis for declaring the statute violated the equal protection clause. The legislature was required to strike a delicate balance in deciding the amounts of compensation it required employers to pay upon injury or death of employees. The widower was not deprived of death benefits upon the compensable death of his wife but was entitled to the same upon proof of dependency. The substantive difference in the economic standing of working men and women justified the advantage that &sect; 287.240(4)(a) administratively gave to a widow.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant bank challenged an order from the Circuit Court of the City of St. Louis (Missouri), which awarded $ 491,892 in actual damages and $ 737,838 in punitive damages to plaintiff class members. The class had alleged that the bank had fraudulently breached its fiduciary relationship to the class members by failing to protect their interests in property for which they had given notes that the bank had purchased.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Class members signed contracts for deeds and installment notes with a company that was developing a lake subdivision. The company sold the notes to the bank before the company ceased operations due to financial difficulties. Mechanics' lienholders then took action to enforce their liens and the property was sold to pay off the liens. Class members, who had for the most part, paid off their notes, were not joined in the action, although the bank was. On appeal of the lower court's finding that the bank had breached its fiduciary relationship to the class, the court ruled that the bank impliedly assumed the obligation of providing good title to the class members or of defending such title, or at the very least of notifying the class members that lien claims had been filed and suits to enforce those claims threatened their interests. Thus, the bank breached its duty when it failed to fulfill these obligations. The court also ruled that the action was proper as a class action and that punitive damages were proper because of the bank's intent to defraud the class. The court found, however, that the lump sum award was improper and that the lower court must specify individual awards.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the judgment of the lower court insofar as it awarded damages to those class members whose lots were exempted from judgment and execution and as to those class members who defaulted on their notes prior to a court hearing. The court found that the facts and conclusions of law as to the other class members were supported by substantial evidence, but vacated the judgment and remanded solely for the entry of individual judgments.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Movant appealed from the judgment of the Circuit Court of Bates County (Missouri), which denied movant's Mo. R. Crim. P. 27.26 motion for post-conviction relief of his convictions for robbery by means of a dangerous and deadly weapon and assault with intent to do great bodily harm with malice aforethought and his consecutive sentences.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After the trial court imposed consecutive sentences of 50 years' imprisonment for movant's robbery conviction and 40 years for his assault conviction, movant sought to vacate his sentence on various grounds. The trial court dismissed the motion and the appellate court affirmed. The court affirmed in part and reversed in part, holding that: (1) the State's failure to deliver the transcript of movant's brother's guilty plea hearing was not a denial of movant's right to a fair trial because the transcript was not favorable to the defense; (2) movant's allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel were without merit because the motion did not point out what substantial information helpful to the defense was missing from trial because of counsel's alleged ineffective assistance; and (3) the trial court's action in dismissing the Mo. R. Crim. P. 27.26 motion was clearly erroneous as to the question of consecutive sentences because the trial judge did not make a record that imposition of consecutive sentences resulted from the judge's exercise of discretion rather than compliance with the mandate of Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 546.480, which had since been declared unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the trial court's judgment denying movant's motion on all grounds except the erroneous imposition of consecutively running sentences. The court reversed the imposition of consecutively running sentences and remanded the cause for the limited purpose of resentencing by the trial court in the exercise of its discretion as to whether the sentences assessed by the jury should have been ordered to run consecutively or concurrently.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Commission on Retirement, Removal and Discipline (Commission) brought a disciplinary proceeding pursuant to Mo. Const. art. 5, &sect; 27, and Sup. Ct. Rules Governing the Mo. Bar and Judiciary 12. The Commission found that respondent, circuit judge, had violated the Supreme Court Rules, the Code of Judicial Conduct, and the statutes of the state of Missouri, and recommended that respondent be removed from office. The court held that respondent be suspended, without pay, for a period of 30 days. The court held that the Commission did not have the power to make an adjudication of discipline which, absent supreme court action, could take effect or be final. The Commission could recommend discipline but it was not effective upon the Commission's recommendation, it was only effective when imposed or adjudicated by the court. The court found that the Commission's order overruling respondent's motion to dismiss was proper. The court concluded that respondent was not guilty of constitutional judicial misconduct sufficiently grave to warrant ouster. The court reasoned that the people of judicial circuit elected respondent, and that the ouster of such an official was a serious matter.</SPAN></P>

The judgment was obtained under the uninsured motorist clause of the insurance contract. The insurance company appealed, and the lower district court affirmed the judgment.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant, the City of Kansas City, Missouri, sought review of a decision of the Circuit Court of Jackson County (Missouri), which entered judgment for defendant company upon agreeing with the company's contention that the city's tax under its occupational license tax ordinance was not uniform as to all merchants in the city and was, therefore, in violation of Mo. Const. art. X, &sect; 3.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The city filed suit against the company to collect alleged occupational license tax deficiencies for certain years. Under the city's occupational license tax ordinance, there was a distinction between the way the tax was arrived at for a new business starting during the year and the way the tax was arrived at for an existing business. The company argued that the tax was not uniform on all merchants in the city and thus violated Mo. Const. art. X, &sect; 3, which provided, in part, that taxes could be levied and collected for public purposes only and shall be uniform upon the same class of subjects within the territorial limits of the authority levying the tax. The trial court entered judgment for the company. On appeal, the court reversed, holding that the ordinance was valid. The sub-classification which the city used was a legitimate exercise of the legislative prerogative in determining how best to raise and collect revenue. The classification was reasonable and rationally designed fairly to capture a percentage of gross receipts as license fees and distinguished between the subclasses of new versus old businesses only to the extent required by the differences between those classes.</SPAN></P>

The court agreed with the taxpayer and affirmed the judgment that &sect; 48.020.2 was unconstitutional.

The circuit court held that Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 249.807 (1969) created an arbitrary and unreasonable voting classification, in violation of the Equal Protection Clauses found in U.S. Const. amend. XIV and Mo. Const. art. I, &sect; 2.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The sewer district attempted to expand its boundaries through annexation of several properties. The property owners objected to the annexation petition, claiming that &sect; 249.807 violated the Equal Protection Clause through the creation of arbitrary and unreasonable voting classifications. The circuit court found in favor of the property owners, holding that permitting only property owners to vote on the annexation, and weighing the votes to reflect assessed valuations, violated equal protection. The court affirmed the judgment on appeal, finding that the section created an arbitrary and unreasonable voting classification in violation of U.S. Const. amend. XIV and Mo. Const. art. I, &sect; 2. The sewer district did not meet the two-part test for application of the limited exception to the one-person, one-vote rule; it did not have sufficiently limited authority and did not disproportionately affect the property owners. Therefore, a compelling state interest, rather than the mere rational basis, was required in order to justify denying the vote to non-property owners. The court found no compelling state interest to justify the disenfranchisement of voters who did not own property.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the judgment. The court also ruled that the decision was prospective, rather than retrospective, in application.</SPAN></P>

The court reasoned that there was no evidence before the Division to support its conclusion that the employee was not accorded an adequate opportunity to demonstrate whether he would be an appropriate candidate for regular employment.

The court held that the trial court did not err in dismissing the second amended petition because there was no constitutional violation of equal protection or federal law. A private individual established the trust with his private funds, appointed a private trustee, and established in his will a procedure by which the recipients were selected. The trustee made the final scholarship decision. Under the will's terms, no public agency or state action was involved. Discrimination on the basis of sex resulted from the settlor's personal predilection.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioners sought release from custody on the basis that &sect; 202.807 was unconstitutional in that the statute was vague and overly broad, its notice requirements were deficient, it neither permitted nor required use of the rules of evidence, it required proof by only a preponderance of the evidence, it did not require that incarceration be in the least restrictive setting appropriate, and it did not require mandatory periodic review hearings. The court dismissed the petitions. The court held that the petitions became moot as a result of petitioners' custody being terminated by their release pursuant to Mo. Rev.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The father filed a petition for writ of prohibition in the intermediate court to prevent the trial court from transferring the guardianship and custody of the son to the State Division of Family Services. The intermediate court issued a writ that prohibited the trial court from making that custodial change. The case was transferred to the court, which made the writ absolute. It held that Mo.

The city assessed a sales tax against the company for .5 percent of its gross revenues, pursuant to &sect;&sect; 92.408(5) (Supp. 1971) and 94.620(5) (Supp. 1973). The trial court affirmed the Department's determination that a sales tax should be assessed against the company. On appeal, the court reversed, holding that the city could not tax that portion of the company's receipts which were directly derived from sales made outside its geographical limits. The court found that a municipal corporation's powers ceased at its municipal boundaries, and that they could not, without a plain delegation of the necessary power from a proper authority, be exercised outside its geographical limits. The court held that &quot;place of business&quot; referred to the place where the trucks were parked, the wares were displayed, the initial orders were taken and filled, payments were made, and the sales were consummated.</SPAN></P>

Const. art. X, &sect; 6, by allowing that authority property would not be exempt from taxation. The court denied the request relief because it determined that: (1) the issuance of revenue bonds by the industrial revenue authority was not a political subdivision subject to the restriction because the authority was a separate corporation; (2) the creation of the industrial development authority was for a public purpose even though private entities may derive benefits from the use of the authority; and (3) the property was not state property that was subject to the requirement that it remain exempt from taxation.</SPAN></P>

Defendant claimed that his convictions were based upon evidence obtained by the police in a warrantless search in violation of his rights under the Fourth Amendment and Mo. Const. Art.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was evasive with his mother-in-law for several days as to the whereabouts of his wife and children. The mother-in-law noticed the smell of decomposing flesh in defendant's home and retreated to a neighbor's home to contact the police. Prior to entering defendant's house, the police determined that defendant had been evasive about his wife's whereabouts and had informed his child's school that he would be absent because of illness. The police entered defendant's home after defendant's father-in-law opened a bedroom window. The bodies of defendant's wife and children were immediately discovered and other incriminating evidence was discovered in other rooms that the police searched. On appeal, the court held that the warrantless search was proper. The court reasoned that there were facts sufficient to justify an objective belief that someone in the home might have required medical attention, an emergency sufficient to justify a warrantless search of the room police entered and the rest of defendant's home. The court also held that the bodies and other evidence that was discovered in the room police first entered was admissible under the plain view doctrine.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant members and officers of the state's tax commission appealed from a declaratory judgment wherein the Circuit Court of Cole County (Missouri) held that Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 150.040, a new statute enacted in 1976 to impose an ad valorem tax on new motor vehicles, was constitutional, and that Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 137.115 was applicable to the valuation established in Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 150.040. Plaintiffs herein involved were automobile dealers.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A duly enacted statute was presumed constitutional unless proven otherwise. The one asserting unconstitutionally need not prove it when it appeared from the statute itself that it transgressed a constitutional provision. Defendants offered no testimony. The statute provided for a set ad valorem tax on every vehicle, regardless of make or model, and without assessment of value. In eliminating assessment and the value factor, the statute violated Mo. Const. art. X, &sect; 4(b), which required that tangible personal property be assessed for property tax purposes after consideration of value. Thus, the act was unconstitutional on the basis of what was clearly apparent from the provisions themselves, without requiring any evidence offered by defendants. The fact that Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 150.040.2, in specifying a valuation based on a percentage of gross receipts, labeled it an inventory valuation for assessment purposes had not altered the real basis on which the tax was determined. The formula was based entirely on gross receipts. If a dealer made no sales, it would owe no tax, even if it owned, possessed or controlled new vehicles. Thus, &sect; 150.040.2 conflicted with Mo. Const. art. X, &sect; 4(b).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judgment was reversed. The cause was remanded to the circuit court with directions to enter judgment in accordance with the views expressed by the court.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A lienor brought an action to establish lien priority pursuant to &sect; 429.270. The subcontractor, who also had filed a lien, filed a cross-claim against the general contractor for the amount due. The trial court found in favor of the subcontractor and held that the subcontractor's lien had priority over the mortgagee's trust deed. The court reversed the judgment and held that: (1) there was substantial evidence to support a finding that the subcontractor timely filed the lien because, although the subcontractor had finished an air conditioning installation project over four months before filing the lien, the last testing and starting of the system was made within the period for filing a lien; (2) to the extent that the mortgagee's deed of trust constituted a purchase money mortgage, it was entitled to priority over the lien because mechanic's liens did not take precedence over a purchase money deed of trust that secured repayment of funds used to purchase land upon which the improvements giving rise to the lien claims were erected; and (3) there was no testimony to have supported a waiver, so the trial court erred in subordinating the mortgagee's deed to the mechanic's lien.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff corporation sought a judgment for the balance due on modular housing units furnished to defendants, a corporation and its trustees, plus a mechanic's lien on the real property on which the housing units were erected. The Circuit Court of Vernon County (Missouri) entered judgment against the trustees and impressed a mechanic's lien on the property. Plaintiff and defendant housing authority appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On the basis that the property had been sold by defendant to the authority, a municipal corporation, and that Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 99.200 precluded enforcement of a mechanics lien against property owned by the authority, the trial court ordered the lien stayed so long as the real estate was owned by the authority. On appeal, the court held that defendant corporation, not the authority, was building the housing units, and it was exercising dominion over the property when plaintiff corporation contracted to furnish the modular housing units. Therefore, plaintiff was an original contractor and its lien statement was timely filed. Mo. Rev. Stat. ch. 429 did not result in property owners being deprived of significant property interests; thus, Chapter 429 did not violate the due process clauses of either U.S. Const. amend. XIV or Mo. Const. art. I, &sect; 10. The authority did not take title to the land and contract itself for erection of the housing; instead, it contracted to purchase a completed housing project. Under such circumstances it received title subject to existing valid mechanic's liens. Likewise, the authority was not entitled to a stay of enforcement of plaintiff's mechanic's lien.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff taxpayers, three regulated utility companies and three railroads, each filed suit against defendant county collector to recover 1973 school taxes paid under protest. Most of the school districts in the county intervened. The Circuit Court of Jefferson County (Missouri) rendered a single monetary judgment in favor of the taxpayers for an amount that was less than the total prayed for. All of the taxpayers appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The parties conceded that the taxing authorities, single-county and multi-county school districts, were required by Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 137.073 (1969) to revise and lower their respective rates of levy as a result of an increase in the assessed valuation of personal property in the county by 10 percent or more from 1972 to 1973. At issue was whether any adjustment was required as a result of a loss or reduction in state aid due to increased valuation. The taxpayers claimed in part that the school districts should wait until the 1974-75 school year and then increase the 1974 levy enough to make up the loss in state aid brought about by the increased valuation in 1973. The court upheld the trial court's judgment. The court held that the taxpayers' suggested approach was not contemplated by &sect; 137.073, by which it was understood that there was a loss in state aid and that it was to be added to the amount of taxes that would have been produced from the original tax rate. A new tax rate that would produce essentially the same sum would then be determined and applied. Further, the school districts' expert testimony on school finance was helpful and appropriate.</SPAN></P>

The trucking firms sought refunds for the fees collected.

The Circuit Court denied the Commission's motion to dismiss and rendered judgment in favor of the trucking firms. The Commission appealed. On review, the court reversed and held that the trucking firms chose not to pursue their administrative remedies, but instead sought a refund by means of a declaratory judgment action and that the means of recovering taxes paid by a declaratory judgment action was not provided for by statute. The court held that the trucking firms failed to exhaust administrative remedies before the invalidity of fees could be asserted in judicial tribunal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 476.458 provided that magistrates were required to retire when they reached 70 years of age.

Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 2, 10. At trial, numerous witnesses testified that the magistrate was competent both physically and mentally. The trial court determined that Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 476.458 was unconstitutional because there was no evidence of any relationship between the attainment of the age of 70 and a magistrate's fitness to preside and because the magistrate was physically and mentally competent to perform the duties required. On appeal, the court held that &sect; 476.458 was constitutional. First, the court found that a 1970 amendment to &sect; 467.458 authorized the state legislature to set &quot;other qualifications&quot; for magistrates.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The prosecuting attorney filed a petition for writ of prohibition, asserting that the Missouri Rules of Criminal Procedure granted no authority to the trial judge to vacate or set aside a judgment after a motion for new trial was deemed denied under Mo.

The court denied the trial judge's motion to dismiss and made the preliminary rule absolute. The fact that the trial judge purported to act on the basis of a previous timely motion for new trial did not authorize the action taken. Pursuant to Mo. R. Crim. P. 27.20(b), a motion for new trial not acted upon within 90 days was deemed overruled for all purposes. In such event, the trial judge's authority to act on the motion terminated and there was no authority for him to act thereafter on the motion. Moreover, the court held that because the granting of a new trial was beyond the time given the trial judge for such action, the action was beyond his jurisdiction and prohibition was a proper remedy.</SPAN></P>

After hearing the mother's beliefs on various issues such as blood transfusions and the celebration of various holidays, the trial court awarded custody of the two minor children to the father. The court reversed on appeal. The court held that the trial court's award based on the mother's religion was improper. The trial court was to determine custody in accordance with the best interests of the child after considering various factors under Mo. Rev. Stat. 452.375 (Supp. 1975). The court held that where parents were of different religious persuasions, it could not choose one religion over the other. Inquiry into religious beliefs per se was impermissible, while inquiry into matters of child development as impinged upon by religious convictions was permissible. The evidence showed that the mother was a loving mother, kept herself regularly employed to adequately support the children, and kept them clean, fed, and disciplined. Moreover, she testified that she would teach the children to respect their father. The father, on the other hand, drifted from job to job, threatened the mother with his gun, and offered beer to the four-year old.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On application by the owner, the court transferred the case because the court of appeals incorrectly held that the court's initial transfer order to the court of appeals acted as an adjudication of the owner's constitutional claims. On appeal, the owner argued that even though he received the individual notice from the collector under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 92.760, nevertheless, the other provision of &sect; 92.760 which stated, in part, that the failure to mail the notice did not invalidate the proceedings rendered the act violative of the due process clauses of the United States and Missouri constitutions, requiring a reversal of the judgment. He argued that the constructive notice provisions of Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 92.755 providing for publication of notice were not sufficient where the owner's name and address were known to the taxing authority. The court held that because the owner received appropriate notice his rights were not in any way affected by the alleged unconstitutionality of the statute. He had not been prejudiced by the operation of the statute nor had he alleged or shown any injury due to the provisions of Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 92.760.

Rev. Stat. &sect; 149.051 (Supp. 1975). Defendant asserted numerous errors challenging the constitutionality of the statute, the jury instruction for conviction, the sufficiency of the evidence, and the trial court's denial of his motion to quash a search warrant.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was arrested and convicted of possession of 1,788 cartons of cigarettes for purpose of sale after officers had conducted several surveillances and obtained a warrant for his arrest. On review, defendant challenged the constitutionality of the statute and the associated jury instruction, arguing that the statute did not expressly provide that the sales had to take place in Missouri and, therefore, was an infringement on his right to travel and engage in interstate commerce. The court found that the statutory scheme of Chapter 49 and other definitions in &sect;&sect; 149.015.2 and 149.015.5 provided the intent to prohibit illegal sales of cigarettes in the state. However, the court found error in the jury instruction because it did not contain a reference to sales in the state, which the court determined was a necessary element of the crime. On remand, the court also directed the trial court to consider its holding that the statutory exceptions protecting common carriers and wholesalers should be defined for the jury if the evidence on retrial demonstrated the exceptions as special negative defenses.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The adopted child, who was an adult at the time she sought to examine her adoption records, was adopted at the age of one. The social service agency provided the adopted child certain information contained in her record but denied the adopted child's request to review the entire record. The adopted child argued that the protection of the record violated her First Amendment right to receive information, interfered with her privacy and liberty rights by interfering with her family relationships, and denied her equal protection under the laws. The court rejected the adopted child's constitutional claims and found that state's protection of the adoptive process was necessary and did not rise to the level of an unconstitutional infringement and that it was the exercise of a valid state interest. However, the court found that the trial court improperly interpreted &sect; 451.120 as a blanket prohibition against the disclosure of adoption records. The court remanded the case for the trial court to determine whether there was good cause to open the record, but noted that the birth parents identity should not be disclosed absent a waiver of confidentiality.</SPAN></P>

Defendant subsequently retained counsel and had the benefit of an attorney throughout the proceedings. On appeal, defendant contended that the classification of marijuana in schedule I of Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 195.017 and the consequent punishment of marijuana offenses as set forth in Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 195.200 denied defendant equal protection of the law in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment on the grounds that the classification of marijuana was arbitrary, erroneous, and irrational. Preliminarily, the court held that defendant did not waive his objections to the facial constitutionality of the statute under which he was convicted since, if it were found facially unconstitutional, defendant could not have been legally convicted and incarcerated for its violation. The court determined that marijuana as not improperly classified in schedule I. The court noted that Missouri classified marijuana with other hallucinogens and not as a narcotic. The fact that the sale of marihuana was punished the same as the sale of narcotic substances did not deny defendant equal protection of the law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In a proceeding in mandamus, the court issued an alternative writ on application of relator, the Director of the Missouri Division of Family Services, for an order directed to respondent circuit court judge requiring him to order that all of a mother's support payments be made to the clerk of the court as trustee for the Division, to which the mother assigned her rights to the payments in applying for aid to families with dependent children.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 208.040(2) (1969), as amended by 1977 Mo. Laws 601, &sect; 1, required that, to obtain benefits, the mother was required to assign her court-ordered support payments from a former husband. The judge refused to issue the order required by &sect; 208.040(5) (1969). Despite the fact that the mother was no longer eligible for benefits, the court held that the issue was one capable of repetition, yet evading review, and addressed the merits. The court held that the judge's duty under &sect; 208.040(5) was mandatory, not discretionary. Further, the mother not only had the right to assign her rights to support but, if she wanted benefits, it was her statutory duty to do so. The assignment of rights contemplated vested existing rights in esse, not rights that had not come into being. Such rights included rights to receive support payments which were past due, currently due, or which would become due. Section 208.040(5) was part of the means of enforcement for persons in the mother's situation. The court refused to consider the judge's arguments asserting the mother's constitutional rights. The statutory procedure did not contravene the public policy of the state.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the taxpayer alleged certain violations of the incorporation statutes. However, the court held that the city had attained at least a de facto status as a municipality. The city argued that no appeal was taken from the county court's order incorporating the city; therefore it was res judicata and not susceptible to collateral attack. The court held that the order of the county court in the absence of appeal, was impregnable to collateral assault; therefore, the trial court was without authority or jurisdiction to reverse it.

Rev. Stat. &sect; 535.010 et seq. (1969) and which declared that a certain provision of Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 535.040 (1969) conflicted with Mo. Const. art. 5, &sect; 3.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The attorney general contended that the circuit court erred in ruling that Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 535.040 (1969) contravened Mo. Const. art. 1, &sect; 22(a) insofar as it denied a jury trial to an indigent tenant because, in part, a proceeding brought pursuant to Mo. Rev. Stat. ch. 535 (1969) was unknown at common law; consequently, Mo. Const. art. 1, &sect; 22(a) did not require that a jury trial was afforded a party to such a proceeding. The court reversed the circuit court judgment. In part, the court stated that the civil-jury-trial provision of the constitutions of Missouri had repeatedly been held to apply to courts proceeding according to the course of the common law and not to special courts, such as justice of the peace, magistrate, or probate courts, which did not proceed according to the common law regardless of the type of civil case which may have been involved. Under that system, the jury trial was and remained available in cases filed in magistrate court whenever, and by whatever means, the case reached the circuit court. The court held that Mo. Rev.

The trial court denied the relief, but ruled that most of the Act was unconstitutional as it applied to all public offices, created by the Missouri Constitution, for which minimum qualification was stated. However, it ruled that Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 130.020.5 was constitutional, along with various other sections. The court agreed that the challenged provisions were unconstitutional because they abridged protected First Amendment rights as incorporated by the Fourteenth Amendment. But, the court held that the remainder of the Act was so dependent on the definitions in Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 130.010(4), and they were so intertwined with the remainder, that the remainder of the Act could not stand alone.

At trial he was convicted of shooting into a dwelling. On appeal, defendant argued that the trial court erred in submitting to the jury the crime of shooting into a dwelling and in refusing to submit common assault to the jury. In reversing, the court held that, although an assault could be committed by shooting into a dwelling, an assault did not require shooting into a dwelling, which was not a lesser-included offense of assault. The court further held that it was pointless to consider whether common assault should have been submitted to the jury because defendant was acquitted of assault and, by operation of Mo. Rev.

During voir dire for a second trial on a separate charge of sale of amphetamines, a venireman indicated that she had read about the previous trial but that she had formed no opinion as to guilt or innocence. The trial court overruled defendant's challenge for cause. On appeal of his conviction, the court of appeals affirmed and held that defendant must either have used one of his peremptory challenges to remove the juror or else have exhausted them before he could complain on appeal. On further appeal, the court held that defendant did not waive his right to challenge on appeal the trial court's action in overruling his challenge to the venireman for cause regardless of whether his peremptory challenges were already exhausted or, if not, whether he used a peremptory challenge to dispose of her. However, the court affirmed defendant's conviction because he failed to show that the trial court was in error in overruling his challenge. It did not follow from what the venireman said that she necessarily was not impartial. Defendant's sentence of 30 years was severe, but not cruel and inhuman.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant challenged an order from the Circuit Court of Jackson County (Missouri), which convicted defendant, upon a jury's verdict, of first-degree murder and assault with the intent to kill.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In the course of robbing a post office, defendant shot and killed one person and shot and wounded a second person. Defendant alleged that the trial court erred in failing to quash the jury panel because Mo. Const. art. I, &sect; 22(b) as implemented by Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 494.031(2) (Supp. 1975) systematically excluded women. Defendant also argued that the trial court erroneously joined the murder and assault charges. On appeal, the court held that Mo. Const. art. I, &sect; 22(b) and Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 494.031 were not unconstitutional. The court found that allowing women to request to be excused from sitting on a jury, either petit or grand, prior to being sworn did not systematically exclude women from jury service, but did allow for a facially valid exemption. The court determined that the joinder of the murder and assault charges was not erroneous because the shootings occurred at the same place, in close succession, and in connection with defendant's scheme to rob. The court concluded that Mo. R. Crim. P. 24.04 permitted the joining in one indictment related multiple offenses which could have been charged separately and no substantive rights of defendant were affected by the joinder.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed to the Missouri Court of Appeals, Kansas City district, and raised questions of constitutional construction falling within the exclusive appellate jurisdiction of the supreme court under Mo. Const. art. V, &sect; 3 (1970). Accordingly, the cause was transferred prior to opinion. Five assignments of error were presented: (1) failure to quash the jury panel because Missouri's jury selection process systematically excluded women; (2) erroneous joinder and refusal to sever four felony charges; (3) wrongful denial of defendant's motion for change of venue because pretrial publicity prevented him from receiving a fair trial in Jackson County; (4) improper limitation of defendant's direct examination of an alibi witness; and (5) insufficiency of the evidence to support the verdicts. The court rejected defendant's contentions and affirmed the convictions. The record warranted the trial judge's conclusion that the time lapse between the publicity and the trial was sufficient to insure a fair and impartial trial in Jackson County, and showed that the trial court excluded anyone who appeared other than fair and impartial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On appeal from his conviction, defendant contended that the trial court erred in failing to quash the jury panel; defendant argued that Missouri's jury selection process, as prescribed by Mo. Const. art. I, &sect; 22(b) and Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 494.031(2) (Supp. 1975), systematically excluded women. The court first noted that, although defense counsel indicated during a motion for a new trial that he had moved, before the jury was sworn, to quash the jury, no record of the alleged pretrial motion appeared in the transcript. Therefore, the issue was not preserved for review. The court held that there was no plain error under Mo. Sup. Ct. R. 27.20(c). Mo. Const. art. I, &sect; 22(b) and its implementing statute,&nbsp;Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 494.031(2) (Supp. 1975), which permitted women the option of declining jury service, were facially valid. Furthermore, defendant did not present any evidence to support his contention that the county's jury selection process resulted in criminal venires that were not representative of the community. Defendant presented no proof of the population gender distribution or evidence concerning gender composition of the jury wheel or panels before or following the trial.</SPAN></P>

I, &sect; 22(b), the trial court was authorized to excuse any woman who requested exemption, however, defendant failed to produce any data pertaining to the percentage of women in the community population or any information showing gender distribution of venires for periods before and after the week of trial. The court held that there was no systematic sex-based exclusion. Also, even if the state violated Mo. R. Crim. P. 25.32, the exclusion of the evidence not produced for inspection was a matter for the trial court's discretion. Defendant failed to show any error in discretion or that the failure to produce resulted in fundamental unfairness or prejudice to his substantial rights.

The State did not attempt to present unconnected crimes in the same trial, and joinder of the charges was permissible under Mo. R. Crim. P. 24.04.

The court found that the primary purpose of the project was the redevelopment or renewal of a blighted area of the city, which was legislatively declared a public purpose. The court held that the actions by the city and the authority were in the exercise of a governmental rather than a proprietary function. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment that the electric company failed to state a cause of action because the requirement that the electric company remove its facilities at its expense was not a taking of its property nor denied the electric company due process.</SPAN></P>

In a petition for declaratory judgment, the districts sought a ruling that Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 321.650 through 321.685 (1975) were invalid. The trial court denied relief. On appeal, the districts claimed that these statutes were unconstitutional because they constituted a special or local law where a general law could be made applicable. The court disagreed, holding that the statutes had previously been held to be constitutional. Next, the districts claimed that the statutes were invalid because they had not been passed in accordance with Mo. Const. art. III, &sect; 42, which required publication of notice in each affected locality. The court ruled that these statutes did not constitute a special or local law. Further, the districts claimed that the statutes were ambiguous and vague. The court noted that Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 321.675 and Mo. Rev.

Rev. Stat. &sect; 64.560 (1969) was constitutional and that plaintiff strip mine operators could recover limestone by strip mining. The operators appealed the decision that denied them the right to sell limestone at the site. Defendants, the county and others, appealed the decision that the mining was legal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The case was transferred to the court from the court of appeals and decided as though on direct appeal. The county adopted a zoning plan pursuant to Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 64.510-64.690 (1969). The operators attempted to open a limestone quarry, requesting re-zoning to permit the mining operation. The re-zoning was denied. The operators contended that an open rock quarry could not be prohibited because it was exempted by Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 64.560 (1969). The trial court held that &sect; 64.560 was constitutional and that the county could not prohibit the mining. The trial court also held that while the operators could mine the property, they could not store or sell the products from the site. The court held that &sect; 64.560 was a special law and therefore unconstitutional under the provisions of Mo. Const. art. III, &sect; 40(30). The court noted that the holding disposed of the appeal by defendants from that portion of the judgment that held Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 64.560 constitutional and the appeal of plaintiffs, which sought reversal of that part of the judgment which limited what they would be permitted to do under the exemption contained in &sect; 64.560.</SPAN></P>

VI, &sect; 19, sought review of an order of the Circuit Court of Buchanan County (Missouri), which granted an alternative writ of mandamus to relator plumber. The city also sought a writ of prohibition to prevent the circuit court from enforcing the writ of mandamus. At issue was whether a plumber's license law, Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 341.010 to 341.080 (1969), applied to the city.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The plumber had sought a license from the city's licensing board, but was turned down. His petition sought to compel the city to honor a license he was issued by a statutory class type city. On appeal, the court reversed because Mo. Const. art. VI, &sect; 22, which prohibited the general assembly from creating any municipal office or employment or fixing the powers, duties or compensation thereof for any city framing its own charter under the home rule charter provisions of the constitution, rendered the state's plumbing licensure laws inapplicable to home rule cities. The court examined a number of cases holding that &sect; 22 limited the legislature's power with respect to constitutional charter cities. Although a home rule city was not immune from all legislative action, where a statute attempted to fix the powers, duties, or compensation of a municipal office or employment, such as a licensing board, it could not apply to a home rule city. Further, the plumber failed to make the required showing that he met the established requirements for mandamus when he failed to show why he was entitled to use a license issued somewhere else in the city.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the judgment of the circuit court that granted the plumber's petition for a peremptory writ of mandamus and the quashed the writ. Because the writ of mandamus was quashed, the city's petition for a writ of prohibition was dismissed as moot.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. &sect; 49.010 (1969). Plaintiff voters were residents of the county's eastern district. Defendants, the county court judges and the county clerk, joined the voters in attacking the constitutionality of the statute. Defendants joined with the voters as respondents before the court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The county was divided into 13 townships and two districts, the latter for the purpose of electing the county court. A presiding judge was elected at large, and one associate judge was elected from each district. Roughly two-thirds of the county's population was in one township, and the great majority of that number was in the county seat. The county's population was concededly malapportioned. The voters claimed that eastern district voters were deprived of a vote of substantially equal weight compared to other voters because Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 49.010 barred municipal townships from being split between county districts. The court agreed. The Attorney General argued that it was not necessary to reach the constitutional question because this county, which followed the &quot;township organization&quot; form of government, had no &quot;municipal&quot; townships within the meaning of &sect; 49.010. The court disagreed. The Attorney General also failed to persuade the court that the county court could create Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 47.010 townships in addition to its existing townships, and then erect new townships with boundaries that would better lend themselves to division without violating Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 49.010.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the judgment declaring unconstitutional that portion of the statute that prohibited the division of municipal townships.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant parents sought review of the judgment of the Circuit Court of Pemiscot County (Missouri), which dismissed their petition with prejudice on the ground that it failed to state a claim for relief in the parents' suit against respondent school district contesting the school district's practice of charging fees to public school children.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The parents contended that the school district's policy of charging registration and course fees, plus requiring students to furnish certain supplies in courses offered for academic credit, violated Mo. Const. art. IX, &sect; 1(a), which required that free public schools be maintained for the gratuitous instruction of all children of school age. The trial court dismissed the parents' suit for failure to state a claim for relief. The parents appealed and the court reversed. The court found that the clear meaning of the words used in Mo. Const. art. IX, &sect; 1(a), their relationship to each other and the language of the introductory portion of the section all indicated that charging fees for public education was prohibited. Nothing was suggested to indicate that the framers of the constitutional provision intended the words to mean other than as the court had interpreted them. Accordingly, the court held that Mo. Const. art. IX, &sect; 1(a) prohibited a school district from charging registration fees or fees in courses for which academic credit was given.

On appeal, the court held that the challenged statutes failed to provide a constitutionally acceptable procedure in Missouri for imposition of the death penalty. The court did not believe that the then newly enacted Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 559.011, which dealt with alternative punishment if the death penalty was declared unconstitutional, was violative of Mo.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant homebuyers appealed a judgment of the Circuit Court of Jackson County, Missouri, which determined that a non-judicial foreclosure by plaintiff Federal National Mortgage Association was pursuant to the power of sale clause in a deed of trust and was contractual in nature, entered judgment for plaintiff on its unlawful detainer action, and found for plaintiff on the homebuyers' counterclaim for a declaratory judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The persons who sold the house to the homebuyers had executed a deed of trust to secure the payment of their purchase money note payable to the Federal Housing Commissioner, who then assigned the note and deed of trust to plaintiff. The homebuyers had agreed to assume the note and the conveyance was subject to the deed of trust. Four and a half years later, the homebuyers stopped making payments. After 15 payments were missed, plaintiff brought the unlawful detainer action. On appeal, the court held that under neither the Fourteenth nor the Fifth Amendment was the extrajudicial foreclosure of the homebuyers' deed of trust unconstitutional. The foreclosure was pursuant to power granted by the deed of trust and not pursuant to any power authorized or encouraged by state or federal law. Plaintiff was not a federal instrumentality. Although it had been a government-owned corporation, it was transferred to private ownership with no functions or powers of a governmental nature. The foreclosure was the action of a private individual. But the court modified the judgment to reflect plaintiff's agreement to accept a non-doubled rental payment for the period when no loan payments were made.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner, a prisoner, alleged that certain conditions of his confinement in the Missouri state penitentiary constituted cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the constitutions of the United States and the state of Missouri. The writ was issued and the director of corrections asserted that the petitioner was lawfully in custody under the authority of a judgment and sentence entered in trial court. Petitioner claimed that the condition that rendered his confinement unlawful was that the building in which he was required to sleep was rat-infested and while he was confined he was bitten by a rat. The court found that a prisoner was entitled to utilize habeas corpus to secure relief from inhumane conditions constituting cruel and unusual punishment even though the detention itself was legal. However, the court concluded that the petitioner failed to establish that he was suffering from cruel and unusual punishment. The court found that the evidence did show that he was bitten by a rat, but it had showed that the petitioner was promptly treated in the hospital and the warden had since contracted with an exterminating company for its extermination service on a once-a-month basis.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of stealing handguns from a store and was sentenced to ten years imprisonment as a repeat offender. He appealed on various grounds. The court affirmed the conviction and sentence, holding that manifest injustice or a miscarriage of justice did not result from the receipt of testimony regarding inculpatory statements about the theft where defendant was not given the Miranda warnings because he had been given the warnings four times only two months prior. The trial court did not err in overruling defendant's pretrial motion seeking to limit the State's cross-examination of him on his previous convictions because the State had the right to make such inquiries under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 491.050 (1969). Defendant lacked standing to challenge the constitutionality of a discovery rule where he was not prejudiced by it. Although the trial court relied on the incorrect statute in holding that defendant's sentence would start to run upon completion of his sentence in another state, the error was harmless because the sentence could not start to run until that time anyway.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant intervenors, 15 school districts, appealed from a decision of the Circuit Court of Cass County (Missouri), which held that plaintiff utilities were entitled to a refund of school taxes paid under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 137.073. The statute required defendants, the county treasurer and tax collector, to reduce the rates of levy when the assessed valuation of real property in the county, on which the levy was based, exceeded 10 percent.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The distributable property of utilities was taxed pursuant to Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 151.60 and the revenue allocated to various counties. Each county had an average rate of school levy, based on property tax assessments; but under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 137.073, if the assessments exceeded 10 percent of the prior year's evaluation in one year, the tax rate was to be lowered so that the original estimated tax would result. After one county had a more than 10 percent increase, the utilities paid taxes under protest and named the county treasurer and tax collector as defendants; the school districts intervened. The trial court considered the increase in assessment in one county in applying &sect; 137.073 and reduced the rate. All of the parties appealed. The court focused upon the language and purpose of &sect; 137.073, which prevented a school district from gaining a windfall based on an increase in property taxes. The court reviewed its prior decisions construing the statute, reemphasized its constitutionality, and held that the circuit court should have considered the assessment increases in all of the district counties when it calculated the refund. The court reversed and remanded with instructions.</SPAN></P>

On appeal from her conviction, appellant contended that the ordinance was violative of U.S. Const. amends. V and XIV because it was vague and overbroad. The court noted that her conduct consisted of the uttering of words, that is, speech. The court found no evidence that appellant physically abused anyone prior to the time the police arrested her for &quot;peace disturbance.&quot; The ordinance had been construed to proscribe verbal conduct that tended to incite immediate violence. The court held that abusive and insulting language did not per se constitute a breach of the peace, and thus, the ordinance was neither vague nor overbroad. Nevertheless, the court reversed the conviction because appellant had not been charged with having said or done anything calculated to provoke a breach of the peace.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Movant appealed a decision of the Court of Appeals, St. Louis District (Missouri), which affirmed the trial court's judgment overruling movant's motion under Mo. R. Crim. P. 27.26 for post-conviction relief in which movant challenged the trial court's refusal to allow credit for his time spent in jail prior to sentencing on his convictions for second degree murder and first degree robbery.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Movant made no request for bail and remained in jail until sentencing on his guilty pleas to second degree murder and first degree robbery. The trial court sentenced him to concurrent 12 year sentences on each charge but refused to allow his jail time. Movant then sought post-conviction relief, contending that the provision of Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 546.615 (1959) that allowed the trial judge discretion in calculating prior jail time as part of the sentence imposed violated the equal protection clause in that it discriminated against the poor who could not raise bond. The appellate court affirmed but transferred the matter to the court due to a conflict with another appellate court opinion. The court reviewed the matter as if on original appeal and affirmed, holding that the trial judge likely considered movant's jail time in deciding to accept the State's lenient recommendation of 12 years for three capital offenses. Moreover, movant should have filed an application and a hearing would have been held, although he probably would not have been entitled to it as the State could have shown &quot;evident proof&quot; of guilt of a capital offense under Mo. Const. art. 1, &sect; 20.</SPAN></P>

A writ issued and the court quashed the writ of habeas corpus. It found that the due process clauses of the federal and state constitutions did not require that a notice and hearing be provided prior to the entry of an order extending a term of probation because the loss suffered by the extension of probation was not the continuing restrictions, but the possibility of future revocation, and due process provided for a hearing in the event revocation proceedings subsequently occurred. Further, the order extending the probation term was entered and petitioner advised of it prior to the expiration of the original term; however, petitioner sought no hearing and accepted the continued probation until it appeared that revocation was imminent.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 173.200 to 173.235, was unconstitutional and void because it violated principles of separation of church and state. Plaintiffs, citizens' groups and others, had filed an action challenging the constitutionality of the Program.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The citizens groups claimed that the Missouri Financial Assistance Program violated the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment, Mo. Const. art I, &sect;&sect; 6, 7, Mo. Const. art. III, &sect; 38(a), Mo. Const. art. , &sect; 8, and Mo. Const. art. X, &sect; 3 because it allowed financial aid to be paid to students that attended private religious colleges. The trial court agreed and declared that the Program was unconstitutional and void. On appeal, the court disagreed, holding first that the Program did not violate the First Amendment. The court reasoned that the Program had a secular purpose, its primary effect was the advancement of education and not religion, and implementation of the Program would not have tended to entangle the State excessively in church affairs. The court held that the Program was not void under the more restrictive parameters of the Missouri Constitution because the public purpose of the statute, promoting higher education, overrode any incidental benefit to a private individual or private higher learning institution and that the Program, Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 173.205 conditioned approval of a school in part upon academic freedom and control by an independent board.</SPAN></P>

The attorney general entered the case as an intervenor. The Circuit Court of Jackson County issued the injunction in part and found the statute void.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The attorneys claimed that &sect; 130.035(1)(5) and (1)(6) made an arbitrary and unreasonable difference between the reporting requirements of a candidate who was a sole practitioner and a lawyer who practiced in the form of a professional legal corporation. The reporting requirements were heightened, the attorneys argued, for the sole practitioner. The commission, prosecuting attorney, and intervenor contended the trial court erred in reaching the constitutional question and in declaring &sect; 130.035(1)(5) and (1)(6) unconstitutional, because they were susceptible of construction in harmony with the constitution. Based upon the very narrow factual situation presented, the court found the subsections were not unconstitutional as applied to the attorneys. The attorneys asserted they had standing to attack the subsections under the overbreadth doctrine. The court found that the facts did not give rise to a controversy upon which the stated challenge could be made and found the subsections were applicable to the attorneys.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A city contracted with the redeveloper to redevelop a business district located in the city pursuant to an ordinance that declared the are to be blighted. The ordinance declared that redevelopment of the business district was in the public interest. The ordinance also authorized the redeveloper, through the power of eminent domain, to acquire properties in the business district. The owners and lessees of property located within the business district filed an action for an injunction against a redevelopment project upon the claim that the ordinance was unconstitutional and void. The trial court rendered a judgment in favor of the owners and lessees. The trial court's judgment was reversed and remanded on appeal. Since the city was acting in its legislative capacity when it determined that the area was blighted, judicial review was limited to whether the legislative determination was arbitrary. The court found that the city council's action was not arbitrary. Therefore, the court found that the ordinance and contract were not an unconstitutional delegation of the power of eminent domain as contended below.</SPAN></P>

The city began providing service to residents in that area under the authority of &sect; 250.190, and the utility brought an action to declare the statute unconstitutional and to restrain the city from providing the service. The trial court entered a judgment dismissing the action, and the utility sought review. The court affirmed, holding that Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 250.240 required the liberal construction of the powers granted under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 250.190 (1969). Also, the utility's certificate to engage in water and sewage service did not grant an exclusive right to the utility. Finally, the legislature, by permitting the city to provide the service, did not exceed its power to provide for the health and welfare of the citizens because it was reasonable to consider that the health and welfare of people in areas adjoining a city into which it is extending its water and sewer lines is of some importance to people in the city.</SPAN></P>

The wife was granted judgment for maintenance against the husband, the payments to be made to the circuit clerk. The husband failed to make most of the monthly maintenance payments. A prosecuting attorney filed a motion for contempt under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 452.345. The judge indicated that he would find the husband guilty of contempt and impose a jail sentence, and the husband filed a proceeding in prohibition against the judge. A provisional rule was issued, which the court later discharged. The court held that imprisonment for contempt of the husband who was financially able to pay but failed and refused to comply with the court order would not violate the constitutional prohibition against imprisonment for debt. The court overruled an 1866 state supreme court opinion, which held that alimony was a debt for which imprisonment could not be imposed. The court was influenced by the fact that all of the other states and the District of Columbia had a view contrary to the 1866 opinion, which had never been challenged.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner pled guilty to operating a motor vehicle while intoxicated, third offense, which was a felony under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 564.440. After being incarcerated, petitioner requested a writ of habeas corpus pursuant to Mo. R. Crim. P. 27.26. The court of appeals granted the writ, but later granted the warden's motion to quash the writ. The court of appeals then granted the application of the warden to transfer the case to the court. The court held (1) Rule 27.26 mandated that petitioner seek the relief requested by a motion to vacate in the trial court, (2) Rule 27.26 was not unconstitutional as a suspension of the writ of habeas corpus in violation of Mo. Const. art. I, &sect; 12 because the rule did not affect the petitioner's substantive rights, and (3) petitioner's assertion that Rule 27.26 violated Mo. Const. art. I, &sect; 4 by restricting his right to apply for relief in the nature of habeas corpus in any constitutional court of record in Missouri was not a valid assertion because &sect; 4 did not confer an absolute right to seek remedial writs in any court with jurisdiction, but simply conferred the power on appellate and trial courts to issue and determine such writs.</SPAN></P>

The Director notified the debtors of the application and the debtors filed a declaratory judgment action that sought to declare that &sect; 301.215 was unconstitutional. The court affirmed the circuit court's judgment which found in favor of the Director. Section 301.215, which provided for a creditor to obtain title to repossessed personal property, was constitutional because there was no &quot;state action.&quot; In order to violate the Fourteenth Amendment, state action was required.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 210.320(2) authorized counties to impose a tax on cigarettes. Defendant was a tobacco wholesaler who sold a package of cigarettes with no county tax stamp. The court reversed the circuit court's judgment that convicted defendant of selling cigarettes without the required county tax stamp. Section 210.320 provided that the Director was to promulgate reasonable and necessary regulations for the collection of the cigarette tax and the violation of any such regulation was a misdemeanor which was punishable by law. Defendant was charged with a violation of the Director's regulation which involved the county tax stamp, not the violation of the statute itself. The legislature's delegation of authority to the Director pursuant to &sect; 210.320 violated Mo. Const. art. II, &sect; 1 which provided for the separation of powers.

VI, &sect; 25, appealed a judgment of the Circuit Court of Jackson County (Missouri) in favor of plaintiffs, a retirement system and certain retirees, finding that the retirement system was authorized to make cost-of-living adjustments in pensions paid to police officers who retired prior to the effective date of Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 86.441.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The city and official contended that the adjustments were unconstitutional expenditures. The retirement system and retirees argued that the cost-of-living adjustments did not increase the pensions of those previously retired but only offset inflation and maintained the status quo, and they claimed that funds contributed to the retirement system lost their identity as public funds. The court reversed the judgment and remanded the case with directions. The court stated that assuming that the pensions constituted gratuities, Mo. Const. art. VI, &sect; 25 was applicable and the granting of the adjustments was prohibited by it. The court stated that if the pensions were in fact deferred compensation, then adding to them after retirement constituted &quot;extra&quot; or &quot;add on&quot; compensation and violated Mo. Const. art. III, &sect; 39(3). The court noted that the pensions previously granted and being paid were cast in terms of dollars, not purchasing power. The court held that Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 86.441, insofar as it applied to persons retired before its effective date, was unconstitutional and that payments under it to persons already retired on that date were prohibited.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Relator had a declaratory judgment entered against her and she sought to have it set aside.

Relator appealed the decision, contending that &sect; 517.480(1) was unconstitutional. On review, the court noted that the magistrate had the right to order the judgment set aside under &sect; 517.460, but payment of all costs then accrued was required even though she was a poor person; &sect; 514.360, which allowed the prosecution of suits by poor people with the waiver of costs, only applied to plaintiffs. However, the court agreed with relator's contention that the magistrate did not have the authority to enter the order setting aside the default judgment. The court noted that the magistrate only had the authority to set aside the order if the costs were paid. The court therefore reversed the judgment and remanded with orders to try the case. The court held that it had no reason to rule on the constitutionality of &sect; 517.480(1) because of the decision on the other issues.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The taxpayers were motor vehicle dealers in Missouri and instituted the action in order to require defendants to proceed with the taxation of their motor vehicles and their goods, wares, and merchandise held for use and sale in accordance with the provisions of Mo.

The court held that the 1974 amendment was unconstitutional because no assessed valuation was placed upon the tangible personal property as was required by Mo. Const. art. X. The 1974 amendment to Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 150.010 (1969) provided no method for determining the value of the property for taxation but simply eliminated the value factor altogether from a tax denominated a motor vehicle property tax. This was not permissible under Mo. Const. art. X, &sect; 4(b). The fact that there were gross inequities in the assessment of new and used cars and the stock of goods, wares, and merchandise held for use and sale by motor vehicle dealers under the 1969 version could not be corrected by unconstitutional means.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Relators, officers of the state division of liquor control, brought a proceeding in prohibition to limit the actions of respondent judge, who reviewed a decision of the supervisor of liquor control to deny the renewal of a liquor license. Relators contended that the judge lacked jurisdiction under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 311.700(2) (1969).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The supervisor of liquor control, without conducting a hearing, notified the restaurant that he would not renew its liquor license. The supervisor based his decision on the conviction of the restaurant owner for using the mails to defraud the State of sales tax. Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 311.060 provided that no corporation was qualified for a liquor license unless its managing officer and majority stockholders were persons of good moral character. The judge, over relators' objections, heard oral testimony and subpoenaed relators to appear and testify. The court held that the judge's sole discretion was whether the law authorized the supervisor's decision. A review contemplated by Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 311.700(2) (1969) required the judge to review the record furnished by the supervisor and decide whether the supervisor acted reasonably in exercising his discretion and not arbitrarily or capriciously or in abuse of his sole discretion. The court also held that notice and a hearing were not prerequisites to the exercise of discretionary authority to grant or to deny a liquor license. No property rights attached because an applicant only received the license for a fixed period.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court concluded that the judge lacked jurisdiction to hear and consider evidence in addition to the record certified to the judge by the supervisor of liquor control. The court's preliminary rule in prohibition against taking testimony from relators or other witnesses or considering testimony previously taken from the judge was made absolute.</SPAN></P>

Appellant driver's vehicle was leased from respondent and insured under a fleet policy by respondent carrier.

Appellant driver had been operating the leased vehicle while his license was suspended, in contravention of state law, and in violation of the lease. This violation of the lease made operative a specific provision of the insurance policy that excluded coverage of appellant driver. Remaining appellants, as judgment creditors, were similarly foreclosed in that they stood in the shoes of appellant driver through whom they asserted their claims.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court enjoined appellants from selling and distributing the book under Mo. Rev.

Rev. Stat. &sect; 563.280 (1969). Reversing the trial court's decree, the court reviewed &sect; 563.280 under a reformulated constitutional test for determining obscenity and ruled that it could hold that &sect; 563.280 was not unconstitutionally vague only by construing the statutory words &quot;obscene,&quot; &quot;lewd,&quot; &quot;licentious,&quot; &quot;vulgar,&quot; &quot;scandalous,&quot; and &quot;immoral&quot; as limiting regulated material to representations or descriptions of specific &quot;hard core&quot; sexual conduct. The court required that jurors be involved as triers of fact in obscenity cases to decide the issue of whether the matter was obscene under contemporary community standards.

Const. art III, &sect; 39(9) and Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 563.430 and 563.440 (1969).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The alleged violation was the association's sweepstakes to promote magazine sales. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded. It rejected the association's argument that the federal government had occupied the field of mailability of lottery material and, therefore, had preempted state lottery laws. The court held there was no federal preemption. By delegating to the U.S. Postal Department the power to determine &quot;mailability,&quot; Congress did not repeal state lottery laws. Enforcement of the state's lottery laws was not direct, physical interference with federal activities under the postal power or some direct, immediate burden on the performance of the postal functions. The relief the attorney general sought would not have a proscribed effect on accomplishing the purposes and objectives of the federal power in regulating the mails. The enactment of the federal lottery laws did not show an intent and purpose to preempt state lottery laws. The postal department's ruling that the association's materials did not violate federal lottery laws would not be frustrated by enforcement of the state's lottery laws.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The driver was pulled over for speeding and the police officer noticed that the driver was staggering and smelled of alcohol.

The driver noticed that Miranda included a right to have counsel present and requested that he be allowed to call his attorney. The officer complied, and the driver spoke with his attorney who advised him not to take the test until he could arrive. The officer advised the attorney and the driver that he would not wait for the attorney and that the driver's license would be revoked for one year pursuant to &sect; 564.444 if he refused to take the test. The court held that the officer was correct. The driver did not have a right to have his attorney present or to condition his consent on his counsel's presence. He had only a right to consult with him under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 544.170 (1969) and Mo. R. Crim. P. 37.89 and 21.14. The driver's refusal to take the test without his attorney present was a &quot;refusal&quot; under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 564.444 (1969). There was nothing vague about the word &quot;refusal,&quot; which simply meant not taking the test when asked.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 286.010 (1969) the member was appointed as a member and chairman to the commission by the state governor for a five year term. The state contended that an amendment in 1972 to Mo. Const. art. IV and implementing legislation adopted in 1974 created a new department of labor and industrial relations, but there was no authority in the constitution for the commission members to succeed membership on the new commission and that the implementing legislation was unconstitutional because it conflicted with the governor's appointive power granted in Mo. Const. art. IV, &sect; 12 and 49. The court held that the office of member and chairman of the industrial commission was not abolished by the constitutional amendment or the reorganization act in 1974. There was nothing in &sect; 12 or &sect; 49 that clearly abolished the office of member and chairman of the commission. The court found that the reorganization act continued the functions, duties, and powers of the commission and of those of the office of commissioner and chairman.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In 1909, the City and the railway company entered into a contract under which the railway company agreed to accept financial responsibility for repairs to viaducts over the railway's tracks. Sixty years later, the P.S.C. investigated and discovered that the viaducts were in need of immediate repair to insure public safety. The City argued that under the 1909 contract, the railway company was responsible for the entire cost of repairs. The P.S.C. determined that under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 389.640, the 1909 contract was not applicable and apportioned 90 percent of the total costs to the City and 10 percent to the railway company. The P.S.C. charged the City with 100 percent of some of the individual repair projects on the ground that the railway company would not have benefitted from those repairs. The City sought review, but the trial court affirmed. The City again sought review. The court found that the legislation creating the P.S.C. did not permit it to ignore the 1909 contract and that the railway's financing of the entire repair project would provide as much public safety as if the City had been forced to contribute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Circuit Court of Jackson County (Missouri) that convicted him of two counts of first-degree murder and one count of first-degree robbery and that sentenced him to three separate, consecutive sentences. The trial court cited Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 546.480 in ordering the sentences to be consecutive.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 546.480, when any person was convicted of two or more offenses before sentence was pronounced on him for either offense, the imprisonment to which he was to be sentenced on the second or other subsequent conviction was to be consecutive with the prior conviction. The court ruled that Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 546.480 required unequal treatment for different defendants not based on any legitimate governmental interest. It mandated different treatment of defendants without any reasonable or rational basis for that difference. It was based solely and only on whether or not a defendant was convicted of at least two offenses before he was sentenced on either of them. The court wrote that relevance could not be found when application of a mandatory consecutive sentencing requirement for multiple convictions had no relationship to such things as seriousness of the crimes committed and the circumstances of the crimes, and it depended just on the chronological chance of whether or not there were two convictions without sentences upon sentencing for a crime. The court made a number of other rulings that upheld the validity of the convictions despite the illegal sentencing.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the trial court's judgment and remanded the case for resentencing at which time the trial court was to exercise its judicial discretion with reference to whether the sentences imposed for the convictions were to be concurrent or consecutive.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Movant sought review of an order of the Circuit Court of Phelps County (Missouri), which denied his motion to vacate sentence and set aside his conviction, as provided under Mo. R. Crim. P. 27.26. On application of movant, the court transferred the action following an appeals court's affirmance of the trial court's order, and, under Mo. Const. art. V, &sect; 10, disposed of the case as if on original appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Movant was convicted of passing a bad check and the jury fixed a punishment of two years imprisonment. Through court-appointed counsel, movant was granted leave for additional time to file a motion for a new trial. Before a motion was filed, the trial court granted the attorney's request to withdraw and, before new counsel was appointed, the time for filing the motion had expired. After new counsel was appointed, the trial court imposed sentence and granted probation, with conditions. While on probation, movant filed his motion under Mo. R. Crim. P. 27.26 on grounds that he was denied assistance of counsel during a critical stage of proceedings and was thereby precluded from taking an appeal. The court agreed and remanded the case with directions to allow movant to file a motion for a new trial. First, the court held that movant, although on probation, could invoke the rule because the restraints on his liberty brought him under the definition of &quot;in custody.&quot; Next, the court determined movant was denied a federally-protected right when the trial court permitted the first attorney to withdraw before filing the motion and failed to appoint successor counsel in time.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the trial court's judgment denying movant's motion to vacate his sentence and judgment. The court remanded the case to the trial court with directions to vacate the sentence and judgment and to permit defendant to file a motion for a new trial and for further proceedings appropriate thereto and consistent with the court's opinion.</SPAN></P>

When the mortgagor defaulted on her loan, it was sold at an extrajudicial foreclosure sale. The mortgagee filed an unlawful detainer action and the trial court awarded it possession of the property. The mortgagor appealed, asserting that the sale involved sufficient state action so as to violate her due process rights because she was denied a hearing prior to the foreclosure. The court affirmed the judgment, holding that it found no state action involved in the foreclosure. The court concluded that the foreclosure sale was conducted pursuant to statutory provisions, and the statute did not create a power of sale. The court noted that the extrajudicial foreclosure right was contractual, not statutory, and only permissible if authorized in the deed of trust.</SPAN></P>

The respondent purchased the property at a foreclosure sale.

The court affirmed the judgment. As to the board's contention that the legislature did not intend to include local bodies such as the board under the law, the court held that the legislature's intent in enacting the law was that all meetings of members of public governmental bodies, except those described in Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 610.025, at which the peoples' business was considered had to have been open to the people and not conducted in secrecy. By including in the definition any &quot;agency,&quot; &quot;board,&quot; &quot;bureau,&quot; &quot;commission,&quot; &quot;committee,&quot; &quot;department&quot; and &quot;division,&quot; the legislature recognized some forms of entities through which governmental bodies functioned.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The student, while participating in wrestling practice, was injured when a physical education coach allegedly applied an illegal wrestling hold on him. The trial court dismissed plaintiffs' negligence action against the school district, and the court affirmed. The court held that the common law, adopted in Missouri when it entered the union, provided that an action could not be maintained for negligence against a public entity. This governmental immunity rule was still in effect in Missouri and was applicable to the school district. The court declined to abrogate the sovereign immunity doctrine and agreed with the trial court that the doctrine protected the school district from liability for the student's injuries. Plaintiffs' assertion that the immunity rule deprived them of due process and equal protection of the laws was without merit as persons who seek recovery for negligence from private tortfeasors may be treated differently from those seeking recovery against a governmental entity.</SPAN></P>

The tenant appealed, and the court reversed, holding that a provision which required a dispossessed tenant to post a bond was violative of equal protection and served no rational basis.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The city adopted a plan to construct thruways on local streets to facilitate traffic between arteries and highways. The city followed the procedure for making a change of grade to effect the plan on the property owners' street and informed them that, under Kansas City, Mo., Charter art.

On appeal from the adverse judgment, the city argued that the city had substantially complied with notice provisions and its action was valid. In affirming, the court found that the street improvement offered no benefit to the owners but instead was a detriment. The court did not explicitly hold art. X, &sect; 355 to be unconstitutional but did hold that the improvement, which offered no benefit to the owners and was in fact a detriment, was a taking without due process. In overruling a motion for rehearing, the court made it clear that, while it was too late for any property owners to make a claim for damages for the change of grade unless they had already done so, they could not be required to pay assessments for the project.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant's tenant requested an evaluation of her dwelling after her child test positive for lead poisoning. An inspector found lead-bearing paint on the dwelling's walls, windows, and doors. After several subsequent inspections revealed that defendant had failed to correct the problem, he was cited for a violation of Ordinance 56091. He was found guilty of that offense. On appeal, the court rejected defendant's argument that the ordinance was arbitrary and unreasonable because it did not require either the presence of children or the existence of conditions that could reasonably result in lead being internally consumed. Furthermore, Ordinance 56091 did not delegate legislative authority to the health commissioner because his role was limited to determining how the exposed surfaces should be treated. His inspectors were also permitted to only take samples of peeling or chipping paint. Finally, the court rejected defendant's argument that Ordinance 56091 was unconstitutionally vague. Rather, it clearly made unlawful the failure to remove lead paint, as defined therein, within 14 days after notice was given.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The coroner brought an action to enjoin the board from submitting to the voters of St. Louis a proposal for the establishment of a city medical examiner. The judge expressed his intention to grant the requested relief unless prohibited from doing so. The board filed for a writ of prohibition, which the court granted. The statutory scheme creating the office of city medical examiner at Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 58.700-58.765 (1973) applied to St. Louis. St. Louis had the unique status of being both a city and a county, and the statutory package covered every county in the state. Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 58.760(4) applied to any county &quot;of the first class&quot; composed entirely of a city with a population of more than 600,000. Absent the words &quot;of the first class,&quot; the legislative intent was clearly to specify the city of St. Louis. The court elected to consider the language &quot;of the first class&quot; as surplusage. The statute did not violate Mo. Const. art. 6, &sect; 22 because it covered only cities, and the mayor's activity that was required by the statute involved St. Louis in its capacity as a county, not a city.</SPAN></P>

The officer asked if the employee had any good books with pictures. Defendant got a book, handed it to the officer, and commented that there were good color pictures. The book was encased in a plastic cover through which two nude persons could be seen in a sexually suggestive position. The officer, who was familiar with the book's contents, paid for it and arrested defendant. On review, the court stressed that the book was hardcore obscenity. Defendant contended that the book was improperly admitted because his arrest and seizure of the book were not supported by probable cause. The court held that the issue was not preserved for review because defendant failed to file a motion to suppress the evidence. Also, there could not have been an unlawful seizure of the book because the officer had purchased it. Defendant's motion for judgment on acquittal was properly denied because Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 563.280 was not overly broad and the overbreadth issue was first raised in motion for new trial.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On appeal, the retirement system argued that (1) Mo. Rev.

VI, &sect; 25; and (3) &sect; 169.585 was discriminatory and a violation of the due process clause of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution. Upon review, the court found the retirement system's arguments without merit. Whether the retired employees actually performed services was immaterial because the Missouri Legislature in enacting &sect; 169.585 did not attach any conditions to their right to be compensated for their employment as special school advisors and supervisors. Even if funds held in trust by the retirement system were &quot;public funds,&quot; there was no violation of the constitutional provisions against use of public funds for the benefit of private persons by &sect; 169.585, because it provided for compensation of only those persons employed by the retirement system who performed such services as directed by the retirement system.</SPAN></P>

The school district did not have standing to obtain a review in the action and the trial court ruled properly in dismissing the petition. Although the school district was clearly an interested party, there was no statutory provision for an appeal by the school district. No right of review was encompassed within the language of Mo. Ann. Stat. &sect; 536.150, which in Mo. R. Civ. P. 100.08 enumerated the standing requirements and bases for administrative review. Until appeal or other review procedure was specifically provided for by the legislature, the court was required to rule that school districts did not have standing to obtain a review of alleged underassessment of property by the county board.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the Act did not violate equal protection laws because there was a reasonable basis for enacting a different procedure for the three large metropolitan areas of the State than was provided for other cities. The court held that the reasonable basis was to alleviate public transportation funding problems which were more acute in the large metropolitan areas. The court held that thus the Act was not arbitrary or unreasonable and there was a reasonable basis for permitting the large metropolitan areas to levy the tax without referring the matter for voter approval.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The case involved an original proceeding in quo warranto filed by the attorney general at the relation of an electric cooperative, referred to by the court as relator, against respondent, the State Environmental Improvement Authority. The information challenged the constitutionality of Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 260.005-260.090 and thus sought to oust the authority from exercising those rights, privileges, and franchises granted to it as a body corporate.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The issues presented were of law and involved the proper construction to be placed on provisions of the Missouri Constitution and their applicability to Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 260.005-260.090 (Act). The attorney general argued the Act was unconstitutional because it permitted the granting of public money and the lending of public credit to private entities and permits the lending and pledging of the state's credit for the payment of private liabilities, all in violation of Mo. Const. art. III, &sect;&sect; 38(a), 39(1), and 39(2). The court did not construe the Act as permitting the granting of public money or lending of public credit or pledging the credit of the state for the benefit of private entities in violation of Mo. Const. art. III, &sect;&sect; 38(a), 39(1), and 39(2). Even if the authority's activities, in receipt and disposition of funds, were to be construed as a lending of credit or grant of public money, the court held that the same would not be proscribed by Mo. Const. art. VI, &sect;&sect; 23, 25 of Art. VI in view of the obvious &quot;public purpose.&quot; Because the authority did not levy or collect taxes and does not exercise any taxing power, the Act was not violative of Mo. Rev. Stat. art.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant, the governor in his capacity as commissioner of administration, sought review of a judgment from a circuit court (Missouri), which issued a peremptory writ and ordered that relator retired judge's claim for retirement benefits be approved. The issue involved whether portions of Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 476.520, 476.570 (1969) were unconstitutional attempts to grant public money in violation of Mo. Const. art. III, &sect;&sect; 38, 39.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A judicial retirement act became effective on September 28, 1971. The act amended Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 476.520, 476.570 (1969) to provide that certain retired judges were eligible for retirement benefits under the new program. The judge retired from office on December 31, 1970. Under the act he was eligible under the revised retirement. The governor in his capacity as commissioner of administration contended that by granting retirement benefits retroactively to judges who ceased to hold office before the effective date of the act was an unconstitutional attempt to grant public money to a private person in violation of Mo. Const. art. III, 38(a), or was an attempt to grant extra compensation after services have been rendered, in violation of art. III, 38 (a) and (39)(3). The court held that the allowance of retirement benefits to the judge under these sections would constitute the granting of public money to a private person in violation of &sect; 38 (a) and the granting of an extra allowance to a public officer after service had been rendered in violation of &sect; 39 (3) supra. The retroactive provisions of the designated sections, as applied to the judge were unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The peremptory writ of mandamus was vacated and quashed, the judgment was reversed, and the cause was remanded with directions to dismiss the petition for the writ of mandamus and enter judgment in favor of the governor.</SPAN></P>

XIV, appealed a judgment of the Circuit Court of Callaway County, Missouri convicting and sentencing him for unlawfully and feloniously removing himself from the lawful restraint of a state hospital under Mo.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant contended on appeal that he was denied equal protection of the laws because of the arbitrary and unreasonable distinction made between criminal patients committed pursuant to Mo.

The court noted that if there was any reasonable basis upon which legislation could constitutionally rest the court had to assume that the legislature passed the act pursuant thereto, and it stated that situations providing a reasonable basis for &sect; 202.435 readily came to mind. The court determined that even if there was a fundamental right to walk where one pleased, defendant had no such right at the time and place in question, and it found that a compelling state interest, the public safety, justified the enactment of &sect; 202.435.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The property owned by the landowner was among the properties set forth in the plan that the authority expected to acquire by eminent domain.

The court held that the provisions of the act were reasonably related and that the title to the act provided, inter alia, for the industrial development of blighted, unsanitary, or undeveloped industrial areas, and the landowner could not really be misled or surprised that the act contained provisions relating to the financing of such a goal, or to the powers of the cities and other public bodies related thereto without which planned industrial development could not occur.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Respondent, an FHA-approved mortgagee, made FHA insured loans in Missouri, which were then sold to various purchasers outside the state. The Attorney General expressed his belief that &sect; 362.195 was unconstitutional because it attempted to exempt a particular class of lenders from the usury statutes and that any loan made at a rate of interest in excess of eight percent would violate the Missouri usury statutes. The maximum FHA rate was increased to eight and one-half percent. Because of the Attorney General's opinions, the market for Missouri FHA insured loans was substantially reduced. The mortgagee successfully sought declaratory relief, and the Attorney General appealed. In reversing and remanding, the court held that (1) opinions issued by an Attorney General did not become the law of the land; (2) the power to declare the law was vested in the courts; (3) there was no justiciable controversy because the Attorney General's opinion that Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 362.195 was unconstitutional did not have the effect of law; and (4) the trial court did not have jurisdiction to grant declaratory relief, nor did the Attorney General have standing to seek a declaratory judgment in the action.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff city and officials sought a judgment holding Mo. Rev. Stat. ch. 296 (1969), dealing with discrimination in employment, unconstitutional as applied to it, citing Mo. Const. art. VI, &sect; 22. The Circuit Court of Cole County, Missouri, entered judgment as the city requested. Defendant Missouri Commission on Human Rights, its members, and officials, appealed. The Commission had responded to a complaint concerning the city's fire department.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Commission received a complaint charging discriminatory treatment because of race or color, racial imbalance, and discrimination in upgrading procedures and hiring practices. Two years later, the same association filed a similar complaint with the city's civil service agency. When the Commission requested a meeting with city officials to discuss terms of conciliation, the city rejected the offer, claiming that the Commission had no jurisdiction. The city filed suit to stop a public hearing the Commission had scheduled. The court explained that the state had the right in the exercise of the police power to prescribe a policy of general statewide application which applied to special charter cities and to give the Commission the authority to enforce that policy. The court determined that Mo. Rev. Stat. ch. 296 did not specify any powers or duties of any city officials contrary to Mo. Const. art. VI, &sect; 22. The court added that Mo. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The first police officer was demoted from sergeant to patrolman after he was found to have violated Rule 7.002(c) by disturbing the peace while off duty. The second police officer was reduced in rank to probationary patrolman after he was found to have violated Rule 7.001 by bringing discredit upon the police department by driving a police van over a curb and upon a public sidewalk. On appeal, the officers contended that Rule 7 was invalid on its face and violative of due process. In affirming the lower court's affirmance of the officers' convictions, the court held that Rule 7, as it was applied to the officers, was constitutional. The court ruled that such regulations were necessary for the discipline of a metropolitan police department. The court stated that it could legitimately assume that by custom, usage, and ''experience,'' a reasonable degree of specificity had been afforded in the application of the regulations and that the members of the police department were familiar with their responsibilities and duties. It would have been impossible to specify every act or omission that might and properly could have constituted a violation.</SPAN></P>

The court ruled that in determining whether defendant could be incarcerated or placed on probation the circuit judge exercised a broad discretion. In the exercise of that discretion the circuit court could place defendant upon probation, if he was a person of previous good character, and the circuit court was satisfied that defendant, if permitted to go at large, would not again violate the law, pursuant to Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 549.071(1) (1969). The court held that the decision to grant or withhold probation in the first instance was entirely within the discretion of the circuit court; was a matter of grace and clemency and not a matter of right, and the court had no power to review or revise such a decision.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellants, certain parcels of land and the owner thereof, disputed a judgment by the Circuit Court of City of St. Louis, Missouri, which, on petition of respondent Collector of Revenue of the City Of St. Louis, Missouri, foreclosed a lien for delinquent taxes. The main issue was whether The Municipal Land Reutilization Law (Law), Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 92.700-92.920 (Supp. 1973), violated either the federal or state constitution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The City was the only city in the state not within a county. Its population was over 500,000. Appellants argued that the Law violated the equal protection clauses of U.S. Const. amend. XIV and Mo. Const. art. I, &sect; 2 and the Law was a local or special law in violation of Mo. Const. art. III, &sect; 40(30). On appeal, the court pointed out that the Law established a procedure whereby qualifying cities could file suit to enforce tax liens. Because the City was not within a county, the delinquent taxes affected by the Law were not limited to taxes for municipal purposes, but included state and city taxes collected for carrying out the city's county functions. Thus, the legislative determination to apply the Law to cities not within a county and not to all cities of a specified population was based upon reason and art. III, &sect; 40(30) was not violated. The court held that, because there was a reasonable basis for the classification adopted by the legislature, neither the equal protection clause of U.S. Const. amend. XIV nor that of Mo. Const. art. I, &sect; 2 was violated. The court refused to consider another constitutional argument because appellants had not raised the issue in the circuit court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner State of Missouri, by a prosecutor as relator, filed an original proceeding in mandamus to compel respondent circuit court judge to proceed with the trial of a criminal case without requiring that 18 to 20 year old citizens be summoned as jurors. The issue was whether Act 70 (Act), Sen. 438, 77th Gen. Assem. (Mo. 1974) had the effect of amending Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 494.010 (1969) so as to reduce the minimum age for jurors from 21 to 18.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judge accepted defense counsel's argument that the Act required 18 to 20 year olds to be on the jury panel in order to satisfy the defendant's due process rights. On review, the relator argued that &sect;3 of the Act was unconstitutional. After a hearing, the court agreed. First, mandamus was appropriate because the State had no pre-judgment vehicle by means of an appeal to test the judge's decision. Section 3 of the Act provided that the term 21 years of age would be replaced with the term 18 years of age wherever it appeared in Missouri statutes. However, Mo. Const. art. III, &sect; 28 prohibited the amendment of an act by simply striking or inserting words; rather, the amended portions had to be fully set out and identified as such in order to avoid confusion. Thus, &sect; 3 of the Act clearly violated Mo. Const. Art. III, &sect; 28. Moreover, &sect; 3 of the Act was not severable from the remaining portions thereof, because the Act failed the test of severability in that it had no separate, independent purpose or enactment without the inclusion of that section. As such, the entire Act was held unconstitutional, and the court issued a peremptory writ compelling the judge to continue with the trial.</SPAN></P>

Defendant contended that the trial court erred in sustaining the validity of &sect; 391.040 because it was unreasonable, arbitrary, and confiscatory, bore no reasonable relationship to health, welfare, or safety, and denied defendant due process and took his property for public use without just compensation. The court held that &sect; 391.040 was unconstitutional because it had no substantial relationship to public health, as it was really just a matter of inconvenience to those tenants who chose to pay a lesser rent in return for incomplete facilities.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court rejected the bulk of the owners' challenges to the ordinance based on existing case law.

The court held that the provision was not invalid because state and local authorities were already obligated to follow the United States Supreme Court's determination of the effect of federal constitutional guaranties and limitations. Furthermore, the court held that invalidation of that specific provision of the obscenity ordinance would not require a finding of invalidity of the entire ordinance. The doctrine of severability would permit the remainder of the ordinance to stand. The court also found no merit in the owners' complaints regarding the ordinance's enforcement because those methods had been changed to comport with existing case law.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was transferred to the custody of the juvenile court and was not questioned again until the next day, when permission was obtained. In the presence of defendant's mother, a juvenile officer, and other officers, defendant was read his rights and confessed participation in the robbery. Defendant was convicted of first-degree murder. The court affirmed the judgment and held that the statement made in the presence of the juvenile officer was admissible under Mo. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiffs, a licensed private watchman and eight corporations, challenged an order of the Circuit Court of the City of St. Louis (Missouri), which entered judgment for respondent Board of Police Commissioners of St. Louis and its individual members. Plaintiffs sought to have Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 84.340 (1974) declared unconstitutional and void or, in the alternative, to have certain regulations made pursuant to &sect; 84.340 declared void.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Board challenged plaintiffs' standing to bring their declaratory action. The court held that the trial court properly overruled the challenge because the proposed changes in the Board's regulations adversely affected plaintiffs. The court also concluded that &sect; 84.340 was not an unconstitutional delegation of legislative power because the regulation of private watchmen, detectives, and policemen was an exercise of the State's police power requiring the Board's judgment and discretion. Further, the Board's creation of two classes of persons entitled to work as private watchmen, with different rules applying to each, was reasonable. When construing Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 84.010-84.340 together, the effect of appointing a person as a policeman was to grant him a license as such. Thus, when a policeman acted as a private watchman, he acted under a license as a policeman, and did not act without a license under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 84.340. As a state agency, the Board was not subject to Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 71.610. The Board had the implied authority to charge reasonable license fees, and it was not unreasonable to require license fees only from private watchmen.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant sought review of a judgment of the Circuit Court of Greene County (Missouri), which convicted him of selling marihuana, in violation of Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 195.200.1(4) (Supp. 1973), and sentenced him to five years' imprisonment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant was arrested by two undercover police officers after appellant sold them marihuana. He was charged and convicted of selling marihuana. He sought review. On appeal, the court upheld the conviction. The court rejected appellant's argument that the verdict was unsupported by the evidence because there was no competent evidence that the narcotics agents had reasonable grounds to believe appellant was engaged in the sale of marihuana. The court held that &quot;reasonable suspicion&quot; or &quot;reasonable grounds&quot; was not essential to avoid an entrapment defense and that the approved instruction on entrapment, Mo. Approved Instructions Crim. No. 3.28 made no requirement of &quot;reasonable suspicion.&quot; The court further rejected appellant's argument that the Missouri statutory scheme regarding marihuana violated his rights under the due process and equal protection clauses of the Missouri and United States Constitutions. The court ruled that Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 195.200.1(4) (Supp. 1973) was not unconstitutional because appellant had not sustained his burden of demonstrating a lack of rational basis for the legislative classification.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Respondents, residents and interested persons, filed a declaratory judgment action. Appellant, the Secretary of State of the State of Missouri, sought review of the judgment of the Circuit Court of Cole County (Missouri), which held that the signers of an initiative petition that proposed an amendment to the state constitution were not required to be registered voters.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiffs alleged that they sought to secure signatures of legal voters on an initiative petition proposing an amendment to the state constitution and that the Secretary stated that he would refuse any proposition that was not signed by the required number of registered voters. On appeal the court found that Mo. Const. Art. VIII, &sect; 5 stated that registration of voters could be provided for by law, and Mo. Const. Art. III, &sect; 2 provided the requirements for voters. Mo. Ann. Stat. &sect; 126.51 stated that any person who was a qualified voter could sign an initiative petition if at the time he signed an initiative petition, he was legally entitled to vote. A qualified voter who was legally entitled to vote was a registered voter under Mo. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 2 and Act 139, Mo. Ann. Stat. &sect;&sect; 114.011 through 114.146. The signature of a person otherwise qualified, but not registered, to vote was not acceptable on an initiative petition proposing an amendment to the constitution, because he was not at the time legally entitled to vote on the measure it proposes. The signers of an initiative petition were required to be registered voters.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the judgment that did not require signatures of registered voters on an initiative petition to propose an amendment to the constitution.</SPAN></P>
