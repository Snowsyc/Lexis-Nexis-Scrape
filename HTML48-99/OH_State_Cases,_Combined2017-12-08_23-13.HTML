</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of kidnapping and robbery.

Code Ann. &sect; 2901.01, and reasonable minds could have concluded that the State presented sufficient evidence to sustain the robbery and kidnapping convictions in that defendant deceived the victim into allowing him to enter her car under the pretense that he needed a ride home and he bound her wrists, after obtaining the combination to the safe, in order to facilitate or aid his escape; and (4) the sentences imposed were within the statutory limits, the penalty enhancement provision contained in Ohio Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The doctors treated the husband in an Ohio hospital. Several months later, the doctors moved out of Ohio and never returned. Twelve years after the husband was treated by the doctors, the wife filed a medical malpractice action against the doctors for loss of consortium based upon a claim that the doctors misdiagnosed a traumatic injury to the husband's spinal cord, which resulted in permanent paralysis of his lower extremities. The parties agreed that the statute of limitations in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2305.09(D) applied to the action. The wife claimed that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2305.15 tolled the statute of limitations during the period that the doctors were not living in Ohio. The trial court dismissed that action because the United States Supreme Court had ruled that &sect; 2305.15 violated the Commerce Clause. The wife claimed on appeal that the United State's Supreme Court's ruling could not be applied retroactively. The court agreed with the wife's claim. The court held that the ruling could not be applied to causes of action that had accred prior to the announcement of the United States Supreme Court's decision.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In three successive years, the township issued permits to the landowners authorizing them to place the mobile home on their property. In the fourth year, the township denied the landowners' application for another permit to keep the mobile home on their property. The landowners did not appeal the township's denial of their permit application. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded. The court held that the trial court abused its discretion by refusing to consider any of the landowners' defenses on the grounds that such defenses were barred by the landowners' failure to appeal the township's denial of their permit application. The landowners maintained the right to assert the unconstitutionality of a zoning law in an original action to enforce such law and that their failure to appeal did not bar such defenses. The landowners' assignments of error on appeal were not ripe because the trial court had not considered them.</SPAN></P>

The city approved the change via an ordinance. The shopping center, located in close proximity to the mall filed a notice of appeal. The shopping center also filed a declaratory judgment action and asserted that the ordinance adversely affected its business and was enacted in violation of the city's municipal code. The shopping center, together with individual taxpayers, also filed a taxpayer's action that contended that passage of the ordinance was an abuse of the city's corporate powers. The actions were consolidated. The trial court affirmed the city's administrative decision to adopt the ordinance and granted summary judgments in favor of the city and the mall thereby dismissing the declaratory relief action and the taxpayer action. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's judgment. The court held: (1) that the shopping center had standing to bring the action because of the likely adverse impact the ordinance would have on its business; (2) that the taxpayers had standing; (3) that the city followed all requirements of its municipal code; and (4) that no due process rights were violated.</SPAN></P>

The common pleas court granted the auditor's motions to dismiss, and the taxpayers timely appealed. On review, the court found that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 5717.05 specified that the jurisdictional &quot;filing&quot; required actual physical receipt by the Board rather than mere mailing of notice with the 30-day period, that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 5717.01 by its terms applied only to appeals to the Ohio Board of Tax Appeals and not to appeals to common pleas courts. The court affirmed the judgment dismissing their appeals and noted that the taxpayers could not argue that &sect; 5717.05 was unconstitutionally vague because they did not raise the issue in the common pleas court.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant, alleged injured party, sought review of the judgment of a trial court (Ohio) granting the motion of appellee, alleged tortfeasor, for summary judgment in the injured party's claim for damages suffered in an automobile collision. The injured party contended that the trial court erred in finding that she had failed to commence her action within the two-year period required by Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2305.10.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The claim arose from an automobile collision that occurred on December 13, 1988. The injured party filed her complaint on December 11, 1990. However, service was not obtained on the tortfeasor until May 1992. Service was not perfected until 16 months after the claim was filed because the tortfeasor departed from Ohio in 1991 to take up residence in North Carolina and, later, California. She was married and changed her name, and lived in several different cities. There was also evidence that the injured party made diligent efforts to locate the tortfeasor and to serve the complaint on her after it was filed. In affirming the judgment of the trial court, the court noted that Ohio R. Civ. P. 3(A) provided, in part that a civil action was commenced by filing a complaint with the court, if service was obtained within one year from such filing upon a named defendant. In rejecting the injured party's argument that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2305.15(A) applied, the court held that &sect; 2305.15(A) was expressly applicable only to the specific limitation of actions statutes it identified and could not be applied to extend the one year period for commencement in Ohio R. Civ. P. 3(A).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the decision of the trial court to grant summary judgment to the tortfeasor, but held that summary judgment was due to the injured party's failure to serve the tortfeasor within one year after the complaint was filed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The property owners had sought and received a building permit to construct an accessory building on their property. Due to a zoning inspector's error, the permit was based on a draft of a zoning ordinance, which had never been enacted. The accessory building violated the enacted zoning ordinance as to size, height, side yard clearance, and rear yard clearance. A new zoning inspector issued a stop zoning violation order to the owners, which they did not appeal. The neighbors contended that the trial court had erred in sustaining the Board's action in granting the variance, which allowed the owners to keep the building, because the Board had not had jurisdiction to hear or grant the variance application. The court agreed that the Board had had no jurisdiction to consider the owners' variance application because Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 519.14 and the Washington Township, Oh., Zoning Resolution art. 14.3(A), (B) provided that a board of zoning appeals could only grant a variance upon appeal.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The employee slipped and fell while carrying scaffolding through a doorway. He worked for a company that was an independent contractor at appellee's plant. The court found that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2317.45(A)(1)(a) was unconstitutional. The statute provided that the trial court reduced from a compensatory damage award the amount of any unrecoupable collateral benefits the employee received within the next five years. Any costs or charges paid by the employee, immediate family members, or employers for those benefits, within the preceding three years of the accrual of the action were to be added back to the award. The court found that the statute deprived tort victims of the equal protection of the law. The effect of the statute was to subsidize the tortfeasors and any insurers they had at the expense of currently nonrecoupable benefits paid by insurance which was funded by tort victims and their employers. The result of the law was unreasonable and arbitrary and there was no legitimate governmental interest promoted by the law. The court's decision rendered the other assignments of error moot.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The inmate filed a complaint under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 against defendants, asserting that his parole had been revoked arbitrarily and contesting the constitutionality of the proceedings. The trial court refused to appoint discretionary counsel and dismissed the complaint for failing to state a claim for relief. The inmate appealed, asserting that the trial court had erred in refusing to appoint discretionary counsel and had committed plain error in dismissing the complaint as time-barred. The court disagreed and affirmed. It explained that the inmate had not demonstrated that he had met the criteria in Ohio Rev. Code &sect; 120.51 for the appointment of discretionary counsel. The court further noted that, in cases under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983, the general or residual four-year statute of limitations in Ohio Rev. Code &sect; 2305.09(D) applied. As the inmate filed his complaint on July 20, 1993, alleging that his parole had been arbitrarily revoked on March 5, 1985, his complaint was not timely. A motion to dismiss could be granted for failure to state a claim when on the face of the complaint it appeared that the action was barred by the appropriate statute of limitations.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The victim sustained personal injuries when a vehicle operated by the driver struck the rear of the bus that the victim was driving. He brought a negligence action against the driver and the jury awarded him $ 2,883 in compensatory damages. The driver sought to modify the verdict, pursuant to the collateral benefits rule in &sect; 2317.45. Applying that statute, the trial court determined that the victim had received $ 3,416 in workers' compensation and $ 1,681.20 worth of sick days and reduced the jury award to zero. The victim appealed, urging that &sect; 2317.45 was an unconstitutional deprivation of a jury trial and infringed upon his equal protection rights. The court disagreed and affirmed. It explained that, as the statute applied after the announcement of the verdict, it did not implicate the right to a jury trial. It further held that &sect; 2317.45 met the rational basis test, as there was a legitimate state interest in regulating the insurance industry and the statute bore a rational relationship to the goal of reducing the costs of insurance. Thus, the court held that &sect; 2317.45 was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

A few days later, a sergeant erroneously sent the reporter a picture of the police officer, rather than his co-worker who was featured in the article. The city filed a motion for summary judgment, asserting that it was immune from liability because of the grant of sovereign immunity under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2744. In response, the officer asserted that the case involved a proprietary function and thus an exception to the grant of sovereign immunity existed. The trial court agreed with the city that the general grant of statutory immunity applied.

The trial court dismissed the claims against the city and the firefighter. The court affirmed. Even if the fire truck was operated in a negligent manner, the city was afforded a defense to liability pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2744.02(B)(1)(b) because the operation of the fire truck was in answer to an emergency call. The court held that the city was not liable. The complaint alleged that the firefighter was acting within the scope of his employment and that he acted negligently. The court held that the complaint did not allege any facts that removed the firefighter from the protections of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2744.02(A)(6). The state's grant of immunity from civil liability to a city and its employees for the negligent operation of a fire truck in response to an emergency call served to encourage a rapid response to an emergency and conserved the city's fiscal resources by limiting liability to only those acts which were committed by employees while acting in a willful or wanton manner.

The trial court dismissed the action as time-barred under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2744.04. Affirming, the court found that the statute was not unconstitutional as applied to minors. The court concluded that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2305.16, the disabilities statute, did not toll the two-year statute of limitations of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2744.04. The court refused to address the issue of whether the injured party's status as a minor when her cause of action accrued would have tolled the time limit because she did not raise the issue in the trial court. The court found that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2305.16 did not toll the statute of limitations in Ohio Rev.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant workers' compensation claimant challenged a judgment of the Court of Common Pleas for Stark County, Ohio, which reversed an additional award of compensation that had been granted to the claimant after he was injured during the course of his employment with appellee employer.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The claimant's request for compensation for his initial injury was allowed. Subsequently, a request for an additional allowance was also permitted approximately 19 years later. After a jury trial, judgment was entered in the employer's favor because the jury found that the claimant was not entitled to participate in the Ohio Workers' Compensation Fund for an additional condition. On appeal, the claimant asserted that the trial court erred in charging the jury that an injury did not include a condition primarily caused by the natural deterioration of tissue, an organ, or part of the body. He also claimed that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4123.01, which codified the definition given in the disputed instruction, was unconstitutional. In affirming the judgment below, the court found that the trial court did not err in giving the disputed instruction because, in so doing, the trial court did not permit a retroactive application of a change in substantive law. Rather, the statutory language was a mere codification of the pre-existing common law, which was in existence when the claimant was first injured. Further, the court adhered to its previous holding that &sect; 4123.01 was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

The stepdaughter was the victim-witness against him at a pending rape trial. He was sentenced to death. Defendant challenged his conviction on multiple grounds, including that he was prejudiced by the introduction of evidence regarding the rape charges, that statements made to police should have been excluded as plea negotiations, and that the death penalty was inappropriately applied to him. The court found the evidence that defendant was, at the time of the murder, facing rape charges brought against him by the stepdaughter-victim was not introduced to prove defendant's propensity to commit crime, but was introduced to prove the aggravated murder specifications. The rape was inextricably linked to the murder. Moreover, the statements defendant made did not contain an offer to plead guilty to any charge, nor did they indicate a serious effort at negotiating a plea. Therefore, introduction of the statements did not violate Ohio R. Evid. 410. Finally, defendant's death penalty arguments were rejected by precedent.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant home builder appealed from a judgment of a common pleas court (Ohio), which granted plaintiff purchasers' application to reduce an arbitration award to judgment. The purchasers received an arbitration award after submitting their dispute with the builder over the construction of their home to the American Arbitration Association. The trial court denied the builder's motion to vacate the award.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The builder claimed, inter alia, that the trial court erred in failing to grant its motion to vacate the arbitration award because the motion was timely brought in accordance with the builder's constitutionally protected due process rights. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2711.10 provided for the vacation of arbitration awards. However, because the builder did not cite to a specific constitutional provision or state its reasons for concluding that &sect; 2711.10 was unconstitutional, the court disregarded the constitutional arguments. The court found that the motion to vacate was untimely because it was not served on the purchasers within three months after the award was made, as required by Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2711.13. The motion was not filed until six months after the award. Thus, the trial court did not err in overruling the motion as untimely, and it lacked subject matter jurisdiction to consider the motion. Because the motion to vacate was untimely, the trial court could not address the issues raised in the motion; thus, the trial court did not err in reducing the award to judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After learning that the badly beaten body of a missing 10-year old boy was found in an abandoned building, defendant's sister told the police that defendant was familiar with the building. Defendant, who lived in Kentucky, voluntarily accompanied the police to Ohio. He admitted that he and an accomplice took the boy into the building to have him perform oral sex, but claimed that his accomplice struck the fatal blows when the boy refused. The court held that defendant's motion to suppress was properly denied. Though an expert witness testified that defendant was below average intelligence, no opinion was formed as to his mental capacity to understand his Miranda rights. Statements that defendant became combative after drinking, though prejudicial, were properly admitted. Defendant's expert relied upon those statements in forming an opinion. Under Ohio R. Evid. 703, the trial court properly required defendant to put the statements into evidence or have the expert's testimony stricken. Under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2929.03(D)(2), the trial court properly instructed the jury that it had to first consider the death penalty before it could consider alternative life in prison sentences.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On August 29, 1990, a jury entered a judgment in the amount of $ 400,000 against the restaurant for an injury which the customer sustained while dining in the restaurant. The restaurant filed a motion to offset the award with any collateral benefits received by the customer and his wife. The trial court initially found that the collateral benefit statute,&nbsp;Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2317.45, was unconstitutional and, therefore, did not compute the required deductions. When the finding that the statute was unconstitutional was reversed, the trial court made findings concerning the amount of collateral benefits to be deducted from the verdict and entered a judgment. The customer and his wife then moved for a determination as to when post-judgment interest began to accrue. The trial court found that interest ran from the date of the original judgment. The court reversed, holding that the trial court erred in holding that post judgment interest accrued from August 29, 1990, because no valid judgment existed until March 20, 1992, when the trial court applied the collateral benefit statute and entered judgment; therefore, post-judgment interest did not begin to accrue until the latter date.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The passengers, who were injured in an automobile accident, had settled their claims with the tortfeasors' insurer under the liability provision of the policy, and with the driver's insurer under the uninsured or underinsured provision of the policy. The passengers then filed a claim with the insurer for arbitration pursuant to the underinsured provision of the automobile liability insurance policy that was issued in another liable party's name. The trial court had granted summary judgment to the insurer, and held that the anti-stacking provisions under the policy had prevented the passengers from recovering any additional amounts. On appeal, the court held that the insurer could not contractually preclude an interfamily stacking, which was the aggregation of uninsured or underinsured limits of policies purchased by two or more people who were not members of the same household. The court concluded that the insurer had to pay the passengers' underinsurance claim because they suffered damages that exceeded those monies available to be paid by the tortfeasors' liability carriers.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The property owner purchased a lot in 1974. It had a building on it, which was constructed before any zoning laws. In 1948, a county zoning resolution had placed the lot in a residential area. That resolution was amended in 1966 to a rural designation. In 1987, the township classified the lot as residential. The property owner used the lot and building to store car parts. The county zoning authority eventually filed an action against the property owner and in 1980 obtained an order for the property owner to clean up the property. That judgment was never appealed. No clean up occurred. After 1992, the township filed an enforcement action. The trial court concluded that the first judgment was res judicata and enjoined the property owner from outside storage. On appeal, the court affirmed. The property owner was not entitled to a jury trial because the action sought mainly equitable relief and res judicata was properly applied to the former judgment. The court found nothing to suggest a constitutional violation in the zoning law or its application to the property owner. Finally, the township was not estopped just because it made reasonable efforts to resolve the issue.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant sought review of a judgment from the Court of Common Pleas of Auglaize County (Ohio), which convicted him of trafficking in marijuana with an added element of a prior felony drug conviction and sentenced him in the State's case against him. Defendant claimed the trial court erred by denying his pretrial motion to suppress and his motions for probation, shock probation, and bond.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted and sentenced. Defendant appealed and claimed the trial court erred. In reversing the trial court's judgment, the court held that the trial court erred. The court found that the State's introduction of the elaborate details surrounding defendant's out of state offense was highly prejudicial and could have unduly influenced the jury to convict defendant based on his past-unrelated behavior. The court noted that the evidence was not relevant and did not prove any of the elements required to be admissible hearsay. The court found that defendant's assignment of error regarding the insufficiency of evidence moot since it found the trial court committed prejudicial error regarding his prior conviction. With regard to the search, the court stated that the initial search of defendant's vehicle was justified, the subsequent search and discovery of a substance that the officer recognized as marijuana that was in a closed, nearly transparent container on the front seat was within the scope of a proper protective search.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After pleading not guilty by reason of insanity to felonious assault, defendant, who was represented by a court-appointed attorney, requested an independent psychiatric examination and filed a motion for expert witness fees. The trial court denied the motion pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 120.33(D), which placed the decision of whether expert witness fees would be granted to an indigent defendant within the trial court's discretion, and placed that same decision with respect to an indigent defendant represented by the public defender's office within the public defender's discretion. Defendant was convicted of felonious assault. On appeal, the court held that (1) the denial of defendant's request for expert witness fees did not violate defendant's Sixth Amendment right to effective assistance of counsel because defendant failed to show a reasonable probability that an expert would have aided in his defense and that denial of an expert would have resulted in an unfair trial; and (2) the distinction created by &sect; 120.33(D) did not violate equal protection because the government had a legitimate state interest in overseeing expert witness expenditures of indigent defendants.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 2913.11(A). Defendant appealed the judgment. The defendant brought before the court the same issue it had presented to the trial court, that whether the payment of a past due account by means of a worthless check, without more, constituted a criminal offense under &sect; 2913.11.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant wrote a check to a realty company in payment of past due rent. The check was returned by the bank marked insufficient funds. After defendant failed to pay for the amount of the check, she was indicted for passing a bad check and pleaded not guilty. After the trial court overruled defendant's motion to dismiss, she entered a plea of no contest and was found guilty of the charged crime. On appeal, defendant argued that payment of the past due account by means of a worthless check, without more, did not constitute a criminal offense. Defendant also argued that she did not receive anything of value for her worthless check and gained nothing in return for writing it. The court found that the elements of passing a bad check did not require the passer of the bad check to receive a material or financial benefit, but only some benefit. Defendant received a benefit because she avoided harassment of the creditor and avoided eviction proceedings.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 2923.32(A)(1), 2913.51, and 4549.62(D)(1).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was indicted by a grand jury. He moved to suppress evidence seized by police during a search of his residence. He also moved to dismiss his indictment for engaging in a pattern of corrupt activity. The trial court denied both motions. Subsequently, appellant entered a no contest plea. The trial court convicted defendant of all of the offenses on which he was indicted and he appealed. The court disagreed with defendant's contention that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2923.32(A)(1) was unconstitutional because it did not set forth a specific degree of mental culpability. The mens rea necessary to establish the offense of engaging in a pattern of corrupt activity was the same as that of the individual predicate offenses with which the defendant was charged. The court determined that when Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 2923.31 and 2923.32(A)(1) were read together they provided fair and adequate notice of the nature of the prohibited conduct. The court concluded that the statutes were not void for vagueness.

The trial court overruled defendant's motions to dismiss on the grounds that the statute of limitations had run and that he was deprived of his constitutional right to a speedy trial. Defendant pleaded no contest to the charge of falsification. On appeal, defendant contended, inter alia, that prosecution of the offense was barred by the statute of limitations, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2901.13, and that commencing prosecution against him over five years from the date of the offense violated his right to a speedy trial under U.S. Const. amend. VI and Ohio Const. art. I, &sect; 10. In affirming defendant's conviction, the court found that prosecution had commenced within one year of the discovery of the offense. U.S. Const. amend.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The guardian filed a motion asking the probate court to issue an order stating that he alone could sign and be responsible for all guardianship accounts.

The guardian appealed, arguing that the probate court erred in determining that &sect; 2111.091 was unconstitutional and in enforcing its policy of requiring attorneys to co-sign guardianship financial accounts. On appeal, the court reversed the probate court's judgment and remanded the matter for further proceedings. In reaching its decision, the court noted that there was no evidence of a local rule providing for the joint control of guardianship estates by the guardian and attorney or anyone else, nor any evidence that a local rule had been filed with the state supreme court as mandated by Ohio C. P. Sup. R. 44(A). Thus, because there was no evidence of the adoption of a local rule, &sect; 2111.091 was not an unconstitutional interference with the rulemaking of the judiciary.</SPAN></P>

The father then filed a complaint for determination of paternity, asking that he be awarded custody of the child, or for an order of shared parenting and visitation. On appeal, the father raised three assignments of error, which argued the unconstitutionality of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 3111.13(C) and 3111.22(B) on the grounds of discrimination against unwed fathers, fathers in general, and illegitimate minor children.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant sought review of a decision from the Common Pleas Court of Lake County (Ohio), which convicted defendant of four counts of aggravated murder and four counts of kidnapping for defendant's participation in religious sacrifices.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant adopted radical religious views and as part of those views, five followers were selected to be sacrificed for religious purposes. The five were sacrificed by defendant and other church members. Defendant was convicted of four counts of kidnapping and four counts of aggravated murder. He sought review. The court affirmed. The trial court did not abuse its discretion when it denied defendant's motion for a change of venue because defendant failed to establish actual prejudice. The trial court conducted sufficient voir dire to establish that the jury was not affected by the pretrial publicity. There was sufficient evidence to sustain defendant's convictions because a rational trier of fact could have found that the essential elements of the crimes were proven beyond a reasonable doubt. The trial court did not err when it admitted evidence of a planned takeover of the church because it was relevant to show part of a larger plan involving the sacrifices. The trial court erred when it admitted the victims' clothing but the error was harmless because defendant failed to show, but for the error, the outcome of the trial would have been different.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed defendant's convictions for aggravated murder and kidnapping and found that the trial did not abuse its discretion when it denied defendant's motion to change venue, that there was sufficient evidence to sustain defendant's convictions, that the trial court did not err in its evidentiary rulings, and that the trial court did not err in its jury instructions.</SPAN></P>

Defendant appealed and asserted that the trial court erred when it refused to suppress evidence that was seized from his office, convicted him of insurance fraud, ordered the production of a defense witness' notes, ruled on evidentiary matters, overruled his motions for acquittal, and imposed the costs. The court held that the allowance of the evidence was proper because it was properly inventoried under Ohio R. Crim. P. 41(D), the insurance fraud conviction was improper under the Ex Post Facto Clause because Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2913.47 eliminated a defense available to defendant under a former statute, the disclosure of a defense witness' notes was harmless error under Ohio R. Evid. 103(A) and Ohio R. Crim.

Neighbors observed defendant and codefendant leave the victim's premises that night and recognized them as persons who had visited the victim in the past. Before the police arrived, defendant and codefendant had driven away. When the police arrived, the victim's home had been ransacked. The next day, defendant and codefendant were arrested. At trial, defendant testified on his own behalf and stated that codefendant was the one who had ransacked the house and who had killed the victim. Defendant claimed that he had tried to stop him. The court held that there was sufficient evidence to reasonably find an intent to kill and that there was sufficient evidence to submit the question of whether defendant acted with prior calculation and design to the jury. Additionally, the court found that, as mandated by Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2929.05, the death sentence was appropriate.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The employee was terminated without reason from her position with the department. An administrative law judge determined that the employee was a professional and technical employee pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann.

The judge recommended that the employee's appeal be dismissed because the board did not have jurisdiction over appeals of removals from positions in the unclassified service. The board adopted the judge's recommendation and the trial court affirmed the board's decision. On appeal the court held that the duties of the employee, rather than her designation, were determinative of whether the employee was classified or unclassified. The court found that the determination of the employee's status turned on the job duties actually performed by her in her position with the department. The court determined that the employee performed duties required by her position that involved the application of technical and professional skills acquired in her academic and work backgrounds, supporting the finding of unclassified service.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the judgment. The court stated that based on the evidence presented, a reasonable jury could have convicted defendant of having a weapon while under a disability based upon his retention of the gun for a significant period of time after the need for self-defense ceased. The court observed that because it could not be certain that the outcome of the trial clearly would have been different had the jury been given the instruction as asserted by defendant, it did not believe that the trial court's failure to so instruct the jury rose to the level of plain error. The court concluded that defendant had waived his argument that the inclusion of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2909.05 as an offense of violence, pursuant to Ohio Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In affirming, the court responded to defendant's 32 assignments of error. The holdings included the following. (1) The State's failure to disclose that a witness was granted immunity did not deprive defendant of a fair trial. Although the information was discoverable, the failure was not willful, and there was no prejudicial effect or tainting of the jury. (2) Although the specification should have indicated that defendant was a principal offender in the aggravated murder, not the kidnapping, reading the flawed specification as an instruction was not plain error. (3) The prosecutor's use of &quot;I believe&quot; was not constitutionally infirm. There was nothing to indicate that he was unfairly attempting to sway the jury. Rather, he was urging the jury to draw specific conclusions with respect to the evidence. (4) The single aggravating circumstance of kidnapping outweighed the mitigating factors, which included defendant's broken homelife, his learning disability, and influence of his co-conspirator. (5) Defendant's absence from an in-chambers discussion did not impede the fairness of his trial. He would not have contributed to his defense, as the discussions were primarily legal matters.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Montgomery County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio) affirmed that part of a final order by the Dayton Nuisance Appeals Board finding appellant bank liable for clean up costs as a mortgagee in possession and reversed that part of the final order finding the mortgagors who defaulted not to be liable. The bank appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The bank was granted a security interest, as guarantee for an indebtedness, in personal property located at the former site of a tire factory. In addition, the bank was granted a mortgage interest in the property. After the mortgagors defaulted, the bank foreclosed but was unable to sell the property. Thereafter, appellee city declared the site a nuisance and sought abatement. The Nuisance Appeals Board (board) found both the bank and the mortgagors liable. The trial court affirmed the finding that the bank was liable but reversed the finding that the mortgagors were liable. The bank appealed, and the court affirmed in part and reversed in part. The bank's liability turned on whether it was a mortgagee in possession. The trial court correctly found that mere mortgagees could not constitutionally be held liable to abate a nuisance on mortgaged property but that a mortgagee in possession could be held so liable. However, the trial court should not have determined whether the bank was such a mortgagee in possession but should have remanded the case to the board for an evidentiary hearing on whether the bank was a mortgagee in possession under the facts and circumstances of the case.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Judgment finding the bank liable for clean up costs as a mortgagee in possession was affirmed in part and reversed and remanded in part. On remand, the case was to be sent back to the board for an evidentiary hearing as to whether the bank could be considered a mortgagee in possession under the facts and circumstances of the case.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 2903.01, 2911.01, 2911.11, and 2913.02, respectively. The trial court sentenced defendant to death for the murder and to prison on the other charges.</SPAN></P>

Defendant returned to the apartment, stabbed his mother 10 times, and went through her belongings. The police stopped defendant later that night for driving without his headlights and arrested him after they found a crack cocaine pipe. Defendant confessed to the killing after he waived his right to counsel. Defendant claimed that he had killed his mother due to intoxication. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment. The court held that: (1) an audio-tape of the confession showed that defendant had waived his right to counsel; (2) the trial court did not err by overruling a motion to suppress defendant's statements to the police; (3) the prosecutor did not exercise peremptory challenges to remove two prospective jurors solely on account of their race; (4) the trial court's failure to instruct the jury on the issue of intoxication did not result in a clear miscarriage of justice; and (5) the aggravating circumstance of defendant's murder of his mother outweighed the mitigating factors beyond a reasonable doubt, and the sentence of death is appropriate.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The athlete was injured during the bicycling portion of the sponsor's triathlon when he swerved to avoid a comfort-station volunteer who was handing out bananas, causing his bicycle to flip over after striking a banana peel. The athlete filed a complaint, which he voluntarily dismissed. He then filed another complaint that did not mention the previous one or specify the amount of damages. The complaint alleged negligence, but not willful or wanton conduct by the sponsor. The trial court granted the sponsor's motion for a directed verdict because the athlete failed to amend his complaint to allege damages seven days prior to impaneling the jury, as required by Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2309.01(D). On appeal, the court held that: (1) Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2309.01 could not bar the athlete's claim for failure to amend his pleading to allege damages according to the statute because it conflicted with Ohio R. Civ. P. 8(A); (2) the sponsor was still entitled to a directed verdict because the athlete failed to allege that the sponsor's agent acted in a willful or wanton manner; and (3) although the issue was moot, the sponsor was entitled to summary judgment for the same reason.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The officer was charged with the use of the Law Enforcement Automated Data System (LEADS) information for his own concerns and uninvited entry into a female officer's residence in violation of the police department's rules and regulations manual. The court rejected appellant's arguments that a violation of the Ohio Admin. Code &sect; 4501:2-10-06 was not an unlawful practice and that it was error to find that he violated Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2913.04 when that statute was not part of the charging instrument nor considered by the board. The court observed that it was incumbent upon the trial court to consider the order sub judice according to the standard set forth in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2506.04. Accordingly, the court concluded that the officer's actions contravened police department rules requiring an officer to perform his duties without favor or prejudice. As the trial court's inquiry was limited to whether the order of the board was supported by the preponderance of substantial, reliable, and probative evidence, it was not required to rule on the excessiveness of the penalty imposed by the board. Appellant waived his objection to the solicitor's participation on the board.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The landowner obtained a judgment that a village zoning ordinance was unconstitutional as applied to the landowner's property; the property was then rezoned. The landowner then sought a declaration that the rezoning was also unconstitutional. In affirming the judgment in the landowner's favor, the court held that the trial court's findings of fact were supported, beyond fair debate, by competent, credible evidence that the zoning classification was both unreasonable and not necessary to the village's health, safety and welfare. Evidence showed that the property could be developed consistent with the village's zoning requirements only if the landowner absorbed a loss of almost $ 500,000. If the land remained undeveloped, an access road that would relieve congestion and create alternative routes for emergency vehicles would not be built; therefore, the rezoning impeded the legitimate governmental interest of constructing an access road. Evidence also showed that the proposed use would not detrimentally affect traffic or existing residential property. The trial court had discretion to consider the proposed use in evaluating the constitutionality of the rezoning.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The emergency ordinance repealed an ordinance that had given village taxpayers credit against their tax liability for taxes paid to other municipalities.

The court found that the emergency ordinance adequately stated the reason for its necessity as required by Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 731.30. Although the clerk did not print her name at the beginning of the certificate of publication and failed to write in the date when posting commenced, the court found that the village substantially complied with the provisions of Ohio Rev.

As appellant, the city sought review of the reversal of its decision to revoke appellee licensee's license to operate a massage establishment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The city licensed an operator and technicians at a certain massage establishment. An undercover police investigation established that prostitution was being engaged in at the establishment, and the operator's and technicians' licenses were revoked. The license of a licensee at a different establishment, at a second location, was also revoked. Different operators were then denied licenses to operate massage establishments at those locations. The trial court affirmed the revocations and denials except as to the licensee of the second establishment. The court held that under Toledo, Ohio, Municipal Code ch. 1735, revocation of the licenses of the operator and technicians at the first establishment was supported by the evidence. The ordinance was reasonably related to the purpose of stamping out prostitution. A regulation requiring that a licensee be given an opportunity to cure violations was inconsistent with the ordinance and without effect; therefore, the licensee's license was properly revoked. However, a history of prostitution at the two locations did not support denial of licenses to different operators not linked to prostitution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed judgments allowing revocation of licenses of technicians and operators as to whom the city determined that they were engaged in prostitution. The court reversed judgments denying licenses to operators as to whom there was no such determination. The court severed the case in which the trial court reversed the revocation of the licensee's license and remanded that case for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

In dismissing the survivor's appeal, the court held that the trial court had jurisdiction to hear a medical claim only if the complaint was accompanied by an affidavit filed after consultation with a medical professional stating that there was &quot;reasonable cause&quot; to commence the action. The physician's affidavit was not filed within the applicable time limitations and could not retroactively confer jurisdiction. The survivor failed to overcome the presumption that &sect; 2307.42 was unconstitutional. The jurisdiction of courts of common pleas was conferred by the legislature; &sect; 2307.42 did not conflict with Ohio R. Civ. P. 8, 11.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court dismissed the survivor's appeal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The administratrix's decedent was experiencing severe back pain and went to the hospital's emergency room. The administratrix claimed the decedent was addicted to drugs, had high blood pressure, and was drunk at the time that he entered the emergency room. The doctor was the emergency room physician on duty. He diagnosed decedent with chronic lower back pain. He gave the decedent intramuscular pain medication and discharged decedent 35 minutes later. The decedent died the next morning. The administratrix then filed this action. The trial court granted a directed verdict for the doctor due to the administratrix's failure to amend the demand of her complaint in accordance with Ohio R. Civ. P. 54(C) and Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2309.01. On appeal, the court held that: (1) where &sect; 2309.01 was held to be unconstitutional by the Ohio Supreme Court, the trial court erred when it granted a directed verdict for the doctor based upon the administratrix's failure to amend her complaint according to &sect; 2309.01; and (2) the administratrix failed to provide evidence showing that the alleged negligence of the hospital staff proximately caused the decedent's death.</SPAN></P>

It also rejected appellant's guilt/innocence phase claims that unduly gruesome photographs were erroneously admitted, that inadmissible hearsay and unqualified expert testimony was improperly introduced, and that the instructions to the jury were defective in various respects (one of which was the omission of the option to convict him of non-capital lesser offenses). Finally, the court rejected appellant's penalty phase claims of ineffective counsel, improper admission of victim-impact testimony, and prosecutorial misconduct.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellants filed the underlying action after the patient's second twin died 20 days after its birth as a result of complications attendant to its birth. The underlying trial court dismissed the physician from the action and ruled that the action could not proceed until a determination was made in the court of claims regarding the physician's immunity claim, which was based on his employment with the State of Ohio. The court of claims held that the physician was immune under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 9.86. On appeal, the court held that the physician was not immune because his conduct was reckless. The physician disregarded numerous obvious risks related to the delivery of twins, and he admittedly failed to pay attention to the fetal monitor. Moreover, although the physician was not licensed to perform Caesarian sections, he failed to properly secure a backup physician in the event that such a procedure was necessary. The court also found that the court of claims should have provided an evidentiary hearing to appellants. However, the court rejected appellants' remaining contentions, including their assertion that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2743.02(F) was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the judgment of the court of claims insofar as it held that the physician was immune from appellants' suit.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The former employee filed a complaint alleging that the former employer subjected her to physical and verbal sexual harassment and that, when she refused to execute a written statement that he had not sexually harassed her, he made her working conditions so intolerable that she was forced to resign. Her complaint alleged wrongful discharge and anticipatory retaliation. The court affirmed the common pleas court's order granting summary judgment for the former employer and dismissing the complaint and found that Ohio law did not recognize a cause of action in tort for wrongful discharge in violation of public policy. There was no common law basis in tort for a wrongful discharge claim absent statutory authority, and the wrongful discharge and anticipatory retaliation claims did not apply to the former employer because he employed too few people to be covered by Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4112.01(A)(2).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of voluntary manslaughter for the stabbing death of one victim, along with aggravated robbery with two violence specifications in one jury trial. In a second jury trial, defendant was convicted of aggravated murder with a firearm and felony murder specification and aggravated robbery in the shooting death of a second victim. On appeal, defendant filed a single appellate brief pertaining to both cases. Defendant's former girlfriend provided testimony that formed the basis for the convictions in both cases. On appeal, defendant alleged, inter alia, that his right to due process had been denied because the relevant statute of limitations for his offenses had expired prior to his indictment. The court found no merit to defendant's claim that the time limitations on element of aggravated robbery, present in both cases, did not limit prosecution of the charges for aggravated murder or manslaughter. The court did find that the trial court erred in attempting to impose a sentence of solitary confinement on defendant on the two anniversaries of the deaths of the two victims.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed defendant's convictions, and reversed and vacated a portion of defendant's sentence.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The property owner held a conditional use permit without restriction to operate a &quot;hunting club.&quot; The owner constructed a sporting clays course and opened it to the public. Neighbors complained of the increased shooting noise and a zoning inspector ordered the course closed. The board upheld the inspector's order. The owner filed its action. The trial court held that the owner's use was consistent with the conditional use permit. The trial court sua sponte questioned the validity of the permit itself, however, and remanded the issue to the board for its determination. The owner appealed the remand order. The court ruled that the trial court could not remand a case with an order to conduct an evidentiary hearing on an issue that was raised for the first time in the trial court. Only if at lease one of five statutorily identified defects in the administrative record were present could the trial court take additional testimony. Even then, the trial court must decide the issue itself. The court ruled that as a matter of law the owner did not comply with the conditional use permit when it opened the court to the public. The property had to be operated as a private club.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Relator county judges appealed from the Clermont County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio), which granted summary judgment to respondents, a county auditor, a county treasurer, and county commissioners. The judges sought a declaration that Ohio Am. Sub. H.B. 200 was unconstitutional and writs of mandamus requiring appointment to their remaining terms and compensation. The judges filed an identical complaint that was dismissed in the Ohio Supreme Court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Respondents argued that res judicata applied. The trial court ruled that the Ohio Supreme Court's dismissal was on the merits and that because the issues raised in both mandamus actions were identical, the second mandamus complaint failed. The judges argued that the Ohio Supreme Court's dismissal was not a judgment on the merits and that the decision was not res judicata. The judges argued that the Ohio Supreme Court's dismissal was a declination to accept subject matter jurisdiction and thus, a dismissal without prejudice. The court affirmed, finding that the Ohio Supreme Court's dismissal of the judge's first mandamus complaint operated as an adjudication on the merits. Because the judgment of the Ohio Supreme Court was an adjudication on the merits of a complaint based on the same facts, seeking the same relief, and otherwise virtually identical to the second complaint, the judgment was res judicata to the issues raised. Although the trial court should have declined to address the judges' constitutional arguments as the Ohio Supreme Court's dismissal was res judicata to those issues, because the trial court reached the correct result, its error did not require a reversal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed his 1991 conviction upon a second trial by the Scioto County Common Pleas Court (Ohio) in which he was found guilty of two counts of aggravated murder. In 1985, which was six years after his 1979 conviction, defendant filed a petition for habeas corpus in a federal district court, which did not make its findings until 1990. He contended that the district court's 60-day time limit for retrial expired before retrial in 1991.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In 1990, the district court granted a conditional writ of habeas corpus and ordered defendant released unless the State retried him within 60 days. On June 13, 1991, the federal court of appeals affirmed the district court's judgment and issued a mandate affirming the district court's conditional writ. In December 1991, the trial court found defendant guilty as charged. Defendant asserted on appeal that he was denied his speedy trial rights pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2945.71 because his trial was held 174 days after the court of appeals issued its mandate. The court noted that &sect; 2945.71, which had a 90-day time limit, did not apply to retrials after a court had released a prisoner pursuant to a writ of habeas corpus, as here. The court held that 174 days was not necessarily such a long delay as to violate the speedy trial provisions of the Ohio and federal constitutions. Furthermore, there were several reasons for the delay, including the fact that the case was over 11 years old at the time of the second trial. In addition, defendant had requested that the trial be rescheduled for a later date and did not assert any prejudice he suffered as a result of the delay.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court overruled all of defendant's assignments of error and affirmed the judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The owner was convicted of an offense involving the illegal possession, use, sale, administration, distribution or trafficking in a drug of abuse. The owner thereby incurred a disability under which he was prohibited from knowingly acquiring, having, carrying, or using any firearm. The owner, while driving his car, was stopped by a police officer. Following a warrantless search conducted with the owner's consent, the officer located a firearm in the trunk. The owner was thereafter charged with possessing a weapon while under disability, in violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2923.13(A)(3). The prosecution then filed the petition to forfeit the car, which the trial court granted. The owner argued that the hearing was held beyond the mandatory 45-day limit required by Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2933.43(C). The court held that, for purposes of &sect; 2933.43(C), &quot;conviction&quot; occurred at the time the owner was found guilty of the offense charged. There was nothing in the record to explain the delay in the case or to serve as a basis for a &quot;good cause&quot; extension as provided for by the statute.

First, the court acknowledged that the State was prohibited from commenting on the absence of a witness in conjunction with the fact that the witness was named on a witness list. However, the court found that no reversible error. Defendant did not ask the trial court to admonish the jury to ignore the prosecutor's comments about the witness. Cautions and corrections may have cured the effect of improper comments. Second, the court found no error in the prosecutor's comments concerning defendant's pre-arrest silence. The prosecutor's remarks were fair comment upon defendant's self-defense testimony.

The trial court also instructed the jury, pursuant to 4 Ohio Jury Instructions (1992-1) 275, &sect; 517.11(8), that when it appeared to an ordinary observer that a defendant was intoxicated, it was probable cause to believe that the defendant was voluntarily intoxicated for the purposes of Ohio Rev.

In affirming the judgment in part, the court held that the trial court properly instructed the jury that &quot;lawful arrest&quot; was an element of resisting arrest because any use of excessive force did not render an arrest illegal but merely raised criminal defenses. In reversing the judgment in part, the court determined that the trial court erred in instructing the jury according to 4 Ohio Jury Instructions (1992-1) 275, &sect; 517.11(8) because the instruction lessened the State's burden to prove the element of involuntary intoxication.</SPAN></P>

At a trial before a referee, defendant testified that the driver threw the cocaine at his feet after the police stopped them. The referee found that the driver and defendant jointly controlled the drugs. Based on the report, he was adjudicated a delinquent. On appeal, the court found that the referee did not shift the burden to defendant but drew permissible inferences against him for failing to produce available material witnesses that were in his control. The referee's consideration of defendant's post-arrest silence was permissible because he did not object to the referee's report on that basis, he affirmatively testified that he told police that the driver tried to throw the bags at him, and there was no evidence Miranda warnings were given.

The officer went inside the bar and requested that defendant come outside of the bar to discuss the matter. When defendant refused, the officer attempted to walk outside with him. Defendant shouted obscenities at the officer. The officer testified that defendant, who was much larger than both the officer and the female officer who was there at the time, was physically threatening toward the officer. In reviewing Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2917.11, the court noted that the Ohio Supreme Court had previously determined that the word &quot;turbulent&quot; in the disorderly conduct statute did not render the statute unconstitutionally vague and that the word referred to tumultuous behavior or unruly conduct characterized by violent disturbance or commotion. The officer had a right to briefly detain defendant on the articulable suspicion that defendant had assaulted a victim. While defendant was not required to answer the officer's inquiries, defendant was not free to threaten the officer by conduct or speech. Since the arrest was lawful, the trial court properly found that defendant was guilty of resisting arrest.</SPAN></P>

The employee brought an application for workers' compensation benefits with the Bureau of Workers' Compensation, but her claim was denied, both at that level and by the Industrial Commission. On appeal to the trial court, the employee's claim was dismissed for failure to state a claim upon which relief could have been granted pursuant to Ohio R. Civ. P. 12(B)(6). The employee argued that the workers' compensation statutes excluding psychiatric injuries without contemporaneous physical or traumatic injury from the statutory definition of &quot;injury,&quot; Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4123.01(C)(1), was violative of her equal protection rights. Applying rational basis review, the court held that the exclusion for mental or emotional stress without contemporaneous physical or traumatic injury under the Workers' Compensation Act was not violative of the Equal Protection Clause because the State had a legitimate interest in maintaining and determining what disabilities were compensable under the Act.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of killing a convenience store clerk during the commission of an armed robbery of the store by defendant and two accomplices. Defendant shot the clerk in the forehead as she reached to push an alarm button. One accomplice a few days later surrendered himself to the police and made statements implicating defendant in the clerk's death. In seeking review, defendant advanced 27 assignments of error. Eleven assignments concerned pretrial matters or the guilt phase of the trial and 13 assignments concerned the penalty phase. The remaining three assignments dealt with claims of ineffective assistance of counsel. On appeal, the court, pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2909.05, having examined the record in its entirety and having examined the appropriate and relevant legal authorities, found no merit in any of the 27 assignments of error. The court held that the aggravating circumstances of the clerk's homicide outweighed the mitigating factors beyond a reasonable doubt, and that the sentence of death was appropriate in the case.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The State commenced a civil forfeiture action against the owner on the ground that certain property was derived from or used in the commission of acts that constituted felony drug offenses. The owner was a defendant in a criminal proceeding that arose from the same underlying facts as the forfeiture action. The lower court denied the owner's request for a stay of proceedings and adopted a referee's finding that the property was used in or derived from aggravated cocaine trafficking. On appeal, the court reversed the lower court's judgment, concluding that it misapplied Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2925.43(D). Once a criminal indictment was filed against the owner, he was entitled to a stay of civil proceedings. That was so whether the prosecutor in the criminal case or the owner filed the motion for stay. The stay was not a matter within the lower court's discretion. Thus, the court sustained the owner's error and remanded the matter with instructions to impose a stay pending resolution of the criminal matter.</SPAN></P>

The court held that defendant's conviction was not against the manifest weight of the evidence because a police officer testified that he observed defendant driving erratically and crossing the center and curb lines of traffic while using his cellular telephone. The court determined that &sect; 431.34(c) was not in conflict with Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4511.202, which prohibited reckless driving, so both the ordinance and the statute were enforceable.

The court stated that a warrantless arrest was valid where the arresting officer had probable cause to believe the person arrested had committed or was in the act of committing a crime. Here, the probable cause to arrest was not present until the discovery of the cocaine. The discovery of the cocaine, therefore, was impermissibly used to justify the subsequent arrest. The court held that the officers lacked probable cause to stop and search defendant thereby rendering the illegally obtained evidence inadmissible. The officers' observations prior to the discovery of the cocaine failed to provide probable cause to make a warrantless arrest. Thus, the discovered contraband was not admissible because the search was not incident to a lawful arrest.

The employer's stolen van was stopped by police, and the murder weapon was found in plain sight. The court denied all of the 32 alleged errors raised on appeal and, as to some of them, held as follows. First, defendant had no expectation of privacy in a stolen van and thus had no standing to object to its search, even on behalf of his codefendant. Defendant's argument that he acquired a privacy interest by having the van in his possession for four days and had made attempts to change its appearance were rejected. Second, despite a history of mental illness, defendant was found competent several times during the procedure; thus there was no basis for alleging ineffective assistance of counsel in not raising the issue. Third, defendant insisted that the witnesses arranged for by his attorney to testify at his sentencing hearing be dismissed and that only he testify; consequently, he could not claim that it was error for his attorney or the court to not call those witnesses at the hearing.</SPAN></P>

The trial court found that the effects of undesirable noise and its regulation through zoning was a valid and proper exercise of the police power and was geared towards protection of the public health, safety, and welfare. The applicant contended that the trial court's denial of the additional information was prejudicial because the Board lacked jurisdiction to entertain constitutional arguments, thus mandating the allowance of additional testimony at the common pleas court level. The court reversed the judgment, finding that the applicant was contending in his appeal before the trial court that prohibition of the Board of his proposed usage of his property was unconstitutional. His argument in that regard mandated the taking of additional testimony by the trial court because the Board lacked jurisdiction to entertain constitutional arguments relative to application of the zoning resolution.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant physician sought review of the judgment of the Court of Common Pleas of Franklin County (Ohio) affirming the order of appellee State Medical Board of Ohio, which permanently revoked the physician's certificate to practice medicine and surgery pursuant to Ohio Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The physician was arrested and charged with the sale of a Schedule II narcotic to a person who was not his patient. While awaiting trial, the physician was charged with selling bulk quantities of a Schedule III narcotic to his secretary. The physician later pleaded guilty to one count of aggravated trafficking in violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2925.03(A)(1), three counts of trafficking in drugs in violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2925.03(A)(1), and illegal possession of drug documents in violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2925.23(B)(1). The board suspended the physician's license to practice medicine pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 3719.121(C), 4731.22(B). After a hearing, the full board permanently revoked the physician's certificate to practice medicine and surgery in Ohio. The trial court affirmed the order. On further appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's judgment. The court ruled that the trial court did not abuse its discretion nor did it act contrary to law. The court also ruled the physician's claim--that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4731.22 was facially defective--was not ripe for review because he failed to raise the issue before the board or the trial court.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant company challenged an order from the Court of Common Pleas of Cuyahoga County (Ohio), which granted appellee city's motion for summary judgment that dismissed the company's declaratory judgment action. The city argued that the company's action was barred by the doctrine of res judicata and collateral estoppel grounded upon its victory in prior litigation between the city and a party in privity with the company.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The previous owner of the company's property had brought an action against the city and challenged the city's zoning ordinance that prohibited the predecessor from operating an auto salvage yard on the property. In that action, the trial court found the ordinance constitutional. Grounded upon that prior litigation, the trial court granted the city's motion for summary judgment that dismissed, grounded upon the doctrine of res judicata, the company's declaratory judgment action. The court affirmed. The court held that the doctrine of res judicata applied to parties and their privies. The court reasoned that &quot;privity&quot; was a succession of interest or relationship in the same thing. The court concluded that the company's complaint was barred by the doctrine of res judicata. The court also found that in comparing Ohio Admin. Code &sect; 4501:1-4-04 to Strongsville, Ohio, Zoning Code &sect; 1262.03(a), the zoning code did not forbid or prohibit that which the Ohio Administrative Code permitted or licensed. By refusing to preempt the field, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. ch. 4737, therefore, expressed an intent by the legislature to authorize the regulation of junkyards by municipal corporations.</SPAN></P>

When a follow-up inspection revealed that the problems remained uncorrected, defendant was issued a ticket and ultimately convicted of violating Cleveland, Ohio, Codified Ordinances 369.13 and 369.15. Defendant claimed, among other things, that the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress evidence obtained through an illegal warrantless search of his property and that he was denied due process. In affirming defendant's conviction, the court found that inspector obtained valid consent to inspect the property from the custodian of the building.

Appellant contended that appellees' claim with appellant was time-barred, pursuant to &sect; 3955.08(A). Appellees argued that &sect; 3955.08(A) violated Ohio Const. art. I, &sect; 16. On appeal, the court stated that the lack of knowledge of a claim until after the proof of claim deadline did not extend the deadline for filing with appellant. Thus, the court held that appellees' claims were barred by Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3955.08(A)(1), even though appellees did not know that the excess insurance provider would be liable for the claims until a Ohio Supreme Court case was decided, and even though the claims were allowed by the liquidator. Further, the court stated that the right to file with appellant was a limited, statutorily created right. Thus, appellees did not have an existing, recognized legal right to recover from appellant beyond the deadline. Appellees did have the right of recovery for their injuries. Section 3955.08(A)(1) merely limited appellees' right to pursue a remedy against appellant, and was not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The city contended that the trial court erred by concluding that the Board's decision was not supported by substantial, competent, and credible evidence, and that the trial court erred by deciding the case without the benefit of arguments or briefs by either party. The court agreed concluding that the trial court erred by deciding the administrative appeal without the benefit of briefs or arguments by either party on the merits of the appeal. The court found that the employee failed to file a timely brief on appeal, and that the city was not in default under Montgomery County, Ohio, Ct. C.P. Gen. Div. R. 2.47(c). Therefore, the court concluded that any sanction or remedy imposed by the trial court as a result of the employee's failure to file a timely brief should not have prejudiced the city. The court concluded that the trial court's action in proceeding to decide the appeal on the merits without the benefit of arguments or briefs from either party deprived the city of the opportunity to be notified of the employee's arguments in support of his appeal and to respond to the arguments either orally or in writing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The patients asserted that no-smoking policy was invalid because it was not implemented pursuant to the procedures as set forth in Ohio Rev.

On appeal, the court affirmed the decision of the trial court and found that the hospital was not subject to the requirements of &sect; 119 because the definition of agency contained in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 119.01(A) did not include the hospital. The court also found that no evidence was presented to support the patients assertion that the rule was an internal management rule. Rather, the court determined that it fell within the executive charge of the managing officer of the hospital and did not require compliance promulgation procedures. The court also found that the policy was not invalid as a violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 5122.29(F)(4) because the personal possessions allowed patients as provided in the statute were required to be safe pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 5122.29(F).

The injured party suffered severe abdominal damage as a result of the leak. The injured party filed a medical malpractice action and after several doctors were dismissed from the action, a trial ensued and a jury awarded a substantial verdict against the surgeon. The surgeon appealed and the court affirmed. The court held that evidence of alcohol use by the injured party was not relevant and was not the cause of the injuries. Further, it was not error to award prejudgment interest to the injured party because the surgeon failed to make a good faith effort to settle pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 1343.03(C).

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted and sentenced upon his plea of guilty to one count of rape, one count of corruption of a minor, and two counts of trafficking in marijuana.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court found that defendant had failed to present or establish any substantive grounds for relief. On appeal, defendant argued that his guilty pleas were involuntary because he had maintained his innocence, he had received inadequate and improper advice from his trial counsel, the trial court exhibited a bias against him, and he was under the influence of medication. Defendant also challenged the trial court's failure to set a hearing on his motion. The appellate court found no evidence of an abuse of discretion by the trial court. The record suggested that defendant maintained his innocence only as to the count of rape, not as to the remaining three charges. Although defendant apparently believed his sexual activity with the victim was consensual in nature, his trial counsel properly advised him regarding the rape shield law. One inappropriate remark by the trial court did not rise to the level of conduct that would render defendant's pleas involuntary.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant student challenged an order of the Court of Common Pleas (Ohio), which affirmed a decision by appellee board of education to expel the student from high school for 80 days for engaging in the sale or distribution of marijuana for profit. The student argued that the expulsion decisions were contrary to law, arbitrary and capricious, and not supported by the preponderance of substantial, reliable, and probative evidence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The student argued that the discipline policy and student assistance program authorizing the expulsion could not be considered in determining the penalty for his conduct because they did not comply with Ohio Rev. Code &sect; 3313.661, which directed boards of education to adopt policies specifying misconduct and penalties. On appeal, the court disagreed. That assignment of error was overruled because the student waived the issue by failing to raise it before appeal. Likewise, the court overruled the student's claim that his due process and equal protection rights were violated because the policy and program required the board to treat him more harshly than two other students involved. The student's expulsion was a result of the board's conclusion that selling drugs was more severe than giving away, possessing, or using drugs, and was based on the violation of stated policy. Because the court could not interfere with the board's reasonable exercise of judgment, the student's claim that his due process rights had been violated necessarily failed. Further, the board's decision to punish the sale of drugs more harshly was reasonably related to its legitimate goal of eradicating drug use.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the decision of the trial court upholding the student's expulsion from school.</SPAN></P>

Upon review, the court affirmed. The court found that the treatment of marihuana-related paraphernalia in the same manner as paraphernalia used or designed for use with other controlled substances was not an unreasonable and arbitrary exercise of the police power where the legislature could have reasonably determined that possession of drug paraphernalia of any kind was equably culpable conduct. The court held that defendant did not have standing to challenge the constitutionality of Ohio Rev. Code &sect; 2925.14 for overbreadth where the statute was constitutional as applied to defendant. The court determined the mandatory fine provisions under Ohio Rev. Code &sect; 2925.14(G)(1) and (2) did not encroach upon the independence of the judiciary where courts were free to exercise their discretion within the framework of the statute. The court concluded the penalties under Ohio Rev.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The worker asserted on appeal that &sect; 4123.57(A) violated the constitutional guarantees of due process and equal protection because it defeated the fundamental purpose of the Workers' Compensation Statute which is to compensate injured workers, irrationally and illogically equated the 100 percent permanent partial disability to total physical disability even though one with accumulated partial disability may still be working and therefore was at risk to further uncompensable injuries, and operated to cause arbitrary and capricious results. The court upheld the 100 percent ceiling on permanent partial disability awards and recognized that while it was possible for a worker to be more than 100 percent disabled, the statute's purpose was valid on due process grounds because if bore a real and substantial relation to the public health, safety, morals, or general welfare of the public and was not unreasonable nor arbitrary.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The conviction arose out of a shooting incident resulting in injury to two victims.

The court held that defendant had waived claims of error regarding certain evidence, prosecutorial comments, and jury instructions because his attorney had failed to preserve these issues for review. The court also held that the weight of the evidence supported defendant's convictions. Because defendant did not sustain his burden of demonstrating that his request for the appointment of a neurologist was reasonable, the trial court properly denied that request. The trial court also properly admitted evidence of defendant's prior incarceration, which demonstrated how defendant became aquatinted with the victim, but gave a limiting instruction to the jury on the use of that evidence. Finally, the court held that the trial court correctly excused, for cause, jurors who expressed reservations about the death penalty, and did not err in its evidentiary rulings during the penalty phase of defendant's trial.</SPAN></P>

On two occasions after the adoption, the individual brought to dog to an independent veterinarian for medical services. On appeal, the court affirmed the decision of the trial court. The court also found that the provisions of the agreement were clear and the individual could not avoid her responsibilities under the agreement by arguing that it was not an adoption as contemplated by the statute since the individual was not adopting a child, which required statutory compliance. The court found that the shelter was not in the business of selling animals as contemplated by Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 1302.01.

Code Ann. &sect; 2925.11, drug law, that is, possession of cocaine in less than the bulk amount. Defendant sought review, challenging, among other things, the trial court's denial of his motion to suppress evidence and motions for a judgment of acquittal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Upon encountering police in an alleyway, defendant allegedly tossed a paper bag containing two crack pipes. Residue on one pipe tested positive for cocaine. Defendant challenged his conviction and sentence for drug abuse. The court held that the trial court did not err in denying defendant's motion to suppress because he was not &quot;seized&quot; by the police before he threw down the paper bag; hence, the pipe containing cocaine residue was abandoned while defendant was walking away and thus was not the fruit of a seizure. Based on Ohio R. Evid. 613(B), the trial court also did not abuse its discretion in refusing to permit defendant to recall an arresting officer for the purpose of further impeachment. Moreover, defendant was not entitled to an acquittal because a rational jury could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant knowingly possessed cocaine. In particular, the crime of drug abuse did not require any minimum amount of a controlled substance. Further, applying rational-basis review, the court rejected defendant's equal protection challenges to sentencing provisions that purportedly favored pregnant women and discriminated against those who carried a concealed weapon.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial judge made an entry on the docket sheet stating that the trial court adopted the report of the referee and granted judgment for the medical center for $ 8,919, interest, and costs. The husband and wife appealed. The court held that the judgment for the medical center was in error because there had never been a factual or legal determination of the wife's rights and there were factual questions regarding the husband's liability for his wife's debt. Further, the referee's report did not recommend or address any amount recoverable by the medical center, and there was no basis for the trial judge entering judgment for the medical center. The court determined that the case should be vacated and remanded to the trial court. The court reminded the trial court that on remand, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3103.03 had to be interpreted in a gender-neutral manner. The court instructed the trial court that the husband was not liable for the wife's debt unless the services were furnished on his credit.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was convicted of five counts of aggravated murder with numerous specifications, and of five counts of kidnapping. Defendant appealed the convictions and sentence and the denial of his motion for a new trial under Ohio R. Crim. P. 33(A)(6). The court affirmed the trial court. The court held that defendant failed to object to many of the evidentiary and procedural issues he raised on appeal, and was unable to show plain error. When there was error on the part of the State or trial court, such as the placement of the victims' clothing before the jury rather than photos, the errors were nonprejudicial because defendant failed to show that they affected the outcome of the trial. The evidence was overwhelming, the court said. The decision not to change venue was within the trial court's discretion, as was the trial court's voir dire and control of the examination of witnesses, and the trial court's conduct countered the effects of pretrial publicity. Also, because the motion for a new trial was not properly before the trial court, it was not properly before the court on appeal.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff claimant appealed the decision of the Hamilton County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio), which granted a directed verdict, pursuant to Ohio R.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The claimant refused to allow the police officers a warrantless search of her apartment. As a result, the claimant alleged that the officers assaulted her and then arrested her for disorderly conduct and resisting arrest. The claimant filed an action against the officers and the city. The action was dismissed as against the city, pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code ch. 2744 and by summary judgment. The trial court granted the officer's motion for directed verdict after the opening statement of claimant's attorney. The trial court found that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2744.04(B), which prohibited a specific dollar amount in a complaint against political subdivisions or its employees, to be unconstitutional. The trial court also denied the claimant's motion to amend her complaint. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded. The court found that the strict application of the seven day requirement to amend a pleading found in Ohio R. Civ. P. 54(C) was not appropriate because the claimant had no way of knowing that the trial court would find the statute unconstitutional. Accordingly, the court held that the trial court abused its discretion in denying the claimant's motion to amend.</SPAN></P>

To remedy the system of double taxation, company devised a deferred compensation plan. Under the plan, each employee entered into a contract with company and obtained a line of credit with bank. Employees were permitted to draw on the line of credit to pay the taxes while on foreign assignment. The Tax Commissioner assessed personal income tax and interest against two employees who filed joint returns with their spouses and denied a refund on the personal income tax to the third employee and his spouse. The employees first contended that they &quot;constructively received&quot; the deferred compensation before they reestablished residence in Ohio, although they &quot;actually received&quot; the income when they were residents of the state. The court found the employees received the deferred compensation as residents of Ohio and were appropriately taxed. Employees also asserted that the Board of Tax Appeals rendered an unreasonable and unlawful decision by holding they were not entitled to nonresident tax credits under Ohio Rev. Code &sect; 5747.05(A)(1). The court also held that the tax assessment was not unconstitutional and rejected employees' other arguments.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The individuals appealed the trial court's entry of a summary judgment for the city &quot;as to the issue of constitutionality of the restriction on a person's right to sell, offer, or display for sale or to give, lend, or transfer ownership or to acquire or possess any assault weapons.&quot; The city cross-appealed from a finding of the trial court that a certain portion of the definition of an assault weapon in the ordinance was unconstitutionally vague, but the court held that the issue was moot because that portion of the ordinance was being remedied by subsequent legislation. The court also held that the trial court did not err in granting summary judgment for the city. After the appeal was taken, the Ohio Supreme Court held that a virtually identical ordinance was a proper exercise of the police power under Ohio Const. art. XVIII, &sect; 3 and did not violate U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 4. That holding was dispositive of the issue on appeal.</SPAN></P>

The victim filed a personal injury action against the driver's employer and the victim's wife filed a loss of consortium claim. The trial court granted summary judgment to the employer. On appeal, the court affirmed. There was no evidence that the employer had notice of any defect in the truck's brakes. Thus, the employer was not aware of any condition that would have created a substantial certainty that the truck's brakes would have failed under the circumstances. Thus, the employer could not have foreseen the injury. The court also found that it was not error to grant summary judgment to the title owner of the truck because he did not have control, possession, care, or maintenance of the vehicle. The owner leased it for trucking purposes. The court also found that the owner was not liable as a bailor because at the time of the transfer the truck was not defective.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After a jury convicted him for aggravated burglary and theft, defendant appealed on the ground that his convictions were against the manifest weight of the evidence. The court overruled defendant's sole assignment of error and affirmed his conviction. Defendant then petitioned for post-conviction relief, alleging that his speedy trial rights had been violated. After the petition was denied, defendant raised a claim of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel by applying for delayed reconsideration of his direct appeal. Noting that the record contained ample direct and circumstantial evidence to prove every essential element of aggravated burglary and grand theft, the court denied defendant's application because defendant's original appellate counsel had rendered effective assistance to defendant. Defendant essentially argued that his appellate counsel failed to point out the ineffective assistance of his trial counsel, but the court held that none of the errors alluded to could be deemed ineffective assistance under the applicable two-prong test. In short, appellate counsel's performance was neither unreasonable under prevailing professional norms nor prejudicial to defendant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The passengers sought a new trial on damages, contending that the jury award was grossly inadequate. Because the nature, extent, and permanence of the passengers' injuries were sharply contested, the court found that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion for a new trial. Pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2317.45, the trial court appropriately reduced the passengers' jury award by the amount of workers' compensation benefits which the passengers received. The court held that the trial court did not err in directing the verdict against the trolley on the issue of liability because the trolley failed to set out warning flags in violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4513.28(D), which constituted negligence per se. The trolley was barred from appealing the apportionment of comparative fault between it and the tractor-trailer rig because they entered into a stipulation in which they waived the right to appeal the jury's apportionment of fault. The stipulation also prevented the trolley from challenging the summary judgment entered in favor of the tractor-trailer rig in its case to enforce its contribution claims against the trolley.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the trial court's order because appellant's assignments of error were not well made. The court found that because there was no evidence in the record that appellant defrauded any person during the commission of the crimes, they were not properly admitted under Ohio R. Evid. 609(A)(3). The court determined that the trial court violated Ohio R. Evid. 608(B) by allowing the prosecutor to read a letter's contents to the jury. However, any error in admitting the evidence was waived by appellant or was harmless. The court found that the trial judge did not violate the United States Constitution when he failed to instruct the jury on the need for unanimity on the alternate means of committing theft. The court concluded that the trial court did not err by giving the complicity instructions for theft. Because there was no evidence to show that the jury did not follow the trial court's instructions, appellant could not show prejudice.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court found the patient to be mentally retarded and ordered him involuntarily committed to a developmental center operated by the MRDD. The MRDD appealed, contending that the center was at capacity and that requiring the patient to be placed there would have caused the MRDD to violate federal Medicaid licensing standards that the State of Ohio had voluntarily agreed to follow. The court held that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 5231.76(C)(1)(a), which placed a cap on the number of mentally retarded patients for whom the State would provide services, unconstitutionally infringed upon the patient's due process right to receive those services. Section 5231.76(C)(1)(a) also violated the patient's equal protection rights because it treated him differently than mentally retarded persons who were committed before the State's facilities reached capacity. The court then held that &sect; 5231.76(C)(1)(a) was not narrowly tailored to serve a compelling state interest. Preventing overcrowding was a compelling interest, but the proper way to satisfy that interest was not by denying treatment to mentally retarded persons where the State had an obligation to treat all of its mentally retarded persons.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was indicted on one count of aggravated burglary, a first-degree aggravated felony under Ohio Rev.

Defendant was sentenced to two consecutive terms of three to five years each. The court affirmed the judgment. The court held that defendant's sentence was not excessive and grossly disproportionate to the underlying offense. A sentence for possession of criminal tools was not unconstitutionally disproportionate where the underlying crime was a felony, such as burglary. Also, excepting lesser included offenses and allied offenses, there was no reason to exonerate an individual of one crime because he simultaneously committed another.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The decedent was driving a rig for his employer when he was involved in a deadly accident.

The wife asserted that the trial court erred in not excusing a juror for cause because the juror did not state that she would be fair and impartial. The juror in question had a family history of heart disease, and her father had recently died from a heart attack. The record did not demonstrate that the court abused its discretion in failing to remove the juror for cause, after she stated that she could try to be fair and impartial. The trial court had the opportunity to observe her demeanor and to judge the sincerity of her response. The jury instructions on dual causation and the instruction defining &quot;injury&quot; were not in conflict.

The lower court entered summary judgment for the father, holding that the statute of limitations under &sect; 2305.09 had expired, and the court affirmed. The court held that the discovery rule pertinent to statutes of limitations only operated to toll the running of the statute until the time that a victim was able to recall that she had been abused. Because the victim acknowledged that she knew she had been abused when she reached the age of majority, the court ruled that the statute of limitations began running at that time and expired before she had filed suit against her father.

The Hamilton County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio) overruled defendant's motion to strike. Defendant entered a plea of no contest.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant contended that the trial court erred to his prejudice in overruling his motion to strike language from the indictment as unconstitutional. The court disagreed and affirmed the judgment. Ohio Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2925.03(C)(1)(a), the schoolyard statute, enhanced the penalty for the trafficking of drugs in a thousand-foot zone around a school. The court deemed the rational basis test was the appropriate test in its equal protection analysis. Legislation would be upheld against constitutional attack under the rational basis test if it furthered a legitimate state interest. The court found that the State had a legitimate interest in protecting school children from drugs. The court considered the legislative history in deciding whether the schoolyard statute was overinclusive because it punished both drug trafficking, which did not involve children in any way, and drug trafficking off school property. The statute was designed to deter drug distribution in and around schools, including nearby homes or apartments, thereby helping to eliminate outside negative influences around the school. The court found that the statute was rationally related to a legitimate state interest.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The common pleas court granted the landowners' summary judgment motions on the basis that both cities' charter provisions amounted to unconstitutional delegations of legislative power. The cities denied that the challenged charter provisions were unconstitutional. They also asserted that the landowners failed to exhaust administrative remedies and failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. By majority vote of their respective electorates, each city had adopted charters pursuant to Ohio Const. art. XVIII, &sect; 7. Thus, the people of each city had properly reserved to themselves, and also to themselves as members of a smaller identifiable political subdivision with a substantial interest in rezoning issues, the right to decide proposed zoning changes. The court reversed, holding that the trial court erred in holding that the charter provisions were unlawful delegations of legislative power. The court distinguished cases involving the unlawful delegation of legislative power to administrative agencies, noting that a referendum, in contrast, was a reservation of the voters' rights to directly determine changes to the status quo, in which they had a legitimate interest.</SPAN></P>

The lower court granted the motions of appellee, the state prosecuting attorney, to enjoin the owners from conducting a public nuisance at the arcade as &quot;lewdness, assignation, or prostitution&quot; was conducted on the premises.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The lower court heard evidence and granted the State's motions for temporary and permanent injunctions. An appeal was taken. The court held that the nuisance statute,&nbsp;Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3767 was not unconstitutional as applied. Tthe conduct underlying the nuisance action was not &quot;inextricably intertwined&quot; with expression protected by the First Amendment, and the sanctions imposed by the trial court were narrowly tailored to avoid an undue restriction of First Amendment rights. The court further rejected the owners' argument that the state failed to prove &quot;lewdness&quot; existed at the arcade and reasoned that the patrons of the arcade who utilized the booths in the facility for sexual activity had no legitimate expectation of privacy while inside the booths. Inasmuch as the sexual activity occurred within areas where no right of privacy existed, the activity was &quot;public&quot; under the definition of lewdness. The court found that the state presented sufficient evidence that the patrons engaged in sexual activity while inside the booths. Thus, the state provided sufficient proof of &quot;lewdness,&quot; or &quot;public sexual activity that was reprehensible or disgusting in nature.&quot;</SPAN></P>

The Superintendent argued that the trial court erred in holding that there was no support in the record for a second period of assessment. The court affirmed the judgment. The court noted that &sect; 1125.18 prohibited gaining a controlling interest without prior approval but did not require an exercise of that control. The court determined that the banker violated the statute when he purchased a substantial percentage of the stock without the required prior approval. The court stated that a reasonable inference from the banker's long involvement in the banking industry was that he was aware of its rules and regulations. The court found that the penalty imposed was a reasonable determination. The court stated that &sect; 1125.18 was not unconstitutionally applied to the banker and was not void for vagueness. The court found that once another bank gained a controlling interest, the banker's violation no longer continued and a civil penalty should not have been imposed by the Superintendent for such period.</SPAN></P>

The summary judgment was premised upon the city's immunity under the Political Subdivision Tort Liability Act, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2744.01 et seq.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The injured party filed suit against the city after the collision. The court affirmed the summary judgment for the city. The court held that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2744.02(B)(1)(b) did not violate Ohio Const. art. I, &sect; 16 because the immunity provided for the city achieved the permissible legislative objective of conserving a political subdivision's fiscal resources. The injured party waived the issue of whether Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2744.02(B)(1) violated the Taking Clause of the Fifth Amendment by failing to raise it in the trial court. The court also held that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2744.02 did not violate the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment under the rational basis test. Section 2744.02 did not impermissibly draw a distinction between sovereign tortfeasors and private tortfeasors. The predecessor section to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. ch. 2744 survived any express or implied constitutional challenges. In enacting Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 2744.02, 2744.03, the general assembly retained the concept of emergency immunity after the repeal of the predecessor to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. ch. 2744, thus evidencing a continuing legislative belief in the validity of immunity statutes.</SPAN></P>

The court stated that an employee, in order to establish an intentional tort of the part of his employer, had to demonstrate that the employer, with knowledge of a hazard that was likely to cause injury, required the employee to perform a dangerous task. In that regard, the court found that the employer knew of and appreciated the harm presented by a jointer without readily available safety guards.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant sought review of a judgment by the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio), which convicted defendant of one count of aggravated robbery with a firearm specification, three counts of kidnapping with a firearm specification, and one count of having a weapon under disability with an offense of violent specification and a firearm specification.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After defendant was convicted of aggravated robbery, kidnapping, and having a weapon under disability, he appealed. On appeal, the court held that the trial court did not err in overruling defendant's motion to suppress his identification by a witness. The witness had an opportunity to observe defendant from a close distance. Additionally, evidence showed that defendant was arrested after a car chase with police officers, during which the officers observed a gun being thrown from the window of defendant's car. The court stated that the witness's facial confrontation and the circumstantial evidence at the conclusion of the robbery showed that the identification procedure was not so impermissibly suggestive as to give rise to a substantial likelihood of irreparable identification. The court determined that one of the convictions for kidnapping should have been merged with the aggravated robbery count. During the robbery, two victims were moved to a stockroom while a third was taken to a safe. The court found that the transportation of the third victim to the safe was merely incidental to the commission of the robbery, without which the robbery could not have occurred.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed those parts of the trial court's judgment convicting defendant of aggravated robbery with a firearm specification, two counts of kidnapping, and of having a weapon under disability with an offense of violent specification and a firearm specification. The court reversed that part of the trial court's judgment convicting defendant of kidnapping as to the third victim and remanded the cause to the trial court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The applicants purchased a lot. The applicants requested, and were granted, a lot split. An ordinance was enacted which modified the minimum lot size for commercial development. The ordinance rendered the applicants' lots unbuildable. The applicants submitted to a zoning commission a proposal for construction. A zoning inspector determined that 18 variances would be required for the proposed buildings and denied the applicants' zoning permits. The applicants appealed to the zoning board, which affirmed the zoning commission's decision to deny their request for variances. The applicants appealed. On review, the court affirmed. The court held that in a declaratory judgment action, the zoning board's denial of the variances to the applicants was proper because the applicants had other remedies available, the property was not valueless if variances were denied, and there was substantial evidence to support the zoning commission's finding. Furthermore, the court held that the decision of the zoning board was to be accorded a presumption of validity.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the legislation did not violate the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment solely because it was gender-based classification in the sense that, because of the subject matter, it could apply directly only to women. The court found nothing in the legislation which interfered with a pregnant woman's right to choose whether to bear a child or to have an abortion to such an extent as to constitute an undue burden upon the exercise of that right, which terminated when the unborn child became viable.</SPAN></P>

The court held defendant failed to show the trial court abused its discretion. Defendant argued the trial court abused its discretion in denying defendant's motion to sever and order two separate trials on the nine counts in the indictment. The court held that where the offenses charged took place in the same neighborhood, involved the same individuals, and took place over a relatively short period of time, joinder of the offenses pursuant to Ohio R.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The victim alleged that defendant sexually abused her throughout her childhood. Defendant contended on appeal that use of the discovery rule was improper, and that the trial court erred in denying his motion for a new trial and permitting the victim's expert to testify on the victim's psychological repression based on privileged group therapy sessions. The court stated that where a victim of childhood sexual abuse repressed memories of the abuse until a later time, the court applied the discovery rule to toll the statute of limitations. The court noted that a large disparity between compensatory and punitive damages was not, of itself, cause to reverse a judgment, but that if a verdict appeared excessive but did not appear to be influenced by passion or prejudice, the trial court could reduce it by remittitur. The court determined that the record indicated that the verdict was supported by the evidence. The court found no abuse of discretion in admitting the expert's testimony, and noted that an expert witness was capable of disregarding information obtained in a privileged situation and testifying only on the basis of non-privileged facts and information.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted by a jury in the County of Summit Common Pleas Court (Ohio) of abduction, attempted rape, and gross sexual imposition. He appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After the victim left a bar, defendant allegedly asked her to perform sex in return for money and forced her into his van when she refused. Defendant argued that the trial court erred in allowing testimony about two similar cases under Ohio R. Evid. 404(B). The court stated that all three acts involved women whom defendant approached in areas known to be frequented by prostitutes. All three involved defendant telling the victims to be &quot;good girls,&quot; asking them what their body measurements were, demanding that they remove their shirt, grabbing their breasts, and demanding fellatio. All three involved defendant driving onto an expressway. Given the defense of consent, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting evidence of the other acts, which established an idiosyncratic pattern of conduct. Moreover, the other acts, which occurred in Canada and New Jersey, were not so remote from the offense at issue as to destroy the probative value of that evidence. Next, the court held that the convictions were not against the manifest weight of the evidence.

The matter was referred to a referee who recommended that the court issue a limited writ of mandamus ordering the commission to vacate its order to the extent that wage loss benefits were denied on causation grounds. The court agreed with the referee. The commission was entitled to consider the possibility that the employee would not have been employable as a professional football player in any league but the commission could not deny the employee wage loss compensation on the basis that the employee did not establish the causal connection between his termination and his injury. The court found that the constitutionality of Ohio Rev.

The court affirmed the judgment, finding that the board's decision was not supported by the preponderance of evidence because the facts did not establish that the existing building was a nonconforming building. The ordinances cited by the board addressed nonconforming uses and none of them prohibited the applicant from building a new service station. In fact, the court found that Ohio Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The insurer sought review of a jury verdict, which found in favor of the insured in its action for damages against the insurer, for breach of the insurance contract and bad faith for the insurer's denial of the insured's claim for loss suffered as the result of a fire. The court reversed the trial court's denial of the insurer's motion for directed verdict on the bad faith claim because the trial transcript was replete with evidence that the insurer had conducted a prompt, thorough, and fair investigation and because there was absolutely no evidence of wrongful intent on the part of the insurer in denying the insured's claim. Because the court reversed the ruling on the bad faith claim, the insurer's assignments of error relating to jury instructions and attorneys fees were rendered moot. The court found that there was competent credible evidence to support the verdict on the breach of contract claim. The court overruled the insured's assignments of error relating to prejudgment interest because the damages were not readily ascertainable.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the decision of the trial court on the bad faith claim because there was no evidence of wrongful intent on the part of the insurer. The court reversed the award of punitive damages and the award of attorneys fees and entered judgment for the insurer on the bad faith claim. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment on the insured's breach of contract claim. The court remanded the case.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiffs, a husband and a wife, sought review of an order from the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio), which sustained the motion to dismiss or for a summary judgment filed by defendants, a designer, a manufacture, and an installer of a hospital service elevator, and dismissed plaintiffs' products liability action as time-barred by Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2305.131.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiffs sought to recover damages for injuries sustained by the husband while he was a passenger on an elevator designed, manufactured and installed by defendants. On appeal, the court held that &sect; 2305.131, which provided that an action for damages caused by a defective and unsafe condition of an improvement to real property had to be brought within 10 years from the date that the improvement was constructed, was unconstitutional as applied to plaintiffs' claim. Because the husband's injury occurred, and the attending rights accrued, only five months before the 10-year period expired, the court concluded that application of &sect; 2305.131 would have stripped plaintiffs of their legal rights by unreasonably limiting the time in which they could pursue their vested legal right to a remedy. Because the construction and installment of a service elevator constituted an improvement to real property within the meaning of &sect; 2305.131, the trial court did not err in finding that defendants were &quot;contractors&quot; as distinguished from &quot;materialmen,&quot; and in concluding that &sect; 2305.131 applied to plaintiffs' action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the judgment of the trial court and remanded the cause to the trial court for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The board suspended the employee for a month from his position as zoning inspector.

The employee appealed, contending that the trial court erred in dismissing his declaratory judgment action without first giving him notice of the intention to do so. The court agreed, holding that: (1) the trial court was required under due process to provide the employee with notice of its intent to dismiss the declaratory judgment action; (2) the at-will employee was entitled to a review of his suspension in an administrative appeal pursuant to Ohio Rev.

The natural parents did not live together and the actions involved children from two families. One of the children had cerebral palsy and exhibited developmental problems. The court held that it was proper to terminate the mother's parental rights pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 2151.414(E)(4) or (E)(8) because she did not understand the child's medical and developmental problems and made no attempt to remedy the living conditions of the child who was living with her natural father. The court held that the custodial father neglected the child under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2151.03 by failing to provide a safe and sanitary conditions for the child. In the other action, the court held that the father was ambivalent toward the child, had no means of support, had a mental illness, and did not complete treatment for scabies. The court held that the other father was not providing support for his son and had little contact with him.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The psychologist provided services to Medicaid recipients. The psychologist's unlicensed employee began providing intake and psychological services to patients. Under a consent agreement between the parties, the Board suspended the psychologist's license to practice for 90 days and prohibited his supervision of all supervisees for three years. The psychologist was then convicted of Medicaid fraud because he had billed Medicaid for the services provided by the unlicensed employee. After the psychologist's criminal conviction, the Board revoked his license. The court upheld the trial court's order that affirmed the Board's decision. The Board did not violate the consent agreement by revoking the psychologist's license because the revocation was based on the psychologist's criminal conviction, which had nothing to do with the consent agreement which addressed his supervision of employees. The revocation order was authorized by Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4732.17 and was supported by substantial evidence. The psychologist could not claim that the Medicaid fraud statute under which he was convicted was unconstitutionally vague because he could not collaterally appeal his conviction.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court affirmed the lower court's order holding that the lower court had properly determined that defendants had governmental immunity for acts of simple negligence under Ohio Rev.

The court further held that because recreational activities were an integral part of childcare services, they were governmental functions, so defendants' governmental immunity was not abrogated under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2744.02(B)(2). Finally, the court held that there were no material fact issues regarding defendant social worker's recklessness in her supervision of the decedent because she never relinquished her supervision of the children, and the decedent had acted in contravention of her instructions prior to his drowning.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant's counsel withdrew and defendant asked for permission to represent himself. The trial court appointed counsel, but indicated that defendant could have assisted in his defense. Defendant was found guilty of aggravated murder. The court determined that a defendant had a constitutional right to represent himself at trial pursuant to U.S. Const. amends. VI, XIV, but when defendant agreed to work with appointed counsel, he effectively waived the right to solely represent himself. The court explained that defendant's third and sixth assignments of error had been denied in his petitions for relief from judgment, so that decision was res judicata on those issues. The court noted that trial counsel was not ineffective for failing to ask that defendant be charged with a capital offense because aggravated murder was not a capital offense in the jurisdiction at the time defendant was charged and tried for aggravated murder. The court found that the mere swabbing of defendant's hands was not so intrusive as to violate defendant's U.S. Const. amend. IV and U.S. Const. amend. XIV rights.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The city enacted Ordinance No. 2887-84, which authorized the city to lease to the village two parcels of land. The city enacted another ordinance for the development of the land. The city filed a complaint against the village for fire protection services. The village answered and counterclaimed seeking a writ of mandamus to compel the city to execute the lease. The city subsequently repealed Ordinance No. 2887-84. The city filed a second complaint, seeking forcible entry and detainer against the village to discontinue their occupancy of the buildings located on the land and further compensation for fire protection services rendered. The village moved for summary judgment seeking a writ of mandamus. The city responded and moved for summary judgment. The trial court granted the city summary judgment and denied the village's request for a writ of mandamus. The court held that the second ordinance prevailed as the later of the two ordinances and implicitly repealed the village's interest in a lease. Furthermore, the court held that because the repealing ordinance was enacted prior to the filing of the petition, the issue of mandamus to compel the city to lease the land was moot.</SPAN></P>

And, after accepting defendant's guilty plea, the trial court asked the defense attorney to go over the plea form with defendant. The plea form, signed by the defense attorney and defendant, included a statement that defendant understood that he was not eligible for probation.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">When the employee suffered a back injury, she sought workers' compensation benefits, and the employer resisted the claim due to a prior condition and a suspicious change of physicians by the employee. After a jury found that she had not suffered a compensable injury, the employee filed an action against the employer that alleged bad faith, and the trial court granted the employer's motion for summary judgment. The employee appealed, and the court reversed the judgment as it pertained to the failure to pay medical bills, holding that the employee had raised a jury question regarding whether the failure was due to standard administrative procedure in an attempt to assure that it did not pay the wrong treating physician. The court affirmed the remainder of the order, however, holding that the employee was not entitled to further compensation for temporary total disability because she had failed to follow procedure in bringing her claim to the administrative agency. Further, the employee failed to demonstrate that any delays by the employer were caused by anything other than dealing with red tape in administering the claims.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed her felony convictions for theft and trafficking in food stamps. On review, the court affirmed. Because the indictment alleged the offenses were committed continuing through May 1988 and the indictment was filed on March 14, 1991, the indictment was timely filed approximately two years two months and within the six year statute of limitations pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2901.13(A)(1). Defendant's constitutional right to a speedy trial was not compromised. Defendant was not subject to any prosecution for these particular offenses before the issuance of the indictment. She was properly convicted of theft because the more specific offense of falsification applied to the making of a false statement. Theft applied to the obtaining of property. Defendant put in applications for welfare, denied she was employed, accepted and received welfare warrants totaling in excess of $ 5,000 and at the time she received these funds she was working. Defendant could not demonstrate beyond a reasonable doubt the trafficking in food stamps statute was so unclear she could not reasonably understand it prohibited the acts in which she engaged.</SPAN></P>

Subsequently, the village sought to enjoin the performance of the contract. The developers filed a motion to intervene, which the trial court granted. The company filed a motion for partial summary judgment on the grounds that the action was time barred by &sect; 733.60. The trial court granted partial summary judgment to the company as to all claims to the invalidity of the contract, for an accounting under the contract, and for a judgment for amounts excessively charged because those claims were not filed within the statute of limitations. The court held that &sect; 733.60 made no effort to distinguish contracts based upon their duration and that the statute was applicable to contracts, like the one at issue, terminable upon a thirty-day written notice. The court held further that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. ch. 733 was the exclusive means by which a municipal corporation or a taxpayer could seek to enjoin a contract entered into by the municipal corporation; therefore, the developers' attempt to characterize the action as a declaratory relief action was ineffective.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The owners were cited for violation of a zoning law as a result of keeping their truck on their property. The zoning law prohibited the storage on residential property of vehicles weighing in excess of 10,000 pounds or of a length greater than twenty-one feet.

The owners leased their truck to a company and provided a driver to transport goods for the company's customers. The owners appealed their citation to the zoning board of appeals, which held in favor of the township. The owners then appealed to the trial court and filed a separate declaratory judgment action. The trial court entered judgment in favor of the owners, finding that the truck was used in operation of a public utility, and therefore its parking and storage was exempt from township zoning. The court reversed and remanded. The court held that while the company which leased the truck from the owners was a public utility, it was not using the owners' land in the operation of its business, and the owners were not a public utility.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was indicted for felonious sexual penetration under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2907.12, stemming from his erogenous contact with a minor victim at a swimming pool. The trial court denied defendant's motion to suppress oral statements made by defendant to the police. After the conclusion of the prosecution's case, the trial court granted defendant's motion under Ohio R. Crim. P. 29(A) for judgment of acquittal as indicted, but continued the trial on the lesser included offense of gross sexual imposition. The court found that the trial court did not err in denying defendant's motion to suppress the oral statements and found that defendant was not in custody when he made the statements after the police asked him to leave the pool, but before they advised him of his rights. The court further held that the victim was properly allowed to refresh her recollection from reports that she did not prepare and was unable to read under Ohio R. Evid. 612 and Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 803(5). However, the court found that resentencing under Ohio R. Crim.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff filed an action against defendants, a retailer, its parent corporation, and the owner/manager of a shopping center, for damages arising from an injury that occurred while plaintiff was making a delivery at the retailer's store. Upon a verdict for plaintiff in the Court of Common Pleas (Ohio), defendant owner/manager appealed. The retailer and parent corporation settled plaintiff's claims against them.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The door through which deliveries were made to stores in the shopping center was protected from entry from the rear of the stores by two large sections of lumber held in place by wall-mounted brackets. As plaintiff was removing the lumber, the door fell on him. At a post-trial proceeding, the owner/manager filed a motion for adjustment in the damages amount to reflect the benefits plaintiff had received or was reasonably certain to receive from collateral sources pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2317.45. The trial court denied the motion and found the statute unconstitutional as an infringement of plaintiff's right to a trial by jury. The court disagreed. The court held that &sect; 2317.45 did not impinge upon the right to a jury trial, the open-courts, or the right-to-a-remedy provisions and was constitutionally valid as to the equal protection and due process challenges under the rational basis test because there was a legitimate interest in regulating the insurance industry and in ensuring that costs of premiums and claims were reasonable so that insurance could be maintained both for the benefit of the insureds and for reasonable profit by insurers.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the trial court's decision and remanded the case to the trial court for a determination of the set-off amounts to be deducted from the damage award.

Appellee county sought the injunction to prohibit the continuance of the nuisance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The bookstore sold explicitly sexual books and videos, and in a separate area from the sales section, had viewing booths for watching the films. Detectives determined that lewd activity occurred in the booths, and sought an injunction on grounds that it constituted a nuisance under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3767. The trial court granted an injunction and appellant sought review. The court affirmed the trial court and found sufficient evidence to support the finding that the two areas of appellants' premises were not adequately separated to allow the bookstore to remain open without a risk of lewd conduct. The court agreed that lewdness occurred. Appellants claimed that the injunction violated their First Amendment rights. The court rejected that argument and held that masturbation while viewing adult videos was not an element of protected expression. Appellants were liable for the acts of their customers because they had knowledge of such acts. The warrantless seizure of customer refuse in which appellants had no reasonable expectation of privacy did not violate the Fourth Amendment and fell within the plain view exception. Complete closure of the bookstore was an appropriate remedy.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 4304.17.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">An investigator for the Commission gained entrance to the club, a private members-only establishment, after following a member who had entered the club by way of a key card. While inside the club, the investigator ordered a beer and was charged by a club employee. The investigator was not asked for identification at any time. The club was cited for a violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4303.13 for sale of alcohol to a non-member. The club's liquor license authorized sale to club members only. The club appealed to the trial court, which reversed the Commission's order holding the club in violation. The trial court held that the Commission's order was not supported by reliable, probative, and substantial evidence. On appeal, the court found that while a recent decision by the Ohio Supreme Court found that evidence obtained in a warrantless administrative search could not form the basis for a criminal prosecution, in the club's case, the warrantless administrative search was used to support an administrative violation. The court also rejected the trial court's apparent theory of substantial compliance with the law. As such, the court reversed the trial court's decision.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Ordinance No. 87-144 established a five-percent preference for bidders offering local products or who had significant local presence. The voters of the city approved a local income tax increase to finance the construction of a city project, to be funded entirely by local money.Pursuant to the ordinance, the city awarded the plumbing contract to a local bidder, rather than to the lower non-resident bidder. The trial court held that the ordinance was unconstitutional because it violated the &quot;statewide concern doctrine&quot; that all Ohio resident bidders be given an equal opportunity to bid on public contracts within the state. The court reversed the orders, finding that the local preference provision in the ordinance was a local application of the same state public policy inherent in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 153.012 regarding preference to Ohio contractors in bidding for contracts that were funded by state funds. The court held that the city council acted reasonably and rationally in granting a preference to local contractors who would be bidding on a local contract funded by local monies. That rationale was sufficient to preclude a determination that the ordinance was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

A blood stain was discovered in defendant's car that was identified as that of the victim. After a jury trial, defendant was convicted and sentenced to death. On appeal, the court reversed the imposition of the death penalty and remanded for resentencing. The court held that the trial court committed prejudicial error by instructing jurors that in the penalty phase they should consider both the aggravating circumstances that defendant was the principal offender and that defendant engaged in prior calculation. The court determined that, under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2929.04, the criteria for aggravating circumstances were to have been constructed in the alternative, with only one aggravating circumstance capable of presentation to the jury. The court determined that, because both aggravating circumstances were presented to the jury, the scales were impermissibly tipped in favor of death.</SPAN></P>

The city cross-appealed in its action against the development company for declaratory and injunctive relief.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After the city sought declaratory and injunctive relief against the development company, the company owners brought suit against the city and its acting mayor. The court considered consolidated appeals in both actions. The court agreed that the company owners' claims of libel and slander were properly dismissed as being barred by the one-year limitation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2305.11(A). The court determined that the company owners' claim under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 was properly dismissed because they failed to allege inadequate state remedies. With regard to the claim of tortious interference with property rights and a related prayer for punitive damages, the court found that the trial court erred when it granted summary judgment against the property owners and granted a directed verdict on the issue of punitive damages. The court concluded that a new trial was required on these issues. Finally, the court determined that, while the city was immune from punitive damages under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. 2744.05(A), the city only had a qualified immunity under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2744.02(A)(1) for tort liability.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A fire was ignited to defendant's home with his wife and four children in the home. Defendant's son died in the fire. Matches and plastic containers filled with gasoline were found with defendant's fingerprints on them. About 26 assignments of error were argued on appeal. No error existed in overruling a motion for mistrial after alleged trial prosecutorial misconduct. The remarks were not comments on defendant's failure to testify and comments regarding defendant implicating his daughters did not deprive him of a fair trial. Testimony of police officials regarding an ex-employee not being involved in the fire did not violate due process rights or Ohio R. Evid. 701, 702, 602. The testimony was based on personal knowledge and was not prejudicial, relevant only to who did not commit the crimes. The prosecutor's penalty phase arguments were not improper and did not deny defendant effective assistance of counsel. There were no objections to the remarks and references to the victims' thoughts and sensory perceptions to the fire were fair inferences based on the evidence. The aggravating circumstances were properly weighed against the mitigating factors, supporting a death sentence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Based on his injuries suffered while responding to a fire on January 3, 1990, the firefighter filed an action on January 3, 1991, within the one-year statute of limitations set forth under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4121.80. On February 20, 1991, the firefighter voluntarily dismissed his complaint without prejudice under Ohio R. Civ. P. 41(A)(1). On August 27, 1991 the Ohio Supreme Court determined that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2305.10 was the statute of limitations to be applied to an intentional tort against an employer. Under the two-year limitations period, the firefighter's period expired on January 3, 1992. However, the firefighter argued that the savings statute,&nbsp;Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2305.19, was still applicable to his action, based on the law in effect at the time, and that his refiling on February 18, 1992 was within one year of the voluntary dismissal as required by the savings statute. The court held that the two-year limitations period was applicable to the action and that the firefighter had three and a half months to refile after the change in law. The savings statute did not apply because the two-year period had not run when he voluntarily dismissed the action.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant attorney challenged a judgment of the Toledo Municipal Court (Ohio), which granted appellee client's motion for summary judgment. The attorney commenced his action to recover the amount of a bad check written by the client plus interest from the date of the check. The attorney also demanded punitive damages for fraud and attorney fees.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The client's retainer check was returned to the attorney by his bank due to insufficient funds in the bank of the client. More than six years after the check was written, and more than six years after it was dishonored for the final time, the attorney filed his action. The trial court found all of the attorney's theories of recovery untenable given that the statute of limitations pertaining to oral contract and fraud had lapsed. On appeal from summary judgment the attorney based all three of his assignments of error on the tolling provisions of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2305.15(A). The court noted that the statute was only applicable to situations where a defendant had absconded or concealed himself to avoid service. Affirming, the court determined that there was no evidence that established either situation. Therefore, application of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2305.15(A) to toll the relevant statutes of limitation was unconstitutional. Thus, the trial court reached the right result, albeit for the wrong reasons.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellees circulated recall petitions seeking the recall of appellant city councilmen.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The councilmen contended that the trial court erred in granting appellees' motion to dismiss and in refusing to enjoin the recall election. The thrust of the councilmen's argument was that the grounds stated in the recall petitions were false, untrue and misleading, and, therefore, the trial court should have enjoined the recall election. The allegedly false statements on the petitions did not and could not appear on the ballot as official petitions did not constitute &quot;campaign materials.&quot; Thus, the councilmen did not demonstrate any clear, legal right which had been violated, certainly not by clear and convincing evidence. The role of the courts in determining the election process was limited to providing relief from any fraud, mistake, abuse of discretion, misinterpretation of statute, or clear disregard for the legal provisions engaged in by the various boards and agencies who were charged with supervision of elections. No such allegation had been made in the instant case. Further, no requirement for &quot;truth&quot; in the petitions had been demonstrated. The trial court did not err in dismissing the councilmen's complaint and in not ordering an injunction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellee landowner applied to the Landmark Commission for a certificate of appropriateness to obtain a demolition permit pursuant to Dayton, Ohio, Rev. Code Gen. Ordinances &sect; 150.246. The Commission denied the application. Appellant, Dayton Board of Zoning Appeals, affirmed that decision. The Montgomery County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio) found the ordinance to be unconstitutional. The Board of Zoning Appeals sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Board asserted that the trial court abused its discretion in finding the ordinance unconstitutional. The court held that the case could be disposed of without engaging in the constitutional questions. In affirming the Commission's denial of the application, the trial court found that the landowner had fulfilled the requirements of &sect; 150.246. The evidence revealed that the square foot cost of similarly used and improved structures in the area was well below the per square foot improvement cost of the building in question. Therefore, the requirements of &sect; 152.246(A)(4) had been met and the landowner should have been granted the certificate of appropriateness and a demolition permit. Nevertheless, the Board maintained that the denial of the certificate was proper because the trial court should have included the adjacent parcel in its application of &sect; 152.246(A)(4). The court held that the ordinance language did not expressly require including adjacent property or other property owned by the landowner in determining whether the square foot cost of meeting the minimum building code exceeded the square foot market value of similarly used and improved structures in the district.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed a decision from the Common Pleas Court of Cuyahoga County (Ohio), which entered a jury verdict convicting him of murder with a firearm, attempted murder with a firearm, and having a weapon under a disability. He argued that his conviction should be reversed because he was denied access to police records, because his arrest and the search of his home were unconstitutional, and because counsel was ineffective.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After a jury convicted him of murder with a firearm, attempted murder with a firearm, and having a weapon under a disability, defendant appealed. Defendant argued that he was denied a fair trial because he was denied access to police investigatory records, available as public records under the Public Records Act, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 149.43(A)(2)(a)-(d). The court found that defendant had failed to comply with the Act's procedural requirements. Defendant argued that his Fourth Amendment rights were violated, because the police searched his home, closet, and a duffel bag without a warrant. The court explained that the requirements for third party consent had been met, because defendant's common law wife agreed to the search. Defendant argued that not allowing him to cross-examine a state's witness about her drug use was error. The court held that the drug use was irrelevant to the trial and that its suppression was not an abuse of discretion. Defense counsel was not ineffective for refusing to call a witness who had been prepared to testify. The common pleas court did err in imposing two firearms sentences, because the murder and attempt were the result of one incident.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The owners purchased the commercial property in question to build a shopping center, but then decided that it was not economically desirable to do so. They accepted an offer from a prospective buyer subject to the condition that the Village would approve the plan. The Commission denied the buyer's application for a permit to build an auto mall, and an appeal to the court of common pleas failed. The owners sold the property to another buyer, which was able to obtain a permit for its desired use. The owners then instituted the instant action, which was dismissed. The court determined that the controversy had been sufficiently eliminated, and there was no longer a justiciable controversy, which was precisely what the trial court found. Regarding the issue as to whether the Commission acted on the application in a timely manner, the court determined that the result would not vary even if the Commission failed to act upon the application within the prescribed 30-day period. Because the Commission did act upon the application, the issue was not whether the duty for timely action was mandatory, but whether it was jurisdictional. It was not jurisdictional.</SPAN></P>

The owner appealed from the trial court's commentary on the merits of the case.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In its order of dismissal, the trial court included its thoughts on the matter. The trial court held that it lacked jurisdiction because the coalition had failed to exhaust its administrative remedies. The owner conceded that it was appealing from dictum and argued that fairness and logic dictated that a trial court, unable to decide a case on the merits because it lacked jurisdiction to do so, should refrain from including statements in its written opinion that could bear upon the merits of the action. The court did not read Ohio R. App. P. 3(D) so literally as to include dictum as a proper subject for appeal. The court further concluded that the owner was not materially prejudiced by the dictum since language extraneous to a court's holding was not binding authority, and that any adverse decisions on the merits of this controversy had to come directly from a court's or an administrative agency's application of Ohio or federal environmental regulations to the owner's situation. Although a court or administrative agency could consider persuasive dictum contained in a judicial decision, it was not subject to review by the court. The court overruled the assignment of error.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After defendant was charged in connection with the alleged theft of money from client's of his insurance business, defendant pleaded guilty to a second degree felony charge of aggravated theft. When defendant then sought to withdraw his guilty plea, the trial court denied the motion, and he was sentenced to a term of 5 to 15 years and ordered to pay a $ 7,500 fine. Defendant appealed, and the court affirmed, holding that the trial court properly denied defendant's motion to dismiss the charges because when he admitted his guilt, he waived any independent claim relating to the deprivation of his constitutional right against double jeopardy. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to allow defendant to withdraw his guilty plea because the record established that the plea had been entered voluntarily and with a full understanding of the rights involved. Defendant was properly sentenced because the sentence was within the range set by Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2929.11 and there was no impropriety on the part of the trial court.</SPAN></P>

The defendant disputed the trial court's finding that Columbus, Ohio, City Code 2311.08(B), (G) were not unconstitutional. In affirming, the court agreed with the trial court's conclusions, but based on different reasoning. Although the court did not find the ordinance to be facially unconstitutional when construed and limited, the trial court was correct to the extent that the ordinance was unconstitutional as applied to the defendant under the evidence adduced before the referee. The conduct of the defendant did not constitute a violation of the ordinance.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant's automobile was stopped by a highway patrol officer after defendant exited the freeway without using a turn signal. A radio check revealed that defendant did not have an operator's license and that a warrant had been issued for his arrest in another county. The officer placed defendant under arrest and conducted an inventory search of the automobile before it was towed to the impound lot. The search turned up a baggie of marijuana under the driver's seat and additional baggies in the trunk. The trial court denied defendant's motion to suppress the seized marijuana and convicted defendant on his plea of no contest. On appeal, the court affirmed and held that the non-investigatory routine search of the contents of defendant's lawfully impounded automobile did not violate the Fourth Amendment, even though inculpatory evidence was discovered. Further, by his no contest plea, defendant stipulated to the facts alleged in the indictment: that he knowingly transported marijuana, knowing that it was intended for resale.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was involved in an auto accident where a passenger in another car was killed. The police noticed that defendant exhibited signs of being drunk and asked for a breath test. Defendant refused. The police obtained a search warrant for a blood sample, which showed alcohol in defendant's blood. Defendant pled no contest to the charges but then appealed. The court affirmed, finding that the implied consent statute, which prohibited testing after a refusal by the suspect, did not prohibit a blood sample being taken where vehicular homicide, rather than driving under the influence, was the crime charged. The court further found that the search warrant made it irrelevant as to whether defendant was under arrest at the time and that the sample was properly taken by a nurse, at the direction of the police officer named in the warrant. The physician-patient privilege had no bearing on the blood sample. Finally, defendant could be found guilty after a plea of no contest.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the Lucas County Common Pleas Court (Ohio), which convicted him on five counts of aggravated murder with specifications and four counts of kidnapping. The conviction arose out of defendant's involvement in a small religious cult, which lured five of its members into a barn, one by one, then bound and killed them. Defendant alleged that he only committed the crimes at the cult leader's orders.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued that the trial court erred in its jury instructions, in not dismissing the second indictment against him, in excluding his expert witnesses, and in convicting him on allied offenses of similar import. The court agreed that the trial court committed an ex post facto error in giving the jury an insanity instruction that paralleled Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2901.01(N) because the murders occurred before that law went into effect. However, the error was deemed harmless because defendant failed, as a matter of law, to establish the elements of the pre-existing insanity defense. The failure to give defendant's requested duress instruction was also harmless error. Defendant's conviction on the second indictment against him, which was a superseding indictment, did not violate his speedy trial right because his waiver of that right from the first indictment applied to the second indictment. Defendant's crimes of luring his victims and killing them were not allied offenses. His experts' testimony was properly excluded, and the evidence supported the trial court's aiding and abetting instruction.</SPAN></P>

The taxpayers did not respond to the request, and the tax commissioner assessed an additional individual state income tax. The taxpayers paid under protest, and the tax board affirmed the commissioner's decision. On appeal, the court held that: (1) the taxpayers were required under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 5747.10, but failed, to file an &quot;amended return&quot; because their liability was altered by the federal adjustment; (2) a &quot;return&quot; included annual returns and amended returns; and (3) the taxpayers' failure to file an amended return constituted a failure to file a return, preventing the three-year statute of limitations under Ohio Rev.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Ohio General Assembly adopted revisions to the state's welfare program that provided that cash assistance and primary care medical coverage would stop after six months per year regardless of a person's need, status, or ability to find employment. Previously the benefits were indefinite. The recipients brought suit to challenge the constitutionality of the revisions. The trial court dismissed the recipients' case. The recipients appealed and the court affirmed. The recipients argued that the alleged right to obtain safety guaranteed by the Ohio Constitution incorporated the right of destitute citizens to receive minimum assistance sufficient in amount and type to prevent homelessness and provide essential health care. The court held that the safety provision of Ohio Const. art. I, &sect; 1 did not create an affirmative duty or obligation on the part of the state of Ohio to provide subsistence welfare benefits to its citizens. There was nothing in the text of the Ohio Constitution that would support the recipients' argument that the state of Ohio had a constitutional obligation to provide welfare payments to its needy citizens.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of a minor misdemeanor by possessing on her land a motor vehicle in an inoperative condition in violation of &sect; 91.261 of the Codified Ordinances of the City of Findlay. She appealed. The court held that defendant's argument that the ordinance used an improper determination of junk, thereby making it unconstitutional, was without merit. The ordinance applied to any motor vehicle that was inoperable. It did not require that the motor vehicle be defined as a junk motor vehicle before one was found in violation of this ordinance. Moreover, the ordinance did not prevent defendant from owning the motor vehicle nor did it deprive her of its use. The ordinance only required that a motor vehicle that was inoperable be stored in an enclosed structure. However, the court found the ordinance unconstitutional because the parties failed to provide a definition for &quot;inoperative condition.&quot; Based on the fact that the record did not contain definitions or time constraints, the language of &sect; 91.261, standing alone, was unconstitutionally broad and vague.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The father was ordered to pay child support when the parties divorced, but he consistently failed to pay it. A subsequent order was issued increasing the amount of the weekly payment to cover the arrearages, and the father made only a few payments in compliance with that order. The child was emancipated several months before the mother's contempt motion was granted. The father sought to have the contempt order vacated, but the trial court refused to do so. On appeal, the father argued that the trial court lacked the power to exercise its contempt power after the child attained his majority. Affirming the judgment, the court held that the trial court had the inherent authority to require compliance with its lawful orders regardless of whether the beneficiary of those orders had attained the age of majority. The court recognized that there was split of authority on this issue, but reasoned that the purpose behind the contempt power of the courts was better served by their holding. Statutory provisions such as Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3113.21(M)(1), (2) and Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2705.031(E), which dealt with the trial court's enforcement powers, supported the court's ruling.</SPAN></P>

The court concluded that the statutes provided adequate notice and fair warning to persons of ordinary intelligence to enable them to conform their conduct to the statutes. The term defining the prohibited quantity was not &quot;vague&quot; as the quantity specified in each provision was specifically defined and limited to two precise alternative objective criteria under Ohio Rev.

Defendant failed to demonstrate that prosecutorial discretion in charging either offense was exercised to impermissibly discriminate against a class of persons to which he belonged. The totality of the evidence supported the charge of drug trafficking in violation of R.C. 2925.03(A)(2) and revealed the drugs, pager, loaded pistol, and money constituted tools of defendant's drug trade. The court rejected defendant's argument that a possession of drugs offense in violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2925.11 was allied with a drug trafficking offense in violation of Ohio Rev.

The Franklin County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio), found that compliance with Ohio Code Ann. &sect; 2967 was necessary for the governor to commute or parole a sentence.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The pardonees argued that the trial court erred when it construed the Ohio Constitution to allow legislative regulation of the governor's power to commute conferred by Ohio Const. art.

The court held that 1) &quot;pardon,&quot; as used in that section of the state constitution did not include the word &quot;commutation;&quot; 2) the legislative restriction was only upon the person seeking a pardon and not upon the governor's power to grant the pardon, which the governor was able to do sua sponte; 3) the constitution, rather than the legislatively mandated application, was the source of the governor's pardoning power; and finally 4) there was nothing in the constitutional provision permitting a conclusion that the governor's power to act was restricted by legislation that provided that he had no power to grant a pardon unless he had first received a recommendation from the Ohio Adult Parole Authority as to whether such pardons should be granted following an investigation by it upon an application made by the person seeking the pardon.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After a jury trial, defendant was convicted of two counts of cruelty to animals, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 959.13(A)(2), (A)(4). Defendant appealed, complaining that the Municipal Court of the County of Medina (Ohio) made erroneous rulings on evidence, the statute was vague, an attorney for a cruelty to animals prevention association was permitted to assist the prosecutor, her voir dire was impermissibly short, and the instructions were erroneous.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After the society received reports that defendant kept 30-50 dogs and several horses in unsanitary and overcrowded conditions with inadequate food, water, and shelter, two separate search warrants were obtained and the animals were seized. The court pointed out that the statutes did not clearly indicate a legislative intent to impose strict liability. Therefore, a recklessness standard was used, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2901.21(B). Because the trial court charged the jury that these offenses required no culpable mental state, the court reversed the convictions. The court rejected defendant's other assertions of error, including the clarification the trial court gave that, under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 959.13(A)(4), defendant could have been convicted if she failed to give animals kept in an enclosure either wholesome exercise or change of air. The court explained that, unlike a typical criminal statute, this one stated specific acts which she was required to perform. The court added that there was no error in limiting defendant's voir dire in the highly publicized case, because the trial court initially asked the prospective jurors if they were able to put aside any preconceptions.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant sought review of a judgment from the Common Pleas Court (Ohio), which convicted defendant of engaging in a pattern of corrupt activity.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant violated 18 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1955, which made it unlawful to engage in an illegal gambling business. Thereafter, defendant was convicted under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2923.32 of engaging in a pattern of corrupt activity. In seeking review, defendant claimed that the violation of 18 U.S.C.S &sect; 1955 did not satisfy the requisite felony predicate event required to sustain a conviction under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2923.32. Because defendant did not have a previous conviction for any gambling offense in Ohio which could be used to enhance a subsequent gambling violation to a felony, the court held that any conduct on defendant's part involving an alleged gambling violation of any section of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. ch. 2951 only constituted a misdemeanor offense. As such, the court held that the conduct which had resulted in a violation of 18 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1955 only constituted a misdemeanor offense in Ohio. In so holding, the court noted that it was required to analyze defendant's conduct and not the federal statute's penalty to determine whether defendant's conduct met the felony predicate required by Ohio's Corrupt Practices Act.</SPAN></P>

The trial court terminated the parent's rights to two of the children and placed them in the Department's permanent custody. The court affirmed the decision. The court found that nothing in the trial court record or the Department's records permitted the inference that the trial court or the Department had an improper motive of taking the children to satisfy the demand for adoption of white children by wealthy, childless, white persons. The court held that there was clear and convincing evidence that the children lived in continually worsening unsafe and unsanitary conditions of avoidable filth, squalor, danger, and neglect. The court noted that the parents resisted all efforts of public authorities of three separate counties to assist in providing for the education, cleanliness, nourishment, good health, safety, and general well-being of the children. The court found that there was evidence of inappropriate corporal punishment and that the children's discipline, social skills, and moral training improved in foster care.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The land owner sought a variance from the board so that he could build a house on a corner lot without conforming to the setback requirements contained in the city's zoning ordinance. The board denied his request for a variance. The landowner filed his action. The trial court upheld the denial of the variance, but it also ruled that the ordinance was unconstitutional as it had been applied to the landowner. The parties appealed different aspects of the board's ruling. The court was &quot;perplexed&quot; by the trial court's constitutional analysis. The same reasoning that led to the trial court's conclusion that the provision was unconstitutional should have led it to conclude that the landowner's variance request could have been granted based on a showing of &quot;practical difficulties.&quot; Without the variance the landowner could only build a house as big as an &quot;enlarged dollhouse.&quot; The neighbors' desire to control the number of children in the area and to preserve certain pine trees did not rise to substantial evidence that the landowner's plan would injure the public health, safety, or general welfare.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant was involved in an automobile accident with the driver, who failed to yield while driving his vehicle in the course of his employment. The OIGA was obligated to pay the employer's insurer's claims when that insurer became insolvent. Appellant settled with the driver's insurer for less than the uninsured motorist policy limits. Appellant continued his action against the driver, the employer, and the OIGA. Summary judgment was entered dismissing appellant's claims against all three parties. Appellant brought this appeal, alleging: (1) his claim against OIGA was not barred for his failure to exhaust the limits of the driver's uninsured motorist coverage; (2) even if so, he could still proceed against the driver and the employer; and (3) if he were precluded from proceeding, the OIGA Act unconstitutionally denied him access to the courts. The court found Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3955.13(A) precluded appellant from proceeding against the OIGA without exhausting the driver's insurer's policy limits. Next, to the extent the driver and the employer would have had coverage with OIGA, they were not liable under &sect; 3955.03. Finally, the OIGA Act was not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The property owners claimed that the method used in valuing their property was both improper and unconstitutional. They alleged that the county used the replacement cost rather then the market value approach. Further, the property owners argued that the method employed by the county yielded unfair results based on tax values of other properties in the area. On appeal, the court held that due to the span of four years between the sale and the valuation, the development of the surrounding area, and the market value analysis conducted, the county was not bound by the prior sale price. The court found that the county used the market value technique to reach the estimated value of the owners' house. The court ruled that the method used did not violate Ohio Const. art. XII, &sect; 2, because the county used the market value. The court determined that the property owners improperly attempted to build their case for a reduction in value by comparing their property to dissimilar properties.

The court affirmed the denial of defendant suppression motion and also affirmed his conviction. The court held that the trial court did not err when it ruled that defendant had failed to establish that the search warrant should be voided. The court found that much of the information presented by the informants was correct, and that the informants were reliable.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant's roommate was on probation and he was charged with violating probation. A search of defendant's home revealed that there was cocaine in the bedroom that defendant and her roommate shared.

Defendant contended that Alliance City Ordinance &sect; 513.14 was unconstitutionally vague and overbroad . She also contended that there was no proof that she intended to engage in drug-related activity in her home. The court held that &sect; 513.14 was constitutional because the ordinance set out specific incidents, it clearly set out the limits of its enforcement, and it defined the necessary mental intent. The court also stated that the plain and literal meaning of &sect; 513.14 was clearly set out by the precise words of Ohio Revised Code &sect;&sect; 2925 and 4729. The court also held that defendant's cohabitation in a place of storage of a controlled substance was sufficient to establish her intent because defendant was in and remained on the premises where a controlled substance was stored, and she admitted that she knew of the presence and storage of drugs.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A father was advised that he had to report any future income for purposes of determining continued eligibility for ADC benefits. The father secured a job but never reported the extra income to the Department. The Department determined that the family received an overpayment in ADC benefits due to the father's new employment. Because the father and the mother divorced and the mother was receiving the ADC benefits on behalf of the family, the Department reduced her benefits to recoup the overpayment. The mother sought review with the trial court, which affirmed the Department's decision. The mother appealed, and the court affirmed the trial court's decision. The court held that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 5107.04(A), (C) required the Department to recover all erroneous ADC payments. Under Ohio Admin. Code &sect; 1-25-34(B) the Department had the authority to recoup the overpayment from the mother even though she did nothing to cause the overpayment. The defense of laches did not bar the Department's claim for recoupment. The court held that the recoupment provisions were rationally related to a legitimate goal of the government. The provisions did not violate due process or equal protection.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Ten landowners requested their lands to be annexed to the city. After completing negotiations, the city and the landowners presented the agreements to the Board. At a hearing, the Board heard testimony for and against the annexation. After the hearing, the Board received letters against the proposed annexation and a memorandum in opposition from the township trustees. Thereafter, the Board denied the annexation. A second request for reconsideration was filed and a hearing was held. In response to the Board's concerns regarding the city's ability to provide necessary services, an ordinance was passed clarifying the services to be provided and empowering the mayor to enter into pre-annexation agreements. Subsequently, the Board again denied the annexation. The court held that the Board applied the wrong standard under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 709.033 and that the lower court affirmed the Board's finding using the same incorrect standard. Specifically, the court held that the Board wrongly considered the effect of annexation on an area not to be annexed. The court further held that the record showed that the annexation was to the general good of the territory.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court held that there were no facts in the record from which it could determine that &sect; 351.19, as applied to defendant, was an unconstitutional exercise of the municipality's police powers. The court was not persuaded that &sect; 351.19 was rendered defective by reason of its reliance upon a vehicle's license plate as a means of rating a vehicle as commercial.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant contended that the trial court abused its discretion in ordering him to pay a fine after sentencing him to the maximum period of imprisonment allowed and without considering his financial ability to pay the fine as required by Ohio Rev.

The court also held that the trial court should have conducted a hearing to determine defendant's ability to pay the fine in order to comply with Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2947.14(A). The court stated that defendant preserved the issue of his ability to pay the fine by filing a motion to vacate the fine after its imposition and that he did not need to object or move for hearing at the time of sentencing because the court erred as a matter of law in failing to hold the hearing. Finally, the court held that defendant was not required to wait to object to the fine until he was penalized for failure to pay the fine, since the lack of a hearing at the time of sentencing rendered the fine unenforceable under &sect; 2947.14(A).</SPAN></P>

Twelve hours later, he was returned to the hospital and diagnosed with bacterial meningitis. The parents alleged that, because of the improper initial diagnosis, the patient lost his hearing. During discovery, defendants were informed that the parents sought over $ 350,000 in out-of-pocket expenses and, at some point prior to trial, the parents also made a written demand for one million dollars. The pleadings, however, were never amended to include a specific monetary demand. Thereafter, the jury was impaneled and opening statements were made. The trial court then dismissed the action under Ohio R. Civ. P. 54(C) and Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2309.01(B) because the parents did not amend their complaint to specify the amount of damages sought. The court held that the trial court erred in entering a directed verdict and found that because defendants had been given written notice as to the amount of the parents' demand and had done nothing to call to the attention of the trial court the failure of the parents to amend the complaint prior to trial, defendants had waived their right to raise the issue.</SPAN></P>

He was eventually apprehended and convicted of theft with violence specifications, failure to comply with order or signal of police officer with violence specifications, and possession of criminal tools with violence specifications. On appeal, the court held that defendant's right to a speedy trial was not violated as he acknowledged in his memorandum in support of his motion to dismiss indictments that he had two criminal cases pending against him, which meant that he was not incarcerated solely on the pending charge. The court found that defendant failed to object to the jury instructions given and waived the issue on appeal. The court held that there was competent credible evidence by way of testimony upon which the jury could have found all of the essential elements required to bump defendant's violation from a misdemeanor to a felony, as provided by Ohio Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff maintains he has failed to receive various promotions because as a union representative he had pursued grievances against the employer and that such discrimination deprived him of equal protection of the law and punished him for exercising his rights of free speech. The court affirmed the grant of summary judgment against the employee. The court found that the Public Employee Collective Bargaining Act of 1984 provided exclusive remedies for an employee who asserted claims that arose from or depended on the collective bargaining rights created by the Act, absent a showing of corruption or fraud. Therefore, the trial court did not have jurisdiction to hear the case. In addition, when a labor contract set forth a grievance procedure to be used in resolving disputes between an employer and an employee, those procedures had to be exhausted prior to resorting to the courts. Th employee failed to avail himself of step four of the grievance procedure, which was to pursue arbitration of the issues.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant claimed he was not brought to trial in the prescribed time period. Defendant claimed that improper references were made to the fact that defendant had outstanding warrants for similar offenses and that the trial court improperly allowed evidence of police communications and gave a conflicting instruction regarding probable cause. Defendant argued that he was denied a fair trial when he was brought into the courtroom in the custody of a sheriff. Defendant also argued that his motion for acquittal should have been granted and that he should not have been sentenced for a third degree felony when only a first degree felony had been proved. The court held that: (1) defendant did not satisfy the triple-count statute,&nbsp;Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2945.71(E), because he was also being held pursuant to a parole violation and another warrant; (2) defendant was timely brought to trial; (3) errors to which defendant did not object at trial were not considered; (4) defendant's choice to wear prison clothing showed that he was in custody so being escorted by a sheriff was harmless; and (5) the elements of the offense were sufficiently established.</SPAN></P>

The landowners applied for a conditional use permit to allow the company to continue to operate in its building, but failed to appear at the public hearing. The Board denied the application, and the landowners sought review alleging that the Board erred in failing to give them notice of the hearing. The trial court upheld the findings of the Board, and the court found no error. The court found that written notice was mailed to the landowners at the only complete address that they provided, and further found that the landowners failed to offer any authority for the proposition that something more was required in order to demonstrate compliance with &sect; 519.15.

The owner contended that the car wash constituted an &quot;accessory building&quot; and that a variance was not required under Boardman Township, OH., Zoning Ordinances art. III. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that because of the uniquely different services provided by gasoline filling stations and car washes the intended car wash was not an accessory building but rather a separate building requiring compliance with the car wash section of the Boardman Township Zoning Ordinances. Furthermore, the owner failed to show that the Board's decision was unconstitutional, arbitrary, or capricious because the denial of the variance was substantially related to a legitimate concern for public safety as a result of increased traffic, water and ice accumulations, and other safety concerns. Finally, the owner failed to show that it had or would have suffered any unnecessary hardship by the enforcement of the zoning ordinance or the denial of the variance pursuant to Ohio Rev.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellants, a minor who was injured at an ice-skating rink and her mother, brought a negligence action against appellees, a local board of education and a local recreation department. The Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio) granted summary judgment to appellees on the basis of the statutory immunity provided by Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2477. Appellants sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">While skating at appellees' rink, the minor caught her ice skate in a hole and fell. In their negligence action, appellants alleged that appellees were negligence in caring for and maintaining the ice at the rink. After the trial court granted summary judgment to appellees on the ground of statutory immunity, appellants sought review, contending that appellees were not entitled to immunity under &sect; 2744 because their failure to repair the ice was wanton and reckless behavior and because the operation of the rink was a proprietary function. The court held that appellees' operation of the rink was a governmental rather than a proprietary function, for the purposes of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2744.02(C)(2)(u), because the ice rink clearly involved the operation of an indoor recreational facility. Any potential liability was barred by the application of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2744.02(A)(5) because the decision to repair or resurface the ice prior to skating activities involved the exercise of appellees' discretion and judgment vis-a-vis the use of equipment, supplies, and personnel.

Defendant had consented to the pictures of the residential property and the only pictures of the business property admitted could have been taken from off the premises. The ordinances were not vague for requiring compliance by the person who owned or controlled the property.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The husband argued that the trial court erred in its division of property between the parties, which resulted in an inequitable distribution of assets. He also argued that the trial court erred in ordering him to pay medical expenses incurred by their son after the son reached adulthood and erred in its calculations of the value of his pension, which resulted in its calculations of excessive marital assets. On appeal, the court held that the wife had only the portion of her inheritance from her stepfather that she used to purchase and pay for the marital home and that was directly traceable to the marital home as separate property. However, the court noted that it did not find the trial court's overvaluation of her separate property to be prejudicial in light of the court's equitable distribution of the assets. Further, the court held that the trial court erred in ordering the husband medical expenses for the son because the trial court's conclusion that this expense was incurred prior to their son's emancipation lacked support. Thus, that portion of the trial court's order was vacated. Finally, the pension was properly valued as a marital asset.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant challenged his conviction, arguing that his prior convictions were improperly revealed. However, the court found that defendant failed to object to the evidence. Furthermore, defendant opened the door on some of the information. Defendant was not denied due process because the case was allegedly rushed to trial. Moreover, the trial court did not err in charging the jury that it was not necessary to prove that defendant used a deadly weapon at trial. The trial court committed harmless error in its failure to instruct the jury as to the statutory definition of a firearm. Defendant waived the issue when he did not object at trial. The overwhelming evidence of the firearm rendered the court's failure to give the statutory definition harmless error. Finally, defendant was not denied due process when the court would not instruct upon the lesser included offense of assault. The evidence supporting defendant's conviction for felonious assault was too solid to support an acquittal of that crime. Because the evidence presented would not support an acquittal, the trial judge was not required to instruct the jury on the lesser included offense.</SPAN></P>

He was sentenced with a fine of $ 1,000 and a term of 180 days. The trial court suspended $ 500 of the fine and 120 days of incarceration and placed defendant on two years' probation, with conditions.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted for soliciting an undercover police officer stationed in an area known for prostitution. He offered her $ 40 and told her he wanted to &quot;get laid.&quot; Another officer witnessed the event prior to defendant's arrest. The trial court denied his motion to suppress statements to the officers and his motion for acquittal. On appeal, he argued that his statements should have been suppressed based on entrapment. The court affirmed, rejecting defendant's arguments based on the entrapment defense. The court found ample evidence of defendant's predisposition to commit soliciting, which showed that he failed to establish entrapment. The trial court thus did not err in failing to give an entrapment instruction to the jury. The court also held that the trial court did not err in denying the motion to suppress, finding unpersuasive defendant's argument that affording him an opportunity to commit the crime violated his Fourth Amendment rights. Nor did the trial court abuse its discretion in admitting evidence or in refusing to recommend defendant for a pretrial diversion program. Finally, the sentence was within the statutory guidelines and was not an abuse of discretion.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed defendant's conviction for one count of soliciting in violation of the municipal ordinance, and terminated any bail pending appeal.

The court reversed two of the arson convictions, finding that the trial court had erred in not tailoring the instructions in accordance with the State's bill of particulars as to the names of the specific persons to whom the State alleged defendant made an offer as to each count. The State was restricted in proof to the indictment and the bill of particulars. However, while the first count included all five offerees, the second and third counts of the bill of particulars alleged offers made to specific people on specific days. Had the jury been specifically instructed in accordance with the details of the bill of particulars, they could have concluded that defendant made offers to different people on those days, in which case defendant should have been acquitted of the latter two arson counts.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant claimed that the search was unconstitutional because his sister, who owned the property, lacked the authority to give the consent. The court held that the conviction was valid. The court found that defendant lacked an expectation of privacy and standing to challenge the search, despite his familial relationship, because he had no property interests in the places searched. The search of the car was valid, even though the sister had no proprietary or ownership interests in the car, because defendant had no proprietary or ownership interests in it either. Although defendant kept his belongings in the shed, the sister's consent to search it was valid because he had no lease arrangement for the shed and it was unlocked. Also, the sister had common authority over the shed, which validated her consent. The indictment was sufficient to advise defendant of the specifications. The court noted that defendant filed a motion for a bill of particulars in which he could have challenged the indictment. The photographs were properly admitted, though there was a delay in their delivery to defendant, because defendant failed to show any prejudice in the untimely delivery.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court affirmed and held that the State had a legitimate interest in preserving the financial soundness of its political subdivisions and its grant of immunity to appellees pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2744.02(A)(1) was related to that stated objective. The court also held that appellees consented to liability for incidents that occurred on some government property, but specifically excluded jails from that consent under Ohio Rev.

The court held that appellants failed to show that the police chief acted outside the scope of his employment, with a malicious purpose, in bad faith, or in a wanton or reckless manner, by allowing inmates to smoke, so he was also immune from suit pursuant to Ohio Rev.

The Common Pleas Court of Summit County (Ohio) entered judgment for plaintiffs and offset the award pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2317.45 with any collateral benefits received by the patron. The owner appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The patron, a sales representative, was taking a business client to lunch when he was injured. Although the trial court originally held a hearing to determine the amount of collateral workers' compensation benefits the patron received, it held that &sect; 2317.45 was unconstitutional. This ruling was reversed on appeal. On remand, the trial court held a second hearing to determine the amount of collateral benefits. The restaurant owner contended in part that it was error to hold this second hearing. The court disagreed, but held that the trial court erred in deducting attorney fees from the gross amount of collateral benefits. Under &sect; 2317.45(B)(2)(i), the trial court was required to determine, as best as possible, the amount of collateral benefits actually received and &quot;reasonably certain&quot; to be received by the patron over the next 60 months. The court found no abuse of discretion in the trial court's decision to take additional evidence to insure the accuracy of these calculations. Further, the court held that &sect; 2317.45(B)(2)(c)(ii) did not authorize the trial court to deduct attorney fees from collateral benefits. The term &quot;costs&quot; generally did not include attorney fees.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judgment of the trial court deducting attorney fees from the amount of the patron's collateral benefits was reversed.

The franchisee had filed an action seeking injunctive and declaratory relief on its claim that appellees failed to comply with the notice requirements of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 45174.50(A), thus depriving the franchisee of its due process rights.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The franchisee filed a notice of protest to the Board pursuant to &sect; 45174.50(A), against the franchisor's proposed establishment or relocation of another franchisee in the relevant market area. In addition, the franchisee filed an action for injunctive and declaratory relief, alleging that the franchisor's statutory notice issued in response to its protest was defective. The franchisee sought to stay the Board's proceedings. The trial court granted appellees' motion to dismiss. In affirming on appeal, the court held that the franchisee was involved in special statutory proceedings pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. ch. 4517, which would allow it to challenge the sufficiency of the franchisor's notice. Moreover, the franchisee had appeal rights under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. ch. 119, allowing it to challenge the Board's resolution of that issue. It was inappropriate for courts to grant declaratory judgments and injunctions that attempted to resolve matters committed to special judicial proceedings, unless the constitutionality of a statute was at issue. Because the franchisee did not contend that ch. 4517 was unconstitutional, the trial court properly dismissed the franchisee's action.</SPAN></P>

When the State determined that only one of the weapons discovered was an automatic weapon under Ohio Rev.

At trial, defendant was convicted of only one count of possession of a firearm while under a disability. Defendant sought review and argued that the jury instructions were improper because they made the elements of the firearm possession offense unconstitutionally vague.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant attorney general appealed from the judgment of the Court of Common Pleas of Richland County (Ohio) declaring sua sponte that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 311.01 was unconstitutional in plaintiff candidate's declaratory judgment action to determine whether he satisfied the qualifications for his candidacy for county sheriff under &sect; 311.01.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The candidate filed a declaratory judgment action against the state attorney general to determine whether he satisfied the qualifications of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 311.01 for the office of county sheriff. The candidate did not raise the issue of the statute's constitutionality. Nevertheless, the trial court entered judgment for the candidate and declared sua sponte that &sect; 311.01 was unconstitutional. The trial court also found as a matter of fact that the candidate met the requirements of &sect; 311.01. On appeal from the trial court's ruling on the constitutionality of &sect; 311.01, the court reversed the judgment. The court ruled that courts were not to decide constitutional questions unless absolutely necessary. The court stated that the record clearly demonstrated that it was not absolutely necessary for the trial court to delve into the issue of whether &sect; 311.01 was constitutional. Accordingly, the court held that the trial court erred in determining that issue.</SPAN></P>
