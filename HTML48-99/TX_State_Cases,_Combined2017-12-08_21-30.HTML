Plaintiffs sought a declaratory judgment construing certain provisions of Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 6675a-2 as to the meaning of machinery used solely for the purpose of drilling water wells. Plaintiffs also sought an injunction against defendants, prohibiting them from arresting or prosecuting plaintiffs for the operation of certain vehicles used in drilling water wells over the state highways. Finally, plaintiffs asked that the court issue a writ of mandamus ordering defendants to authorize defendant tax collector to issue limited vehicle registration plates to plaintiffs. The trial court awarded judgment to plaintiffs. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded the case with instructions to dismiss, finding that there was no allegation that the vehicle registration acts were unconstitutional.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant steel contractors sought review from a judgment entered in the 53rd District Court at Austin (Texas) that denied appellants' request for a declaratory judgment invalidating appellee commission's order that materials used had to be manufactured within the United States. Appellants contended appellee's order was invalid per se because it prohibited competitive bidding for government contracts as required by Tex. Civ. Stat. art 6674h .</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee commission passed an order restricting the use of materials by contractors engaged in building highways and other facilities to those manufactured in the United States, its territories or possessions. Appellant steel contractors sued for a declaratory judgment invalidating the order and for injunctive relief. Eventually, the trial court rendered judgment in favor of appellee on the grounds that appellants had failed to show &quot;that Minute Order 48644 was not reasonably related to the assurance of reliable sources of supply&quot; of steel materials, and citing the jury finding that the evidence did not show the order resulted in increased cost of such materials to the state, rendered judgment for appellee. The court reversed the judgment because appellee's order directly contradicted the statutory mandate of Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art 6674h, that all contract proposals for highway improvements were to be submitted by competitive bids.</SPAN></P>

Appellees filed their controverting plea of privilege seeking to hold venue in the original jurisdiction by virtue of Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 1995, &sect;&sect; 23, 27. The trial court denied appellant's request. The court reversed and ordered that the case be transferred.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff The State of Texas initiated an action to obtain a writ of mandamus against respondent District Judge to compel him to proceed to hear and try a lawsuit for writ of temporary injunction filed by the State against respondent beach corporation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The beach corporation filed an action for a declaratory judgment that it was the owner of 384 acres of beach on Galveston Island and that neither the State of Texas, its subdivisions, nor the public or any member of the public, had any easement or any right or claim to the land above the line of mean low tide. The beach corporation then announced that it was about to erect barricades on the beach to prevent vehicular traffic. The State sought a temporary injunction. The trial judge ordered that no further proceedings were to be held until the appellate courts had passed on the constitutionality of Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. art. 5415-d, the &quot;Open Beaches&quot; statute. The State sought a writ of mandamus. The sole issue was whether the trial judge was required to proceed to trial of the State's application for temporary injunction. On appeal, the court held that the refusal of the trial judge to hear and determine the State's application for temporary injunction was a clear abuse of the discretion that the trial judge had in connection with the handling of the trial court's docket.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court ordered that a hearing by the trial court on the State's application for temporary injunction was to commence within 60 days from the date that its opinion became final and that no writ would actually issue unless its order was not complied with.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, a city and school district, sought review of the judgments of the District Court of Hays County (Texas) that they take nothing in their action and cross-action asserting liens and seeking to recover alleged delinquent taxes levied and assessed against certain automobiles owned by appellee taxpayer, who claimed that the assessments were unconstitutionally discriminatory and arbitrary.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city and school district assessed taxes against the taxpayer's automobiles but not against his other personal property, including bank accounts. The district court ruled that this singling out of automobiles violated Tex. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 7189 and Tex. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 8, which required that all property be taxed uniformly and equally. The city and school district were denied relief and they appealed. In reversing, the appellate court ruled that the rights of the city and school district to taxes on the automobiles were not lost by their negligent failure to assess taxes against the taxpayer's other personal property. Also, the taxpayer failed to meet his burden of establishing that the omission operated to his substantial injury. That is, he failed to show that his taxes were excessive or substantially higher because of the omission of the taxable property. Under Tex. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 1060, the city had a tax lien on the automobiles. However, no similar statutory lien existed in favor of the school district. Prior authority allowing a lien for school districts was repealed by Tex. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 2758 (Vernon 1927).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment against the city was reversed and judgment was rendered in favor of the city for the amount of taxes due, plus penalties and interest, together with foreclosure of its tax lien against the taxpayer's automobiles. The judgment against the school district was reversed in part and judgment was rendered in its favor for the amount of taxes due, plus penalties and interest.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant taxpayers challenged a decision of a trial court (Texas), which refused to grant their action for an injunction against appellee, Memorial Villages Water Authority, a private corporation, and persons composing the Board of Supervisors of the Authority, to prevent the construction of a sanitary sewer system.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An election was held to determine whether the Authority was to issue bonds for the purpose of purchasing, constructing, etc., a waterworks and sanitary sewer system. The election was also to determine whether the payment of bonds was to be financed through the levy and collection of a tax. The election resulted in a favorable vote for the bonds and tax. The taxpayers argued that Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 8280-271 prevented the Authority from operating a sanitary sewer system and bonds voted for such purpose were therefore invalid because the Memorial Villages Supply Corporation was operating a sanitary sewer system in the territorial limits of the Authority. The court rejected the argument concluding that the sanitary sewer system in operation was not within the meaning of the statute a &quot;public&quot; sanitary sewer system because it was operated by a private corporation. The court stated that its services were available to the members of the public who desired them and who paid the fees charged, but that this did not change the system to a public system within the meaning of the statute.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parties were run-off candidates in a primary election for the office of county tax assessor-collector. The party executive committee canvassed the votes and found that appellee received 2741 and appellant 2739. The District Court of Upshur County (Texas), after a lengthy trial, ordered appellee certified as the party's nominee on the basis of 2720 votes for him and 2719 votes for appellant. Appellant sought review and appellee cross-appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant questioned over 100 ballots that the trial judge ordered tallied for appellee. His primary argument was that certain requirements of Tex. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 5.05 and Tex. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 8.13 were mandatory, and that failure to perform each specific requirement in the absentee voting process voided a ballot. The court disagreed, holding that statutes tending to abridge the voting franchise were confined to their narrowest limits by liberally interpreting them in favor of the citizen's right to vote. The trial court impliedly found no fraud as to the manner in which the carrier envelopes and absentee ballots were handled. The court affirmed that finding, holding that the trial court properly ordered the ballots counted. The record showed no abuse of discretion by the trial court in recounting the ballots in a particular ballot box on appellee's allegations of irregularity. Nor was reversible error shown for the trial court's failure to compare the ballots and ballot stubs in the box, as appellant had protested when appellee requested such a comparison. The court sustained two cross-points asserting that two votes were added in error to the votes cast for appellant.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's judgment and ordered that the mandate be issued instanter. In view of the fact that the questions involved would be moot before the expiration of the time ordinarily allowed to seek a rehearing or before questions could be certified to the Texas Supreme Court and answered, it was further ordered that no motion for rehearing or motion to certify questions to the supreme court could be filed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff commenced proceedings against the insurer in Taylor County. The insurer filed a plea of privilege. The court overruled the plea pursuant to Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 1995(27). The court reversed and remanded the action with directions that the case be transferred to Lubbock County. The portion of art. 1995 relied upon by plaintiff was unconstitutional, in violation of U.S. Const. amend. XIV, because venue could be maintained against a foreign corporation by merely proving that the company had an agency or a representative in the county, whereas, under art. 1995(23), a cause of action had to also be proved against a domestic corporation to maintain venue in the county. Thus, venue against foreign corporations was wider than that afforded to domestic corporations. Moreover, prior case law held that statute to be unconstitutional, as a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Citizens and taxpayers within the area of a regional water authority brought an action against the authority claiming that the act that created it, Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 8280, &sect; 193, was unconstitutional. The citizens and taxpayers claimed that the statute deprived them of a republican form of government, was a local law, disfranchised them, and deprived them of their property without due process of law. They sought to enjoin the authority from assessing and collecting taxes. The lower court found in favor of the authority, and the citizens and taxpayers appealed. On appeal, the court found no evidence in the federal or state constitutions that the citizens and taxpayers were being deprived of a republican form of government. The court found that the results of an election held by the towns in the region favored the issuance of bonds for the purpose of providing a source of water supply to be repaid from ad valorem taxes on all taxable property in the region. The court held that the argument of the citizens and taxpayers that they were disfranchised and deprived of their property without due process of law was without merit.</SPAN></P>

Ann. art. 886 and 887 (1925) and sought a temporary injunction against the court of inquiry. The trial court denied the injunction and the probate judge appealed. The court affirmed, based on precedent from the Supreme Court of Texas, which the court was bound to follow. The court noted that only the district attorney could call witnesses, there would be no right of cross-examination, and no right to counsel. Although the proceeding was investigative only, the court expressed its concern about whether the requirements of due process were met but held that the statute had been upheld by precedent that was binding on the court. The probate court judge had not been held in contempt and was not in the position to contest the validity of art. 887. Nevertheless, the court distinguished cases relied on to challenge the statute because the proceedings in this action were to be public.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A court of inquiry was convened to investigate certain practices in the handling of estates by a probate court. The probate court judge prayed for a temporary injunction to prevent the inquiry from going forward. The trial court denied that prayer and the judge perfected an appeal from that decision. The judge then filed a supplemental petition for a temporary injunction on the ground that, after the court of inquiry began, nine indictments were returned against him by a grand jury on the same matters being investigated by the court of inquiry. The trial court rejected appellees' argument that it did not have jurisdiction to hear the supplemental petition. The trial court then denied that petition. On appeal, the court agreed that the trial court had jurisdiction to hear the supplemental petition. The court held that it was proper for the court of inquiry to continue. However, the court held that appellees could only investigate those matters that were not the subject matters of the indictments.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee had brought an action seeking to enjoin appellant from issuing a certificate of authority to intervenor.

The court held that since appellee had presented evidence of a probable right and probable injury if the order was issued, the trial court had jurisdiction to enjoin appellant to preserve the status quo. The court went on to hold that the case should be tried under the de novo standard of review, rather than the substantial evidence rule, pursuant to Tex. Ins. Code art. 3.04, &sect; 3.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Texas Real Estate Commission refused to renew the license of a real estate salesman when the broker employing the salesman advised the Commission that the broker did not desire the salesman licensed as his employee. The salesman reapplied with a different broker, but the renewal was refused again. The refusal was upheld on administrative appeal before the Commission. The salesman sought judicial review, and the lower court affirmed that the Commission's order was supported by substantial evidence and was not arbitrary, capricious, illegal or improper. The salesman appealed the judgment of the lower court, claiming that the Commission's order was required by Tex. Civ. Stat. Art. 6573a to be supported by a preponderance of the evidence, not by substantial evidence. On appeal, the court found that the Commission in its order was exercising the legislative function of license granting. The statute relied upon by the salesman was void because it conflicted with Tex. Const. art. II. &sect; 1, in that the statute commanded the lower court to do other in reviewing the factual basis of the order than determine whether or not the order had reasonable support in the evidence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The father was guilty of cruel treatment toward his wife as to render their living together as husband and wife insupportable to her.

Ann. art. 4639a, &sect; 1 as amended by H.R. 436, 57th Leg. (1961), where Tex. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 4639a, &sect; 1 (as amended) was allegedly unconstitutional because it violated Tex. Const. art. 5, &sect;&sect; 1, 8. Article 5, &sect; 8 did not authorize the Legislature to take away the general control of minors from the district court. The amendment placed the child's well being solely in the jury's hands and made the district court impotent to do what was in the child's best welfare. The district court had the duty to take into consideration all of the facts relating to the child in order to form an intelligent judgment on what was the child's best interest. The amendment struck down the judicial interpretation given to Tex. Const. art. 5, &sect;&sect; 8, 16. The amendment was unconstitutional. The constitutional duty to minors placed upon the district court should not have been limited by the Legislature.</SPAN></P>

The judgment awarding the divorce of the parties was affirmed; otherwise, the judgment was reversed and remanded as stated in the opinion with respect to the child custody award. There was reversible error in admitting hearsay evidence, a letter. All remaining points were overruled.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The son was killed when struck by a car driven by the driver. A trial commenced to a jury but upon the father resting his case, the trial court instructed the jury to return a verdict for the driver. The driver's motion for an instructed verdict was based on the ground that the father had not made out a prima facie case and that there was no evidence introduced by the father to show any specific act of negligence on the part of the driver. In passing upon the propriety of the trial court's action in instructing a verdict, the court viewed the evidence in a light most favorable to the father, indulging against the instruction every inference that could be properly drawn from the evidence. The court found that the trial court had improperly taken judicial knowledge and notice of the posted speed limits at the place of the accident. In the absence of conclusive evidence that the Highway Commission had altered the prima facie speed limits as authorized by statute, the father should have been permitted to plead and offer proof that the highway at the locale of the accident was a business district as defined by statute.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, both individually and as executrix and trustee, filed an appeal of a judgment of the 146th Judicial District Court of Bell County (Texas), setting aside an order of a county court admitting to probate the will of the testator and declaring such instrument to be a nullity. The judgment was entered in a will contest filed by appellee will contestant.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following the probate of the will and the appointment of appellant, the contestant instituted separate proceedings under the provisions of Tex. Prob. Code Ann. &sect; 93 to contest the will. The county judge, sitting in probate, without the aid of a jury had a hearing on the contest, and judgment was rendered denying the contest. The contestant's appeal was tried de novo and the only special issue submitted was whether at the time the testator executed the instrument in question he was acting under the undue influence of appellant, to which the jury answered &quot;Yes.&quot; The trial court then entered a judgment denying probate of the will. The court held that in an action brought to set aside the probate of a will under the provisions of Tex. Prob. Code Ann. &sect; 93, all persons named in the will were necessary parties. The absence of necessary or indispensable parties constituted fundamental error that could be raised for the first time on appeal. The failure of the contestant to make all of the persons named in the will parties defendant in the will contest proceedings constituted fundamental error that required reversal.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The worker was killed as the result of a work-related accident. The worker's estate filed an action for death benefits under the Texas Workmen's Compensation Act. The trial court awarded benefits to the estate. On review, the estate argued that the trial court used the wrong formula in determining the worker's average weekly wages. The court found that the statute that provided the computation for weekly wages was amended after the worker's death. Prior to the amendment, Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 8309, &sect; 1-3 provided that average weekly wage would be determined based on the whole of the year. The statute was later amended for wages to be based on the past 210 days. The court found that there was no indication that the statute was to be applied retrospectively. The court concluded that even though the statute was remedial in nature there was still no indication from the legislature that it was to be applied retrospectively. Therefore, the trial court's decision was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of a judgment in its taxpayer refund suit in the 53rd District Court of Travis County (Texas), that the Texas franchise tax was constitutional. Appellant contended the tax was in violation of Tex. Const. art. 8 &sect; 1, and U.S. Const. amend. XIV.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant paid its franchise tax, Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Chapter 12, Title 122A, under protest, and then sued for refund, arguing it was unconstitutionally discriminatory, because the tax was not levied on national banks in the state, in violation of Tex. Const. art. 8, &sect; 1, and the equal protection clause of U.S. Const. amend. XIV. The lower court found that 12 U.S.C.S. &sect; 548, permitted states to tax national banks in four enumerated ways, but that the franchise tax was not based on one of the enumerated bases, and that the franchise tax was not unconstitutionally discriminatory. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that national banks and state banks were not in the same class, because national banks could not have the franchise tax levied on them. Appellant had not complained of inequality within the classification; therefore, the franchise tax was constitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the decision that the franchise tax was constitutional because it applied only to corporations chartered or authorized to do business in Texas.

Const. art. 8, &sect; 19. The nursery stock did not meet the requirements that it had to be &quot;farm products&quot; and that the taxpayer was the &quot;producer.&quot; The trees and bushes were started by grafting and budding on large nursery farms and transferred to the taxpayer who conducted its retail and wholesale business on several city lots within the city. The taxpayer was not a farmer but a merchant conducting a retail, and to some extent wholesale, business.

The court ruled that courts of civil appeals like it had appellate jurisdiction coextensive of their respective districts, extending to all civil cases of which the district courts or county courts had original or appellate jurisdiction, under such restrictions and regulations as might have been prescribed by law. The court found that the State's appeal sought to have the court, which was clothed with civil jurisdiction, to strike down and declare invalid a provision of the Code of Criminal Procedure which had to do with the filing and prosecution of criminal misdemeanor cases in justice of the peace courts. The court found that the record did not demonstrate a question involving any private property rights or the redress of a private wrong. Further, the court found that no contention was made that any civil action arose out of the transaction.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State sought to restrain the transportation company from operating its trucks on public highways without having first obtained a certificate of public convenience or a permit.

The court held that the fact that the statute itself did not provide for notice and the right to a hearing was not grounds upon which to invalidate the statute because such notice requirements were found under Tex.

Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 6687b. The motorist argued that the summary procedure was inapplicable to an appeal from an administrative decision, that a trial was required, and that art. 6687b was void.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The motorist asserted that the issue on appeal from an administrative decision was whether that decision was supported by substantial evidence. He argued that the question of whether there was substantial evidence to support the decision in his case could only be determined after an evidentiary proceeding, and therefore, that it had been inappropriate to grant summary judgment. The motorist also claimed that Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 6887b, &sect; 22(c), which provided that under no circumstances was the substantial-evidence rule ever to be used or applied to appeals prosecuted under the act, was void because it conflicted with the application of the substantial-evidence rule that the trial court had been required to apply in reviewing the administrative decision to suspend his driver's license. On appeal, the court found that the courts in a number of cases had held that summary procedure was appropriate in an action of the present kind. The court further held that it was not necessary to rule on the motorist's argument regarding the validity of the statute because the record did not show that the lower court had resorted to or applied the substantial-evidence rule.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The injunction was granted because the county ignored those parts of Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat.

It did not use all of the property and it then advertised the unused portions for sale at public auction. The owners claimed that art. 1577 gave them preference rights to purchase. On appeal, the court held that the caption of art. 1577 was too restrictive to embrace those portions, which granted the claimed preference rights. The caption limited preference rights to a sale of right-of-way property, which was conveyed by the state to the county but art. 1577 contained no such limitation. The trial court should have decided the issue without resort to house and senate journals. Since the caption limited preference rights and since the court could not go behind art. 1577, which would have accorded preference rights to the owners, the county properly proceeded with a sale at public auction. The sale should not have been enjoined.</SPAN></P>

The City appealed, arguing that inasmuch as the minerals were excepted from the taking, the trial court erred in refusing to limit the jury's consideration to the value of the surface estate. The owner argued that the reservoir would cover the surface of the land and, in effect, would destroy the value of the minerals. The court noted that after the condemnation the owner would still have title to the remaining portion of his tract and noted further that there was some evidence that directional drilling for oil and gas under the property taken could be conducted from the remaining tract. The court concluded that the trial court should have limited the jury's consideration to the value of the surface, but stated that the error could be eliminated if the owner would file a remittitur of $ 10 per acre, which the owner's witnesses testified was the value of the mineral estate.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The divorce decree incorporated the terms of a property settlement agreement that awarded the bulk of the property to the husband. The wife waived her appearance at the divorce trial and the husband had testified that the settlement was fair and equitable. The wife sought to set aside the property settlement portion of the decree, claiming that she entered into the agreement under duress and that the husband had fraudulently concealed the value of the community estate. The court, in affirming the judgment denying the bill of review, determined that, even if the agreement was unfair, the wife was not entitled to a new trial on that basis alone. Noting that, under Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. art. 4638, a judgment dividing marital property was not the same as a voluntary partition, permitted under the Texas Constitution, of marital property during a marriage, the court reasoned that the property settlement was not unfair merely because it was unequal. In addition, the court rejected the wife's motion for a rehearing and determined that, although one member of the court did not participate in the decision, such fact did not preclude the remaining members from lawfully proceeding.</SPAN></P>

The city claimed that it was liable only for the pro rata part of the taxes. The assessor contended that Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 7151 (as amended 1951) was unconstitutional. The trial court ruled in favor of the city. The court held that article 7151 did not violate Tex. Const. art. VIII, &sect;&sect; 1 and 2, Tex. Const. art. XI, &sect; 9, or Tex. Const. art. III, &sect; 35. Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 7151 (as amended 1951) effectuated the provisions of the Texas Constitution exempting property owned by the city. It resulted in equal taxation, and exemption for the city, as required by the Constitution. All that article 7151 did was make the provisions of the original act applicable to &quot;any other body politic.&quot; It complied with Tex. Const. art. III, &sect; 35 and was, therefore, valid.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs as trustees and the trust sued defendants, a certain individual, along with the county judge and the county commissioners court to set aside an order from the commissioners' court declaring a county roadway to be a public highway.

After trial, the injunction was made permanent and the order from the commissioners court was set aside. Defendants contended that the commissioners court did not abuse its discretion. The court reversed. The selection and laying out of public roads was a matter that is vested in the commissioners court and in the exercise of that duty its orders could only have been set aside where there was such a gross abuse of its discretion as to amount to fraudulent, capricious or arbitrary action.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant city sought review of a decision of the District Court, Winkler County (Texas), which issued a temporary injunction in an action brought by the State of Texas on the relation of appellees, a county judge and members of a commissioners' court, by information in quo warranto, to enjoin the passage on second reading of an annexation ordinance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city argued that the district court erred in restraining the passage of the annexation ordinance on second reading, because such restraint was an unwarranted judicial interference with a legislative act. On appeal, the court held that at the time the quo warranto proceeding was initiated, the relevant ordinance was still in the process of being enacted. It had not been passed on second reading and the legislative process through which it might become law had not yet been completed. No effort had been made to enforce its provisions upon anyone. The court held that the case was not one in which the mere passage of the ordinance, in the absence of any attempt to enforce the same, could or would result in irreparable harm or injury to the judge and the other members of the commissioners' court. Thus, a proceeding in quo warranto to enjoin passage of the ordinance was premature. It had not been shown that probable harm would result from the mere passage of the ordinance. Accordingly, the district erred in restraining the passage of the annexation ordinance under the facts and circumstances of the case.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city issued an ordinance, which rezoned certain property by special permit. The ordinance was passed after public hearings before the city council. The area had previously been zoned for single family dwellings and had been used by the Jesuit order for use as a orphans home. The property was also used as a school. The ordinance rezoned the area for the use of multiple story apartments, hotels, retail shots, and office buildings. The property owners brought an action against the city and its building inspector for a permanent injunction asserting that the ordinance was unconstitutional. The trial court denied the injunction. On appeal, the court affirmed. It was not reversible hearing for the city to hold public hearings on the rezoning before a zoning committed that consisted of the city plan commission rather than the whole commission. All the rules and regulations of the city plan commission were followed. The court also found that the city plan commission offered a recommendation and that the ordinance was passed only after a public hearing before the city counsel. Thus the owners rights were not harmed because of the procedure followed in the enactment of the ordinance.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayers alleged that art. 2786e was unconstitutional on the grounds that it contravened Tex. Const. art. VII, &sect; 3. Specifically, they alleged that the indebtedness owed to the bank was not to be repaid from current revenues of the district, but was a deficiency debt payable only from revenues of future years; and that payment thereof constituted illegal expenditure of tax funds contrary to the Constitution. On appeal from the denial of a temporary injunction, the court held that it was unable to find language in &sect; 3 that prohibited legislative authorization of time warrants. The court found nothing in &sect; 3 that prohibited the legislature from making the warrants payable from any available funds. Moreover, there was no limitation in &sect; 3 that deficiency debts could not have been made a charge on proceeds of maintenance taxes. Section 3 did not require a special election at the time the warrants were issued, and there was no contention that maintenance taxes available were not properly voted. Thus, the statute did not unconstitutionally authorize issuance of warrants payable from taxes without an election at which the tax was voted.</SPAN></P>

The trial court overruled a plea in abatement filed by the landowners and entered judgment in favor of the district and the landowners. On appeal, the court applied stare decisis in upholding the constitutionality of Tex. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 7880-147c1 through Tex. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 147c6a. Also, the court held that the trial court was correct in holding that Tex. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 7880-147c6 was severable from Tex. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 7880-147c1 through 147c5. Tex. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 147c6 provided that a city or town in a district was a separate voting precinct. It was not necessary to address the constitutionality of Tex. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 7880-147c6. The outcome of the election did not in any way depend upon its provisions. Because a majority of the voters in the entire district voted to abolish the water district, there could have been no discrimination against the city voters.

The taxpayers that brought the class action had two goals: to obtain a declaratory judgment that the Act was unconstitutional, and to enjoin the authority from assessing and collecting its taxes for that reason. The trial court dismissed the action and the taxpayers appealed. On review, the court held that quo warranto proceedings were the sole and exclusive remedy by which the legality of a public corporation could be questioned and attacked. The court also held that the alleged unconstitutionality of the Act by which certain cities were not taxed the same as rural areas failed for lack of evidence. The cities had the option to chose by popular vote whether or not to participate in the Act, and the taxpayers had no evidence whether or not any of the cities had exercised that option. Therefore, the relief sought was premature.

The commissioners court ruled in favor of the proponents. The contestants appealed to the trial court. The trial court held that under the provisions of Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat.

Upon their refusal to proceed, the petition for creation of a district was refused. The proponents contended that &sect; 18 was unconstitutional. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment and held that the trial court properly ruled that the substantial evidence rule did not apply. The court ruled that while &sect; 18 did not use the words de novo, the very language used made clear that the dominant intent of the legislature was to provide a full and complete new trial in the trial court. The court held that the trial was not limited to the substantial evidence rule and that &sect; 18 provided for a de novo trial in its broadest sense.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the oil well operators produced gas in excess of the amount fixed by the Commission, the Commission ordered the shutting of the wells until the overproduction was overcome. When the oil well operators filed an action against the Commission and its members, the trial court found the proration order to be void and it enjoined enforcement of the Henze-type shut in order. On appeal, the court reversed, holding that the Commissions orders were properly promulgated against the oil well operators because the Commission complied with the terms of Tex. Civ. Stat. art. 6008 by allocating the monthly reservoir allowable among all oil wells. Although the allowable per well was not prospectively fixed, Tex. Const. art. 1, &sect; 16 and U.S. Const. amend. XIV were not violated because the oil well producers had no vested right to oil in excess of their fair share and the fair share could only be accurately and finally determined after actual production and the expiration of each month. Because the Texas Legislature devised a scheme to meet the practical problems in guaranteeing to each producer his fair share of the gas and that scheme was followed, the Commission's orders were valid.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee offered certain investment type insurance policies. Before amendment, Tex. Rev. Civ.

After a hearing, the Commissioner of Insurance ruled that appellee's forms for investment type policies required approval by the Board or the Commissioner (appellants), and on appeal, the Board affirmed the Commissioner. On appeal, the trial court ruled that, by operation of law, appellee's forms were approved for use as they were on file prior to the amendment of article 342. On appeal, the court reversed, holding that in accordance with the legislative history and letter of the statute, appellee's forms required approval by appellants through affirmative action; thus appellee's forms could not be approved by operation of law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner's property was originally zoned for residential purposes. The owner made several applications to the city's council to have the property rezoned for retail purposes, which were denied by the city.

The case was submitted to a jury, which found for the owner. The city then filed a motion for a judgment notwithstanding the verdict, which the trial court granted. On appeal, the court held that the owner had an extraordinary burden of showing that no conclusive or controversial facts or conditions existed that authorized the city to exercise its discretion in denying the applications. The court stated that the owner did not meet her burden of showing that the city acted arbitrarily or unreasonably in denying her the requested zoning change, noting that the record was replete with debatable facts that rendered the question one of law and not of fact. The court concluded, therefore, that it was not for the jury or the trial court to substitute its findings for that of the city's legislative body.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On March 28, 1950, the Board issued the litigant a license to practice pharmacy in Texas.

The litigant alleged in December 1959, he tendered to the Board payment for his renewal fee together with the required affidavit. The Board refused to renew the license on the basis that their records showed the litigant did not attend and graduate from a reputable university, school, or college of pharmacy, which met the requirements of the Board. On appeal, the Board argued that it was error to require the Board to issue a 1960 renewal license to the litigant because he failed to prove he possessed the minimum statutory qualifications for a license to practice pharmacy in Texas. The court held that: (1) in applying for a renewal license, the litigant met all statutory requirements; (2) the Board did not have authority, by ex parte proceedings, to deny the renewal; and (3) in this proceeding the litigant was not required to plead and prove that he possessed the statutory requirements for the issuance of a license.</SPAN></P>

(Tex. 1959).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Board construed the provisions of new legislation, which required wholesalers to pay an increased tax on their existing inventories, to apply also to retailers. The retailers argued that the legislature did not intend to impose a new tax on their existing inventories. Further, since no such subject was expressed in the Act's title, as required by Tex. Const. art. III, &sect; 35, retailers had no notice of the prospective tax. The court found that the Act was intended to recodify the provisions of Tex. Penal Code Ann. art. 666-21 (1959 Supp.). Under art. 666-21, a tax was levied only on first sale by wholesalers; no tax was levied on liquor in the possession of retailers. In fact, retailers were forbidden by law from purchasing tax stamps and could not pay liquor tax by affixing stamps. Since the legislature expressed in the Act's title that it was intended to amend art. 666-21, the Act was limited to matters imposing a tax on wholesalers, not retailers. Moreover, if the Act was construed as imposing a new tax on the inventories of retailers, the tax would be unconstitutional because such subject was not expressed in the title of the Act, as required by the Texas Constitution.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a proposition for urban renewal lost, the contestants alleged that a material number of voters who voted against the proposition were not eligible to vote because they had not duly rendered their property for taxation as the Texas Constitution required. The parties stipulated that at the time of the election, the particular voters referred to had not voluntarily submitted rendition slips listing property for taxation, no property appeared in the names of the voters on the rolls, and no rendition sheet appeared in the office of the tax assessor in the names of those voters. On appeal, the court noted that there were a number of ways in which it could be shown that a voter had duly rendered his property for taxation although it might not appear on the tax rolls in his name. Reversing, the court held that summary judgment in favor of the contestees was not warranted because their motion for summary judgment did not negative the existence of genuine material issues of fact as to whether the voters did nor did not have property on the tax rolls rendered by some other person in the name of some other person.</SPAN></P>

The homeowner brought suit against the creditors and his stepchildren, pleading statutory trespass to try title involving the property.

On appeal, the court held that there was there sufficient evidence to support the jury's finding that one of the notices was not posted in a public place. However, the court reversed for a new trial because the evidence was insufficient as to the issue of the property's value and its rental value. The court determined that the homeowner's expert witness was qualified, however, his testimony was based on erroneous assumptions of fact. Specifically, the record showed that the witness did not see or inspect the property until two months before trial, but nevertheless testified as to its value five years earlier. The court noted that the testimony would have been proper if it were framed as a hypothetical question had been propounded to him describing the condition of the house.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee New York corporation owned real and personal property located in Texas. Appellee purchased insurance covering Texas risks from insurer domiciled in England. Each insurance agreement contracted for was delivered and paid for in New York. The insurer was not authorized to write insurance in Texas. Any investigation or adjustment of losses was conducted between appellee's agent and the insurer's agent in New York. The insurer did not solicit appellee's business within Texas. All decisions regarding the insurer were made in New York, and losses on policies and premiums were payable in New York. Texas levied a tax on appellee for premiums appellee paid on policies purchased from the insurer at the rate of five percent of the gross premiums, in accordance with Tex. Ins. Code Ann. art. 21.38, &sect; 2(e). Appellee successfully challenged the statute's constitutionality in the trial court. On the basis of United States Supreme Court precedent, the court of civil appeals affirmed. The tax was not a tax on an occupation performed in Texas, but rather it was more of a fine for conducting business outside the state that related to insuring property inside the state.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment granting a recovery of the taxes paid was affirmed. The taxing statute was found to have been unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants argued that the trustees had appealed to the school authorities prior to filing the action in the lower court and that such action constituted an election under Tex.

The trustees attacked the board's orders as being violative of the constitution and without lawful authority. Under the allegations, the court held that the lower court had jurisdiction to the exclusion of the school authorities. Therefore, it reversed the judgment. The court found that because the trustees alleged matters within the exclusive jurisdiction of the lower court, it erred in sustaining the plea to the jurisdiction and dismissing the case.</SPAN></P>

The court reasoned that art. 13.43a would authorize a district court to hear and determine the rights of a winning candidate and declare him to be the loser in a judicial or statutory proceeding of which he had no notice. The court ruled that it was not sufficient for purposes of due process that a party might have accidentally heard of a recount conducted under the provisions of art. 13.43a and filed an answer and thereby acquired a right to his day in court.</SPAN></P>

The employee was injured in the line of duty as a city fireman. However, the city argued that the fireman had failed to exhaust his administrative remedies and failed to provide it with proper notice. The court found that there were no administrative remedies that the fireman had neglected. Further, the court found that the employee had filed proper notice with his supervisor within 24 hours of becoming aware that he had a serious injury. Thus, there was no notice issue in the case. The fireman established in the record that he had sustained an injury in the course and scope of his employment and that his absence from work was as a result of his injury.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant State of Texas sought review of an order by the 98th District Court (Texas), which denied the State's request, under Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 4646b, for a permanent injunction to prevent appellee lender from continuing with its usurious lending practices. A key issue on appeal was whether Tex. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 1524a-1, which purportedly authorized the lender to engage in a certificate plan of lending, was constitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State unsuccessfully sought to enjoin the lender from engaging in a type of lending known as a &quot;certificate plan,&quot; based on the State's belief that the plan was usurious. The court reversed the district court's order that denied the State's request for an injunction, enjoined the lender from pursuing its plan, and found that the plan involved usurious lending. In its ruling, the court followed a previous decision and reiterated that Tex. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 1524a-1, which purportedly authorized the lender's plan, was unconstitutional. In rejecting the district court's finding that the loans in question were not usurious, the court considered both components of the lender's loan plan as being one contract. Accordingly, the payments on one part of the plan constituted a repayment on the associated note, which resulted in the collection of usurious interest.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the order and rendered a judgment that granted the State's request for a permanent injunction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An election was held in a county precinct and the voters approved the sale of alcoholic beverages in that area. All parties agreed that there had been no procedural irregularities in the election. The issue presented was whether a subdivision of a county was barred from voting &quot;wet&quot; if the county in which such subdivision was located was &quot;dry,&quot; unless or until the county as a whole voted for the sale of alcohol. The court noted that previously there could have been a &quot;dry&quot; enumerated subdivision within a &quot;wet&quot; county but not a &quot;wet&quot; subdivision within a &quot;dry&quot; county. However, the legislative intent was to change the law. The court noted that if the legislature intended to prohibit &quot;wet&quot; areas in a &quot;dry&quot; county they could easily have done so in the statutes. Therefore, the court concluded that the portion of the county that held the election had the legal right to an election to determine the local option status of that area, and the trial court was in error in its judgment holding to the contrary.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court's judgment and rendered the opinion that the election was lawful and valid.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The authority sought to acquire lands to construct reservoirs using the procedure set out in art. 7880-126. The previous version of that article had been held unconstitutional as it granted the authority the power to appoint the board of appraisement and did not provide for a hearing prior to the submission of the boards' report. The new version provided that the authority was to nominate a tribunal for appointment by the district court. The trial court found that the new version of the article violated the landowners' due process rights and the court affirmed. A comparison of both versions of the action reflected that the two were almost identical as the method of operation of the board of appraisement under the old act, which was previously declared unconstitutional, was carried forward into the new act. As the re-enactment of a statute after it was construed by the highest court of a state carried with it the construction previously placed upon it by the court, the court had no alternative but to find the new version of art. 7880-126 to be unconstitutional. Further, a requirement for a full hearing prior to the entry of the tribunal's report could not be read into the article.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant insurers filed applications to continue existing deviations from the maximum rates for fire insurance fixed and promulgated by the Board, acting under Tex.

The court set aside the Board's order on the grounds that the Board failed to state its reasons for such denial as required by the code. A subsequent order was entered by the Board following another hearing on the subject matter, from which appellants appealed. Appellants argued, inter alia, that if judgment was based on the grounds that the proposed rates were not adequate, were not unfairly discriminatory, would not constitute uniform percentage deviations, or were not applied to reasonable territories, then as a matter of law the trial court erred. The appellate court affirmed, holding, inter alia, that appellants failed to establish that the proposed rates were not unfairly discriminatory.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The insurer sought review of the trial court's decision, denying the declaratory relief sought by the insurer through a petitioned ruling by the trial court that the whole of art. 5.26, as amended, was inoperative after the appellate court's prior finding that the provisions of art. 5.26, precluding the application of the substantial evidence rule and requiring trial under the preponderance of the evidence rule, were found to be unconstitutional. The Board contended that the invalid portion of art. 5.26 was severable from the balance of the statute regulating insurance rate deviations and prescribing appeal procedures. The court on appeal affirmed the trial court's judgment based on its determination that the invalid portion of art. 5.26(g) was severable from the remainder of the statute. The court found that with the invalid portion of the statute stricken, there still remained a workable, intelligible, and valid statute capable of being executed and enforced.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed its decision on rehearing. In so ruling, the court noted that the decision relied upon by the motor carriers, wherein the court had ruled that where the State of Texas had voluntarily invoked a court's jurisdiction by submitting its rights for adjudication it was bound thereby and all defenses to &sect; 1609b were properly raised and considered, was inapplicable because, there, prosecution under &sect; 1609b had already been initiated. Unlike the prior case, no action had been taken against the motor carriers. The motor carriers were not entitled to have their interpretation &sect; 1609b ruled upon unless and until the law enforcement officials brought a criminal action or an action for an injunction against the motor carriers.</SPAN></P>

The driver filed an action and sought injunctive relief, a judgment declaring &sect; 22(a) unconstitutional, and a declaration that the &quot;affirmative finding&quot; was void. The trial court sustained appellees' pleas to the jurisdiction, which contended that the remedy of appeal provided by &sect; 22(a) was exclusive. On appeal, the court ruled that &sect; 22(a) did not provide an administrative board or other special tribunal with exclusive jurisdiction for a case such as the driver's action. The trial court had jurisdiction of the action for declaratory judgment, pursuant to Tex. Const. art. 5, &sect; 8; Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 2524-1, &sect; 2.

But an election to determine a matter of policy was open to all qualified voters within the voting district. The Urban Renewal Act, &sect; 5, art. 1269l-3, concerned in part whether the city should undertake a rehabilitation of blighted areas of the city and whether it should be vested certain powers under the Act. The purpose of the election was to determine whether the city should possess additional powers, a policy matter. That part of the Act, with respect to the election on the initial policy matter of adopting the resolution, which limited the voting to qualified voters residing in the city, owning taxable property within its boundaries, who had duly rendered the same for taxation, was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The dam reservoir was a flood control and conservation project to be constructed on a river. The city filed with the Board its application for a permit to appropriate, for municipal purposes, a certain amount of the unappropriated water from the river. A river authority entered into contract with the United States whereby it agreed to contribute to the cost of construction of Canyon Dam and was granted a right to utilize storage space in the reservoir. The court held that the contract and the beginning of construction of a dam smaller than the proposed dam described in the city's application did not render moot the city's appeal. The contract did not purport to regulate the use of the water but plainly excepted that from the contract. The contract simply provided that for the recited consideration the government would provide the authority storage space in the project to impound water and make such diversions as granted to the authority. The question for decision by the Board was the use and diversion of water to be stored by another authority and not the design and construction of the project. If it deemed an amendment of the application necessary, it was authorized to require it.</SPAN></P>

Ann. art. 21.28, &sect; 3(g) was unconstitutional because of a defective caption of the act in which it was contained. Appellee was the insurance company's receiver.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The agent asserted that Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat.

The court disagreed and overruled his motion for a rehearing. The agent's view of &sect; 11 was too narrow. The history of classifying insurers for special legislative treatment was a matter of common knowledge. The court rejected his claim that Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 21.28, &sect; 3(g), insofar as it denied the right of offset to claims bought after filing of delinquency proceedings with the view to its being used as an offset, was unconstitutional because of a defective caption of the act in which it was contained. The caption was not inadequate under Tex. Const. art. 3, &sect; 35 because Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 21.28, &sect; 3(g) was fairly within the object expressed in the caption to the 1955 Act.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Prior to 1958, local delivery services, such as the carrier, were not subject to the Act if they conducted business in a certain city, or cities contiguous therewith, and their route did not include any open space on a highway not in an incorporated city. In 1958, the attorney general issued an opinion to the effect that local delivery services were subject to the Act. Thereafter, the carriers filed a declaratory judgment suit and sought to enjoin prosecution and arrest for alleged violations of the Act. The trial court entered a judgment for the carriers. The court noted that art. 1690b provided for the arrest, prosecution, and fine of persons violating the Act. However, the carriers did not allege that the Act was unconstitutional and void. Rather, they urged in effect that if the Act was given the interpretation for which they contended that they would have a valid defense against its enforcement in a criminal prosecution. Such a contention was not sufficient to invoke the aid of equity in denial of the jurisdiction of criminal courts.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The hairdresser was temporarily enjoined from operating a beauty parlor in her home. She argued on appeal that the zoning ordinance pursuant to which the injunction was granted, Fort Worth, Tex., Zoning Ordinance &sect; 6, was unconstitutional because it arbitrarily deprived her of the right to use her home in the desired manner, had no relation to the public health or general welfare, and was inconsistent with Tex. Penal Code Ann. art. 734b. Further, the hairdresser argued that the trial court erred in overruling her exception to the city's pleadings that the ordinance did not set out any specific acts of damage or injury to the health, safety, or welfare of the city. The court affirmed the judgment, finding that, although it would have been preferable for the trial court to wait until a trial was held on the merits to answer the question of constitutionality, there was actually no reason for the trial court to wait because the issue before the trial court was one of pure law, which could be answered on the evidence that was before it in the preliminary hearing.

The court found Texas courts had justified the constitutionality of fees paid the county and district judges for serving on the Juvenile Board at least partly upon the theory they were performing functions for the benefit of the State and not on behalf of the counties as entities distinct from the State. The court held it did not believe it was contemplated by the legislature that a county judge, a stranger to the Juvenile Board, could draw a salary for a service he was without authority to perform.

The court held if the statute providing the county judge might be paid $ 1,500 per annum additional compensation for his services as a member of the Juvenile Board, Tex. Civ. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state filed an action under Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 4646(b), seeking a temporary injunction to restrain the corporation from violating the usury laws of Texas, and a permanent injunction on final trial. After the hearing, the trial court granted the temporary injunction. The corporation appealed. On appeal, the corporation argued that the trial court had no authority under Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 4646(b) to grant a temporary injunction. However, the court determined that Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art 4646(b) authorized the trial court to grant a temporary injunction. Further, the court determined that it did not comport with reason to say that the equitable relief provided by the law was to be thwarted because a business could not be profitably operated within the purview of the law. The corporation further argued that the provisions of the trial court's order were broader than necessary to preserve the status quo; thus constituting an abuse of judicial discretion. However, the court overruled the corporation's contentions that the trial court's order exceeded its proper scope. Accordingly, the order of the trial court was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

The taxpayer argued that it did not sell the dry gas resulting from the cycling operations, but rather it returned the gas until it was withdrawn and sold. The taxpayer further alleged that all taxes due under Tex. Rev. Stat. Ann. art. 7047b had been paid. On appeal, the court held that the residue gas that the taxpayer sold was not saved but was excluded in calculating the tax. Thus, the gas was subject to a tax as provided by 1945 Tex. Gen. Laws ch. 269, art. 7047b, &sect; 1(2). The court found that because the residue gas that was returned had no market value, the gas was stored and not saved.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The fireman took a military leave of absence from his position and was then given a medical discharge from the military. The fireman requested reinstatement with the fire department, but he was denied reinstatement because of his heart disease. In an action before the pension board, the employee was denied pension benefits because he was physically able to perform the duties of fireman. The firearm brought an action against appellees and the pension board seeking either reinstatement or a pension. The court reversed the decision and dismissed for want of jurisdiction. The court held that the trial court did not have jurisdiction to hear the fireman's attempted appeal from the commission. Although Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 1269, &sect; 22a made it the duty of the Commission reinstate the fireman after military service if he met the requirements, the trial court did not have the authority or jurisdiction to review that decision. The court held that the fireman was not denied a constitutional right because his reinstatement was a mere privilege given to him by &sect; 22a, not a vested property right.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Commission initiated the declaratory judgment action against the company seeking a determination as to whether the company was required to register its trucks in the state. The trial court found that the company was required to register the trucks in the state because the company was using the trucks to conduct business within the state. The company sought review. Pursuant to Tex. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 6675a-2, every owner of a motor vehicle used upon the state's public highways was required to apply for registration of each vehicle. The court found that only non-residents were granted exemption from the registration statute. The court further determined that the State Highway Department was not authorized to exempt state residents from registering the vehicles. The court held that, because the statute had not imposed an unreasonable burden on interstate commerce, it was a valid exercise of the state's police power and was not in violation of the equal protection clause. The court found that the company was required to register the trucks within any county in the state in which it was a resident. The court affirmed as modified the judgment of the trial court.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff appealed from the trial court (Texas) judgment for defendants in his suit to recover for personal injuries sustained by him in a collision.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff argued that a juror expressly declared his bias against personal injury plaintiffs, that the trial court's adverse finding was contrary to the evidence, and that its refusal to sustain his challenge improperly made him use a peremptory challenge. The only record filed on appeal was the transcript certified by the district clerk and what purported to be a transcript of the voir dire examination of the challenged jurors and the testimony of one of plaintiff's counsel at a hearing on his new trial motion. The court did not think the voir dire transcript could be construed as even a partial statement of facts under Tex. R. Civ. P. 377. It found that plaintiff had failed to preserve his appellate points. The transcript did not contain a complete record of what transpired on voir dire. It was apparent that the challenged juror's testimony was contradictory in several particulars, but the court could not say that the trial court abused his discretion or erred in overruling the new trial motion, impliedly finding that there was no bias or prejudice. Nor could it say that the ruling was against the great weight and preponderance of the evidence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants contended that the entire value of the devise and bequest to the charitable organization was exempt from inheritance taxes under the law. The court stated that the deceased died July 19, 1955. The 1955 amendment contained an emergency clause, but did not receive a two-thirds vote necessary to make the Act of 1955 immediately effective. The legislature did not adjourn until June 7, 1955, and the amendment did not become effective until 90 days after adjournment, or September 5, 1955. The apparent purpose of the enactment of the 1957 amendment was to make an act of a prior legislature effective immediately on its approval by the governor, even though the Acts 1957 had not been passed in the manner required by the constitutional provision requiring a two-thirds vote. Such an effort could not be availing because one legislature had no power to construe the Acts or declare the intentions of a prior legislative session.

The builder sought a judgment that art. 1015(g) was unconstitutional. The trial court found in favor of appellants. The court affirmed the judgment and held that art. 1015(g) was not in violation of Tex. Const. art. 3, &sect; 56, as being a local or special law passed by the legislature under the guise of a general statute, as there was an extensive border between Texas and Mexico, and any bridge constructed across that border was for the interest of the people at large. Therefore the statute was not local or special within the meaning of the constitutional provision, even though its enforcement was confined to a restricted area. It operated upon a subject that the people at large were interested in. Because the statute was valid, the city's contract to purchase the international bridge to have been constructed by the builder was a valid and enforceable contract.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, insurer, agent, and insured, challenged the orders of the District Court of Shelby County, Texas, which overruled appellants' pleas of privilege in actions arising out of the destruction of an oil rig by a fire. The actions included claims by appellee heirs of the insured's partner against the insurer and the agent, the heirs' cross-claim against the insured, and the insurer's interpleader action against the insured.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">None of the parties resided in, the policy was not issued in, and the burned oil rig was not located in the county where the action was filed. The insurer and the agent claimed in part that Tex. Ann. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 1995(27) was void. The insured argued that venue was not maintainable against him. The heirs claimed that the insured did not file a plea of privilege to their cross-claim. The court reversed two of the trial court's orders and affirmed one. The court held that venue could not be sustained against the insurer under art. 1995(27), which governed venue in actions against foreign corporations, because art. 1995(27) was unconstitutional under the Fourteenth Amendment to the extent that it conflicted with the provisions of art. 1995(23), which governed domestic corporations. The court concluded that even if art. 1995(27) were valid, venue could not be sustained as to the agent under art. 1995(29a) because he was not a necessary party to the heirs' action against the insurer. The court found that the venue rules applied to interpleader actions, Tex. R. Civ. P. 816, and held that the insured's plea to the interpleader action did not extend to the heirs' cross-claim.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A number of property owners brought a class action suit for a permanent injunction preventing the city from enforcing an ordinance. The ordinance made it unlawful for anyone to posses any type of fowl. A temporary injunction was granted. The trial court found that the city was compelling the owners to get rid of their fowls and pens under penalty of prosecution for disobedience. The court found that in the absence of a statement of facts it was presumed that there was sufficient evidence to support the finding. The court further found that it was proper to hold that the ordinance invaded the owners' property rights. The ordinance defined fowls as property. It was not an abuse of discretion for the trial court to determine that the owners showed a probable fright and probable injury. The temporary injunction preserved the status quo pending a final trial on the merits. There was no evidence that there was any public harm as a result of the temporary injunction. The court concluded that there were bona fide issues as to the owners right to ultimate relief. It was not error to grant the injunction. The court made no determination on the validity of the ordinance.</SPAN></P>

Appellants also challenged the method for fixing the fees, arguing that they were discriminatory toward small dairies.

The court found that the fees were not unreasonable and that the inspections and fees were authorized by Tex. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 165-3 and the regulations of the state health officer.

Ann. Rev. Civ. Stat. art. 165-8 (1957) declared unconstitutional. The statute authorized appellee, the Commissioner of Agriculture, to enforce the provisions. The trial court (Texas) upheld the constitutionality of the statute and the egg seller appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The egg seller claimed that the Texas Egg Law, Tex. Ann. Rev. Civ. Stat. art. 165-8 (1957), constituted an unreasonable regulation of its lawful business and was not authorized under the State's police powers. The main question was whether the State could validly force it to sell its eggs only according to the qualities established by the Act or as &quot;ungraded.&quot; The court found that the requirement was reasonable. All that the provision required was that the truth be stated. The court also held that aesthetic standards for food were not unreasonable or unconstitutional because a form of deceit was practiced upon the consuming public when it purchased eggs which were runny believing it purchased firm eggs which did not run. Because the consumer could not easily determine how an egg looked on the inside without breaking it, it was entirely proper that the act required that the inside of the egg be examined by persons in the egg business if this could be accomplished in a reasonable manner, such as by candling. Finally, in exempting local producers, the statute properly considered the financial strain the act would place on small producers and was not arbitrary or discriminatory.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reformed the trial court's declaratory judgment to the extent that an amendment to the Texas Egg Statute rendered the judgment as to one section of the law's constitutionality moot. As reformed, the court affirmed the judgment.</SPAN></P>

The lenders argued that Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. art 4646b (1943) was in violation of Texas Const. art. 5, &sect; 21. The court overturned the trial court's decision, finding that: (1) it was not the intention of the constitution to confer power upon the legislature to give to the Attorney General power to perform acts which the constitution itself conferred upon county attorneys; (2) the state constitution did not in express terms make it the duty of the Attorney General to represent the State in suits in which it was interested, but it did not confer that power upon any other officer; hence the legislature had full power to impose that duty upon the Attorney General; and (3) Tex.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The district filed an action to collect two years worth of taxes, penalties, and interest allegedly owed by the owner on lands it owned within the county. The trial court entered judgment for the district. The owner then appealed, claiming that the act creating the district was unconstitutional because it contained no express finding that the lands included therein would be benefited and it did not give the right to a determination by the district directors that the owner's lands would be benefited by inclusion therein. On appeal, the court held that there was a distinction between districts that were established as by a special act of the legislature and those organized primarily for private purposes. The court noted that the district was a political subdivision of the state and stood upon the same footing as counties. The court determined that when the legislature itself directly created the district, the owner had no constitutional right to a hearing on the question of benefits and that in carrying out an express constitutional mandate to conserve water, the legislature could authorize taxes to be imposed upon all property within the district without regard to benefit.</SPAN></P>

The trial court issued a judgment, which cancelled, forfeited, and rendered null and void that charter. It found that forfeiture was justified under Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat.

The corporation appealed from that judgment, which was affirmed. The court stated that the visitation statutes, Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. arts. 1366-1371, gave the attorney general an unlimited and unrestricted right to examine a corporation's books and records at any time and as often as he may deem necessary. It also stated that those provisions did not violate the constitutional inhibitions against unreasonable searches and seizures. Moreover, the attorney general's secretary had been authorized to affix his signature to the visitation letter sent to the corporation.

The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of the taxpayer and ruled that the school district was only entitled to the amount tendered by the taxpayer. On appeal the court reversed, holding that art. 7298, as applied by the trial court, was retroactive, void, and unconstitutional because the statute contained no provision allowing a reasonable time after the effective date of the act within which actions could be brought for delinquent taxes for years preceding the four year bar of the statute, the school district's claims for delinquent taxes for prior years constituted vested rights, and giving the statute retroactive application was in clear violation of Tex.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant insurance company applied with appellee insurance board to renew a permitted deviation for a lesser rate than the maximum insurance rates promulgated by appellee. When appellee denied its application, appellant filed suit. The lower court dismissed the suit, sustaining appellee's pleas in abatement and to the jurisdiction.

Article 5.26 of the Insurance Code expressly provided that the deviation period of one year was from the date of final granting of permission to deviate, whether by appellee or upon the direction of the court. In this case, neither of those dates had arrived yet. The provisions of the statute precluding application of the substantial evidence rule and requiring trial under the preponderance of the evidence rule were unconstitutional and the statute authorized an appeal.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the petitioners had the right to institute the proceedings in their own names without the joinder of the Attorney General or other county officials. The court found that the statutes authorized the landowners to petition for an election to determine whether or not the district should be abolished and the petitioners were taxpayers and had a direct interest in the election to abolish the taxing agency. The court held that, even if the calling of the election involved the exercise of discretion by the directors of the district board, the petitioners were entitled to a trial on the merits in the mandamus proceedings because they alleged that the directors abused their discretion in arbitrarily refusing to call the election. The court held that mandamus would lie to control discretionary acts of public officials where there was an abuse of discretion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The dairy producer contacted an El Paso County retail farm equipment distributor and purchased a forest harvester. Subsequently, the forest harvester's transmission housing and cover broke. The replacement parts were delayed and the dairy farmer purchased another machine of another make. The dairy producer filed an action in El Paso County to receive a credit for the machine. The manufacturer filed a plea of privilege to change venue to Dallas County, which was overruled. On appeal, the court reversed. The court found that there was no contract between the manufacturer and the dairy producer because the sale was from the manufacturer to the distributor and at a later date to the dairy producer. The court also found that there was no evidence that the salesman was other than the distributor's employee and was furthering the business of his employer. The court further determined that the salesman's statement that the machine would do the job was not binding upon the manufacturer because there was no evidence of probative force of apparent authority given to him by the manufacturer. Thus, the court concluded that the dairy producer had no cause of action against the manufacturer.</SPAN></P>

Section 13 required appellees, a county and a city, to transfer to the district delinquent taxes levied for the purpose of supporting a hospital system that was created prior to the enactment of Tex.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city and the county operated a hospital system, and the city contributed to the hospital system by levying an ad valorem tax.

Under &sect; 13, delinquent taxes owed to cities and counties on levies for hospital systems were to be paid to the hospital districts. After the city and the county abolished their hospital system and created the district, the district brought an action, seeking to recover delinquent taxes under &sect; 13. When the trial court held that &sect; 13 was unconstitutional, the district sought review. Upon review, the court held that &sect; 13 was unconstitutional because under Tex.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State determined that certain utility facilities within the rights of way of an interstate highway needed to be relocated in order to facilitate the improvement and construction of the highway.

The State brought declaratory judgment actions to determine if it had a duty to reimburse appellees for the costs that they incurred in removing and adjusting their utility facilities.

Ann. art. 6674w-4, which provided for the reimbursement by the State for the cost of relocating utility facilities necessitated by the improvement of an interstate highway when such relocation was eligible for Federal participation, and that the statute was constitutional.

The court reversed the order that issued the injunction. The court noted that the Board was authorized to issue the regulations by Tex. Ins. Code, Tex. Stat. Ann. art. 3.53, &sect;&sect; 2(B) and 7. Further, the court agreed that appellants were entitled to judicial review of the Board's action under Tex. Ins. Code, Tex. Stat. Ann. art. 3.53, &sect; 12. However, the court said, appellants did not have the right to have enforcement of the challenged regulations enjoined pending judicial review. The court held that the trial court's power was limited to either upholding or setting aside the regulations. The trial court did not have the power to reinstate the old regulations.

The building and loan also sought an injunction to prevent the banking commissioner from taking any action to prevent it from opening branch offices. After a bench trial, the trial court denied the request for a declaratory judgment but granted an injunction preventing the bank commissioner from interfering with the building and loan opening six branch offices. Both parties appealed. On appeal, the court held that the banking commissioner's approval must be obtained by building and loan associations prior to the opening of additional public offices for the transaction of business. The court also held that the promulgated banking rules were valid from and after their effective date. However, the court upheld the trial court's finding that the rules did not apply to the building and loan's proposed branch offices.

The trial court found that the officials lacked legal authority to exclude the applicants from the college, that the policy violated their state and federal constitutional rights, and ordered the mandamus to issue. The court reversed and found that the legislature was fully aware that the officials had governed the college with the view that it was vested with discretionary power to exclude female students, and that by re-enacting subsequent legislation which did not alter that view, the legislature had acquiesced in the board's view. The court also held that mandamus was improper because there was no evidence of any law which clearly and imperatively required that females had to be admitted to the college. Finally the court held that the female students did not meet their burden of showing the unconstitutionality of the discretionary authority that had been vested in the officials.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed and held that the applicants failed to make a prima facie case for a variance under Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 1011g, &sect; 3. Although the applicants' argued that publication of the zoning ordinance was not shown, they never specified any failure to publish the ordinance. The ordinance preventing the construction of a building for commercial use on the applicants' lots zoned solely for residential use was not unreasonable, oppressive, or arbitrary. It constituted a valid exercise of police power. The applicants failed to show that the action of the village and the Board in passing the zoning ordinance in refusing the permit was arbitrary, unreasonable, or a clear abuse of power.

The court agreed and ordered a writ of mandamus to issue if the trial judge did not allow a jury trial. In reaching its conclusion, the court noted that the statute at issue had repealed a previous series of restoration statutes that provided a trial by jury. The court held that the fact that the statute at issue did not provide for a jury either at trial or on appeal violated the Texas Constitution because, at the time of the Constitution's adoption, a litigant was entitled to have the issue of mental illness tried to a jury.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After an employee of the utility company was discharged for incompetence, the union organized a strike and a picket line at a power plant. When the utility company sought a temporary injunction, the trial court granted the injunction. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment, holding that the trial court's jurisdiction was not preempted by the jurisdiction of the National Labor Relations Board because the activity did not come within the area covered by the Labor Management Relations Act. In making that determination, the court noted that the union activity was not a concerted effort of the employees and that the discharged employee was fired as a result of incompetence, which was an unprotected activity. Further, the provisions of Tex. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 5154d, 1446a that prohibited picketing at public utilities did not conflict with the National Labor Relations Act because the State of Texas had a valid public purpose of maintaining service at its utility facilities. Moreover, the right to free speech was not violated by the injunction because the constitutional privilege did not apply to the protest of an employee's discharge for incompetence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellees argued that art. 1269m was unconstitutional as violating Text. Const. art. III, &sect; 56, prohibiting the passage of a local law regulating the affairs of cities. However, the court held that the constitutionality of Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 1269m (Vernon) had previously been upheld by the Texas Supreme Court. The court also held that the issue of whether the employees' rights were barred by laches had previously been decided adversely to appellees' contention in a separate case. In response to appellants' assignments of error, the court held that: (1) the proposition that the trial court erred in classifying the employees as custodial workers instead of as policemen and failing to allow them the salary fixed for policemen had been resolved against appellants' contention in a separate case; and (2) the trial court did not err in limiting the employees' recover to a period of two years next proceeding the commencement of their suit because the only type of controversy that required a member of the police department to first appeal to the Civil Service Commission was one involving dismissal, suspension, or demotion and appellees had not waived the statute of limitations.</SPAN></P>

Ann. art. 7477, &sect;&sect; 12-14 (1953) were unconstitutional because they violated the separation of powers principles set forth in Tex. Const. art. II, &sect; 1. The court held that Tex. Civ.

Section 13 provided that appeals were to be decided de novo using a preponderance of the evidence standard rather than the substantial evidence rule used in administrative appeals and because &sect; 13 usurped the Board's authority to weigh the evidence.

The town could assess taxes at a higher rate under the ordinance adopting Tex. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 961 (1925). The court affirmed the judgment because the town was duly and legally incorporated and functioning as a town under the provisions of Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 1133 (1925). The ordinance in question was in proper form and received the requisite statutory vote of the town council and was passed, filed, and recorded in the requisite statutory manner. The several validating statutes of the state cured any defects that may have existed in the adoption of those statutory provisions. Those validating statutes were constitutional.

After his discharge, the manager filed suit against the lender and another company, seeking to recover all of the commissions retained by the lender.

Further, the court noted that the manager presented no evidence that he had any right to the commissions, noting that there was no express agreement by anyone to pay the manager for his acts in countersigning the polices, and the manager was not a third party beneficiary of an agreement between the other company and the insurance company.</SPAN></P>

On motion for rehearing, the court agreed with the city that the city was protected from liability by Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. art. 46d-15. On appeal, the court adhered to its former opinion and held that Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. art. 46d-15, the legislation that sought to make the negligent action of the city free of tort liability, was arbitrary and unreasonable. The court reasoned that a legislative action withdrawing common law remedies for well established common law causes of action should be sustained only when it was reasonable in substituting other remedies, or when it was a reasonable exercise of the police power in the interest of the general welfare. Here, there was no substitution of the remedy that Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. art. 46d-15 sought to take away from one who suffered by reason of the negligent conduct of a municipality. The legislature did not intend to exempt municipalities from tort liability in the operation and maintenance of airports.</SPAN></P>

The trial court granted the board's motion for a judgment and declared Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 6243f, &sect; 17 to be constitutional and valid.</SPAN></P>

The board directed the investment of funds in investment trust shares, which represented an interest in stock in private corporations. That action was authorized by &sect; 17. The director, who was ex officio treasurer of the funds of the pension system, refused to comply with the direction of the board on the ground that &sect; 17 violated Tex. Const. art.

The court held that: (1) any loss of business sustained by the company was because of one of its by-laws, which ordered the company to strictly comply with Texas law regarding the practice of dentistry and required customers to sign an affidavit stating the &quot;precise nature and extent&quot; of the work done for them by the company; (2) the testimony failed to establish that article 754a(5) had anything to do with a customer's refusal to sign the affidavit; (3) the proof did not show that the prosecution of article 754a(5) invaded any of the company's property rights; and (4) article 754a(5) was not void.</SPAN></P>

A city employee was burning grass near an airplane storage hangar. The fire spread and burned up the hangar as well as the charter service's airplanes and equipment stored therein.

The charter service appealed and the court reversed and remanded the cause to give the charter service an opportunity to establish common law liability against the city. The court held that the city, in the discharge of its airport operations, was acting in its proprietary capacity for the benefit primarily of its own inhabitants and other persons desiring to avail themselves of such services, as distinguished from its acts in the discharge of governmental functions in the operation of the airport. The court held that Art. 46d-15 of the Municipal Airport Act, 50th Leg.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, the Texas Department of Public Safety, appealed a judgment from the County Court at Law No. 2 of Nueces County (Texas) that, on an appeal by plaintiff driver, pursuant to Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 6687b, &sect; 31, set aside an order from the Department that automatically suspended the driver's license to operate a motor vehicle, under authority of Tex. Rev. Civ.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The driver was convicted in Louisiana of the offense of operating a motor vehicle while intoxicated in Louisiana. The Department received notice of the driver's conviction and thereafter suspended the driver's license for a period of six months. The order of suspension purported to be under the provisions of Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 6687b and was issued automatically without a hearing and without notice to the driver. The trial court determined that the Department lacked authority to suspend automatically the driver's license. On appeal, the court rejected the Department's claim that it had the power and authority under Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 6687b, &sect; 28, upon notification that the holder of a Texas operator's license had been convicted of an offense in a sister state which, if committed in Texas, would result in automatic suspension, to automatically suspend such operator's license without notice or hearing. The statutes, fairly construed, required notice and a hearing before the driver's license could be automatically suspended. Such a ruling comported with the general rule that one could not be deprived of a license or permit without due process, or notice.</SPAN></P>

The trial court granted the city's motion for summary judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Under the terms of Houston, Tex., Ordinance No. 3351 extensive territory lying adjacent to the city was added to the corporate limits of Houston. The citizens argued that the action of the trial court was erroneous because under the undisputed facts, the ordinance was void and a private citizen could maintain the suit without joinder by the State of Texas. The citizens argued that all provisions of Houston, Tex., City Charter art. I, &sect; 2b were mandatory and because the city did not comply with them the ordinance was void. The court affirmed, holding that where the city had the power to annex a territory by ordinance, without the consent of inhabitants of the territory annexed, the ordinance could be collaterally attacked only if the ordinance was void on its face. The court held that the citizens failed to meet their burden of proof. In the second cause of action the court held that the citizens' arguments regarding the debts of the water districts was void because it was a collateral attack on the annexation ordinance. The court also noted that the citizen's attack on the validity of the ordinance was not raised in the trial court and would not be addressed on appeal.</SPAN></P>

He challenged the decision and the court held that there was insufficient evidence to warrant the revocation of the license. The evidence showed only that the owner of the pharmacy had filled a prescription for another person without the pharmacist's knowledge. Because knowledge was not proved revocation was improper. Further, the revocation could not be upheld on other grounds because the notice of hearing specified only the one charge. The pharmacist's license could not be revoked without due process, which included notice of the charges against him and a hearing on the charges. The board failed to show that the pharmacist waived his right to have the hearing limited to the matter charged.

The Legislature did not intend to delegate legislative power to the Board, an administrative body, whereby such Board in the enactment of administrative rules could change any of the substantive laws of Texas. As a matter of the settled substantive law of Texas, the insurance policy in question was effectively cancelled by the mutual consent of the insurer and the employer.

The trial court granted the relief sought by the executor and excluded the land from the district. The district, the board, and the landowner argued that art. 7880-3c, &sect; A(9) was unconstitutional. The court observed that the legislature had the power to make any classifications and exemptions which were not arbitrary and unreasonable, and that the test was whether there was any basis for the classification which could have seemed reasonable to the legislature. The court held that art. 7880-3c, &sect; A(9) violated the equal rights provision of Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 3 because there was no reasonable basis for excluding any grazing land in tracts of 640 acres or more and omitting therefrom the exclusion of smaller tracts of the same kind of grazing land.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The claimant filed his action for total and permanent incapacity. Within 20 days, the employer filed a petition for removal to federal court and filed its answer in federal court. The claimant took default in State court because the employer had not filed an answer in that court. Ultimately, the federal court remanded the case to State court. The trial court then set aside the default judgment on the ground that the default judgment was entered without jurisdiction due to the removal procedure. The question before the court was whether the trial court was justified in doing so under 28 U.S.C.S. &sect;&sect; 1446 (a),(e). On appeal, the court answered the question in the affirmative and affirmed the judgment. The court held that, when the employer filed its petition for removal and bond: (1) the jurisdiction of the federal court attached for the purpose of determining the correctness of the allegations of the petition; and (2) at such time the jurisdiction of the trial court was automatically abated pending such determination and the question of whether the cause was removable was one for the consideration of the Federal Court and was not to be determined or ignored by the trial court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Board barred the attorneys from practicing before it for a period of three years under the authority of Tex.

The order was predicated upon a finding by the Board that the attorneys were guilty of unethical and fraudulent conduct before the Board based predicated on evidence that the attorneys filed solicited claims, filed unauthorized claims, filed false claims, filed fictitious claims, and filed false instruments in claims and cases pending before the Board. While the sufficiency of the evidence to support the Board's findings was not questioned, the trial court entered a temporary injunction, finding the Board had no legal power and authority to enter the order. The court affirmed and held that the statute on which the Board relied violated the due process clauses of Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 19 and the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution because it failed to provide for notice and hearing. Extra-official or casual notice, or a hearing granted as a matter of favor or discretion, was not deemed a substantial substitute for the due process of law that the constitution required.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Attorney General ruled the Naturopathic Act unconstitutional. The Act was allegedly in violation of Tex. Const. art. XVI, &sect; 31, which provided that the legislature was allowed pass laws prescribing the qualifications of practitioners of medicine in the State of Texas and to punish persons for malpractice but that no preference was ever be given by law to any schools of medicine. The validity of the Act was also attacked for vagueness. The court found that the Act was invalid upon both grounds. The practice of medicine as defined by Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. art. 4510 included the practice of naturopathy as defined by the Act. The practice of naturopathy as defined by the Act was the practice of medicine but limited to certain means and excluding specific means. While the Act affirmatively authorized a limited practice of medicine, it also affirmatively denied that the Act was to have had that effect. The Act attempted to both grant and deny to those complying with its terms the privilege of practicing medicine. It was, therefore, impossible to interpret and to enforce; the Act was void.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The cemeteries brought suit against the banking commissioner to enjoin his enforcement of Tex. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 548b, which regulated the sale of prepaid funeral benefits. They claimed that the act was unconstitutional. The attorney general intervened and sought a temporary injunction to prohibit the cemeteries from selling prepaid funeral benefits. The trial court denied the attorney general's petition and the court reversed. It found that the act was constitutional because it applied to all entities desiring to sell prepaid funeral benefits and its requirement that funds collected be placed in trust was only a mode of regulation of the business and did not prohibit the selling of the benefits. Further, the cemeteries were subject to the provisions of the act, because their contracts provided for the sale of prepaid funeral benefits to be delivered at an undetermined future date dependent upon the death of the contracting party. Finally, as the cemeteries failed to comply with the provisions of the act regarding the sale of prepaid funeral benefits, the trial court erred in failing to enjoin them from selling prepaid funeral benefits.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city's ordinance set scaled license fees for ballrooms. The amount of the fees correlated with the square footage of the ballrooms. The city sought to collect a license fee from the ballroom owner. The ballroom owner argued that the fee was an occupation tax rather than a license fee. He also argued that because the occupation tax was more than half of the tax that the State assessed him, the ordinance violated Tex. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 7, Tex. Civ. Stat. arts. 7047a-19, 7048. The court reversed the trial court's judgment and remanded the case. The fee was not excessive because it did not seem to exceed the cost of issuing the license or of policing the ballroom. The court presumed that the cost of policing a larger ballroom was more than the cost of policing a smaller ballroom. The record did not show that the ordinance was directed toward revenue. Therefore, the ordinance did not impose an occupation tax and the above constitutional and statutory provisions did not apply.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The husband sought a divorce on grounds of separation without inexcusable abandonment. The wife argued that the legislature did not intend amended art. 4629(4), which reduced a married couple's required separation period from 10 to 7 years, to operate retrospectively. The wife also argued that the trial court erred in including time elapsed during the pendency of several divorce actions and that the husband's right to divorce on the grounds granted was barred by res judicata. The court held that the judgment of divorce was properly granted. The court determined that amended art. 4629(4) operated retrospectively because Texas law construed marriage as a status rather than a contract vesting rights in the parties, and the constitutional provisions against retrospective laws were therefore inapplicable. The court also found that the separation period was properly computed because fault for the separation was not a material fact. The court concluded that a prior judgment was not res judicata of the issue determined in the case because the issue of whether the parties had been living apart for seven years could not have been determined by a judgment rendered two years earlier.</SPAN></P>

Home-rule cities had plenary power to annex State-owned navigable submerged territory lying adjacent to their existing boundaries, subject only to constitutional inhibitions against palpably arbitrary abuse of the power.

The ordinance had prohibited the keeping and displaying of pinball machines or marble boards. Appellee, an operator of such machines, had brought an action against the city to challenge the ordinance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The ordinance was passed; within five days, the operator filed suit. In response to the city's appeal from the injunction, the operator contended that the ordinance was inconsistent with Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. arts. 7047a-2, 7047a-3. The court held that while the city had power by charter and statute to define and prevent a nuisance, it was axiomatic that no legislative body could by an arbitrary standard, declare that to be a nuisance which was not so in fact. The court determined that no general statute allowed the city to prevent or prohibit marble boards. The court ruled that if the ordinance was intended to be a law against gambling devices, it was void as in conflict with Tex. Penal Code Ann. art. 615 et seq. The court noted that a municipality had no power to prohibit pursuit of occupations regulated by state law. Authority for the city charter was Tex. Const. art. 11, &sect; 5, which provided that any ordinance passed under that charter could not contain any provision inconsistent with the Texas Constitution or with the general state laws.</SPAN></P>

A Texas trial court entered judgment for plaintiffs. Defendants appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants maintained oil storage tanks about 50 feet from the decedents' house. When lightning struck, one tank caught fire. The burning oil spread to the decedents' house. The jury found that defendants' act of storing crude oil in a tank that was not vapor-proof was a proximate cause of the deaths, that the maintaining of the tank with open holes in the top was negligence and a proximate cause of the deaths, and that the accident was not unavoidable or due to an act of God. Noting that Kilgore, Tex., General Oil Ordinance &sect; 13 stated that it was unlawful to use any storage tank that was not vapor-proof, the court held that the tank was not vapor-proof as that term was frequently used in the oil and gas industry. Violation of the ordinance was negligence as a matter of law. Next, the court held that the evidence supported the jury's findings that the tank had open holes in the top and that the use of such a tank was negligence in fact. Finally, the court held that the jury properly found that the fire was not an unavoidable accident or due to an act of God. Those who were negligent were held to know the usual effect of ordinary natural forces on a negligent act or omission.</SPAN></P>

The trial court entered a summary judgment in favor of appellee. Upon review, the court affirmed. The court found that it was not authorized to take judicial notice of any ordinance of the city or any code division that was not pleaded. The court held a city ordinance that pertained to building permits was unconstitutional on the basis that it violated due process and due course of the law land provisions where the ordinance left it to the unbridled discretion of a city inspector to disapprove a design, resulting in a refusal of a permit and the prohibition of a building. The court concluded that because there was no valid ordinance providing a rule of action for the government and restraint of discretion to preserve it from whimsy and caprice, there was no legally supportable discretion vested in the city council.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The applicant sought a beer retailer's license but the county judge denied his request on the ground that the premises for which the permit was sought was located in a &quot;dry&quot; area. The applicant filed a statutory appeal of the judge's decision, naming the judge and the Board as defendants. The trial court denied the license and the applicant sought review, arguing that the local option election, pursuant to which the area was declared dry, was invalid. The court noted that the 1935 amendment to Tex. Const. art. 16, &sect; 20, and the 1955 amendment to Tex. Penal Code art. 666, &sect; 40a limited local option elections to counties, justice's precincts, and incorporated cities or towns. The court noted also that neither the constitution nor the statutes authorized local option elections to be held in only a part of a justice precinct. The court found that after the city of Austin had voted to permit the sale of alcoholic liquor, the election at issue had been conducted in only that portion of a justice's precinct that lay outside the Austin city limits. The court concluded that such election was not effective to make the sale of liquors within that portion of the precinct illegal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The company was engaged in the business of buying and selling liquefied petroleum products. An occupation tax was levied against the company under an occupation tax statute, Tex. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 7060, which operated uniformly upon all persons and corporations operating a gas plant or gas works located within any incorporated town or city, used for the local sale and distribution of gas and charging therefor. The court determined that the facilities of the company were located within the corporate limits of the city, they were used for local sale and distribution of butane in the city, they were sufficient for that purpose, and charges were made for the company's product. The court explained that the legislature not only considered and treated butane as a gas, but had so classified it. The court held that butane was a gas and that the company's facilities in the city constituted a gas plant or gas works for the sale and distribution of gas within the meaning of art. 7060. The court concluded that because the record did not suggest that the classification was unreasonable, it could not be said that art. 7060 violated the state or federal constitutions.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed the portion of the judgment that awarded interest from the date that the taxpayer made the payments. The court held that the taxpayer was entitled to a refund because it paid the taxes under the duress of an unconstitutional act. The court then recognized the general rule that the State was not liable for interest in the absence of a statute. However, the resolution of the legislature under which the taxpayer brought the action made no reference to interest, and the court cited a controlling decision that allowed interest against the State. The court found that Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. art. 5072 provided for interest at the rate of six percent per annum on all judgments entered in Texas. Article 5072 contained no exceptions.</SPAN></P>

On review, the court found that the transfer order issued by the county board was void because it was not given with notice to the president of the board and that pursuant to Tex. Rev. Civ.

The court ruled that art. 2892 and Tex. Penal Code art. 297, the compulsory school laws, did not provide a penalty for another public school that voluntarily taught a non-resident student, that when the parents of children made private arrangements with another school district they could not be criminally prosecuted, and that there was no authority for the injunction because no property interests of the trustees were affected.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs filed suit against the city under the Act, alleging that the city's annexation ordinance was invalid because it violated the United States and Texas Constitutions.

After a hearing on the pleadings, the trial court sustained the city's bill of exception, which urged the dismissal of plaintiffs' pleading because it was not brought as an action in quo warranto, thereby dismissing plaintiffs' pleadings. On appeal, the court held that the trial court properly dismissed plaintiffs' pleadings because the city's action in exercising its authority to extend its boundaries could only be attacked or questioned by quo warranto proceedings and could not be questioned in a collateral attack brought by individuals only, unless the action or ordinance was void on its face. The court further held that plaintiffs could not, by calling their action a suit brought under the Act, bring such collateral attack in the absence of representatives of the State of Texas because the Act could not and did not enlarge the jurisdiction of any court, nor did it create any new jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>

The limitation specified by Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 3202-a was the actual cost of the support rendered by the state institution. The guardian did not show that the amounts charged and sued for were in excess of actual cost. The court ruled that the evidence supported the jury's finding that no binding agreement existed to delay the payments for the ward's care. There was no official memorandum or record showing an authorizing action by the Texas Board of Control to postpone the support payments due the State until after the ward's death.</SPAN></P>

By the terms of the adoption judgment, appellee stepfather was granted leave to adopt the two minor sons of the natural father without his knowledge or consent. The natural father appealed a judgment confirming the former decree of adoption and denying him any relief.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The natural father was previously married to the mother of their two sons. While the natural father was a patient in a mental institution, the mother secured a divorce and obtained exclusive custody of the boys. The stepfather subsequently married the mother and obtained custody of the boys. Although the natural father was not required to provide child support under the terms of the divorce decree, he later offered to pay support and tried to arrange visitation with the boys. The court overturned the trial court's judgment. The court held that under the provisions of the adoption statute, Tex. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 46a, &sect; 6, no adoption was authorized except with the written consent of the living parents, unless such parents proved themselves unworthy by abandoning and deserting for a period of two years the child sought to be adopted. Where the living parents were without notice of adoption proceedings and where they did not give written consent for such adoption, they had to be allowed a full hearing in a subsequent proceeding on the issue of whether sufficient facts existed as to authorize the entry of the judgment of adoption.</SPAN></P>

The drilling of the wells was completed, and the owners failed to pay the contractor for its services. During the drilling of one of the wells, some problems were encountered. The contractor incurred extra expense. There was a dispute over which party was responsible for the complications. The contractor filed an action to recover for the unpaid items in the contracts. A jury awarded the contractor damages. The owners appealed. The court affirmed, holding that the contractor was not required to submit the general issue of whether or not it had performed its contract in a careful and workmanlike manner. The court explained that the issue of who was responsible for the extra expenses was submitted the in form of two questions to the jury. It was assumed at trial that the owners owed some amount under the contract. Thus, the owners were restricted from submitting the general issue of whether the contract was performed in workmanlike manner on appeal. The court also found that the contractor was entitled to attorney's fees under Tex. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 2226.</SPAN></P>

The broker alleged that he procured the sale for a consideration a large amount of money of a 75-year lease held by the owners on downtown real estate, which included a modern office building that the owners had built on the property. The parties agreed that the broker was not licensed under the Real Estate Dealers License Act, Tex. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 6573a. However, the broker did hold a license to deal in securities under the Texas Securities Act, Tex. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 600a. The trial court entered summary judgment in favor of the owners. The broker appealed. The court affirmed, holding that Tex. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 6573a did not give the broker an exemption from the licensing requirements needed to maintain an action to recover a real estate commission. The court explained that the broker's status as a licensed securities dealer did not excuse him from the requirement that he be licensed as real estate dealer to recover a commission.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The county conducted an election for the purpose of authorizing the issuance of bonds for the construction and maintenance of farm-to-market roads and laterals.

The trial court denied the request for a temporary injunction. The taxpayers asserted that the election by a simple majority under Tex. Rev. Civ.

Const. art. 3, &sect; 52, which required a two-thirds majority for elections on bonds used for the purpose of the construction, maintenance, and operation of macadamized, graveled, or paved roads and turnpikes. The court affirmed the denial of a temporary injunction because it determined that the election of bonds by a simple majority was proper for the construction of farm-to-market roads under Tex. Const. art. 11, &sect; 2, which authorized simple majorities for elections on bonds used for county roads, since the term &quot;county road&quot; was broad enough to include farm-to-market roads and laterals.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant short line railroad sought review of a judgment of a trial court (Texas), which decreed that the refusal by appellant Railroad Commission of Texas to set aside an action of the short line was null and void. The short line had filed a circular with the Commission in which it fixed the switching limits of a road so as to include all of its line and operations. The Commission had denied appellee trunk line railroad's complaint.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The dispute involved rates and charges that affected a nonparty shipper. The short line had only a single line that was nine miles long, which connected with the trunk line at Altair. Without notifying the trunk line, the short line applied to the Commission for a declaration that the entire line of railroad was within the switching limits of Altair. It also sought to avoid the higher joint-line mileage rates. The trial court declared the short line's operations to be a line haul operation subject to existing rates or at lawful rates fixed by the Commission. It also held that the short line could not declare its entire line to be within the switching limits of Altair. On appeal, the court agreed that the short line's action was unreasonable, arbitrary, and void in that it injuriously affected the trunk line. The short line's terminal at Altair did not extend the entire length of its line. Furthermore, the short line did not render a &quot;terminal switching service.&quot; The short line was completely controlled by the shipper. If it had been permitted to place its entire line within the switching limits of its station at Altair, such act would have resulted in a preference to the shipper.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Finding that the act of the Commission in approving or at least refusing to set aside the short line's action was erroneous, the court affirmed the judgment. The court ruled that railroad regulation in every aspect was within the Commission's jurisdiction; it stated that had the Commission exercised its jurisdiction, it would have reached the same result as the court.</SPAN></P>

The commissioners entered a judgment awarding the landowners a certain amount for the market value of the land taken. The landowners filed an appeal. The trial court entered a judgment in favor of the landowners. Upon review, the court reversed. The court held the trial court improperly allowed testimony concerning the closing of a portion of a street that occurred two years after the taking where such damages were to be excluded from the condemnation award because the landowners did not own land abutting the street section that was closed. The court determined the doctrine of waiver was inapplicable where the issue of the street closing did not come into the case as an element of damage until the landowners first injected it. The court concluded an instruction that provided the jury was to disregard all evidence of community injury was not sufficient to cure all error where it could not be said that the jury did not consider the improper testimony in awarding damages.</SPAN></P>

The essence of the resident's argument, applied to the facts of the case, was that the title failed because it did not detail the body of the bill. The court disagreed and affirmed the trial court's judgment. The court stated that the subject of the title, which stated there would be a grant of additional powers to a named agency, immediately gave rise to the inquiry: What are the additional powers? Upon such notice, the body of the bill could have then been examined. And, the court noted that in this case the body of the bill was short. Thus, the title was constitutionally sufficient. Further, the court also stated that the act concerned one subject, the grant of additional powers to the Willacy County Navigation District, and the body of the bill was germane to that subject. The court found that there was no constitutional violation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following a petition by appellee city pursuant to Fort Worth, Texas, Ordinance 3099, the district court (Texas), rendered judgment permanently enjoining appellant fireworks sellers from storing, possessing, selling, or transporting fireworks in the city or within 5000 feet of the city limits. The sellers appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The sellers were in the business of selling fireworks to the public. The city sought an injunction, urging that the sellers were in violation of the ordinance. The trial court granted permanent injunctive relief. The sellers appealed. Upon consideration, the court affirmed, holding that the ordinance at issue was within the purview of Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 1175, &sect; 19, which gave the city the power to define all nuisances and prohibit the same within the city and outside the city limits for a distance of 5000 feet. In so holding, the court noted that ordinances prohibiting the possession for sale of fireworks were almost universally sustained. According to the court, it was a matter of common knowledge that the combustion of fireworks, especially in the confines of a crowded city, was dangerous not only to property but also to persons, and resulted annually in the loss of property and sometimes in a loss of life. The court rejected the sellers' due process arguments, stating that the court had the power to abate public nuisances when property rights and public safety were involved.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the court stated that Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 2922a authorized the enlargement of nuclear districts by the annexation thereto of other districts. The control of the schools of the enlarged district necessarily rested with the Board, which served the nuclear district at the time of the annexation. The court overruled appellants' contention that Article 2922a was in part unconstitutional because of a noncompliance with the provisions of Tex. Const. art. III, &sect; 35. Further, the court held that the Board did not abuse its discretion in ordering the annexation of the various school districts. The trial judge found that the Board acted in its sound discretion for the best interest of the children involved in ordering the annexations, and there was no abuse of discretion. The court held that the evidence amply supported the findings of the trial judge and that such findings in turn supported the conclusions of law stated and the judgment rendered.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The utility company set its rates for supplying gas to its customers. The rates changed, depending on whether customers contracted with the utility company. The utility company increased its rates, publishing a new schedule. The utility company furnished gas to its contracted customers at the old rate until the contracts expired, then used its new rates. The customers filed suit against the utility company, seeking a temporary and a permanent injunction to restrain it from acting to collect moneys due for gas furnished under the new rates. They also sought a mandatory injunction to compel the utility company to furnish gas at the old rates until all of the customers ceased receiving it at those rates. The trial court found for the utility company, granting its motion for summary judgment, and the customers appealed. The court affirmed and held that the existence of contracts for service at one rate did not prohibit the utility company from establishing a new and different rate. The court held that the customers' failure to claim that the rates were unreasonable or that their competitors were favored, limited their cause of action to discrimination, which they failed to prove.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff sellers appealed a judgment from a trial court (Texas) that dismissed for lack of jurisdiction the sellers' declaratory judgment action in which they sought a determination that an ordinance enacted by defendant, the City of Houston (Texas), which prohibited the sale of a crime comic book to any child under the age of 18, was invalid. The sellers also sought to enjoin enforcement of the ordinance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Although the sellers raised numerous points on appeal, the court deemed it unnecessary to set them forth because the question presented was whether the trial court erred by dismissing the cause for lack of jurisdiction. The court ruled that the trial court properly dismissed the action because the sellers did not establish that they suffered any irreparable injury as a result of the ordinance. Equity would not enjoin criminal proceedings or attempt to stay the enforcement of a criminal law, such as the ordinance, except where the law attempted to be enforced was unconstitutional and void and its enforcement would result in irreparable injury to vested property rights. The court observed that the only penalty provided for in the ordinance was imposed upon any person selling or displaying for sale &quot;comic books&quot; within designated categories. No penalty was imposed upon any purchaser, nor was any destruction or confiscation of property provided for. The sellers were afforded an adequate remedy through the criminal courts, that is, by proceeding in their business and challenging the validity of the ordinance in defense of any prosecution that might be brought against them.</SPAN></P>

The districts brought suit to set aside an order that rescinded a tax levy, for an injunction, and for declaratory judgment adjudicating the power and duty of the commissioners' court to levy taxes.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The districts were established under the authority of Tex. Const. art. 3, &sect; 52. The underlying bonds had been paid off. The commissioners' court levied taxes every year for the maintenance of the drainage improvements. The commissioners' court ordered a levy for one year and then rescinded the order after the state's attorney general issued an opinion that the commissioners' court had no authority under Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 8138 to levy a tax when the bond was fully paid. The trial court agreed and denied the relief requested by the districts. On appeal, the court held that the trial court erred in concluding that the commissioners' court had no authority simply because the districts were bond-free. It made no logical sense to permit the establishment of the drainage districts, and to then not permit a tax to maintain them once the bonds were paid off. Art. 8138 was constitutional. The districts were permitted to levy the necessary taxes without approval of the voters for a maintenance tax. The trial court erred in rendering a declaratory judgment that the commissioners' court did not have the power or duty to levy the annual maintenance tax.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city alleged that the owner violated an ordinance passed by its city council, which was authorized by Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. art. 1175, &sect; 19, with respect to the fireworks and that the city and its inhabitants would suffer irreparable injury and damage to their health, safety, and welfare unless an injunction were granted. The trial court agreed. In affirming the decision, the court first held that the allegations in the city's petition were sufficient to state a cause of action against the owner for public nuisance in fact. Further, the court ruled that the city's ordinance was not invalid, and that the transporting, storing, selling, and hauling of fireworks within 5,000 feet of the city limits constituted a public nuisance per se. Therefore, the court could not strike down the ordinance because the act sought to be prevented was almost, if not quite universally, held to be inherently dangerous and to constitute a hazard to property and a menace to life, limb, and health. Finally, ordinances prohibiting the possession for sale of fireworks were generally sustained.</SPAN></P>

The order was accompanied by appropriate provisions restraining the judges from interfering with petitioner's assumption of the duties of County Auditor of Duval County.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Although there was one preliminary procedural matter raised, the substantial question presented by the appeal was whether or not the office of County Auditor had been abolished at the time petitioner was appointed. The judges asserted that the trial court erred in overruling a plea in abatement because the suit was in effect a mandamus action, not a suit for injunction. The court found that there were differences between the two writs. The order appealed from was not a temporary one. While it could have been properly classified as a mandamus, it was not invalid based on the fact that it was not referred to by that name in either the order itself or in the supporting pleadings. Prior to the appointment of petitioner to the position of County Auditor, the judges ordered that the services of the county auditor be dispensed with and that the duties be assumed by the court clerk. In support of their decision, they relied on Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 1645a-8, as amended by 1953 Tex. Acts ch. 217, &sect; 1. However, the court held that by its very terms, it was not applicable to Duvall County because it only applied to counties within the designated population bracket.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found the judges did not have statutory authority to abolish the position and it affirmed the decision in favor of petitioner.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The guardian first argued that the district court did not have jurisdiction, the exclusive jurisdiction of matters involving persons non compos mentis being vested in the probate court. The court found that suit was brought in the district court under Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 3196a &sect; 5 and it found no conflict with Tex. Const. art. 5, &sect; 16 giving jurisdiction to the county courts in probate matters. Because the claim was presented to the guardian and not allowed by her, jurisdiction in the district court was proper. The purpose of the statute was to authorize suit to enable the State to recover the amount due it for the support of nonindigent patients confined in state hospitals. Under the statute, a verified account, sworn to by the superintendent was sufficient evidence to authorize a court to render judgment. This did deprive the guardian of her due process rights. However, reversal was required because she had disputed fact issues, and the motion for summary judgment should have been overruled.</SPAN></P>

The City brought suit against the board and its individual members in their official capacities. It sought a declaratory judgment declaring Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. art. 1434-a, unconstitutional and establishing its priority of right to withdraw water from the Guadalupe River Watershed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The City sought to determine the feasibility of taking water from the Guadalupe River Watershed to supplement its water supply. Before taking surveys, however, the City sought to establish priority of right to take the water in the event a permit was not granted by the board. The City then tendered a presentation to the board for approval and was denied. The court held that the trial court did not err when it refused to dismiss the cause of action because a justiciable controversy was raised, and the trial court did not commit error when it held that &sect; 1-a was unconstitutional. The court found that a justiciable issue was presented as to the validity of the statute and the rights of the parties under the statute. The court held that the title to the amendment of the Act was deceptive, fatally defective, and violated Tex. Const. art. 3, &sect; 35 and therefore, Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city enacted an ordinance providing that it was unlawful for any person to park a vehicle other than a commercial vehicle in a loading zone. Another ordinance defined a commercial vehicle as one bearing a commercial license plate. The businessman received numerous tickets for parking his vehicle, which was related to his business in making deliveries, in a loading zone because he did not have a commercial license plate. The trial court found that it had no jurisdiction to grant injunctive relief, as such relief could be granted only where a vested property right was involved, and that the ordinance was constitutional. On appeal, the court held that the trial court lacked jurisdiction. Equity would not enjoin criminal proceedings in enforcing criminal law except where the enforcement would result in irreparable injury to vested property rights. The businessman neither alleged nor proved that he had a vested property right to use the streets of the city to conduct business. The court also found, however, that based on the lack of jurisdiction, the trial court improperly ruled on the issue of the ordinance's constitutionality, although such error was not a basis for reversal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The ultimate issue in the action was whether the unions under the provisions of &sect; 152(11), by collective bargaining, could require the execution of a closed shop contract between the unions and the railroad company, which contract would require the discharge of all non-union employees who did not join and remain members of the union. The court reversed the decision of the trial court finding &sect; 152(11)&nbsp;unconstitutional and rendered judgment for the unions. The court noted that &sect; 152(11) was a valid exercise of the commerce power as established by numerous decisions of the U.S. Supreme Court. Moreover, &sect; 152(11) did not violate the First, Fifth, Ninth and Tenth Amendments to the Constitution where there was no governmental action taken on behalf of the unions by the congressional enactment of &sect; 152(11). Moreover, &sect; 152(11) was valid and controlling in the field of labor relations operating in interstate commerce and superseded any state legislation in the same field and contrary thereto, particularly: Tex.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The boxer held a valid boxing license. He applied to the commissioner of labor statistics for permission to have a professional prizefight with a Caucasian boxer. This was in direct violation with Tex. Penal Code Ann. art. 614, &sect;11(f), which made it unlawful for African American boxers to participate in a boxing match with Caucasian boxers. The trial court, sitting without a jury, granted a take nothing judgement for the boxer. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded. The court found that the statute's classification was not based on all colors, it was just focused on Caucasians and African Americans. The court further found that there was no justification for the classification. Boxing was a regulated state activity, which fell within the boundaries of the 14th Amendment. The court found that &sect;11(f) violated the 14th Amendment and was thus null and void. The court remanded so that it could be determined whether the boxer complied with the other rules and regulations related to boxing matches.</SPAN></P>

The majority of taxpayers, who paid taxes in the area, approved the bonds. The bonds were to be paid from taxes on property located in the business district. After the city's attorney general refused to make a decision on the bonds; a number of taxpayers brought an action. The taxpayers favored the bonds and sought a declaration that the bonds were valid. The trial court held that the bonds were invalid. On appeal, the court reversed. The court found that off-street parking facilities constituted permanent public improvements within the purview of the city's charter. The parking was clearly for public use especially where it was used to relive congestion on the street and where the parking was available to the public. The court thus found the trial court erred in holding that the city did not have authority to issue the bonds. The court also found that it was not in violation of Tex. Const. art. VI, &sect; 3a to only allow individuals who resided in the district to vote on the bond issue. The court found that the bonds were valid and directed the city to issue and sell the bonds.</SPAN></P>

It was undisputed that the territory detached by the ordinance in question was inhabited by approximately 20,000 people, that it had many permanent improvements including water mains, electric power and telephone lines, gas mains, paved streets, sewer lines, and many residential and business houses. The city asserted that Tex. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 1266 violated Tex. Const. art. III, &sect; 56, which provided that the legislature could not pass any local or special law regulating the affairs of cities. The court sided with the State. Tex. Civ. Stat.

The committee contended that art. 8.22 was unconstitutional and that the citizens did not have an interest in the matter sufficient to give them standing to petition for mandamus. The court held that the duties imposed on the committee were public duties in which any citizen in the district had an interest. Thus, the citizens were qualified to bring the action. The court further held that there was no conflict between art. 8.22 and the constitution. The constitutional provisions providing for a nominee were not intended to apply to a situation where the nominee died after the deadline for filing, and art. 8.22 did not provide for the nomination of a deceased candidate but, rather, provided a procedural method by which a nominee could be selected by the committee if the name of the deceased candidate received the most votes.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A property owner's land was condemned to build a lake. Instead of agreeing to sell the entire parcel, the property owner elected to keep a 31.8 acre tract. The property owner realized that with the creation of the lake, his property would become landlocked. The property owner applied to the commissioners to open a road across the landowners' ranch. On appeal, the court found that under Tex. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 6711, the commissioners' court could declare public highways. Art. 6711 also established notice requirements before a private land could be condemned for use as a public highway. The fact that the road would benefit the property owner did not make it a private road. The road was not restricted to his use, but open to and to be used by all members of the public wishing to use it. The undisputed evidence demonstrated that the property owner had no public road to or from his land and his place of residence. Any overland route had to be over the landowners' land. That the property owner became landlocked as a result of refusing to sell his landlocked land did not mean he was not entitled to a public road.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The realtors brought a quo warranto proceeding through the county district attorney questioning the validity of certain election proceedings by the City of Houston, held for the purpose of annexing a large territory surrounding the city which included property owned by the realtors. The realtors sought to enjoin the City of Houston from exercising authority in the annexed area and sought a declaratory judgment determining the validity of a contract between the City of Houston and the City of Bellaire by which the City of Bellaire furnished water and sewer service to the annexed property. The trial court entered a judgment in favor of the cities, and the realtors appealed. The court affirmed, holding that the election was not void because an order of the city council setting the election for a date more than 30 days after its order did not violate the city charter and because great inconvenience would have resulted from a finding that the city limits were not validly extended. The court found that the contract for water and sewer service was valid because the rates charged under the contract were lawful and were not discriminatory.</SPAN></P>

Appellants alleged that a certain ordinance purporting to define and regulate itinerant merchants, vendors, and peddlers was unconstitutional and void. Appellants sought review of a judgment of a trial court (Texas), which denied the relief sought by appellants.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants alleged that the ordinance was violative of Tex. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 1 and U.S. Const. amend. XIV. The trial court found that the partnership was engaged in selling dry goods, dishes, and kitchen utensils in the city through its agent, who went from house to house in the city in connection with the sale of such merchandise on credit. The agent spent only one-half day each week in the city. The partnership had been engaged in carrying on its business in the city for a number of years. Appellants argued that the charge exacted of them as a condition precedent to the lawful pursuit of their business in the city was so large as to effectively impose an occupation tax upon them. The city contended that the charge was actually a license fee that enabled the city to partially defray the expense of enforcing the provisions of the licensing ordinance. The court held that the charge was so large and excessive as to render the ordinance invalid insofar as its enforcement against appellants was concerned because such oppressive exaction by a town of less than 2,500 population was manifestly prohibitive and confiscatory in its application to the business of appellants.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The private corporations, which constructed and maintained toll roads, were chartered prior to the creation of the Texas Turnpike Authority. Tex. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 6674v, &sect;&sect; 15(n), 18 pertained to such private corporations and toll roads constructed and operated by them. The private corporations successfully argued in the trial court that under the terms of Tex. Civ. Stat.

Reversing the judgment, the court held that the private corporation's property was not tax-exempt because it was not public property devoted exclusively to public purposes within the purview of Tex. Const. art. XI, &sect; 9. Under the provisions of Tex. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 6674v, &sect; 18, legal title did not pass to the State while any road was pending acceptance by the State. The State's interest in the property was no more than an indirect and uncertain expectancy that did not entitle the property to tax exemption. Because the property was subject to taxation, Tex. Civ.

The trial court condemned the land. On appeal, the court affirmed. The 1947 amendment to Tex. Stat. Ann. art. 8263h, &sect; 50, the statute under which condemnation was sought, was not unconstitutional due to the fact that it permitted the district to acquire property close to a port to lease it as an industrial site and it was a public use because it was a matter of common knowledge that industrial development and the successful operation of ports were essential to each other. The trial court had jurisdiction over the action, and did not err by denying the landowners' motion for a change of venue.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The City sought a declaratory judgment to establish the legality of the City of Laredo, Texas, Milk Ordinance (Ordinance), adopted in accordance with Tex.

The City also sought a temporary injunction to restrain the dairy from selling or offering to sell its milk or milk products within the City or its police jurisdiction until it obtained a permit from the City's health officer, as required by the Ordinance. At the time the dairy filed its answer to the City's petition, it had not applied for such a permit. The trial court issued the temporary injunction prayed for by the City. On appeal, the court rejected the dairy's contention that prior cases involving other dairies governed the result in this case. The court noted that the principle of virtual representation did not apply and that the prior suits were not class actions, within the meaning of Tex. R. Civ. P. 42. The court further noted that Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 165-3, &sect;3, itself contemplated a permit to be issued by an incorporated city's health officer. The court held that application for a permit under the Ordinance was a prerequisite to any challenge by the dairy to its validity.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner sought to enjoin defendants from enforcing the provisions of the fire code prohibiting the selling of fireworks in the city. On appeal, the owner urged that the ordinance, No. 4370, art. 41-2(f), was invalid and deprived him of substantial property rights without due process of law. The owner also alleged that trial court erred in its conclusion of law that the city had authority to enact the ordinance. He claimed that the trial court erred in finding that there was no conflict between the ordinance and any state statutes and finding that fireworks and firecrackers were inherently dangerous to life, limb, and property. The court determined that (1) the ordinance was not an arbitrary abuse of the city's police power as it was clearly aimed at preventing fire and other damage from fireworks, (2) Texas, by its occupation tax, in no way invaded the field of the regulation of the sale of fireworks in the city, (3) there was no conflict between the statute and the ordinance because cannon crackers were nowhere described as fireworks in either law or ordinance, and (4) it was common knowledge that the use of fireworks in crowded areas was dangerous to both life and property.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The oil company had filed suit in another county to enjoin a county from enforcing certain taxes. While that action was pending, the Attorney General delivered a letter of visitation to the oil company, demanding an inspection of the oil company's corporate records. The oil company filed the present action, seeking to enjoin the Attorney General's examination of such records and to enjoin the use of such records in the pending tax suit in the other county. The trial court declared that the Attorney General had acted within the scope of his lawful investigatory powers under the visitation statutes, Tex. Civ. Stat. Ann. arts. 1366 to 1371, and denied any injunctive relief. On appeal, the court reversed. Although the Attorney General was acting within the scope of his lawful powers in inspecting the oil company's records, the Attorney General was acting beyond the scope of his lawful powers in taking copies of such records for use in the pending tax suit. The Attorney General's visitorial powers were limited to suits involving the violation of corporate charter rights and privileges or violations of regulatory provisions and were not available to aid in the tax suit.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Para. 37 provided that a list of names of delinquent retail dealers was distributed to various wholesalers who extended credit to such dealers. The licensee argued that because his name was on the list, he was unable to procure credit to purchase liquor to sell. On appeal, the court affirmed, finding that the liquor business was subject to regulation under the police power of the state. The court discussed the legitimate scope of the police power and discussed the relation of the public welfare and other objectives to such legislation. The court concluded that the legislature's purpose was to regulate liquor traffic by keeping various levels of the industry independent. As long as the legislation was reasonably geared toward the preservation of the public welfare or to prevent some manifest evil and was not arbitrary or capricious, the licensee's right to contract was subordinate. Due process, which was measured by the terms of the law under which the license was issued, was not violated. By voluntarily submitting to the laws regulating retail liquor dealers and by accepting the benefits of such laws, the licensee waived the right to challenge the constitutionality of para. 37.</SPAN></P>

The districts appealed the Board's refusal to make an adjustment of the economic indexes of the two counties in the light of an unprecedented freeze and its devastating effect upon the counties. The trial court rendered a take nothing judgment against the districts. In affirming the trial court's judgment, the court held that art. 2922-16 was constitutional and that the economic index was not an arbitrary basis of distribution of school funds. The court further held that the Board's action in approving the economic indexes for the counties was supported by substantial evidence. The evidence adduced at trial failed to show a sudden marked decline in the economic activity in the counties. Moreover, had the economic indexes for the counties been recomputed at the time of the entry of judgment on the basis of the most recently available information from the sources enumerated art. 2922-16, the economic indexes would have been as high as or higher than those adopted by the Board.</SPAN></P>

The purchaser contended that the contract was void and unenforceable because many of its provisions violated antitrust law and public policy. He also argued that the provisions for the payment of royalties failed for lack of consideration. The court concluded that the contract was not void and affirmed the judgment. It found that the parties had intended to make a contract legal in all respects. They prudently added a clause, which provided that any illegal portion of the contract would be inoperative and that in any event the obligation concerning the cash consideration and royalty payments would be binding. The court concluded that the saving feature of the contract removed all impediments to the enforcement of the agreement to pay royalties. It rejected the purchaser's contention that the provision for royalties was too vague to be enforced. It found that the parties had construed the provision that the purchaser would pay $ 20 per gallon to mean 20 cents per gallon. The purchaser was bound by that construction.</SPAN></P>

The cotton was later sold. The landlord's heirs intervened and asserted their rights as prior lienholders under the provisions of Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. art. 5222. The court noted that the bank never undertook to offer proof that the written contract of lease entered into between the landlord and tenant was illegal and the only question on appeal was whether events subsequent to the contract resulted in the loss of the landlord's lien. The court held that regarding the cotton raised on the leased land by the tenant, the landlord and his heirs were secured in the lien so long as they did not attempt to impose a charge upon the cotton raised to be applied to the debt owing for rent, in excess of one-fourth of the cotton crop or its value. The court concluded that the landlord's heirs lost the statutory lien because of the demand to deliver more than one-fourth of the value.</SPAN></P>

The case did not involve fact issues but the validity of a rate-making order, which was a question of law, appropriate for summary judgment. The court held: (1) that the plan was not invalid because it took into consideration losses sustained during the policy; (2) that the plan was not fatally defective on the ground that it involved retroactive as distinguished from prospective rate making; (3) that the phrase &quot;subject to the acceptance of the insurance carrier&quot; in the Board's order provided the carrier with uncontrolled discretion, which was discriminatory; (4) that the discretionary nature of the phrase &quot;subject to the acceptance of the insurance carrier&quot; did not destroy the Board's order as a whole; (5) that the invalidity of this portion of the order did not affect the validity of the retrospective plan itself; and (6) that the invalid portion was separable from the valid portion on the order.</SPAN></P>

The lender required the debtors to buy an investment certificate, which secured the promissory note. The debtors sued the lender, and the trial court found in its favor. The debtors appealed, and the court noted that, although stipulated by the parties, the lender did not fully comply with Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 1524a-1. The court overruled the debtors' arguments that Art. 1524a-1 was unconstitutional, but further noted that the provision of Art. 1524a-1 that declared that the making of loans and the selling of certificates of investment were two separate and distinct transactions, and that periodic payments required on the certificates of investment would not be considered as periodic payments on the loan, was pure fiction. The court also found that, even though the loan transaction was within the provisions of Art. 1524a-1, usurious interest was charged on the loan debt. The court held that, even though the issue was not presented under appropriate point of error, because the lender admitted that it issued the investment certificates at issue only to borrowers, it was not in compliance with Art. 1524a-1.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The duct was laid in an alley, which adjoined the food store's property. The food store entered into a contract a general contractor to construct a building on its property. The plan called for excavation for a basement. During the excavation, approximately 120 feet of the duct caved into the excavation, breaking the cables and causing considerable damage. The food store contended that their failure to comply with the building code did not render them guilty of negligence per se. The court held that that the definition of the word &quot;structure&quot; contained in the building code was sufficiently comprehensive to include the concrete duct involved. Unquestionably, the dominant purpose of the provisions of the building code was for the protection of the adjoining property owners. It was negligence to carry on and conduct the excavation and the removal of the perpendicular and lateral support adjacent to and under the structure without taking precautions. The court reversed the judgment and the case was remanded.</SPAN></P>

Appellee firemen, seeking a limitation on the number of hours they were required to work, filed suit based upon a petition by more than 10 percent of the qualified voters of the city.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Municipal firemen sought to amend the city's charter through the initiative and referendum process. The language of the legislation proposed by the petition was an enlargement of legislative provisions governing the hours of work. Under the proposal the firemen would work only five shifts biweekly, rather than six shifts prescribed as maximum under the law. The charter had no provision with reference to initiative or referendum connected with amendment, although it did have provision as to initiative of the people for the holding of an election to enact a city ordinance. Appellants resisted the proposed amendment as an usurping of their authority. The court held that: (1) under Tex. Const. art. 11, &sect; 5, the electorate were free to amend the charter as long as it did not contain any provision inconsistent with Texas law; (2) under the charter, the council's duty was to pass the initiative petition as written for submission to the electorate at the next city election; and (3) only the city secretary was authorized to exercise any discretion, and that discretion was limited to the determination of whether the requisite number of qualified voters had signed the petition.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The companies were engaged in the business of transporting natural gas by pipe line. The companies primarily purchased gas produced by other corporations. One of the companies transmitted all of the gas so purchased to other states through a pipeline that originated in Texas, another company made sales in Texas to three small customers and sent the rest of its gas outside the state, while the final company transported its gas in intrastate commerce only. The state statute at issue, Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 7057f, taxed as a local activity the gathering of gas in Texas. The companies argued that the statute violated the commerce clause of the federal constitution because the gas was in interstate commerce from the time it left the mouths of the producing wells. Rejecting this contention, the appellate court reversed the trial court's judgments in favor of the companies and rendered judgments that the companies take nothing by their respective suits. The tax levied by the statute was fairly commensurate with the protection and benefits conferred by the state upon the companies and did not interfere with Congress's authority to regulate interstate commerce.</SPAN></P>

The trial court overruled the city's new trial motion, but the pedestrian agreed to a remittitur suggested by the trial court at a hearing on the city's motion for judgment non obstante veredicto (JNOV).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city claimed that the pedestrian did not comply with the notice provisions of its charter because he failed to notify the city of his injuries until nearly five months after the accident. The pedestrian relied on unchallenged jury findings that he was physically and mentally unable to give such notice for 90 days after the accident to toll the notice requirement. At the hearing on the new trial motion, jurors testified that there was speculation about the attorneys' fees the pedestrian would be required to pay and that those fees were considered in determining damages. There was also evidence that the jurors found that the charter's notice requirement was unfair to the pedestrian and should not be used to prevent his recovery. The court held that the notice requirement only applied to those capable of giving notice within the prescribed period and that the notice provision was discriminatory and unreasonable if applied as a defense against liability under the facts found by the jury. However, it sustained the city's contentions that the jury's discussions about the attorney's fees and the charter's notice requirement amounted to material misconduct that warranted a new trial.</SPAN></P>

The railroad company contended that the truck driver was contributory negligence and negligent per se for failing to stop within 50 feet but not less than 15 feet from the nearest rail as required by Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 6701d, &sect; 86. The truck driver contended that article 6710d, &sect; 86c was unconstitutionally vague and indefinite. On appeal, the court determined that article 6710d, &sect; 86c was constitutional and that the truck driver's violation of the statute was negligence per se.

The trial court found that the trustee's sale was conducted four years, one month, and five days after the note secured by the deed of trust matured, and therefore, the sale and deed made thereunder to plaintiff was void. The court held the sale was not void under S.B. 489, ch. 59, 43d Leg. and H.B. 914, ch. 105, 43d Leg. The court held that the Acts applied to sales that were then being advertised. It is undisputed that the trustee in the deed of trust in question was not at that time attempting to sell the land in controversy under the powers given him by the deed of trust. The Acts did not attempt in any way to toll the statute of limitation. They did not create an exception to such statutes. At the time these statutes were enacted limitation had already begun to run against the deed.</SPAN></P>

The trial court denied injunctive relief and the citizens and the county appealed. The court affirmed and held that &sect; 4 of the Dallas County Road Law of 1941, 47th Leg., amend. 51st Leg. (Reg.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city passed an ordinance providing that it was illegal to harbor livestock within the city unless owners of the livestock complied with specific regulations.

There were 25 establishments dispensing food for human consumption within 200 yards of the owners' business, and the owners typically had 25 to 75 animals located on their premises. The trial court held that the ordinance was an improper exercise of police power and enjoined its enforcement. The court reversed, holding that cities had broad powers to enact health measures and that the ordinance did not violate the owners' due process rights. The court ruled that the operation of the owners' business created unsanitary conditions and that the unsanitary conditions justified the exercise of the city's police powers in treating the owners' business as a nuisance.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant inhabitants sought review of a judgment from the trial court (Texas), which granted respondent city's motion for summary judgment in a quo warranto action to determine the validity of the city's annexation of land pursuant to Waxahachie, Tex., Charter art. II, &sect; 2 (1946).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inhabitants challenged an action of the city, which annexed additional territory under the authority conferred by Waxahachie, Tex., Charter art. II, &sect; 2 (1916), which was amended by Waxahachie, Tex., Charter art. II, &sect; 2 (1946). The inhabitants contended that the annexation was void because the challenged ordinances denied due process and equal protection under the law, contrary to U.S. Const. amends. V, XIV and Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 19. The inhabitants contended that the 1946 amendment to art. II, &sect; 2 had not repealed the 1916 version of the ordinance, which resulted in an arbitrary exercise of power. The trial court granted the city's motion for summary judgment. On appeal, the court noted that the 1946 amendment extended the right of the city to annex land without the need of any petition or vote of owners of the affected territory. The amendment impliedly repealed inconsistent and repugnant provisions in the earlier Charter. Because the annexation ordinance was enacted by a home rule city, within the meaning of Tex. Const. art. art. XI, &sect; 5 after a valid charter amendment, the inhabitants were not denied due process or equal protection of the law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, an injured wife and her husband, appealed the decision from the Special Ninth District Court of Montgomery County (Texas), which entered judgment for defendant vehicle owner in plaintiffs' suit for personal injuries and damages following an accident. The district court granted a plea of abatement filed by the vehicle owner on the basis that the suit was untimely.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The suit stated that plaintiffs were man and wife and that the injured wife's disability of coverture was not removed. The vehicle owner contended that the suit violated the two-year statute of limitations. Plaintiffs contended that the disability of coverture tolled the limitations period under Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 5535. Further, they contended that the vehicle owner waived the issue by not filing a plea of misjoinder. On appeal, the court disagreed. In order to assert the statute, the injured wife had to be the proper person to bring the action. Because the suit was based on personal injuries to her and damage to the vehicle, a part of the community property, the husband should have brought the suit. Because the husband failed to file suit within the statute of limitations, the suit was time barred. A misjoinder plea was not required because the suit set forth all the elements that would allow the district court to rule. While the injured wife was not a proper party, it was not improper to allow her to remain named as a plaintiff.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the dismissal of the suit as untimely.</SPAN></P>

The district court held that Tex. Civ. Stat.

Although the child was adopted in the State of Missouri, the court held that under the 1931 Texas Adoption Act, the child was not entitled to share in the distribution of the estate because he could not take from collateral kindred.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Texas Senate passed a bill, codified as Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. art. 2756b, that allowed the establishment of independent school districts on any federally-owned military reservation land located within the state. Based on this bill, the state's board of education issued orders permitting the annexation of military reservation lands into nearby independent school districts. The school district, based on the board of education's orders, filed an action for a judgment permitting it to annex a nearby military reservation in its district, so that the school district would qualify for more education funding. The trial court denied the petition and held that the bill was void and unconstitutional, that it did not convey the authority to the board of education to issue such orders, and that the board of education's orders were in excess of its authority. The school district sought review. The court found that the bill was not unconstitutional, that the board of education had the legal authority to include the military reservation within the school district, and that its orders were effective and valid.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The bureau was made up of all the principal railroads of the State of Texas. Several livestock traffic associations filed a petition with the Commission to lower the freight rates for livestock feed. Prior to the hearing, the associations orally amended their petition to limit its scope to a reduction of rail rates only. The bureau contended that the Commission's order violated the due process and equal protection clauses of the state and federal constitutions because it was not applicable to motor carriers. Upon review, the court found that Tex. Civ. Stat. Ann. arts. 6458 and 6459 were not unconstitutional because the emergency rates they provided for were not applicable to motor carriers. The court found that the Commission was justified in entering the order because the discrimination between the railroads and the motor carriers was not so unjust as to invalidate the order. The bureau failed to make a showing that it was unreasonable for the Commission to enter an order that made the emergency freight rates apply only to the railroads. Motor carriers were governed by Tex. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 911b.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the order that denied the bureau's action for a temporary injunction restraining the Commission from enforcing its emergency freight rate order.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Authority for the injunction was a comprehensive zoning ordinance passed by the city. Under the terms of the ordinance the district in which the businesses had their yards was classified as a light industrial district, and the businesses were ordered in effect to move or eradicate their businesses by a certain date. All of the businesses had been doing business at their present locations when the first comprehensive zoning ordinance of the city was adopted and continued to do business at the same locations ever since. They operated in the same buildings, on the same yards, and to the same extent ever since the first ordinance was passed. By the zoning ordinance they were placed in a district in which they did not conform and each had been a non-complying business ever since that time. The court reversed the trial court's judgment and dissolved the injunction. The court stated that to order a prior existing non-conforming business to move or go out of business was unreasonable and constituted a taking of the businesses' property without due process of law and without compensation in violation of Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 17.</SPAN></P>
