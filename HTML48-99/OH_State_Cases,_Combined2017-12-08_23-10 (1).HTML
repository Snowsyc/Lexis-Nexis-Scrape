</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The homeowner sought a permit to use his property as an in-home insurance office. The planning commission determined that the homeowner was not actually residing at the property at issue and denied the permit. On appeal, the homeowner argued, inter alia, that the lower court erred in finding that the planning commission's action was not contrary to the city's zoning ordinances and challenged the constitutionality of the application of the ordinance. The court found that the homeowner had violated the ordinance by employing his stepdaughter, who, concededly, did not reside at the property at issue. The court further held that the ordinance did not directly impact the homeowner's family living arrangements, but was rationally related to its stated purpose of protecting the residential character of the neighborhood by limiting commercial uses of the home. There was no indication that the city enforced the ordinance in an arbitrary, capricious or discriminatory manner, or that there was a taking of the property.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the lower court's judgment, which upheld that denial of the homeowner's home occupation permit, and overruled the homeowner's assignments of error.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The records were sought under the Ohio Public Records Act, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 149.43 et seq.

In dismissing, the court held that there was an available legal remedy provided by Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 5120.21(C)(2) to access such records, which rendered the extraordinary relief by way of mandamus unavailable.

Appellant filed a pro se motion with the trial court requesting that his sentence be set aside. The trial court overruled the motion. Appellant filed a notice of appeal and the court affirmed the trial court's decision. Appellant then filed a petition for post-conviction relief and the trial court denied that motion. Appellant contended that he was entitled to be re-sentenced in conformity with Am. Sub. S.B. 2 (Ohio 1996). On review, the court held that because appellant's sentence was imposed before the enactment of Am. Sub. S.B. 2 (Ohio 1996), Ohio Rev.

The corporation filed a counterclaim. The trial court granted judgment for the ex-employee on the claims of fraud and breach of fiduciary duty and dismissed the counterclaim. The corporation and the ex-employee appealed. The court held that the trial court properly (1) denied the corporation's motions for directed verdict and for judgment notwithstanding the verdict because a fraud claim existed under Ohio R. Civ. P. 50, (2) admitted expert testimony under Ohio R. Evid. 104, 702, (3) refused to grant the motions for directed verdict and judgment notwithstanding the verdict as to punitive damages because the evidence supported these damages under Ohio R. Civ. P. 50, and (4) dismissed the counterclaim for breach of contract because there was no evidence of damages. The court held that a genuine issue of material fact existed as to the claim for constructive discharge, the motion for new trial on damages based on the jury's clerical error was properly denied because the jurors were not competent witnesses under Ohio R. Evid. 606(B), and punitive damages were properly assessed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The administrator contended that the insurer was liable for the bull bodily injury liability of $ 300,00 for each accident because his daughter had two surviving parents and two brothers each with a separate claim for damages suffered as a result of her death. On appeal, the administrator argued that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment to the insurer. Upon review, the court found the administrator's argument without merit. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3937.44 operated alike on all persons who contracted for policies of automobile liability insurance with an insurer, or who brought bodily injury and/or wrongful death claims against a tortfeasor's policy of liability insurance. All persons who contracted for coverage providing bodily injury liability of $ 100,000 each person and $ 300,000 each accident were to receive up to that amount of coverage for which they contracted and no more. Similarly, all persons who brought bodily injury claims and/or wrongful death claims against a tortfeasor's policy of liability insurance were to receive up to the amount of coverage for which the tortfeasor contracted and no more.</SPAN></P>

In seeking the writ, relator claimed that the board's denial of parole had violated relator's due process rights.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Claiming to have been denied due process of law to a fair and impartial parole hearing, relator sought a writ of mandamus ordering the board to grant a new parole hearing and to correct information on relator's assessment/risk aggregate score sheet. After the trial court dismissed relator's complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted, relator sought review. Upon review, the court held that a claim for a new parole hearing could not be based on violations of relator's due process rights because: (1) there was no constitutional or inherent right to be conditionally released before the expiration of a valid sentence; and (2) state law made parole decisions discretionary, which meant that a prisoner denied parole was not thereby deprived of &quot;liberty.&quot; The court also held that relator's unsupported conclusions regarding the false and erroneous information had been insufficient to withstand the board's motion to dismiss. Finally, the court held that the board had not been required to provide relator with a copy of the score sheet because relator's parole file was not a public record.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury found defendant guilty of one count of kidnapping and three counts of rape. In his postconviction petition, defendant broadly asserted that he was denied ineffective assistance of counsel in that counsel failed to secure and present available evidence which had a reasonable probability of affecting the verdict, and that counsel failed to object to evidence and misconduct by the state prejudicial to petitioner. The trial court properly dismissed this petition as defendant had not set forth sufficient operative facts to demonstrate the lack of competent counsel and that the defense was prejudiced by counsel's ineffectiveness. Specifically, defendant's accompanying affidavit did not indicate what evidence his counsel failed to obtain nor did he point to any specific false evidence or misconduct by the prosecution for which his counsel should have raised an objection. Thus, the trial court did not err in failing to grant a hearing on defendant's claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. Further, the trial court was not required to grant a hearing on the petition absent a showing that there were substantive grounds for relief.</SPAN></P>

The insured brought the action for underinsured motorist coverage and breach of contract against the insurer, and both parties filed motions for summary judgment. The insured was injured when his motorcycle was struck by a vehicle.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The collision occurred as a result of the other driver's negligence. The insurance contract provided that the insured was to exhaust the liability limits of the tortfeasor's insurer prior to making a claim for underinsured motorist benefits. Prior to reaching a settlement with the other driver's insurer, the insured notified the insurer of his underinsured motorists benefits claim. The insurer denied the claim. The other driver's insurer paid a sum less than its liability limit. The insured argued that the claim for underinsured motorist coverage did not accrue until the date that he settled with the other driver's liability carrier. The insurer also contended that the trial court erred by finding that the cause of action accrued prior to the effective date of the 1994 amendment of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3937.18. The court reversed the judgment granted to the insurer. The insured's cause of action accrued on the date he settled with the tortfeasor's insurer, after the amendment of &sect; 3937.18. Because the insured collected from the tortfeasor's insurer an amount greater than the amount of his own policy's underinsured coverage, &sect; 3937.18 prevented him from collecting from the insurer.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the summary judgment granted to the insured and remanded with instruction to enter summary judgment in favor of the insurer.</SPAN></P>

The trial court sentenced him to 18 months of incarceration, which was suspended on the condition that defendant serve six months' of actual time. Defendant sought review and contended that the sentencing was unconstitutional. The court held that defendant's sentence was unconstitutional. Pursuant to Ohio Rev.

Further, under Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 15(D), no law was to be amended unless the entire act contained the revived and repealed sections. The court held that the trial court was required to comply with the amended sentencing guidelines, and the court reversed and remanded the sentence. However, the court determined that the trial court properly accepted defendant's guilty plea because it had ensured that such plea was knowingly and intelligently made as required under Ohio R. Crim.

Stat. &sect; 2903.01(B) with specifications, pursuant to Ohio Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 2929.04(A) (7), 2941.14, that the murder was committed during the course of an aggravated robbery, and aggravated robbery under Ohio Rev. Stat. &sect; 2911.01 with a prior offense specification pursuant to Ohio Rev. Stat. &sect; 2941.142.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a second murder with unique characteristics was committed, defendant was convicted. At his trial on the first murder with the same unique characteristics, the State introduced the conviction for the first murder. Defendant claimed that the admission was too prejudicial to be admissible. The court affirmed the conviction and the death penalty. Pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2945.59 and Ohio R. Evid. 404(B), evidence of the first murder was admissible because its unique characteristics tended to prove defendant's identity, scheme, motive, or system in the second murder and there was substantial evidence that he committed the first murder. The trial court carefully instructed the jury not to use the first murder to convict defendant and there was no error in raising the first murder at voir dire. There was no error in the trial court having instructed the jury on all mitigating factors, though defendant did not raise all of them. The sentence was not unconstitutional merely because there was no death sentence for many years. Defendant's mitigating circumstances of his age and unfortunate childhood experiences were considered but his background did not excuse the murder.</SPAN></P>

The insured filed a complaint for declaratory judgment and other relief against the insurer, requesting the trial court to declare that its insurance policy provided a total of $ 300,000 in uninsured/underinsured motorist benefits.

The insurer filed a motion for summary judgment, which the trial court denied. The insurer appealed and the court reversed and remanded. The court held that the statute was constitutional and that the trial court improperly invalidated the amendments to Ohio Rev.

The executrix filed a claim against the manufacturer of the welding equipment, and included in the complaint was a cause of action against the employer for an intentional tort in the workplace. The complaint was filed less than two years from the date of death. The employer was granted summary judgment on the ground that the complaint had not been filed against it within the one-year statute of limitations under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2305.112 for employment related wrongful death actions, which became effective after the date of death. On appeal, the court noted that &sect; 2305.112 had been declared void, and Ohio Rev.

The date of death preceded the effective date of the voided statute, and the action was filed before the statute was reenacted subsequently by the legislature.

On appeal, he argued, inter alia, that the Medical Board's order was not supported substantial evidence and challenged the constitutionality of the revocation statute,&nbsp;Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4731.22, as applied. The court affirmed. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in finding that the Medical Board's order was supported by substantial, reliable, and probative evidence. The statute permitted the Medical Board to refuse reinstatement of an applicant found guilty of a felony, and the doctor's continued denial of wrongdoing justified the Medical Board's determination. Section 4731.22 was enacted under the state's police power to protect the public's safety and welfare. As such, it was presumed constitutional. The doctor failed to overcome the presumption by showing the statute bore no substantial relation to a legitimate state interest.</SPAN></P>

The trial court sentenced defendant to prison terms of 1 year on the first count and 18 months on the second count, the maximum terms permitted on each count. In its sentencing entry, the trial court stated that it considered the statutory criteria of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 2929.11, 2929.12, 2929.13. Upon analyzing the factors of Ohio Rev.

The court reversed the judgment and held that the trial court could not impose the maximum term of imprisonment available under Ohio Rev.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of the trial court (Ohio), which convicted him of two counts of robbery, third-degree felonies, in violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2911.02(A)(3).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">This case dealt with the application of Ohio's new felony sentencing procedures in Senate Bill 2. Defendant appealed his sentence. On review, the court affirmed. The provisions of Senate Bill 2 required a consideration of defendant's likelihood of recidivism. This did not permit a judge to increase or enhance a sentence based upon a speculative prediction that the accused was likely to commit unnamed and uncharged crimes in the future. The statutory procedure of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2929.12(D) and (E) for determining whether an individual was more or less likely to be a recidivist did not deny the accused due process of law. The trial court did not err in finding that defendant committed an offense that was &quot;more serious&quot; than the conduct normally constituting robbery. The use of a firearm significantly increased the likelihood that the victims could be subjected to serious injury or death and was relevant in determining the seriousness of the offense. The victims suffered psychological harm. Under R.C. 2929.14(C), the trial court could the longest prison term. Defendant had an extensive juvenile and criminal record.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was involved in a robbery and three murders, and pled guilty to three counts of involuntary manslaughter. He filed an appeal, which was denied as untimely, and thereafter filed a motion for post-conviction relief, which was also denied. Appellant sought review and the court affirmed the convictions. The court held that there was no actual conflict of interest by his attorney's representation of a state witness against him, and that he had received effective assistance. The court held that he waived a defense of the statute of limitations and waived his right to compulsory process upon entering his plea of guilty. The court further held there were no discovery violations which required reversal, and that his right to a speedy trial was waived when his plea was entered. The court also held that appellant's right to confrontation was not violated because appellant failed to show prejudice, that there was no judicial or prosecutorial misconduct, and that the state presented sufficient evidence.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The administrator's wife was killed in a traffic accident and he sued the motorist for negligence and sought recovery under UDM policies with the insurer. The claim against the motorist was dismissed when the administrator was paid the $ 100,000 policy limit on the motorist's liability coverage. However, summary judgment was entered for the insurer pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3937.18 (1994), an amendment that became effective eight days before the accident and which provided, inter alia, that UDM coverage was not excess insurance to other applicable liability coverages. The administrator appealed, arguing that case law in effect at the time the policies were issued applied and that such law allowed for recovery. In affirming, the appellate court ruled that the law in effect when the right to UDM coverage accrued controlled, not the law in effect when the contracts were entered. Thus, the amended &sect; 3937.18 applied. The UDM policies did not create vested contractual rights and application of the statute did not violate the prohibition on retroactive statutes under Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 28.</SPAN></P>

The federal court held that the Act was unconstitutional as applied to vehicle owners whose vehicles and/or license plates had been or would be seized while their vehicles were being driven by third persons.

On appeal, the inmate claimed that his sentences should be modified so as to conform to the sentencing guidelines enacted by the passage of Am. Sub. S.B. 2. The inmate argued that failure to resentence him under the new guidelines, giving prospective rather than retrospective application to the sentencing guidelines, amounted to a denial of equal protection and deprived him of due process. The court disagreed and affirmed. The court held that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 1.58(B), which allowed one awaiting sentencing to obtain the benefit of amended sentencing/punishment criteria, did not apply because the inmate had already been sentenced.

On appeal, defendant contended that the bill was unconstitutional in that it violated his right to equal protection. The court disagreed, holding that the classification drawn by Am. Sub. S.B. 2, &sect; 5 between felons who committed their offenses before the effective date and those who committed their offenses after that date was not based upon an inherently suspect characteristic. Further, the classification did not threaten the exercise of a fundamental right. Further, the court stated that it was self-evident that &sect; 5 furthered the State's legitimate interests in promoting judicial efficiency. Because defendant was sentenced six years before the effective date of the bill, he lacked standing to challenge &sect; 5 on the basis that it unlawfully provided an exception to Ohio Rev.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that the state Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) was not constitutional, that there was insufficient evidence to sustain his conviction, and that a financial sanction was improperly imposed without a hearing.

The court held that the state RICO statute was constitutional, in spite of defendant's assertion that that statute was vague on the ground that it lacked a definition of key terms, failed to state a mens rea requirement, and because it had the potential to inhibit a person's exercise of the constitutional right of association. The court held that the statute's key terms gave the defendant fair notice of the forbidden conduct, that a mens rea element was not required, and that the statute did not inhibit defendant's constitution rights.</SPAN></P>

The court found that there was a question of fact whether there was a failure by the bus driver to leave the child in a place of safety, in violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4575(E).

Defendant argued that the trial court improperly sentenced him on both his conviction for felonious assault and attempted murder. The court found that the offenses were not committed separately nor were they committed with a separate animus. The acts clearly constituted one crime with a single animus.The State contended that if the court found it necessary to reverse one of the convictions, it requested that the conviction for felonious assault be vacated and the conviction for attempted murder be affirmed. When multiple sentences were imposed for allied offenses, one of the sentences had to be vacated. The decision upon which offense defendant was to be sentenced was one to be made by the prosecution.

The bank then initiated the action pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2117.12 against the fiduciary. The fiduciary argued that the claim was not timely filed. On appeal, the bank argued that the trial court should not have found that the bank's claim was time barred when the fiduciary did not seek to administrate the estate until one year after the death of the decedent and that there was a genuine issue of material fact as to whether it was a reasonably ascertainable creditor entitled to notice. The court held that the first argument was of no legal consequence because the estate was administered within the parameters of Ohio law and the bank could have initiated the administration itself pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2113.06. The court also disagreed with the second argument.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court held that the Ohio General Assembly clearly expressed an intent that Senate Bill 2 not be applied retroactively. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's judgment, holding that Senate Bill 2 did not apply retroactively. The court rejected appellant's claims that Senate Bill 2 unconstitutionally impaired his right to file a petition for post-conviction relief under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2953.21. Appellant lacked standing to challenge the constitutionality of Senate Bill 2 where he did not allege in his petition that he was adversely affected by the amendments to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 2953.21, 5120.60, or 181.25(A) that resulted from the enactment of Senate Bill 2. The fact that Senate Bill 2 reduced the penalty for the offense of which appellant was convicted did not render the harsher sentence appellant received under an earlier version of the sentencing statute cruel and unusual.</SPAN></P>

The court held summary judgment was improperly entered in favor of appellee where the insured's rights under the uninsured motorist provisions of the insurance policy did not accrue until after Ohio Rev.

The court found that the earliest date upon which appellee could have been said to have a vested right under the insurance contract was the date that the underlying accident occurred. The court concluded that the amendment did not unconstitutionally interfere with the insurance contract in question where coverage in accordance with the amendment was not a common-law right and did not come within the protection of Ohio Const. art.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Under the divorce decree, the mother was awarded custody of the two children and the father was ordered to pay child support. Several years later, the county child support enforcement agency recommended the termination of child support for the emancipated son. During termination proceedings, the father sought a retroactive change of custody and child support obligation, asserting that the son had lived with him for one year. The common pleas court granted the State's motion for summary judgment on the matter, found that the father was in arrears in payments for that son, and ordered the father to continue paying support for the other son. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment, finding that the common pleas court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the request to modify parental rights and responsibilities of an emancipated child. The father improperly attempted to eradicate the arrearages that accrued during the year instead of obtaining a modification of the custody and support decrees when the son moved in with him. The father's other objections were rejected; the agency correctly was ordered to recalculated child support pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3113.215.</SPAN></P>

In a previous action, the trial court held that since a federal court declined to rule on the applicant's state claims, his declaratory judgment action was not barred by res judicata.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The applicant was denied renewal of his commercial driver's license after he failed to supply the BMV with his social security number.

The court found that the trial court properly determined that the applicant's federal claims where barred by the doctrine of res judicata. The court held that the applicant's complaint involved the same facts, the same subject matter, the same parties, and the same relief sought as that litigated in the federal case. The court found that the applicant did not appeal the decision of the federal court. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment because it could not find that the social security requirement for a commercial driver's license in any way impinged upon the applicant's religious freedoms under the Ohio or United States Constitutions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that a new legislative enactment (Act), effective July 1, 1996, revised the criminal sentencing structure for Ohio and that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 1.58(B) required the trial court to reduce his sentence. The court disagreed and affirmed. The court agreed that &sect; 1.58(B) provided that, if a sentence imposed for any offense was reduced by an amendment or reenactment of a statute, the sentence, if not already imposed, was to be imposed according to the revised statute. The court noted, however, that the Act clarified the legislature's intention that the revised sentencing structure be applied only to sentences imposed on persons who committed an offense on or after the effective date of the revised structure. Because defendant's crime was committed before that date, the provisions of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 1.58(B) did not apply and did not dictate the reduction of defendant's sentence. The court found defendant's assertion that the revised sentencing structure was unconstitutional because it resulted in the imprisonment of people for the same offense but subject to different sentences meritless on the basis of a previous Ohio Supreme Court decision.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

He was charged with arson and breaking and entering. He filed a motion to suppress, which was denied and was convicted. He sought review. The court affirmed the breaking and entering conviction. It found that the trial court properly denied defendant's motion to suppress because under the totality of the circumstances, and in the absence of police coercion, defendant's low intelligence did not negate the voluntariness of his statements. The trial court did not err when it admitted a neighbor's testimony that she overheard defendant admit that he had set the fires because the statement was an adoptive admission under Ohio R. Evid. 801(D)(2)(b). The court vacated the arson conviction because the trial court erred when it admitted billing invoices because the state failed to lay a foundation for the business record hearsay exception in Ohio R. Evid. 803. Because the records were inadmissible, the state failed to prove that the amount of damages met the statutory requirement of Ohio Rev.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">While investigating the shooting of a horse, the humane society officer discovered an emaciated, dehydrated, and starving pony in defendant's barn. Defendant argued that the actions of the officer in stepping up to the barn opening and looking inside violated her Fourth Amendment rights, but the trial court overruled her motion to suppress the evidence of the pony's condition. On appeal, the court held that because defendant did not shield the stall from visual inspection, she did not have a reasonable expectation of privacy. Although the barn was part of defendant's curtilage and was usually entitled to an expectation of privacy, defendant made no effort to keep the pony in a stall located in a less observable area of the barn, and thus the pony was in open view. Merely looking at the pony from the driveway did not amount to a &quot;search.&quot; The trial court did not err in overruling defendant's motion to suppress. The trial court placed defendant on a diet, which prohibited extras like dessert and was approved by a licensed physician. The sentence did not violate U.S. Const. amend.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner pled guilty to resisting arrest on unrelated charges that were dropped but then had his parole revoked by the Ohio Adult Parole Authority (APA). He claimed his detention was illegal and unconstitutional on a number of grounds, but the court limited its inquiry as to whether petitioner met the requirements of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2725.01. By that statute petitioner had to show that the authority that incarcerated him had no jurisdiction to do so or that the circumstances of his imprisonment were extraordinary, resulted in a manifest injustice, and that he had no other legal remedy available. The court held that the APA had complete jurisdiction over all parole matters, including parole revocation hearings, determining parole violations, and revocations of parolees' freedom. Second, petitioner's law violation clearly violated the terms of his parole and was a legitimate reason for its revocation. Third, the circumstances did not reflect any extreme injustice, and petitioner's non-jurisdictional issues were more suited to examination on either direct appeal or in a petition for post-conviction relief pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2953.21.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following plea negotiations, defendant pleaded guilty to one count of gross sexual imposition and another count was dismissed. The plea was entered on the record, after which a sentencing hearing was held. Based upon the pre-sentencing report, a common pleas court (Ohio) found defendant was a sexual predator pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2950.01. It was from that judgment that defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant alleged that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2950.09(B)(1), a portion of Ohio's sexual predator statute, was unconstitutionally retroactive. The indictment against defendant was based on incidents that occurred in June 1996. The sexual predator statute became effective on January 1, 1997. Section 2950.09 provided in part that regardless of when the sexually oriented offense was committed, if a person was to be sentenced on or after the effective date of the statute for a sexually oriented offense, the sentencing court was required to conduct a hearing to determine whether the offender was a sexual predator. The trial court held such a hearing and found defendant was a sexual predator. In reversing, the court noted that under Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 28, the general assembly could not pass retroactive laws. The court found that to the extent that the sexual predator statute imposed additional duties and attached new disabilities to past transactions, it was retroactive and violated the Ohio Constitution. Thus, as applied to defendant, &sect; 2950.09 was a retroactive application of a legislative enactment and defendant could not be required to register as a sexual predator.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the Marion County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio) convicting and sentencing him, upon a jury trial, of burglary, in violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2911.12(A)(2), a felony in the second degree.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's conviction resulted from activities that occurred over a two-day period. On the first evening, defendant and two other persons allegedly discussed plans to burglarize a home. One of these persons was his roommate and the other was a friend who stayed with defendant. Later that night, an attempted burglary occurred at a residence. Upon discovering that the house was occupied, the intruders fled. In the early morning hours the following day, another home was burglarized. The property stolen included a television, compact disc player, videocassette recorder, stereo equipment, video games, firearm paraphernalia, and other items. Acting on a tip that the stolen property was within defendant's apartment, the police obtained a search warrant. While there, the police found many of the items reported stolen. Although the trial court erred in overruling defendant's request to inspect the sworn statements of a witness to a grand jury for inconsistencies with her trial testimony, the error was harmless when viewing the totality of the evidence. A rational trier of fact could have found that the essential elements of the offense of burglary were proven beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">ODOT rejected the seller's bids on road salt contracts for the disputed counties because the salt was mined in Canada rather than in the United States. ODOT also withdrew its acceptance of the seller's bid as to one county because Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 125.11(B) required ODOT to select a bidder using salt mined in Ohio where it had received two or more bids proposing the use of the Ohio mined product. The seller was denied injunctive relief. The court held that: (1) ODOT was required to reject the seller's bids for the disputed counties because the Canadian mined salt the seller offered to supply was not a &quot;domestic source end product,&quot; as that term was defined, nor was there any evidence in the record of a determination that rock salt of a satisfactory quality was not mined in the United States; and (2) Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 125.11(B) and Ohio Admin. Code &sect; 123:5-1-06(C)(1) did not impermissibly infringe upon the federal government's exclusive authority over foreign affairs because they did not provide Ohio officials with an opportunity to treat foreign nations differently based upon the ideological bent of a nation's government, or based upon any other factor.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owner's father operated a gas station on the premises for many years. The city council subsequently rezoned that property for multi-family residential use, but permitted continuation of the nonconforming use. The property owner subsequently discontinued use of the property as a gas station and removed the underground gasoline storage tanks on two separate dates. The building commissioner notified the property owner that the existing service station building had to be demolished and that any future uses of the property had to comply with multifamily residential zoning. The court concluded that the six-month period of Ohio Rev. Code &sect; 1165.03(b) conformed to the statewide due process interest in preventing ordinances from retroactively prohibiting nonconforming uses. However, that ordinance did not incorporate the element that the discontinuation was voluntary as mandated by Ohio Rev. Code &sect; 713.15. The court found that the property owner acted voluntarily in removing the gasoline storage tanks. No basis existed upon which to have initiated a new nonconforming use without municipal authorization, controlled by Ohio Rev. Code &sect; 1165.03(a).</SPAN></P>

The landowner also claimed that appellees failed to properly notify the members of the class of landowners in accordance with &sect; 5310.35. The county council had adopted a resolution abolishing the obsolete and costly land registration system within the county. The Ohio Legislature had authorized counties to abolish registration of land within their jurisdictions. The landowner argued the trial court erred in ruling appellees had met the mandatory notice requirements of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 5310.35 and the postal regulations.

The trial court noted that because the spousal award was of short duration, it would not retain jurisdiction over the matter. On appeal, the court reversed the judgment of the trial court and remanded. The court found that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in ordering spousal support. The court found, however, that the trial court intended to bar modifications of its spousal support order, which modifications Ohio Rev. Code &sect; 3105.18(E) permitted. The court therefore modified the order of the trial court to authorize it to modify the amount or terms of its spousal support order. The court decided that the trial court abused its discretion in the life insurance order that it imposed because the ex-husband's life insurance exceeded the value of the spousal support obligation. The court modified the order to provide that the ex-husband only had to maintain a policy of insurance on his life payable to the ex-wife in an amount sufficient to satisfy any unpaid balance of the spousal support, and no more.</SPAN></P>

Defendant sought review of the denial of his motion by the trial court without a hearing. On appeal, the court held that: (1) the trial court did not err in denying defendant's motion because the statute was properly applied prospectively and did not violate defendant's rights to due process and equal protection, nor did such application constitute cruel and unusual punishment; and (2) there was no constitutional provision prohibiting the delaying of the effective date of legislation beyond 90 days, and because the statute at issue did not apply to defendant, he lacked standing to complain that the statute was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of a judgment from the Cleveland Municipal Court (Ohio), in which he was convicted of violating Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4411.22(A), which prohibited impeding or blocking the normal and reasonable movement of traffic. Defendant's motion to dismiss, claiming that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4511.22 was unconstitutionally vague, was overruled prior to defendant's trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant claimed that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4511.22(A) was unconstitutionally vague, that the verdict was against the manifest weight of the evidence, and that the trial court prohibited him from presenting relevant evidence. The court affirmed, holding that &sect; 4511.22 was not unconstitutionally vague as it gave people of ordinary intelligence a reasonable opportunity to know that they should not stop within lanes of travel when the traffic of the area was normally and reasonably moving. The court determined that the plain language of the statute provided adequate guidelines for law enforcement and thus established a clear standard of guilt on which police and the courts could rely. The court found that the evidence established that although traffic was not completely stopped by defendant's conduct, his conduct nonetheless diverted other vehicles and thereby impeded traffic and thus, the verdict was not against the manifest weight of the evidence. The court concluded that the trial court properly prohibited defendant's presentation of irrelevant evidence concerning traffic patterns other than the one prevailing at the time defendant was cited for violating &sect; 4511.22.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's judgment and ordered that the State recover its costs. The court also ordered that a special mandate issue directing the trial court to carry the court's judgment into execution. The court ordered any bail pending appeal terminated and remanded the cause to the trial court for execution of sentence.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 2923.16, and one count of having an open container in a public place in violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4301.62.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An officer stopped defendant after he saw defendant's vehicle weaving within its lane and over the center line. After conducting field sobriety tests, the officer arrested defendant and performed an inventory search of his vehicle prior to its impoundment. A rifle and a loaded handgun were discovered. Defendant filed motions to suppress evidence and to dismiss, which were denied. Defendant was convicted of three driving offenses, two firearm offenses, and having an open container of beer. On appeal, the court remanded with instructions to terminate defendant's administrative license suspension pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4511.191 because the double jeopardy clauses of the U.S. Const. amend. V and Ohio Const. art. I, &sect; 10 precluded its continuation after his conviction for driving under the influence. The court vacated defendant's conviction and sentence on the improper handling of a firearm charge because it was an allied crime to the concealed weapon charge under Ohio Rev.

The court affirmed the remaining convictions and held that the officer was free to do the inventory search anytime after he made the decision to impound defendant's vehicle.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant widow's husband was involved in a fatal car accident while in the course of his employment for appellee employer.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, property owners who lived near an airport, filed a motion to dismiss an appeal brought by defendant port authority for review of an order of the Lucas County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio), which denied the port authority's motion for summary judgment in a nuisance action. The property owners contended that that the denial of summary judgment was not an appealable order pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2505.02.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The port authority contended that it was immune from suit pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. ch. 2744. On appeal, the court held that it had authority to hear the appeal. Ordinarily, the denial of a motion for summary judgment was not a final appealable order; however, Ohio. Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2501.02 allowed appellate review of an order denying a political subdivision the immunity provided in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. ch. 2744. Further, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2744.02(C) provided that any order denying such immunity was a final order. The two statutes were not unconstitutional. They did not conflict with Ohio. R. Civ. P. 54(B) because the judgment at issue did not dispose of a claim; it dealt with the validity of a defense. The statutes did not violate the state constitution's &quot;one subject&quot; rule or its &quot;open courts&quot; clause because they related to the subject of the bill that enacted them and did not deny the property owners access to the courts. They did not violate equal protection because the different treatment allowed served a legitimate governmental purpose, conserving the fiscal resources of political subdivisions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied the property owners' motion to dismiss the port authority's appeal of the trial court's judgment denying the port authority's motion for summary judgment. The court denied the property owners' motions for sanctions and costs. The court sua sponte consolidated the appeal with another appeal and decided procedural matters in the other appeal.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 5553.042.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The residents argued that the trial court erred by finding that the decision of the Board was supported by the requisite degree of evidence when the residents stipulated that the unpaved portion of the road had been abandoned and not used for a period of 21 years. The issue was whether the record was devoid of any support for the Board's determination. The court determined that there was evidence that the township had exercised authority over the unpaved portion of the road by cutting the grass and by asking the county engineer to regrade it. The court explained that there was evidence that the parcel deeded to appellee landowners' children would have become landlocked if the road was vacated. The court noted that there was evidence that the township had maintained the unpaved portion, however minimally, during the 21 year period. The court concluded that even where a road was found to have been abandoned, it was not mandatory that the township lost its rights in and to the road because that could occur only after formal proceedings for vacation were taken. The court determined that evidence of landlocking was relevant to proceedings under &sect; 5553.042.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the trial court's judgment dismissing the petition and concluded that the trial court did not err in granting summary judgment for the warden. The court held that defendant was not entitled to immediate release and the warden was under no clear legal duty to discharge him. The court found that the Ohio Adult Parole Authority had declared in 1983 that defendant was a parole violator at large following his conviction and release for a forgery crime. In 1995, defendant was involved in a weapons offense in Illinois and the Illinois authorities discovered the Ohio warrant. Defendant was subsequently extradited to Ohio and his parole was revoked. The court noted that Ohio Rev.

The judge filed a motion for summary judgment. The court held that relator had an adequate remedy by properly filing a motion for delayed appeal, pursuant to Ohio R. App. P. 5. Furthermore, it was held that such an action would allow the court to review the matter on the entire record. The court found that relator's complaint failed to state a claim in mandamus. It was also noted that relator did not respond to the judge's motion for summary judgment. As a consequence, the court concluded that the matter was an appropriate case for dismissal for lack of prosecution.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The country club submitted an application requesting CAUV status for certain acreage, which was denied by the auditor because the acreage was not devoted exclusively to commercial agricultural use.

The country club subsequently continued to submit annual CAUV renewal actions, and instead of employing the administrative appeal process, the country club filed a complaint in the trial court seeking a declaratory judgment. Summary judgment was entered in favor of the country club. In reversing, the court held that the administrative remedy was not necessarily onerous as the issue involved in the country club's declaratory judgment action was the same issue that would have been decided in an administrative appeal. The court determined that it was clear that the country club's declaratory action was merely a substitute for the administrative appeal process provided by the legislature and because such an administrative process was an equally serviceable remedy, declaratory judgment was not available.</SPAN></P>

The court rejected the argument finding that the photographic evidence of the wife's injuries was relevant, that the trial court considered all the evidence before sentencing defendant within the statutory limits, and that it was not unduly swayed by passion. The court found that the trial court properly followed the sentencing procedures, pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2929.12, in finding that defendant had a history of criminal convictions and alcohol abuse, and that he had been drinking the night he attacked his wife. The court rejected defendant's argument that the sentencing guidelines of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 2929.11, 2929.12, 2929.13, and 2929.14 failed to give judges sufficient guidance in determining whether incarceration was appropriate.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">One plaintiff was killed and the other injured in an accident at a railroad crossing. Their personal injury and wrongful death claims were consolidated for trial. Despite the trial court's granting of a motion in limine, the court held that the railroad opened the door to introduction of evidence of subsequent remedial measures by questioning a witness about a state program to upgrade railroad crossings. The court held that plaintiffs' state tort claims were not preempted by 23 C.F.R. &sect;&sect; 646.214(b)(3) and (4), which regulated traffic safety devices at railroad crossings, even though federal funds had been used to install a safety device at the crossing. The court held that for federal preemption to apply it was necessary to show that the FHWA had specifically approved the upgrade. The court held that the trial court had properly instructed the jury on ordinary care, which was the standard that applied. The court held that there was sufficient evidence for the court to submit the issue of punitive damages to the jury. The court would not reduce the jury's punitive damages award on the wrongful death claim, even though it was based upon property damages of only $ 100.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After insured was injured in a car accident and the insurer denied coverage under an automobile insurance policy, the insured sued the insurer. When the trial court granted summary judgment for the insurer and overruled the insured's motion for relief from judgment, the insured appealed. The court reversed and remanded in part with instructions to stay the proceedings. The trial court did not comply with a 60-day stay requirement under Ohio. R. Civ. P. 3(D). Although the trial court did not err in concluding that the state was not a proper forum under Ohio R. Civ. P. 3(D), the trial court did err in dismissing insured's complaint. A choice-of-law clause was enforceable. The provision allowed the insured, with the consent of the insurer, to refile the suit in Ontario, Can., which had a substantial relationship with the parties and the transaction, and application of the law of Ontario, Can., was not contrary to the policy of Ohio. Having the insured litigate there was not so inconvenient as to deprive her of her day in court.

The court agreed and reversed the trial court's decision, opining that it had misapplied the &quot;practical difficulties&quot; test used to consider the grant or denial of an area variance. The court explained that a property owner encountered &quot;practical difficulties&quot; whenever an area zoning requirement unreasonable deprived him of a permitted use of his property. In making such a determination, the court noted several factors to consider: whether the property would yield a reasonable return or whether there would be any beneficial use of the property without the variance, whether the property owner's predicament feasible could be obviated through some method other than a variance, and whether the various would adversely affect the delivery of government services. The court concluded that the property owners provided no information addressing any of the &quot;practical difficulties&quot; factors and, as such that the property owners failed to meet their burden of demonstrating practical difficulties sufficient to require the Board to approve their application for a variance.</SPAN></P>

After a trial to a magistrate, judgment was granted to the administrator. The trial court overruled the employer's objections and adopted the magistrate's findings. On appeal, the court held that the subrogation rights under former Ohio Rev. Code &sect; 4123.93 did not include a right of subrogation for payments made under wrongful death claims. Subrogation allowed the employer to step in the shoes of the employee. Because a wrongful death claim belonged to the wrongful death beneficiaries, and not the employee, the employer could not be a subrogee on that claim.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was found guilty of involuntary manslaughter in violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2903.04(B). However, the trial court subsequently granted defendant's motion to dismiss the indictment against him on the ground that &sect; 2903.04(B) was unconstitutional to the extent that it allowed a conviction to be based upon a lesser culpable state than recklessness. Upon review, the court affirmed. The court found there was no due process basis for granting defendant's motion to dismiss where the criminal intent element could be dispensed with if the criminal statute at issue was designed for the protection of public health and safety and it had no common-law background that included a particular criminal intent. The court determined that there was no equal protection basis for granting the motion to dismiss because there was no suspect class nor were defendant's fundamental rights impinged. The court held that a felony conviction for causing the death of another as a proximate result of committing a strict liability misdemeanor was unconstitutionally excessive punishment where the conviction was grossly disproportionate to the offense and shocked the sense of justice of the community.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court held that Am. Sub. S.B. 20 (Ohio), Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3937.18, controlled the language of the policy and that it resurrected the anti-stacking provisions in the policy. Because the insured's UM coverage was for the same amount of money for which he settled with his tortfeasor, there was no excess coverage. On appeal, the court affirmed, finding that &sect; 3937.18(A)(2) provided that the insured's policy limits were to be reduced by the amounts available for payment under all applicable policies covering those who were the liable to the insured. The statute became effective six days before the insured's accident occurred, and the law in place when the insured's right to UM coverage accrued applied. The court found that the trial court was correct in applying &sect; 3937.18(A)(2) to the insured's claim. The court also determined that the insurer did not waive its rights to deny coverage on the basis that the insured settled his claim with the tortfeasor without notifying the insurer, noting that the insured's settlement compromised the insurer's subrogation rights.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a decision of the Clark County Common Pleas Court (Ohio), which convicted defendant on three counts of aggravated drug trafficking, having weapons while under disability, and illegal use of food stamps.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that the trial court erred by rejecting his request to be sentenced under Senate Bill 2 and Senate Bill 269. The court stated that defendant provided no analysis to explain his perceived constitutional violations, and the court found none. The court could not agree that Senate Bill 2's exclusion of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 1.58 violated equal protection or due process principles. Furthermore, when the new legislation took effect, it already included the foregoing language excluding &sect; 1.58's application. Under these circumstances, the court held that defendant's ex post facto claim lacked merit. Further, the court held that the trial court did not err by not suppressing incriminating statements defendant made when police executed the search warrant. Testimony from the pretrial suppression hearing demonstrated that police advised defendant of his Miranda rights upon entering his home. The record contains testimony that defendant heard his Miranda rights, understood those rights, and voluntarily chose to make incriminating statements. Under these circumstances, the court concluded that defendant implicitly waived his Miranda rights.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After defendant was stopped for a traffic violation and released, the police determined that there was an outstanding felony warrant for his arrest.

Defendant argued, inter alia, that the trial court erred when it failed to consider a lesser included offense. Defendant was convicted of receiving stolen property, and the court affirmed. The court rejected defendant's claim that the unauthorized use of a motor vehicle was a lesser included offense of receiving stolen property. It was possible to commit the greater offense of receiving stolen property without simultaneously committing the lesser offense of unauthorized use of a vehicle because the statutory element that defendant &quot;use or operate&quot; the motor vehicle was not an element of the greater offense of receiving stolen property. The trial court did not err in failing to allow defense counsel to present a closing argument because the transcript did not show that defense counsel offered to give a closing summation or objected to the lack of closing arguments.</SPAN></P>

On review, defendant argued that there was no evidence to indicate that he was operating a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol. The court found that when the police officer approached defendant that he was slumped over in his car and that the keys were not in the ignition but that the ignition was in the &quot;on&quot; position. The court found that the State was not required to prove that defendant had started the vehicle's engine. Instead, it was sufficient that defendant had put himself in the position where he could potentially cause the movement of his car while intoxicated. Moreover, the evidence indicated that defendant was holding a beer can when the police officer approached him and that he was visibly intoxicated. Finally, the term &quot;operate&quot; in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4511.19 was not unconstitutionally vague because defendant was on notice that his behavior was prohibited. Therefore, the trial court's decision was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to an agreement with the board, TARTA provided transportation to and from school for designated students. The parents filed their action against TARTA and the board after students were injured after getting off of TARTA buses after school, because the buses were not equipped with the types of safety features and equipment required for school buses. On appeal from the grant of summary judgment to TARTA and the board, the court held that: (1) the TARTA buses transporting the students were not school buses and therefore were not subject to the safety requirements covering school buses; (2) the board's use of TARTA buses to transport students did not violate those students' and their parents' rights to equal protection because the board's use of the TARTA buses to insure that the maximum number of students were transported to school was rationally related to their objective to promote a thorough and efficient system of common schools; and (3) the board and TARTA were entitled to summary judgment on the negligence claims because the parents had not set forth any alleged duties owned by TARTA or the board and, therefore, had not asserted any common law negligence claims.</SPAN></P>

The court of common pleas affirmed the zoning board's decision, and the landowner appealed. The court dismissed the landowner's appeal. In so doing, the court found that pursuant to &sect; 2506 the landowner had three options with which to challenge the city: (1) file a &sect; 2506 alleging that the denial of the variance was not supported by evidence; (2) challenge the constitutionality of the ordinance as applied to his property; or (3) file a declaratory judgment action challenging the statute on its face.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant agreed to plead guilty to 13 counts of aggravated robbery with firearm specifications. After indicating satisfaction with his trial counsel, defendant was sentenced. On direct appeal, defendant unsuccessfully raised the issue of the operability of the firearm and the consecutive terms of incarceration on the firearm specifications. In 1996 and without information outside the record, defendant sought post-conviction relief for ineffective trial counsel and claimed that his sentence was illegal due to the enactment of Am. Sub. S.B. 2 (Ohio 1996), which adopted a sentencing framework disfavoring individuals who were charged or convicted of felony offenses prior to July 1, 1996. On appeal, the court affirmed the denial of the petition for post-conviction relief without an evidentiary hearing by finding that defendant failed to allege or raise a constitutional issue or equal protection deprivation resulting from the enactment of S.B. 2 because the Ex Post Fact Clauses of the federal and state constitutions as well as Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 1.58(A) prohibited defendant from receiving any additional punishment. Defendant's remaining claims were res judicata.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant alleged error in his sentence for theft as a fourth-degree felony where the jury inadvertently wrote the value of the items on the wrong verdict form and in his aggravated burglary conviction where the prosecution failed to establish presence or likelihood of presence, an essential element of the offense. The court modified the aggravated burglary conviction, but otherwise affirmed. The value of the property was clear from the evidence at trial, and defendant was not prejudiced by the verdict form error. But the prosecution failed to establish that anyone was present or likely to be present at the time of the offense, as required for aggravated burglary under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2911.11(A)(3). As a result, the jury's verdict was unsupported by sufficient evidence to permit reasonable minds to find defendant guilty of aggravated burglary beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer did not live in the city, but he performed work for a contractor, outside the city limits, whose office was located within the city limits. The city ordered the taxpayer to pay city income tax pursuant to City of Cambridge, Ohio, Cambridge City Ordinance &sect; 95.04(C), which the taxpayer paid. He then requested a refund, which was denied by the city treasurer. That decision was affirmed on appeal to the city's income tax board. The taxpayer's challenge to that decision in the lower court was rejected, prompting this appeal. The taxpayer argued the city's tax, as applied to him, was unconstitutional. The city argued that because the taxpayer's employer was a city-based employer, the fact that the taxpayer worked outside the city did not entitle him to a refund. The court disagreed. The court found, under the &quot;fiscal relation&quot; test of whether a municipal tax violated due process, the city had to provide the taxpayer with some benefit or protection in order to justify its tax. Because all the benefits the city offered were indirectly through the taxpayer's employer and the taxpayer received no city benefits, the tax was unconstitutional as applied to him.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the District had the authority to issue the bonds. The agreements entered into between the District and the ODOT and other parties did not create a debt within the meaning of Ohio Const. Art. VII because the agreements made it clear that the bonds would be issued solely by the District and would be the debt of the District. ODOT's obligation to make lease payments was not a debt subject to the debt limitation of Ohio Const. Art.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of engaging in a pattern of corrupt activity and three counts of felony theft. Defendant was sentenced to consecutive 18-month prison terms on each theft conviction, and to a seven to 25-year prison term for the corrupt activity conviction. The trial court's order denying defendant's motion for postconviction relief was upheld on appeal. The provisions of Am. Sub. S.B. 2 were unambiguous and did not apply to crimes committed before July 1, 1996; not only did defendant's crime occur before the effective date of the legislation, but defendant was convicted and sentenced for that crime before that date. Defendant's sentence was valid and lawful when imposed, and did not constitute cruel and unusual punishment merely because it was more severe than the sentence that would have been imposed under Am. Sub. S.B. 2. The failure to apply Am. Sub. S.B. 2 retroactively to defendant was not equivalent to a bill of attainder because there was no legislative determination of guilt.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant property owners challenged a decision of the Lucas County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio), which found in favor of appellee township in an annexation appeal.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owners filed a unanimous petition to annex their 65 acres of land to the village, thus leaving the township. The county board of commissioners held a public hearing and denied the petition, finding that a highway and a railway together might prevent the timely provision of safety services to the 65 acres. The lower court affirmed. The court on appeal affirmed again. The court found that the county board of commissioners properly considered the wishes of the property owners. However, their wishes were not the only factor to be considered in deciding &quot;the general good of the territory&quot; under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 709.033(E). Both the property owners' wishes and the provision of services had to be weighed. The lower court also did not err in finding, unlike the county board did, that the annexed territory was unreasonably large. Size measured in acreage alone was not dispositive; other factors such as provision of services and impact on the township's tax base could be properly considered.</SPAN></P>

The evidence supporting the officer's discharge included the following incidents: the officer left his service revolver in an unlocked locker on several occasions, was late for roll call, failed to notify that a prisoner was injured, and was involved in a serious car accident with a civilian for failing to slow as he approached an intersection. The court found that based upon the evidence, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in determining there was substantial, reliable, and probative evidence supporting the commission's decision that the termination was proper due to his violations of Akron Civil Service Rule 10.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. ch. 3767.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The stores sold and rented videos and books featuring sexually explicit materials. The stores contained arcades with private viewing booths in which patrons could preview videos. Undercover agents claimed that patrons masturbated in the booths. The State initiated an action against the stores, alleging that they constituted public nuisances. The trial court granted the State's petition for injunctive relief. In reversing the decision in part and remanding, the court found that the stores were improperly enjoined permanently from conducting their video and book sales. The State did not allege that the stores were nuisances themselves. The abatement of the nuisances could have been accomplished by the less restrictive means of issuing permanent injunctions against conducting the arcade businesses only. In affirming the decision in part, the court found that the trial court properly issued temporary orders closing the stores because the State showed the need for such orders. The trial court was unsure how dependent the sale of materials in the retail room and the operation of the booths were upon one another, so it properly enjoined the stores' businesses temporarily.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the decision granting the State's petition for temporary injunctive relief.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff father and defendant mother had one child when father filed a complaint for divorce. The trial court granted the divorce and awarded him custody of their son. Mother filed a motion for contempt and for modification of parental rights and responsibilities. The trial court granted mother's motion and set father's wages at $ 50,000 for child support determination purposes. Father appealed and the court reversed. The court held that there was no evidence that father's sexual orientation had directly and adversely affected his son in such a manner that a change in his parental rights and responsibilities was necessary and that a parent's sexual preference, standing alone, was not a sufficient basis to modify the allocation of parental rights and responsibilities. The court held that the trial court erred by setting father's wages at $ 50,000 and that before considering the benefits a parent received from remarriage or from sharing living quarters with another person, the trial court first had to make findings that the amount calculated (1) would be unjust or inappropriate and (2) would not be in the best interest of the child.</SPAN></P>

The store appealed to the Board, which denied the appeal. The store appealed the decision to the trial court, which found in favor of the Board. The store appealed the trial court's decision challenging the constitutionality of the ordinance. The court applied the two-pronged analysis and found that the store failed to show that the ordinance was unconstitutional.

The trial court directed a verdict for the builder on his claim and entered judgment for him on the counterclaim. The court held that the trial court erred in granting a directed verdict for the builder at the end of his presentation of the case. The builder made his motion for a directed verdict after resting his case. The motion was untimely and prematurely raised because it was not properly raised in accordance with Ohio R. Civ.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A juror asked a psychologist for a definition of paranoid schizophrenia which defendant claimed to suffer from as a mitigating factor to the death penalty. The court overruled the claim that the juror's misconduct prejudiced defendant because a hearing was held on the issue, the definition the juror received was consistent with the definition given by an expert for defendant, and the juror did not communicate that definition to other jurors. The trial court's instruction that &quot;mercy&quot; was not a mitigating factor was not erroneous because it was a statutorily correct instruction under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2929.04. The jury was not improperly constituted where it did not contain jurors who were excused for cause due to their inability to either sign a death verdict or follow the law. The State did not use two peremptory challenges discriminatorily where the State offered the race-neutral explanations that one was challenged for being against the death penalty, and the other was a friend of a co-defendant. Defendant was not entitled to 12 peremptory challenges under Ohio Rev. Code ann. &sect; 2945.21(A)(2) because Ohio R. Crim. P. 24(C) permitted only 6 in capital murder cases.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was found guilty of aggravated burglary. After sentencing, he filed a petition to vacate and set aside sentence, which was denied. He appealed, arguing that Am. Sub. S.B. 2, Gen. Assem. (Ohio) was either retroactive or was violative of his right to equal protection and due process under the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. The court noted that the supreme court had held that the general assembly's refusal to retroactively apply the differing provisions of Am. Sub. S.B. 2 to persons convicted and sentenced before July 1, 1996 did not violate those persons' rights to equal protection and due process. Defendant also argued that the amendments to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2953.21, found in Am. Sub. S.B. 4, Gen. Assem. (Ohio), constituted ex post facto legislation. The court disagreed, finding that the amendments did not punish as a crime an act previously committed, which was innocent when done; nor made more burdensome the punishment for a crime, after its commission; nor deprived one charged with crime of any defense available according to law at the time when the act was committed, so there was no ex post facto violation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The applicant bought a parcel of land. She applied for a conditional use permit that allowed the placement of a mobile home on the land as she had planned. A zoning inspector denied the applicant's request, and she appealed to the board. The board affirmed the inspector's decision and denied the permit because the mobile home was not harmonious with the intended character of the area. The board noted that approximately 15 area residents had opposed the permit. The trial court affirmed. The court reversed the judgment of the trial court. The court found that neither the board nor the trial court exceeded its authority by deciding that the placement of the mobile home required a conditional use permit. However, the board's decision was not supported by a preponderance of substantial, reliable, and probative evidence. The only evidence was a copy of the zoning resolutions, pictures of the mobile home, and the site plan that showed how the applicant would comply with the requirements for a permit. The court transcript contained the personal opinions of area residents. The test for compliance with the harmonious character of the conditional use was established by objective conditions.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff sustained an injury while operating a screen printing machine during the course of her employment. Plaintiff filed a complaint against defendant, alleging that the machine was damaged and defective, and that defendants were aware of its condition and deliberately failed to repair it. The trial court granted defendants' motion to dismiss the case for reason that plaintiff failed to file her complaint within the one-year statute of limitations provided in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2305.112. On appeal, the court stated that it was true that at the time plaintiff was injured, the relevant statutory remedy provided a one-year statute of limitations. However, because this statute was effectively found unconstitutional during the pendency of the case, the court held that the original Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2745.01 should be treated as though it were never enacted. The court held that the case should fall subject to the two-year limit set forth in the earlier &sect; 2305.10.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court convicted defendant of disturbing the peace because of his barking dog. Defendant argued that the disturbing the peace statute was unconstitutional for vagueness. The parties prepared an agreed statement of the trial court proceedings and another judge, not the trial judge, signed it. The court held that only the judge who sat in the proceedings was able to evaluate the accuracy and truthfulness of a proposed statement. The court reasoned that it was essential that the trial judge, and not some other judge, sign the statement. Where the parties' agreed statement of facts did not achieve the formality, validity, or authenticity of a statement of evidence conforming to Ohio R. App. P. 9, an appellate court could not consider its contents. The court noted that without a valid statement of the evidence, defendant could not show that he raised the vagueness issue before the trial court. The court concluded that defendant waived any challenge to the constitutionality of the statute or its application because he failed to raise the issue at trial when the issue was apparent at the time of trial.</SPAN></P>

The trial court denied the motion, without holding an evidentiary hearing. Defendant appealed. On appeal, the court affirmed, and held that defendant was not entitled to be resentenced, under Am.

The magistrate originally recommended that the realtor's claim be dismissed because it was not a licensed real estate broker under Ohio Rev. Code &sect; 4735.21.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parties entered into an exclusive listing contract for the sale of the owner's property. The condition was added to the contract that the owner reserved the right to sell the property to the current tenant on the premises or its affiliate for a certain period without a fee being owed to the realtor. Thereafter, the owner sold the property to a customer of the tenant. The owner refused to pay a commission to the realtor. The realtor then brought a breach of contract action seeking its commission under the listing contract. The trial court adopted the magistrate's decision, and entered a judgment for the realtor. The court reversed the trial court's judgment, and held that &sect; 4735.21 did not directly conflict with Ohio R. Civ. 9(A) because Ohio Rev. Code &sect; 4735.21 did not address the capacity to bring an action in Ohio. Section 4735.21 did not establish a procedural rule requiring a party seeking to collect a real estate commission to aver capacity. However, to collect the commission under &sect; 4735.21, the realtor was required to prove, as an element of the claim, that it was licensed as a real estate broker.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested after police observed his vehicle weaving over four lanes of the five-lane highway, often being in the southbound lanes while traveling northbound. Defendant was unable to perform any field sobriety tests and was subsequently arrested. During an inventory search of the vehicle an unloaded, but operable rifle, was found. The court concluded that evidence of defendant's prior traffic citations for alcohol-related offenses was admissible to assist in establishing the element of chronic alcoholism, however, the court held that it was not persuaded that this evidence, alone, proved that defendant was a chronic alcoholic sufficient to sustain a conviction under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2923.13(A)(4). The court held that while evidence of prior alcohol-related offenses was admissible for the limited purpose of assisting in establishing proof of chronic alcoholism, such evidence in and of itself was legally insufficient to sustain a conviction under &sect; 2923.13(A)(4). Therefore, the court vacated defendant's conviction for having a weapon while under the disability of chronic alcoholism.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, defendant's sentence was vacated and remanded for a resentencing. Prior to resentencing, Ohio's death penalty statute was deemed unconstitutional, and the sentence was commuted to life in prison. Defendant sought post-conviction relief pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2953.21, then amended his petition to include an affidavit of verity. The trial court determined that defendant's claims were barred by res judicata and that defendant failed to set forth sufficient documentary evidence to support his claims. The trial court denied defendant an evidentiary hearing. Defendant sought review and included an argument that res judicata was inapplicable because his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel could not have been raised on appeal because his trial and appellate counsel were the same. The court found that defendant failed to address the trial court's second ground for denial of post-conviction relief, that there was insufficient documentary evidence to support defendant's motion, and that a hearing was not mandated under &sect; 2953.21.

The court ruled that the prosecution still bore the burden of proving each element of the offense of murder, and defendant bore the burden of proving by preponderance of the evidence either &quot;sudden passion&quot; or &quot;sudden fit of rage&quot; in order to be convicted of voluntary manslaughter rather than murder.

The court stated that defendant's privately retained counsel had worked part-time at the county public defender's office, which represented his co-defendant. The court stated that defendant was given a separate trial, and other facts indicated that no actual conflict existed. The court also held that defendant's request to remove counsel was not filed in a timely manner and other grounds for dismissal lacked merit. The court also ruled that a photograph identification procedure was not unduly suggestive, the identification testimony was properly admitted, principal witness testimony was not unreliable, and the conviction was not against the manifest weight of the evidence.

The couple appealed, claiming that the second complaint was timely filed under &sect; 2305.131, a statute of repose, and that it was not barred by &sect; 2305.10, which contained a two year limitations period. The court affirmed the summary judgment for appellees, ruling that if both a statute of repose and a statute of limitations were applicable to a cause of action, the action had to be filed within both the repose period and the limitations period. The court found a precedent ruled that &sect; 2305.131 violated the right to a remedy guaranteed by Ohio Const. art. I, &sect; 16 and was thus unconstitutional. In addition, a voluntary dismissal was a failure otherwise than upon the merits within the meaning of the savings statute,&nbsp;&sect; 2305.19. The statute, however, did not apply when the action was dismissed before the statute of limitations period had run.

After the trial court convicted defendant and imposed a sentence of five to 25 years, defendant sought review, claiming that the confession should have been suppressed, that the trial court had erred in denying an Ohio R. Crim. P. 29(A) motion to acquit, and that the sentence had violated U.S. Const. amend. VIII. The court held that defendant had waived the right to obtain review of the suppression issue because the grounds for suppression on appeal were different from the grounds in the trial court. The court also held that the trial court had properly overruled the motion for acquittal because the State had presented substantial, credible evidence which would allow the jury to conclude that defendant had committed the crime.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of aggravated murder and kidnapping and a three-judge panel imposed the death penalty. Defendant filed a motion for post-conviction relief. The trial court denied the motion and granted the state's motion for summary judgment. Defendant appealed. On appeal, defendant argued that the trial court erred in denying some of his forty-two claims on the basis of res judicata. However, the court held that because defendant was represented by the same attorney at trial and on direct appeal, the trial court erred in finding the doctrine of res judicata applicable the four claims of ineffective assistance of counsel. However, the court held that applying the standard for evaluating claims of ineffective assistance, defendant's claims were meritless. Defendant further argued that the trial court erred in denying his petition for post-conviction relief because each of the forty-two claims set forth a constitutional claim upon which relief could have been granted. However, the court held that the trial court properly dismissed the petition without a hearing because the record indicated that he was not entitled to relief.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The father was determined to be the parent of the mother's child pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3111.13. The juvenile court issued a support order but no order of custody or visitation. The mother accused the father of sexually abusing the child when he was about four years old. The father filed motions for contempt for the mother's denial of visitation and the mother filed a motion to suspend the father's visitation. Medical and psychological evidence could not establish that the father abused the child, but the child believed, possibly because of the mother's coaching, that the abuse had occurred. The court held that admission of medical and psychological records without the testimony of the persons who prepared the records was error, but harmless because there was enough other evidence presented, including an in camera examination of the child, on which to base the order suspending visitation. The total amount withheld from the father's wages pursuant to the combined child support order and a municipal court garnishment order exceeded the limit allowed by the CCPA. However, there was no private cause of action to enforce the CCPA.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted by a jury of felony assault under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2903.11 after he shot his ex-wife during a domestic altercation. Defendant alleged that the trial court made numerous errors that were prejudicial to his trial. The court affirmed. Defendant first asserted that he was subjected to double jeopardy because his probation was revoked for a prior infraction, and he was charged with the present crime. The court found defendant's argument to be without merit. Defendant then asserted that the warrantless search of his home was unconstitutional and the evidence obtained there should have been excluded from his trial. The court agreed that the search of his home without a warrant was unconstitutional, but found that the error was harmless pursuant to Ohio R. Crim. P. 52(A) where there was overwhelming evidence of defendant's guilt. Defendant also alleged that he was not properly advised as to his Miranda rights and failed to understand their importance.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant salvage operators appealed from a Wayne County Common Pleas Court (Ohio) judgment enjoining them from operating a junk yard or scrap metal salvage operation on a particular piece of their property as requested by plaintiff township. They argued their legal nonconforming use could not be arbitrarily regulated by subsequent unconstitutional statute, the action constituted a &quot;taking,&quot; and the injunction violated Ohio R. Civ. P. 65.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1990, the operators bought property and began their operation. The business operated for several years before the township passed a new zoning resolution which designated the property as agricultural and prohibited operation of junk yards or scrap metal salvage operations anywhere inside the township. The resolution also provided that current nonconforming uses could continue as an exception. To qualify for the exception, an application for a zoning certificate had to be filed within a year. The operators refused to apply, despite multiple public notices and personal visits from the zoning inspector. The township, through the inspector, then sought and won a permanent injunction. The lower court determined that the operators had failed to comply with licensing requirements so their business was never lawfully operated and could not be excepted as a prior nonconforming use. The court affirmed. The operators failed to demonstrate the resolution was unconstitutional. The injunction was proper.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of permanent injunction was affirmed. The operation could not be given a nonconforming use exemption because the operators never obtained the proper license and were therefore operating unlawfully at all times. They failed to demonstrate any prejudice or aesthetic purpose behind the ordinance and proffered insufficient evidence to overcome the presumption that the resolution was necessary for health, safety, and welfare reasons.</SPAN></P>

In support of defendant's contention that the arresting officer had lacked probable cause to stop defendant's car, defendant pointed to the officer's erroneous citation to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4511.36(A), which outlawed improper right-hand turns.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After observing defendant turn into the wrong lane, the officer pulled defendant over and smelled alcohol. Thereafter, defendant was charged with and convicted of driving while intoxicated, improper left turn, and failure to wear a seatbelt. In seeking review, defendant claimed that the evidence should have been suppressed because the officer had lacked probable cause to make the stop. In support of this claim, defendant pointed to the officer's erroneous citation to &sect; 4511.36(A), an improper right-hand turn, which was corrected by the officer at the trial to &sect; 4511.36(B), an improper left-hand turn, as proof that the officer had no cause to believe that defendant had violated the law. Upon review, the court noted that the officer had been very clear that defendant had made a left turn into the wrong lane of traffic, a direct violation of &sect; 4511.36(B). The court was unimpressed with the argument that the mix-up between &sect; 4511.36(A) and &sect; 4511.36(B) tended to show that defendant had done nothing wrong. The court held that the confusion was clerical in nature only and that the officer had seen an improper left turn into the wrong lane.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of solicitation for sexual activity. On appeal, the court held that the trial court had not abused its discretion in denying defendant's pre-trial motions to take the arresting officer's deposition or submit interrogatories. Under Ohio R. Evid. 801(D)(2), defendant's statements were not hearsay. Thus, her motion to suppress was properly overruled. The trial court was justified in excluding testimony regarding any complaints against the arresting officer as it was irrelevant. However, the court reversed and remanded for a new trial because the admission of defendant's prior prostitution convictions violated the rules of fundamental fairness. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2907.26(C) governed the rules of evidence in prostitution cases. The court held that the statute, to the extent it allowed evidence which went beyond the charged offense and allowed character evidence to prove propensity and guilt, was unconstitutional. The court excluded the prior convictions for purposes stated in &sect; 2907.26(C). However, the court recognized that the prior convictions could be admissible for other limited purposes, such as those enumerated in Ohio R. Evid. 404(B).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of menacing by stalking in violation of &sect; 2903.211. Defendant claimed the trial court erred by denying his motion to dismiss on the ground that &sect; 2903.211 was unconstitutionally vague and that his conviction was against the manifest weight of the evidence. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment and held that the language of &sect; 2903.211 would put a reasonable person of ordinary intelligence, law enforcement officials, and triers of fact on notice as to what conduct was prohibited. The court ruled that &sect; 2903.211 was not unconstitutionally vague because it contained sufficient guidelines so as to prevent arbitrary or discriminatory enforcement. The court held that the trial court did not err in overruling defendant's Ohio R. Crim. P. 29 motion for judgment of acquittal at the close of the prosecution's case because the evidence presented at trial was such that reasonable minds could reach different conclusions as to whether defendant was guilty of menacing by stalking.

Code &sect; 2744.03(A)(5) the city had immunity from liability for judgmental or discretionary acts unless the judgment or discretion was exercised with malicious purpose or in bad faith. The evidence at trial demonstrated that the pool was staffed adequately by certified lifeguards on the day of the accident, and there was no evidence that the city acted in a wanton or reckless manner in its discretionary decision making in the pool's operation. The provisions contained in &sect; 2744.02(B)(3) regarding the maintenance of a nuisance on public grounds were general and were inapplicable in light of the special provisions of &sect; 2744.03(A)(5).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On November 22, 1995, a police officer stopped defendant's car. He placed her under arrest and cited her for driving while under the influence of alcohol, while the percentage of alcohol in her breath was greater than .10, in a weaving course, and possession of an open container of alcohol in a vehicle. After transporting defendant to the department, the officer seized her driver's license and placed her under an administrative license suspension. On November 28, 1995, defendant entered a plea of not guilty to all four offenses. Of the six days that passed between this date and the date of arrest, one of the days was a legal holiday and two of them were weekend days. On January 9, 1996, defendant agreed to enter a plea of no contest to the charge of driving while under the influence of alcohol in return for the dismissal of the other charges. She was then found guilty of the charge. The court affirmed the judgment, by holding that her conviction was proper because three of the six days that passed between the date of the arrest and the date of the initial appearance would not be counted toward the five-day total, as Ohio R. Crim. P. 45(A), superceded Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 1.14.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of improper confinement of a dog and cruelty to animals. She sought review of the decision of the Girard Municipal Court (Ohio) that conditioned her probation on the following factors: that she could not own, harbor, or keep any animal except two domestic cats and that she had to pay the sum of $ 6,500 to the Animal Humane Society to cover the disposition of the numerous animals which had been taken from her property.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that it was error to require her to forfeit possession of all of the various animals on her property as a condition of her probation because that condition applied to animals which were not the subject of the offenses of which she was found guilty. She also challenged the legality of the condition in which she was required to pay the costs of disposing of the animals taken from her property arguing that, in essence, that condition constituted a fine which was greater than the maximum amount allowed for a misdemeanor. The court affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded the cause. The court found no error in conditioning defendant's probation on her forfeiting possession of all of the animals on her property, noting that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2929.51(D)(2) stated that a jail sentence for a misdemeanor could be suspended under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2951.02 on any terms that the trial court deemed appropriate. The court concurred, however, that defendant could not be required to pay more than the maximum fine that could be imposed for the misdemeanor of which she was convicted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's convictions, affirmed her sentence except for the probation condition concerning the payment of $ 6,500 to the Animal Humane Society, reversed that portion of the sentence, and remanded her case for resentencing on that particular point.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant had been stopped for failure to drive within marked lanes, and was subsequently arrested for operating under the influence. Although the arresting officer signed a sworn statement that defendant refused to take the Breathalyzer test, the record showed that defendant did try to take it, but blew too hard. Defendant's license was placed under administrative license suspension (ALS) pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4511.191. Defendant contested the suspension and the trial court terminated the suspension because there was not reasonable grounds to stop defendant and found that he had not refused to take the Breathalyzer test. Defendant's motion to dismiss the pending charges based on double jeopardy grounds and his motion in limine to prevent relitigation of the issues raised concerning the administrative suspension were denied. The court affirmed, finding that there was no double jeopardy violation because the ALS suspension did not continue past the time of his conviction and sentencing for operating under the influence. The court found that issue preclusion did not preclude the relitigation in a criminal proceeding of an issue previously determined at an ALS hearing.</SPAN></P>

The Franklin County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio) consolidated the actions and granted summary judgment to defendants, the state and the Ohio Superintendent of Public Instruction. The taxpayers appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayers sought to prevent implementation of the scholarship program on the grounds that it violated the Establishment Clause of the U.S. Constitution as well as several provisions of the Ohio Constitution. The court rejected the taxpayers' arguments that the scholarship program violated the Thorough and Efficient Clause of Ohio Const. art. VI, &sect; 2 and that the program was invalid in that it was enacted as part of a bill that contained more than one subject, in violation of the one-subject rule of Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 15(D). However, the court determined that the scholarship program was unconstitutional because it violated the Establishment Clause of U.S. Const. amend. I, as well as Ohio Const. art. I, &sect; 7 and the school funds clause of Ohio Const. art. VI, &sect; 2. The court held that the scholarship programs had the primary effect of advancing religion because it provided direct and substantial, non-neutral government aid to sectarian schools. The court further found that the program violated the Uniformity Claus of Ohio Const. art, II, &sect; 26 because the practical effect of the date restriction was the same as if the legislature had expressly limited the territorial operation.</SPAN></P>

Senate Bill 2 had revised the criminal sentencing structure for Ohio. The Senate Bill also provided that it applied only to the sentences of persons who committed an offense on or after July 1, 1996. The court affirmed the denial of defendant's motion to vacate his sentence, finding that he was subject to the sentencing procedures that were in existence before Senate Bill 2 became effective.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following the decedent's death through the negligent operation of a truck driven by the tortfeasor, who was insured by the insurer, the fiduciary brought a claim for death benefits. The insurance policy executed between appellees contained liability limits of $ 100,000 per person and $ 300,000 per occurrence for bodily injuries caused by the tortfeasor. The trial court granted summary judgment on the issue of the extent of liability under the policy. The court affirmed the judgment and held that civil damages recoverable for wrongful death were not limited by Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3937.44; rather the code spoke only to the contractual agreement between the tortfeasor and the insurer. Thus, while the insurer's underwriting liability was limited to the per-person coverage of $ 100,000, the fiduciary had the potential to recover a judgment for substantially more than that sum from the tortfeasor. Therefore, &sect; 3937.44 and the constitutional injunction of Ohio Const. art. I., &sect; 19a were compatible and not in conflict. The constitutional provision prohibited only the enactment of laws that placed a specific limitation on the amount of damages recoverable by the survivors.</SPAN></P>

(Ohio 1995) was an unconstitutional retroactive application of law and an ex post facto law, and that they were denied equal protection of the laws by the creation of classifications of individuals sentenced before and after the effective date of the legislation.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged the nuisance abatement order of the Fayette County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio) which closed her videotape rental store for one year and ordered that certain property be sold at auction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant operated a videotape rental store. The store carried general release videotapes in a main room and adult videotapes in a smaller, separate room with access restricted to those over 21 years old. After finding that two adult videotapes were obscene, the trial court ordered that the store be closed for one year and that certain property be sold at auction. On appeal, the court held that the trial court erred by dismissing appellant's counterclaim filed under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 based on a letter the prosecutor sent her that a grand jury had found the videotapes obscene as an attempted prior restraint on constitutionally protected expression because appellant set forth a viable claim. The trial court did not err by finding that the videotapes were obscene because both depicted sexual conduct specifically defined in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2907.01(A). The trial court abused its discretion by ordering that the store be closed for one year because it was an overly broad abatement order, as it made no attempt to limit its order the nuisance and, therefore, posed a significant risk to protected speech.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was reversed insofar as it dismissed appellant's civil rights counterclaim for failure to state a claim and insofar as it ordered appellant's store to be closed for one year. The case was remanded for the issuance of a new abatement order that was narrowly tailored to the nuisance. The judgment was otherwise affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were convicted of grand theft and of engaging in a pattern of corrupt activity. Defendants sought post-conviction relief, and the trial court dismissed their petition. Defendants appealed. They claimed that the indictment charging them with engaging in corrupt activity was defective because it did not set forth the essential elements of the crime. Defendants also contended that the corrupt activity statute,&nbsp;Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2923.32, was unconstitutional. Defendants claimed that their challenges to both the indictment and the statute were not barred by res judicata. The court, in affirming the trial court, concluded that the trial court appropriately utilized the doctrine of res judicata and that it correctly dismissed the petitions for postconviction relief. The indictment failed to allege any mens rea element. There was no indication in the record that defendants or their attorney were misled, confused, surprised or prejudiced by any defect in the indictment. Defendants' challenge to the constitutionality of the statute was not a reviewable issue because the constitutional challenges were capable of being raised in the trial court prior to judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The township resident applied for a variance permit to add a second mobile home on his site. The zoning inspector denied the application. The resident appealed to the zoning board. While hearing the appeal in a properly scheduled public meeting, the zoning board denied the resident's application for a permit after their private meeting. The resident filed his action and the parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment. The trial court concluded that the township regulation about non-conforming uses was not an unconstitutional violation of the resident's rights, but the private deliberation was violative of the Sunshine Law. The zoning board appealed and the resident cross-appealed. The court affirmed. It found that the zoning board could not reasonably believe that its private meeting about the resident's application was not covered under the Sunshine Law. It was a public body and no statutory exception existed to justify an executive session to consider the appeal. But, the resident had no vested right in expanding the size of his mobile home and the township regulation did not violate his constitutional or statutory rights. The trial court did not err in its decision.</SPAN></P>

Subsequently, plaintiffs assigned their claims against appellee to appellant insurance company, the insurer of a one of the manufacturers of the press. Appellant sought to recover from appellee in the form of indemnification, and appellee moved for summary judgment. The county court granted appellee's motion, and appellant sought review. On appeal, the court stated that the rule in Ohio was that a third-party tortfeasor did not have standing to bring an employee's action against an employer. A third-party tortfeasor could not bring an indemnification claim against an employer, who was acting in compliance with the Ohio workers' compensation law, for damages suffered by an employee in the course of or arising out of his employment. The court held that the rule barred all of appellant's claims because appellant had no standing to raise plaintiff's intentional tort claim against appellee.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, defendant challenged the constitutionality of Senate Bill 2 (Ohio 1996), which he alleged created a less harsh sentencing regime and prohibited retroactive application of its terms. The court determined that a rational relationship to a legitimate governmental interest existed and found that the change in sentencing laws that gave rise to defendant's contentions did not affect the sentence for the crime of grand theft alone, there was a complete renovation of the sentencing laws in state criminal law in order to further the policy of protecting the public from crime. The court ruled that defendant was not denied equal protection of the law and failed to point to a constitutional infirmity in the portion of Senate Bill 2 that declined to give retroactive effect to its changes in sentencing.

Under those contracts, West Virginia worker's compensation laws applied to any on the job injuries. The court found that summary judgment and dismissal of the employee's complaint were appropriate. Specifically, the court held that: (1) the collective defendants' affirmative defense regarding payment of worker's compensation benefits put the employee on notice of their immunity defense, (2) the affirmative defense provided the employer with immunity from the employee's lawsuit, (3) the special employer had an implied contract for services with the employee and based on comity principles, its subscription with the Ohio worker's compensation fund provided it immunity from the employee's suit, and (4) under W.

</DIV>

Defendant received a bill of particulars from the City two months prior to trial. Upon his conviction for maintaining a dog kennel for five or more dogs, defendant filed various motions and appeals that delayed his sentencing. Twenty-three months after his conviction, defendant was fined and ordered to pay court costs. On appeal, the court affirmed defendant's conviction for his criminal violation of &sect; 21.1 by finding that the bill of particulars was sufficiently specific to supplant any alleged deficiencies in the City's complaint. By finding that Ohio Mun. &amp; County Ct. Superintendence R. 5(C) was directory and not mandatory, the court affirmed defendant's sentence by finding no violation of Ohio R. Crim.

The trial court did not err in failing to instruct the jury on residual doubt. The trial court's refusal to instruct the jury on parole issues was not error. The State's evidence, if believed, would have allowed a reasonable trier of fact to find defendant guilty of grand theft beyond a reasonable doubt. Any prejudice to the alleged non-statutory aggravating circumstances argued by the State which may have occurred was cured by the trial court's instruction. The State did not exceed the permissible scope of its closing argument during the penalty phase. Defendant was not denied the effective assistance of trial counsel. There was no evidence of any extraordinary circumstances in defendant's past which significantly mitigated his culpability. Thus, defendant's death sentence was appropriate.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, parents and next friends of injured son, sought review of a judgment from the Court of Common Pleas (Ohio) which granted summary judgment in favor of defendants, city and soccer club. Plaintiffs sought to recover for their son's injuries when he jumped on a soccer goal, which fell on the son. The circuit court found that a release and recreational user statute barred plaintiff's action for negligence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, parents and next friends of injured son, filed a complaint against defendants, city and soccer club, alleging negligence, willful or wanton misconduct, and that defendant city allowed a dangerous condition to exist on public grounds. Plaintiffs' son had been injured when he jumped up, and hung on the cross-beam of the soccer goal, which was not anchored and fell on top of him. The trial court granted summary judgment, finding that the claim against defendant city was barred by Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 1533.18 et seq., the recreational user statute and that a release barred claims against both defendants. The court affirmed the trial court's grant of summary judgment because the injuries to plaintiffs' son were within the scope of the release and plaintiffs' negligence claims were, therefore, barred by the release. The court also determined that parents could release a child's future claims and that the release was not contrary to public policy. Because the court found that the release barred plaintiffs' claims or that they failed to prove willful and wanton misconduct, the court found the defendants' defense of the recreational use statute was moot.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's grant of summary judgment in favor of defendants, city and soccer club, because the negligence and wanton and willful misconduct claims of plaintiffs, parents and next friends of injured son, were either barred by the release or lacked proof of such conduct. The court determined that the release did not contravene public policy and that a parent could waive a son's future claims.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant mother sought reversal of the judgment of the Clark County Court of Common Pleas, Juvenile Division (Ohio), which terminated her parental rights with respect to her four children and awarded such rights to appellee human services agency.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother's four children were taken from her and placed in foster care, owing to her severe and chronic chemical dependency. The human services agency alleged that that dependency rendered the mother unable to care for her children. The agency then sought an award of permanent custody due to the fact that the mother's chemical dependency remained as it was, the mother had failed to remedy the problem, and she had demonstrated a lack of commitment to her children while they were in foster care. The juvenile court granted the agency's petition, and the mother appealed. The court reversed and remanded. The court rejected the mother's arguments that the evidence showing that placement was required was insufficient and justification for the juvenile court's order was lacking. However, there was merit in the mother's argument that there was an absence of any finding with respect to whether or not reasonable efforts were made to reunify the mother with her children. As such efforts were statutorily mandated, the absence of any findings on that subject was a significant and prejudicial error. The case was therefore remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the aggravating factor was that defendant was the principal offender or that he committed the aggravated murder with prior calculation and design. The court found that the prosecutor's comment about the victim's good character did not prejudicially affect defendant's substantial rights.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A patient, following back surgery at a hospital, sued the hospital, asserting medical malpractice claims and alleging fraud as a result of the hospital's treatment of injuries he sustained from a fall. The lower court granted summary judgment in favor of the hospital, and the patient appealed. On appeal, the court affirmed in part, and reversed in part. The court found that the patient's medical malpractice claims were not barred by the one-year statute of limitations, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2305.11(B)(1), as the statute included a 180-day notice rule, which could have been used to extend the limitations period to 180 days after written notice was given to the hospital that the patient was considering bringing an action. The court noted that the 180-day rule did not require the use of specific words, and the absence of the phrase &quot;medical claim&quot; did not preclude the letter from being a &sect; 2305.11(B)(1) 180-day notice. The court found that the letter to the hospital was sufficient to put a reasonable person on notice that the patient was considering bringing an action on the claim. The court also found that the patient did not submit sufficient evidence to support the claim of fraud.</SPAN></P>

Thus, the court held that the rape shield law's application did not deny defendant's right to confrontation. Additionally, the court held that the trial court did not err in allowing statements of a key prosecution witness, who was a child, under the spontaneous utterance exception to the hearsay rule, despite the fact that the utterance was made two weeks after the act.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After his motion to dismiss was denied, defendant was convicted in the Wayne County Municipal Court (Ohio) on his plea of no contest to the charge of driving with a prohibited urine alcohol concentration in violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4511.19(B)(3). He appealed, again raising the claim that the statute violated the Equal Protection Clauses of the state and federal constitutions because it treated similarly situated adults differently.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When defendant was arrested on the charge and failed the lab test, he was 18 years old. He based his claim of unconstitutionality on the distinction made by &sect; 4511.19(B)(3) between adults who were 18 to 21 years old and those who were 21 and over. In considering his appeal, the court ruled that &sect; 4511.19(B) did not involve either a suspect class or a fundamental right. Further, its purpose was to limit a young adult's right to drive after having consumed alcohol, which was a legitimate State interest. The court also ruled that adults between the ages of 18 and 21 who were charged with drunk driving and adults who were 21 and over and charged with drunk driving were not similarly situated. The legislature had determined that adults from 18 to 21 years of age had no right to drink and that adults who were 21 and over had that right. Thus, &sect; 4511.19(B) treated all similarly situated drivers who were under age 21 in a similar manner. The court also ruled that the classification based on age was not unreasonable or arbitrary but, rather, was rationally related to a legitimate State interest. The statute, therefore, did not violate defendant's equal protection rights.</SPAN></P>

He was indicted for felonious assault. The case was scheduled for jury trial on January 22, 1996. Prior to trial, defense counsel made a motion to dismiss the indictment, pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2945.71, which provided that a person facing a felony charge had to be brought to trial within 270 days after arrest. Section 2945.71 also provided that for purposes of computing time thereunder, each day during which the accused was held in jail in lieu of bail on the pending charge was to be counted as three days. The trial court denied defendant's motion and the case was tried 115 days after defendant's arrest. Defendant appealed his conviction. The court held that the trial court did not err in denying defendant's motion to dismiss the indictment on speedy trial grounds. A review of the trial court transcript clearly demonstrated the existence of a valid parole holder on defendant, which prevented the application of the triple-count provisions of &sect; 2945.71.

The court held that (1) the evidence was such that the jury could reasonably conclude that the murder was sufficiently associated with defendant's attempted aggravated robbery of the victim as part of one continuous occurrence, so as to support the aggravated murder conviction under Ohio Rev. Code &sect; 2903.01(B), and the capital sentencing specification in &sect; 2929.04(A)(7), (2) the trial court did not abuse its discretion in determining that the children were competent witnesses, (3) defendant was not denied the right to assistance of counsel when the trial court denied his motion to dismiss his court-appointed trial counsel because defendant failed to show a breakdown in the attorney-client relationship of such magnitude as to jeopardize that right, and (4) after doing an independent review of defendant's sentence pursuant to &sect; 2929.05, it concluded that the sentence of death was appropriate, and any trial court error was harmless.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants argued that because a halfway house was an allowable conditional use within an M-Manufacturing district, such a facility that met the conditions of Columbus, Ohio Code &sect; 3389.11 was entitled to a presumption that it served the public good. The court rejected that argument on the grounds that the manufacturing district conditions were independent of those contained in &sect; 3389.11. As a matter of law, the Board's decision was supported by a preponderance of reliable, probative, and substantial evidence that demonstrated that granting the permit posed a substantial detriment to the public good. The evidence presented sufficiently supported a finding of substantial detriment to the public good based on the concentration of correctional facilities in the area and the proximity of the property to schools and a senior citizens center. The Board was told that three correctional facilities were in the area. Children boarded the bus near the proposed facility, and a high school and two middle schools were located within one and one-half miles of the property.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a decision of a trial court (Ohio), which convicted and sentenced him for failure to drive within marked lanes.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant claimed, inter alia, that the trial court erred in denying his motion to dismiss based on Ohio's speedy trial statute and by refusing to permit testimony proffered by defendant to show the bias of the two witnesses for the State. In reversing, the court held that the trial court erred in failing to make appropriate factual findings with respect to defendant's motion to dismiss on speedy trial grounds and that the trial court erred in refusing to allow defendant to attempt to impeach the State's witnesses. The bone of contention between the parties with respect to the speedy trial issue was whether a 27-day period was properly chargeable to defendant. That interval represented the time that elapsed from defendant's request for a pretrial conference to the holding of that conference. Because the motion to dismiss on speedy trial grounds involved a factual question concerning whether the delay was chargeable to defendant, the trial court was required under Ohio R. Crim. P. 12(E) to state its essential findings on the record. Further, the impeachment evidence against the State's witnesses was probative because it went directly to the bias of those witnesses.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of the denial of his motion for a reduction of sentence pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 1.58(B) by the Athens County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio). Defendant alleged that &sect; 1.58 was a savings clause that permitted the retroactive application of Ohio S.B. 2, &sect; 5, as amended by &sect; 3 of Am. Sub. S.B. 269, to reduce the punishment for a convicted person.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was involved in a car crash that killed his common law wife. He was under the influence of alcohol at the time of the accident. Defendant pleaded no contest to the charges of aggravated vehicular homicide, involuntary manslaughter, and aggravated vehicular assault. In 1992 the trial court entered a judgment of conviction on the charges. Six years after the judgment and sentencing, defendant brought a motion for a reduction of sentence pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 1.58. Defendant alleged that &sect; 1.58 was a savings clause that required a court to reduce his sentence according to the sentencing guidelines in &sect; 5 of Ohio S.B. 2, as amended by &sect; 3 of Am. Sub. S.B. 269, for all sentences after July 1, 1996. The court rejected defendant's contention and affirmed the trial court's denial of defendant's motion for a reduction in his sentence. The court found that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 1.58(B) by its own terms did not apply to defendants who had already been sentenced. Moreover, because defendant's sentence was imposed in 1992, long before Ohio S.B. 2 became effective, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 1.58(B) was of no benefit to defendant.</SPAN></P>

Defendant told the police that he was addicted to marijuana and had smoked it daily for the past several years. The court affirmed defendant's conviction for having a weapon while under a disability in violation of &sect; 2923.13(A)(4). Section 2923.13(A)(4), which prohibited a person who was drug dependent from possessing a weapon, was constitutional. Section 2923.13(A)(4) did not create an arbitrary classification of persons. The right to bear arms pursuant to Ohio Const. art. I, &sect; 4 was subject to the limitation of Ohio's police power. Section 2923.13(A)(4) was constitutional because it was a reasonable legislative action that promoted the public's health, safety, and general welfare. The firearms proscription ended once the disability was removed, such as when treatment was sought. Section 2923.13(A)(4) was not unconstitutionally vague because it provided fair warning to citizens of ordinary intelligence of its dictates, included explicit standards for those who were charged with enforcing the law, and ensured that other constitutionally protected freedoms were not unreasonably infringed.</SPAN></P>

A jury found defendant guilty, and on appeal, defendant argued that the jury selection process was prejudicial against him. After the jury commissioner drew the names for the jury pool at random, the names of those chosen were alphabetized and called in alphabetical order. The court held that the jury selection, while not the preferred process to be utilized, was not prejudicial. The procedure outline in Ohio Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant failed to appear before the sheriff for the execution of his sentence after his conviction on kidnapping and gross sexual imposition and the grand jury returned an indictment against him pursuant to Ohio Rev.

On appeal, the court affirmed his conviction and held that the language of the statute encompassed defendant's situation and that defendant's obligation to appear per the trial court's orders was very clear. Defendant's arguments that the statute was overbroad and vague also failed because, not only did he fail to assert the argument in the trial court, the overbreadth argument could not be applied to a criminal statute outside of a limited First Amendment context. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2937.29 provided adequate notice and warning of the punishment for failure to appear with sufficient guidelines for evenhanded application.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff owners filed an action against defendant water district seeking a judicial declaration that the water district's contract with the city did not preclude the city from contracting directly with residents of the water district for provision of water services when the water district had not provided them. The Allen County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio) granted summary judgment to the owners. The water district appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court framed the issue as whether the water district could establish a monopoly over water distribution and prevent property owners from obtaining water from the city or county without the water district's consent. The trial court concluded that the contract at issue applied only to water distributed through water distribution lines owned by the water district. The water district argued on appeal that the trial court failed to give adequate consideration to the underlying purpose of the contract or the prior course of dealing between the city and the water district. The court held that summary judgment was inappropriate because neither the contract or relevant statutes defined the term user and the definition was a question of material fact. The court also held that the question of the city and county's constitutional and statutory rights to provide water was dependent upon the meaning of the contract, making resolution of the issues impossible until after a trial on the merits took place.</SPAN></P>

P. 29 and sentenced him to the maximum penalty.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's deputy treasurer lost $ 115 million dollars of public money in the declining bond market of 1993-1994 when he &quot;sold&quot; existing bonds to other institutional investors and agreed to repurchase the bonds at a specified date. The State charged defendant with dereliction of duty and the jury found him guilty. On appeal, the court held the trial court erred when it denied defendant's motion for judgment of acquittal. The State did not prove that he violated a duty expressly imposed by law, that he acted with the requisite recklessness, or that he failed to keep records evidencing certain risky investments. Though, defendant was not blameless in failing to supervise his subordinates' improvident investment activities, his alleged mismanagement was not a crime. A public official's fiduciary duties to preserve public moneys was not a basis of a criminal charge for dereliction of duty under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2921.44(E) because they were merely implied in the general grant of authority to make the investments in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 135.35(A). Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2921.44(E) required the underlying statute to expressly impose a duty upon the accused.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">As part of an investigation in to the sexual activity of certain young children, police discovered that defendants coerced and forced the children to have sex with each other and with defendants, which defendants would photograph and film. A detective interrogated several young boys and threatened them with detention in the juvenile detention center unless they gave evidence against defendants. A jury convicted defendants of several counts of child sexual abuse and related offenses. The court affirmed the convictions. Ten years later, the boys interrogated by the detective, then adults, came forward and recanted their testimony against defendants. The trial court vacated defendants' convictions and granted their motion for a new trial. Affirming the judgment, the court held that defendants offered sufficient proof to present a prima facie case of a Brady violation. The court held that expert testimony was admissible for the purpose of advancing defendants' ineffective assistance of counsel claim. The court noted that the trial court did not base its decision to vacate solely on the recantation.</SPAN></P>

Defendant filed a motion for judgment as a matter of law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1977, defendant pleaded guilty to attempted escape, a lesser-included offense. In 1994, he was indicted in another county for breaking and entering, grand theft, and possessing criminal tools. All counts carried a specification that he had previously been convicted of an offense of violence, to wit, the attempted escape. Defendant filed a petition to vacate and set aside the judgment on the first conviction on the ground that he had not been advised that by pleading guilty his conviction could serve to enhance penalties in future convictions. The trial court denied his petition. On appeal, defendant filed a motion for judgment as a matter of law. The court declined to address the issue of whether it had jurisdiction because defendant should have brought his petition in the second trial court, then affirmed the denial of post-conviction relief. The court reasoned that his plea's possible enhancing effects on subsequent sentences were collateral consequences, so advisement was not necessary, that defendant had not proved ineffective assistance of counsel, and that he was not entitled to hearing on his petition because he had not established substantive grounds for relief.</SPAN></P>

The complaint charged the property owner had committed crimes by building a room addition that extended to and within the easement area of a village street, obstructing the view of the intersection and creating a dangerous condition. The court reversed the trial court's decision dismissing the village's lawsuit. The court determined that under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 723.01, the village had the power to regulate the use of streets. The village had the duty to keep its streets open, in repair, and free from nuisance. The court determined that the trial court erred by finding that the village selectively enforced the ordinance against the property owner. The conscious exercise of some selectivity in enforcement was not in itself a violation of the U.S. Constitution. In order for selective enforcement to reach the level of unconstitutional discrimination, the discrimination had to be intentional or purposeful. The burden of showing discriminatory enforcement was not satisfied by a mere showing that others similarly situated were not prosecuted.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, defendant contended that the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress due to the lack of a reasonable suspicion to stop and detain him and for probable cause to arrest. The court found that the trooper did have a reasonable suspicion, based upon specific and articulable facts, that defendant was not displaying a rear license plate. Thus, the trooper was constitutionally permitted to make a brief stop of defendant's vehicle in order to investigate that possible infraction. The trial court's factual findings, based upon the trooper's testimony, were supported by competent, credible evidence. When the trooper smelled an odor of alcohol on defendant during the course of his initial investigation, the trooper acquired a reasonable suspicion of a separate criminal offense justifying his continued detention and investigation of defendant for suspicion of driving under the influence. Defendant was not under arrest by mere virtue of being subjected to field sobriety tests. And the trooper possessed probable cause to arrest defendant for driving under the influence, given the totality of the facts and circumstances within the trooper's knowledge.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from his conviction in the Court of Common Pleas of Stark County (Ohio) for felonious assault with a gun specification. He contended that the trial court should have instructed on a lesser included offense and that he was denied a fair trial by the prosecution's use of peremptory challenges. He also complained of prosecutorial misconduct, ineffective assistance of counsel, and violation of his right to a speedy trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's friend and the victim had a long running dispute over a woman. Defendant and his friend stopped in a pickup truck when they saw the victim on the street. The victim shot at the friend, narrowly missing defendant. When the victim started walking away, defendant shot him in the back of the head. The court held that defendant was not entitled to an instruction on aggravated assault because the victim was trying to shoot defendant's friend, not defendant. The prosecution used its peremptory challenges to exclude male jurors. Defendant failed to object and thus failed to preserve his claim of gender based discrimination. After his arrest, defendant was released from jail only after he signed a waiver of his right to a speedy trial. He then failed to appear at the scheduled trial and after his rearrest was confined until the trial. There was no violation of his speedy trial right by conditioning his release upon execution of the waiver and the waiver continued in effect after his rearrest. The court held that there was no ineffective assistance of counsel and no misconduct in the prosecutor's closing argument.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of driving under the influence of alcohol and was sentenced to 90 days in jail, with all but 10 days suspended. Defendant earned credit for four days served before she was ordered to reappear before the trial court for a modification of sentence. Her sentence was modified to five days in jail, with four days credit for time served, and 18 days of electronically monitored house arrest pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4511.99(A)(2)(a). Defendant filed a motion to vacate, which was denied. She thereafter appealed, asserting that delay in execution of her sentence was cruel and unusual punishment, deprived her of due process of law, and violated her due process rights. The court affirmed the judgment, holding that the trial court properly denied defendant's request to vacate her sentence because the jail sentence imposed by the trial court was mandatory and could not be vacated. The court noted that defendant was credited for the time that she actually spent in jail and for the times that she appeared and was unable to serve due to jail overcrowding but that &sect; 4511.99(A)(2) required that she serve the remainder of her sentence as modified by the trial court.</SPAN></P>

The developer became the owner of the interior portion of the island and proposed to give access to lots in its planned subdivision to the bay and nearby lake by cutting a channel, which would sever the roadway. It obtained approval of the planning commission to re-route the road. The lot owners voluntarily dismissed their administrative appeal of the commission's decision and sought a declaration of their rights to the roadway. The trial court granted judgment to the developer and the court affirmed. It found that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 711.24 allowed for changes in platted streets without modification of the lots. Further, the trial court's application of &sect; 711.24 was not an impermissible taking of a property interest, as the lot owners held an implied easement of ingress and egress over a platted road both prior to approval of the plat and after the new plat, and the only difference in the easements was the location and length of their path.</SPAN></P>

Appellant sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee revoked appellant's license to operate a salvage yard because he was in violation of standards set forth in the motor vehicle salvage laws. The court affirmed. Even assuming that appellee's members were members of the same trade organization as the person who filed the complaint against appellant, this was not sufficient to disqualify them per se from sitting in judgment at the administrative level. There was no indication of any egregious procedural violation and no evidence of bias or prejudice. The decision to admit or not admit additional evidence was within the sound discretion of the trial court. The provisions of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4738.03(A) must be read to require that the retail sale of salvage motor vehicle parts must be the &quot;principal&quot; activity of the salvage dealer or &quot;of first importance&quot; to his business. Appellee testified that there were a number of different criteria that led it to conclude that appellant was operating his business contrary to law.

He filed a petition for post-conviction relief requesting retroactive application of the provisions of S. 2 to his sentence. He also requested the appointment of counsel to represent him. The trial court denied his petition without a hearing and refused to appoint counsel for him. On appeal, the court held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in so doing.

The court noted that, pursuant to section five of Ohio S. 2 and Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 1.58(B), Ohio S. 2 could not be given retroactive application.

Code &sect; 9.86. The trial court also denied appellants' request for a jury trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The troopers went to the claimant's house after reports that his vehicle was involved in a hit/skip and his mother answered the door. She asked the troopers to stay at the door while she got the claimant, but the troopers followed her into the house. The claimant was visibly intoxicated and was arrested for the hit/skip and a DUI. Appellants argued that the trial court erred by striking their demand for a jury trial and by determining that the troopers were entitled to immunity from civil liability. The court disagreed and held that a jury trial was necessary only when a case required resolution of factual issues which were triable to a jury in comparable civil actions. The court held that the issue was a question of immunity for which there was no right to trial. The court held that pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 9.86, no officer was liable unless his actions were manifestly outside the scope of his employment, or unless the officer acted with malicious purpose, in bad faith, or in a wanton or reckless manner. The court held that there was not enough evidence from which to extract a malicious purpose, bad faith, or wanton or reckless manner on the part of the troopers.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The patient went to the hospital for diagnostic testing. An orderly placed him on a gurney to transport him to a testing area. When they approached a flight of stairs, the orderly asked the patient to get off of the gurney and walk down. The patient protested that he could not stand because of medication that he had been taking. The orderly then pulled the patient off of the gurney and attempted to stand him up. The patient fell down the stairs. He and his wife filed suit against the hospital, alleging that the orderly was negligent. The trial court granted summary judgment to the hospital on the ground that the patient failed to file suit within the one-year statute of limitations of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2305.11(B). The court affirmed, first concluding that the patient's injuries occurred in connection with a &quot;medical diagnosis&quot; and, therefore, that the orderly's alleged negligence constituted a &quot;medical claim&quot; within the meaning of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2305.11(D)(3). The court next determined the cause of action accrued on the date of the fall. Accordingly, the court found that the action was time-barred because the patient failed to file suit within one year of the fall.</SPAN></P>

The court also rejected defendant's claim that the State failed to notify defendant of the particulars of the testimony of a police detective. Although the court found that there was a discovery violation, the court found that there was no prejudice and no indication that the violation was willful or that prior knowledge of the evidence would have benefitted defendant.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State brought an action against the motorcycle club to perpetually enjoin it from holding its annual swap meet and party in Orrville, Ohio. The State asserted that the party was a public nuisance generating excessive noise, property damage, crime, public sexual activity, and lewdness. The trial court granted the perpetual injunction. On review, the court affirmed. The club attacked the finding that the party was a public nuisance under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3767. The court, however, noted that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3767.01(C) defined nuisance as any place in or upon which lewdness, assignation, or prostitution was conducted, permitted, continued, or existed, and further provided that injunctive relief could be sought against anyone who used, occupied, established, or conducted a nuisance, or aided or abetted therein under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3767.02. The court noted that the evidence was sufficient to show that such behavior took place at the party, and that the club was the sponsor and responsible party for the event. The court found that the statutes in question were not unconstitutionally vague and clearly advised persons what activity was not permitted.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The cities argued that the trial court erred by granting summary judgment in favor of the village. The court affirmed the judgment and found that the cities were not entitled to vote on the merger. Exhaustion of administrative remedies was required prior to instituting a declaratory judgment action challenging the constitutionality of a statutory restriction. An election contest was the specific remedy provided by Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3515.08 et seq. for the correction of all errors, frauds, and mistakes that occurred at an election. The cities were dilatory in bringing their action as to a first election and were not entitled to challenge the merger by way of a declaratory judgment action. As to a second election, neither protest nor contests were appropriate remedies and the cities were entitled to pursue declaratory relief. The merger statutes,&nbsp;Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 709.43 et. seq., were constitutional and authorized the merger. The court held that voting was limited to residents of the areas that were merging.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant putative father challenged a judgment of the Court of Common Pleas of Summit County, Juvenile Division (Ohio), which denied him a jury trial, which established his paternity of a 17-year-old child on the complaint of appellees, a mother and the Summit County Child Support Enforcement Agency, and which ordered him to pay $ 47,520 in back child support upon the report and recommendations of a referee.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A court-ordered genetic test indicated a 99.98 percent probability that the putative father, who admitted to sexual activity with the child's mother, was the child's father. Eleven months after the complaint was filed, the referee recommended a trial date. Two weeks later the father unsuccessfully sought a jury trial and requested that the State of Ohio provide him with an independent genetic expert. On appeal, the court affirmed the common pleas court's determination of paternity and the establishment of a child support obligation by finding that the father's request for a jury trial was untimely as not filed pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 31111.12(D) within three days of the date of the referee's report, which was approved and entered as a matter of record on the same date. The father's request for an expert at the state's expense was permissibly denied in the absence of a statutory right to additional expert testimony at the State's expense. Pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3111.03(A)(6), the father was presumed to be the natural father as the genetic test result indicated a 95 percent or greater probability of paternity. The paternity action was not time-barred.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the common pleas court's judgment against the father and taxed costs to the father.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that Am.Sub.S.B.

No. 269 violated his constitutional rights. The court affirmed, concluding that: (1) defendant was subject to the sentencing procedures in existence before Senate Bill 2 became effective; (2) defendant's constitutional arguments were meritless; (3) there was a necessary period of adjustment whenever a statute was amended; (4) Senate Bill 2 did not apply retrospectively, hence, the trial court did not err by denying defendant's motion to vacate his sentence; and (5) the trial court's denial of defendant's motion was neither a denial of due process or a violation of equal protection of the law.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court affirmed and held that defendant failed to show that he had been singled out for prosecution, and also failed to demonstrate the group of defendants who were prosecuted in a similar manner were similarly situated as defendant. The court found that the State presented legitimate criteria from which it could have properly based its decision to ask for an inclusion of the violence specification. The court further held that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2901.01(I) was not unconstitutionally void for vagueness or overbroad as applied. The court noted that a person of common intelligence could not find the term &quot;offense of violence&quot; so vague as to not understand it that it prohibited assault.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a decision of the Garfield Heights Municipal Court (Ohio), which denied her motion to dismiss the criminal proceedings against her, wherein she was charged with driving under the influence in violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4511.19(A)(1) and violating Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4511.19(B) (2), prohibited blood alcohol concentration.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was stopped for crossing the center line. After the officer noticed a strong smell of alcohol on her, she was asked to perform a field sobriety test. Defendant had difficulty performing the test. Defendant's chemical test indicated a blood alcohol concentration level of .151 percent. Defendant was placed under arrest. Subsequently, defendant's driver's license was suspended. Defendant moved to dismiss the criminal proceedings against her on the basis that she had previously been placed in jeopardy for the same act by reason of the license suspension. The trial court denied defendant's motion. Defendant argued that the Double Jeopardy Clauses of the United States and Ohio Constitutions prohibited second prosecutions or multiple prosecutions for the same offense. The court found that defendant's contention that she had been previously placed in double jeopardy for the same act by reason of the license suspension had partial merit. The court noted that the record did not indicate that defendant's license suspension was terminated on the day of sentencing. Thus, the court held that defendant was unconstitutionally subjected to a second punishment.</SPAN></P>

The city filed a third-party complaint against ODOT, which had installed the guardrail. Plaintiffs settled the claim with the city, and the city sought indemnification from ODOT. The court of claims determined that the guardrail complied with the standards in effect at the time it was built; that ODOT had no duty to upgrade the guardrail because that was a planning decision entitled to immunity; that the guardrail was not a nuisance and the driver's actions were the sole proximate cause of his injuries; and that a common duty existed between ODOT and the city, and therefore, indemnification was not available. The court affirmed on appeal, and found no errors in the court of claim's determinations. ODOT was not liable because the guardrail conformed to accepted engineering standards at the time the plans for construction were approved. ODOT's discretionary decision not to incorporate a new design was entitled to immunity, and thus, ODOT had no duty to upgrade the guardrail.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, a prison inmate, challenged the legality of a search warrant, which was issued based upon information obtained while a prison investigator was monitoring defendant's telephone calls with his wife. After defendant's motion to suppress was denied, he pled no contest to drug trafficking in violation of Ohio Code Ann. &sect; 2925.03. On appeal, the court affirmed and held that the monitoring of inmate phone calls did not violate U.S. Const. amend. IV. The court reasoned that where a prisoner had notice of the practice and elected to place a call, he had no subjective expectation of privacy. The court also concluded that monitoring was in the interest of institutional security. The court further determined that the practice did not violate Title III of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act, 18 U.S.C.S. &sect;&sect; 2510-2521, or Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2933.52(B)(1) because it occurred in the ordinary course of the investigator's law enforcement duties. The court ruled that the spousal privilege created by Ohio Rev.

Code Ann. &sect; 2903.04(A), as a result of defendant's commission of a traffic violation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant filed a motion to dismiss the first count of his indictment, involuntary manslaughter, because the offense described was incompatible with the alleged statutory violation and because the statute described by the offense was overbroad and resulted in cruel and unusual punishment. The trial court reasoned that the punishment for the violation was disproportionate to the crime committed. On appeal, the court affirmed. Punishments prohibited by the Eighth Amendment were limited to those, which were so disproportionate to the offense as to shock the moral sense of the community. The court looked to the gravity of the offense and the harshness of the penalty, the sentences imposed on other criminals in other jurisdictions, and the sentences imposed for commission of the same crime in different jurisdictions. It found that the application of the involuntary manslaughter statute to minor misdemeanors consisting of strict liability violations involving no mental culpability would involve the imposition of punishment that was grossly disproportionate to the offense in violation of the Cruel and Unusual Punishment clauses of both the federal and the state constitutions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Liquor control agents visited the cabaret and, when one of the cabaret's female dancers exposed her breasts, issued a citation to the manager for a violation of &sect; 4301:1-1-52. The agents decided to issue the citation because they believed that topless dancing was &quot;improper conduct&quot; within the meaning of &sect; 4301:1-1-52. In spite of testimony that all the cabaret dancers were required to wear latex on their breasts, the commission ruled that the dance performance was improper and upheld the citation. The trial court agreed and found no constitutional violation. On appeal, the court reversed. The court held that non-obscene nude or topless dancing was entitled to free speech protection under Ohio Const. art. I, &sect; II. The court stated that nudity by itself was not obscene; it was expressive conduct. The court further held that &sect; 4301:1-1-52 did not make clear its intent to regulate only that which was obscene. Because the cabaret was cited for topless dancing, the court was forced to conclude that the line between nudity and sexual conduct was blurred under &sect; 4301:1-1-52. This was substantial overbreadth, and &sect; 4301:1-1-52 could not be saved.</SPAN></P>

The zoning board appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The corporation filed for a conditional use certificate pursuant to the township zoning resolution &sect; 400.8. A public hearing was held and the corporation presented testimony that the proposed use presented no foreseeable serious environmental concerns, that all necessary governmental permits could be secured, and that its existing mining operations had not had a negative effect on property values. The board denied the petition and the corporation filed for judicial review. The trial court reversed the board's decision. The board argued that it had the delegated authority to deny the corporation's conditional use certificate if the corporation satisfied the conditional requirements of &sect; 400.8. The court agreed and held that effective application of &sect; 400.8, pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 1519.14, required that the board had discretion to approve or deny conditional use permits, based on its evaluation of the unique circumstances of the petition, within the administrative powers properly delegated by the township. Failure to recognize the board's discretionary authority undermined the administrative authority properly delegated to it.</SPAN></P>

After the victim settled with the tortfeasor, the negligent driver of the vehicle in which she was riding, for injuries that she sustained in a car accident, she made a claim to her own insurer, which was denied.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The victim's policy provided underinsured motorist coverage up to $ 100,000, and the tortfeasor had liability coverage for bodily injury up to $ 100,000. After the victim settled with the driver for $ 100,000, she made a claim to the insurer, which was denied. The trial court denied the insurer but granted the victim summary judgment. The court reversed, as it was error to determine that the victim's right to coverage accrued on the date of the accident rather than the date of the settlement with the tortfeasor. Thus, the law in effect when the victim's right to the coverage accrued was controlling, not the law in effect when the contract was executed. Therefore, an amendment to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3937.18 was applicable because the right accrued after its effective date. Section 3937.18, as amended, provided that underinsured motorist coverage was available to an insured only if the insured's coverage exceeded the coverage available under the tortfeasor's liability insurance coverage. Because the victim collected from the tortfeasor's insurance company an amount equal to the limit on her own policy, &sect; 3937.18 prevented her from collecting additional insurance from her insurer.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court's summary judgment for the victim and remanded the matter for the trial court to enter summary judgment in favor of the insurer.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of failing to secure a permit for the placement of his mobile home. On appeal, the court disagreed with defendant's contention that the board of county commissioners did not have the authority to regulate mobile homes or their placement. As to defendant's contention that the board did not follow the proper procedure when it adopted the building code regulation pursuant to which defendant was convicted, the court found that the trial court failed to address the issue. The court concluded that defendant's mobile home was a dwelling subject to regulation pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 307.37(A). It concluded that, consistent with &sect; 307.37(A), the board was authorized to regulate the placement of defendant's mobile home. The court believed that it was appropriate for defendant to challenge the Pike County regulation in conjunction with the trial for its violation. The court declined to apply the appeal provision of &sect; 307.37(A).

After being ejected as a fair exhibitor for his refusal to confine his solicitation activities to his booth, the candidate filed suit against the board for breach of contract and other causes.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In exchange for this dismissal of a criminal trespass charge against him that arose out of the incident at the fair, the candidate signed a general release of all claims against the city, the county court, the prosecutor, the county, and the state. The candidate then filed his suit against the board alleging breach of contract, defamation, and violations of 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1981. The court agreed with the candidate that the trial court erred in determining that the board was not a state actor under &sect; 1983. However, the court held that the board did not violate the candidate's First Amendment rights because its rule requiring him to confine his distribution of literature to his booth was a valid and reasonable time, place and manner restriction. The court also held that the rule was not applied in a discriminatory fashion because the other exhibitor reprimanded for distributing outside of his booth had ceased to do so when asked, unlike the candidate. The court next concluded that the candidate's clear and adamant refusal to heed the board's rule constituted a breach of the contract and entitled that board to dismantle the candidate's booth and have him removed from the fairgrounds.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Two defendants sought review of a judgment from the Hamilton County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio) that suspended their drivers' licenses and denied their requests for occupational driving privileges.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants pled guilty to trafficking in marijuana. The trial court suspended their drivers' licenses as provided in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 2925.03(M), 4507.16(D)(2). Defendants requested occupational driving privileges, and the trial court denied their requests. Defendants appealed the suspension and denial of occupational driving privileges. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment. The Ohio Supreme Court previously ruled that the suspension of drivers' licenses as provided in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2925.03(M) for drug-related offenses was constitutional. Further, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4507.16(F) permitted only those offenders whose licenses were suspended pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4507.16 (B), (C) to petition for occupational driving privileges. The legislature did not intend to allow offenders whose licenses were suspended under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 2925.03(M), 4507.16(D)(2), to apply for driving privileges. Additionally, all drug offenders were treated equally under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4507.16(F). Thus, defendants' equal protection rights were not violated by providing other offenders in different classifications with lesser penalties.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 4511.202, and failure to wear a seat belt in violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4513.263. A police officer served defendant with a summons and a copy of the three charges. Seven days later defendant appeared in court but asked for a continuance to get an attorney. The trial court later granted his counsel's motion to withdraw because defendant was no longer indigent. Defendant pleaded no contest to the charges. After sentencing defendant filed a motion to withdraw his pleas or, in the alternative, for a new trial. The court affirmed the trial court's decision denying that motion. The court held that defendant's speedy trial deadline had not expired.

The employee contended that barring her psychiatric condition claim from workers' compensation coverage violated Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 35 and her equal protection and due process rights. The court affirmed, holding that the trial court properly dismissed the employee's administrative appeal because the Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4123.01(C)(1) expressly excluded psychiatric conditions from workers' compensation coverage where the injury was caused solely by work-related mental stress and because &sect; 4123.01(C)(1) was constitutional. The employee's equal protection and due process rights were not violated by the dismissal of her negligence claim because the legislature constitutionally established the workers' compensation system as the exclusive remedy for injuries or conditions that arose in the workplace.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Department denied the recipient ADC and Food Stamp program benefits because she crossed out certain words on a form that were part of the verification portion of her reapplication for benefits. Benefits were denied and the recipient pursued her administrative remedies with the Department. The Department upheld the decision to deny benefits, and that decision was affirmed on appeal to the common pleas court. The recipient then brought this appeal, alleging that since the words she crossed out consisted of &quot;swearing,&quot; and her Catholic religion considered swearing a sin, she should not have been denied benefits for crossing out the swearing portion of the reapplication documents. She argued that to deny her benefits violated the Free Exercise of Religion clause of the United States Constitution. The court found the Department's rules and the policies required an unaltered verification form. Failure to comply with the verification resulted in denial of benefits. That rule applied to all benefit recipients, and did not selectively impose burdens on conduct motivated by religious belief. Therefore, there was no constitutional violation.</SPAN></P>

The trial court did not give a reason for the dismissal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A majority of the voters in a special election approved cancellation of the owner-operator's liquor permits. The owner-operator brought the action after a federal court declared that the statute under which its liquor licenses were cancelled was unconstitutional. The owner-operator argued that the trial court erred in dismissing his action for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. Defendant argued that if the case was dismissed for improper venue, the court should transfer it to the appropriate trial court. Affirming the dismissal order, the court held that the trial court was correct in granting the ODLC's motion to dismiss because under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4301.31 and established case law, the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas had exclusive jurisdiction in cases where a party sued the ODLC for declaratory or injunctive relief. The court found that the ODLC's argument was illusory because the trial court's order did not state why it granted the motion to dismiss, that it had no duty to transfer an improperly venued case, and that the ODLC should have submitted a motion for change of venue to the trial court.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother gave birth to a son. Following a trial and genetic testing, the father's paternity was established. The lower court then referred the case to a magistrate who conducted a hearing on the issue of child support. The father, who was unemployed, was required to seek employment and pay child support. The lower court adopted the magistrate's report. The father's subsequent motion to modify support was rejected. On review, the court affirmed and held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it determined that there had been no change in circumstances warranting a re-determination of child-support. The father argued that he should not be penalized financially because the mother chose to have and to keep the baby. The court held that the decision of whether to carry a fetus to term could never be an equal one. Biologically, the wishes of only one party must prevail. The father's equal protection argument failed because the relevant consent provisions of the adoption statute did not treat the mother and father of the child differently. Last, the father's act of sexual intercourse with the mother carried with it the risk that a pregnancy would result.</SPAN></P>

The court stated that a plea in a criminal case had to be made knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily and that a failure on any of those points rendered enforcement of the plea unconstitutional. Reversing, the court found that the language used by the common pleas court in its discussion with defendant before the plea was accepted, indicating that the mandatory three-year sentence required under Ohio Rev.
