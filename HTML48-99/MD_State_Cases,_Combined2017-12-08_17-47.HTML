</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant landowners challenged separate judgments of the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County (Maryland), which upheld the constitutionality of Charter of Anne Arundel County, Md., art. III, &sect; 308, which conferred upon the people of a home rule county the power of referendum over local legislative enactments where it was neither delegated by the General Assembly nor expressly reserved to the inhabitants of charter counties by the Constitution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In ratifying &sect; 308, the voters retained the right to approve or reject by way of petition and popular election ordinances of the county council. The county council enacted new zoning legislation. Instead of challenging the new ordinance through litigation, opponents of the zoning action appealed to the voters through referendum. Appellees, the Board of Supervisors of Elections of Anne Arundel County (board), ordered the question placed on the ballot. The voters rejected the legislation. The landowners claimed that the board lacked authority to approve the citizen referendum petitions and instituted suits in the circuit court that challenged the validity of &sect; 308 and the zoning referendum. The circuit court issued a declaratory decree that upheld the referendum article and election. The court granted certiorari and affirmed. The adoption of a home rule charter that included the referendum process was an exercise of the right to make provision for any form of government the people deemed suitable for their needs.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the decrees of the circuit court that upheld the referendum process that struck down zoning legislation and determined that the previous zoning legislation was revived by the voters' referendum vote.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A voluntary fund was established by a city bar association to maintain the integrity of the legal profession by reasonably reimbursing losses caused by defalcations of members of the bar of the State of Maryland, acting either as attorneys or as fiduciaries. Clients filed a claim with the trustees seeking reimbursement of losses caused by the defalcations of their attorney. The claim was denied on the ground that the proximate cause of the defalcations stemmed from their attorney's having been made a corporate officer with the authorization to sign checks on its behalf. Clients appealed to the court, which remanded the matter to the trustees. The trustees denied the claims again and the clients appealed. The court reversed, holding that the trustees were to pay the claim. The court held that the trustees had been too strict in their determination of what constituted an attorney-client relationship. In determining whether such a relationship existed, the court applied the &quot;but for&quot; standard: but for the fact that the dishonest attorney enjoyed an attorney-client relationship with the claimant at the time of or prior to the loss, the loss would not have occurred.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff taxpayers brought an action against defendant county for a refund of an alleged recording tax overpayment, and to reduce to judgment an order of refund by the tax court. The Circuit Court for Prince George's County (Maryland) granted the taxpayers summary judgment as to the tax court order, but granted the county's demurrer on the refund claim. Both parties appealed, and the court granted the county's petition for writ of certiorari.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In a prior action, the tax court held that the county's recordation rate exceeded that allowed by statute, and the taxpayers were entitled to a refund. The court affirmed that decision. In response to that case, chapter 129 of the Acts of 1976 was enacted, ratifying the county's rate retroactively except as to any actions which were res judicata. In the present action, the taxpayers argued that because the facts and issues of a second refund claim were identical to the prior action, except for the instrument recorded, and because the county refused to make payment from the prior action, they were not required to exhaust their administrative remedies. Noting that there was no common law action for recovery of taxes voluntarily paid as a mistake of law, the court held that the taxpayers' proper remedy was through the statutory procedure set out in Md. Code art. 81, &sect;&sect; 215-217. The court rejected the county's claim that the prior action was a nullity because the appeal from the tax court's order was based on a statute since held unconstitutional. In any event, the tax court's decision was a final order, making the action res judicata for purposes of chapter 129 of the Acts of 1976.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the judgment of the lower court which granted summary judgment to the taxpayers on the action to reduce the tax court order to judgment and sustained the county's demurrer on the taxpayers' claim for a second refund.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant county sought review of an order of the Circuit Court for Montgomery County (Maryland) that sustained appellee landlord's demurrer to the county's bill of complaint. The county brought this action to enjoin the landlord from violating regulations that required landlords to report on minority tenants and applicants. The trial court held that the regulations violated the United States Constitution and the Maryland Declaration of Rights.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The regulations required landlords with 25 or more rental units to report on the number of minority tenants and applicants. The circuit court held that the distinction between owners of 25 or more units and owners of a lesser number of units was arbitrary and violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. On appeal, the court reversed. The court noted the testimony of a county witness that over 90 percent of the complaints concerning housing discrimination related to apartments rather than houses and that the regulations covered a very high percentage of the units in the county. According to the court, this testimony demonstrated a reasonable basis for the distinction drawn. The trial court also found that one of the goals of the regulations was to make landlords cognizant of the percentage of minorities in their units and that such an objective was not justified absent a finding of past discrimination. The county argued that if landlords were aware of the racial makeup of their units, they would examine their practices and eliminate unconscious or unknowing discrimination. The court agreed with the county that its goal was not unreasonable.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After dependency benefits were awarded to the decedent's daughter, appellants argued that the lower court's interpretation of &sect; 67(6) deprived them of due process of law. Appellants argued that the interpretation of &sect; 67(6) permitting recovery in the absence of a casual connection between the death and the employment other than a mere occurrence in the course of employment was repugnant to the Fourteenth Amendment because it made the employer an involuntary insurer of the life and health of his employees under circumstances where such liability did not rest upon the employer-employee relationship. The court affirmed the award of benefits to the decedent's daughter because the employer's obligation under &sect; 67(6) to pay compensation on behalf of an employee injured in the course of his employment by the wilful or negligent act of a third party did rest upon the employer-employee relationship. The court found that the injury in a sense was work-related even though it arose for personal reasons not attributable to the work environment. The court concluded that it occurred within the course of employment on the employer's premises at a time when the decedent was obliged to be at work.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellee claimants wished to sue a hospital for medical malpractice.

The trial court agreed, finding that the Act impermissibly vested judicial power in an administrative agency and imposed procedural and monetary impediments that denied reasonable access to the courts and the right to trial by jury. Appellant state officials sought review, and the court reversed and remanded. The essence of judicial power was the final authority to render and enforce a judgment.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant property owners challenged the judgments from the Circuit Court of Baltimore and the Baltimore City Court (Maryland), which upheld Baltimore City, Md., Ordinance 137 (1976) and denied injunctive relief restraining appellees, owners and developers, from proceeding with the construction of the housing project authorized under Ordinance 137. Appellees, mayor, city council, owners, and developers, filed a petition for certiorari.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The property owners filed an action in the city court challenging the validity of Ordinance 137, which authorized the construction and operation of a housing complex for the elderly. At the same time, they filed an action in the circuit court to enjoin appellees from proceeding with the construction. The lower courts upheld the ordinance and denied injunctive relief. The property owners appealed, but prior to consideration by the appellate court, appellees' petition for certiorari was granted. The court affirmed the lower courts' judgments. The property owners did not show that the city abused its discretion, under Baltimore City, Md., Code art. 30, &sect; &sect; 4.5-1d and 4.0-2c, by acting inconsistently or unfairly in granting or denying other conditional use applications. Thus, the mere retention of the power to pass on conditional uses did not violate the uniformity mandate of Md. Ann. Code art. 66B, &sect; 2.02. Likewise, the evidence was insufficient to overcome the presumption that Baltimore City, Md., Code art. 30, &sect; &sect; 4.5-1d and 4.0-2c were constitutional. The Zoning Board's approval was not a condition precedent to the right and power of city council to approve the ordinance.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court affirmed the conviction and the court granted a petition for a writ of certiorari. The court reversed the conviction and held that &sect; 418 of the Act, considered with &sect; 417(2), was unconstitutional on its fact in that it denied him equal protection of the laws. The court did not think that the mere possibility of further distribution after a sale in a bookstore, in itself, warranted the classification. The bookstore employee, or any other person not within the exempted class, who distributed that same program, would have been subject to punishment for violation of the statute.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant had asked his wife to go to his apartment to get a ring which he had stolen from the victim. He contended on appeal that this evidence was a privileged confidential communication between him and his wife, and was improperly admitted in evidence in violation of Md. Code Ann. Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. &sect; 9-105 (1974). The court found that the evidence did not suggest that his wife disclosed his communication to a third party, nor did the circumstances require disclosure. In addition, the nature of the communication indicated that it was intended to remain confidential. The court found that the communication was confidential and consequently protected by the statute from disclosure, and that the fact that defendant and his wife were separated at the time of the communication, or that their marriage had little to commend it, did not bar application of the privilege. Nor did the fact that defendant had already been served with divorce papers at the time he claimed the privilege bar its application. Further the court found that the lower court was wrong in concluding that the privilege was not applicable where the confidential communication was made in furtherance of a crime.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judgment was reversed, and the case was remanded to determine whether the erroneous admission of the privileged communication between defendant and his wife amounted to harmless error.</SPAN></P>

The subcontractors gave notice to the property owners of their intention to file liens against the property. The subcontractors filed the liens, but the property owners argued that they failed to comply with the statutory provisions. The court agreed and reversed the lower court's decision. The record disclosed that not one of the subcontractors complied with all of the statutory provisions. In addition, they failed to timely file their liens, which clearly barred their actions.

The Circuit Court for Harford County (Maryland) denied the petition.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Under the binding arbitration provision of Harford County, Md., Code &sect; 201B(h)(5) (1965), the county employer was to implement an arbitrator's award of a wage increase for its employees. The county did not implement the award and the employee association, on behalf of the employees, filed a petition for a writ of mandamus and for damages against the employer and other county officials. The employer raised the defense that the binding arbitration provision was invalid. The trial court issued an interlocutory order in which it denied the employees' motion to prohibit the employer from raising the defense of the invalidity of its own municipal ordinance. The trial court then denied the employees' petition. In affirming the trial court, the court first held that the motion to prohibit was properly denied because the employer could challenge the validity of the ordinance where the duties involved were ministerial. Second, the court held that the ordinance was invalid because it attempted to bind the employer in the exercise of legislative discretion over the compensation of its public employees, which was not authorized by either a public general law or by the county charter.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant city filed eight separate condemnation petitions against parcels of land owned by appellee property owner. The property owner filed a motion to dismiss the city's quick-take petitions and thus divest it of title and possession of the property. The Court of Common Pleas of Baltimore City (Maryland) entered an order granting its motion to divest the city of possession and title to the property. The city appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The property owner alleged that it was not necessary for the city to take the land and that the city had fraudulently used its zoning powers in order to deprive it of just compensation by adversely affecting the value of the real estate. On appeal, the court held that Baltimore, Md., Code of Pub. Loc. Laws &sect; 21-16(a), (c) (1969, 1977 Cum. Supp.) made clear that, unless the right or power to condemn title was challenged, if the city had complied with the procedural requirements of &sect; 21-16 a property owner had no basis for attacking the immediate taking of his property under the statute. Because the property owner had never contended that the city did not comply with the formal requirements mandated by &sect; 21-16(a), and had repeatedly emphasized that it did not dispute the city's right and power to condemn, title and possession vested in the city 10 days after the property owner withdrew its original answer and objection to the quick-take petitions, and could not presently be attacked. Thus, the property owner's motion to strike the trial court's orders granting immediate title and possession to the city was inappropriate and the trial court erred in granting it.</SPAN></P>

It found that the trial court did have jurisdiction to determine if &sect; 67, as applied to the taxpayers, was constitutional.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A police officer was investigated for misconduct. The Police Department Trial Board recommended that he serve 80 hours of duty without pay. The police commissioner then directed that the officer be terminated. The officer appealed to city court, and that court reinstated the original penalty. On appeal, the court reversed the reinstatement of the decision of the trial board. The court held that Law-Enforcement Officers Bill of Rights, Md. Ann. Code art. 27, &sect;&sect; 727-734A did not prevent the police commissioner from dismissing an officer notwithstanding a recommendation for a lesser punishment by a hearing board. The court ruled that the fact that Md. Ann. Code art. 27, &sect; 732 referred to decisions rendered in accordance with Md. Ann. Code art. 27, &sect;&sect; 730-731 did not compel a finding of inconsistency between the Law-Enforcement Officers Bill of Rights and Md. Ann. Code art. 27, &sect; 732. The court reasoned that the hearing board would meet and hold hearings, that it would make its findings under Md. Ann. Code art. 27, &sect; 731, and that those findings would be transmitted to the police commissioner for his ultimate decision. An appeal would lie from the police commissioner's decision.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiffs, tenants and landlords, appealed the decision of the Maryland Court of Special Appeals, which reversed the chancellor's ruling that the application of Prince George's County Multifamily Occupancy Tax to persons receiving military housing allowances exceeded defendant county's authority in plaintiffs' action for a declaration judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The tenants and landlords contested the constitutionality of the occupancy tax under the uniform taxation mandate of Article 15 of the Declaration of Rights. The keystone of the challenge to the occupancy tax was whether the tax was a direct tax on the tenant's property or whether it was an indirect excise tax on the privilege of using or occupying a rented multifamily residential unit. The court examined the designation placed upon the tax by the Legislature, the subject matter of the tax, and the incidents of the tax, as in the manner in which it was assessed and the measure of the tax, and affirmed the decision. At no point in the state act or the county ordinance was there any indication that the tax was intended as a direct charge on a tenant's possessory estate. Thus, the tax appeared to be a levy on the use and occupancy of a dwelling rather than an assessment directly against any property interest in the tenant's hands. The court held that the occupancy tax was an excise tax imposed or laid with a political view for the good government and benefit of the community, and was therefore not subject to the uniformity requirements of Article 15 of the Declaration of Rights.</SPAN></P>

All other requisite indicia of comprehensiveness were also present. Underlying adoption of the sectional map amendment was a well thought out, carefully considered and extensively studied plan, correlated to the common needs of the area. There was massive participation in the planning process. The requirement for a comprehensive plan was met because due consideration was given to the common needs of a particular district. The aggrieved property owners had not overcome the presumption that the rezoning was valid and bore the necessary relationship to the general public interest and welfare. The circuit court erred in holding that even though the rezoning was comprehensive, precedent mandated that the aggrieved property owners be afforded a right to cross-examine witnesses at the sectional map amendment hearings before the county council.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court granting summary judgment for the state, finding that the city had no authority to subject the state to its zoning ordinance where the state had not manifested an intent be bound by the provisions of the Zoning Enabling Act.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiffs, non-resident property owners, appealed an order of the Circuit Court for Worcester County (Maryland), which sustained a city ordinance adopted by defendants, the mayor and city council, changing the qualifications for voters in city elections while holding invalid an ordinance creating a classification between non-resident property owners registered before the ordinance's enactment and all other non-resident property owners.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The voting franchise originally extended not only to residents but also to non-residents owning real estate. The mayor and city council adopted a charter amendment resolution which changed the qualifications of voters by prohibiting non-resident property owners from voting. However, another resolution created a &quot;grandfather clause&quot; that allowed non-resident property owners on the voter rolls as of the date the resolutions to remain on the voter rolls. Several non-residents subsequently attempted to register to vote. When they were denied registration, they filed a declaratory action asserting that the resolutions were unconstitutional. The trial court held that the resolution changing the qualifications was proper, but found that the resolution creating the &quot;grandfather clause&quot; was unconstitutional as violative of Equal Protection. On appeal, the non-resident property owners asserted that the two provisions were not severable, making both invalid. The court held that resolutions were validly enacted, and that the legislative intent and history supported the finding of severability. The classification violated Equal Protection, making only the second resolution invalid.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court agreed with the trial court's order finding the second resolution invalid and severable from the first, but vacated the order and remanded the case because the trial court adjudicated additional matters that should not have been reached and did not deal with all of the resolutions challenged.</SPAN></P>

The city could not challenge the registered voter' status as qualified voters because a statutory remedy was available to challenge such qualifications. The statutory remedy was the exclusive method for challenging the qualifications of the registered voters. Also, it was of no consequence if a registered voter lived in a district, which was over-represented; the voter still had standing because residents of a legislative district, which received constitutional treatment under a redistricting plan, had standing to maintain an appeal.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant mother challenged a trial court's decree that ordered appellee father to pay less than the total amount required for a child's support. The Court of Special Appeals (Maryland) reduced the father's support obligation, holding that under Md. Const. Decl. Rts. art. 46 and Md. Code Ann. art. 72A, &sect; 1 (1957) the mother was obligated to contribute to support, and the mother appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">When a trial court declined to order a father to pay the full amount that it determined was necessary for a child's support, the mother appealed contending that he was obligated to pay support up to the limit of his available income after proper expenses were paid. The court held that the parental duty to support a child was not primarily the father's obligation but was to be shared by the parents in accordance with their respective financial resources. The language of art. 72A, &sect; 1 was sufficient to reject the common law rule that imposed a support duty only on the father. Although the courts had failed to interpret that statute to require both parents to share the duty of support, any remaining doubt was eliminated by the passage of the equal rights amendment, Md. Const. Decl. Rts. art. 46.

The following morning, defendant decided to practice some &quot;touch and gos&quot; during the course of which, he &quot;buzzed&quot; nearby apartments. His activities were observed by a Maryland police officer in a helicopter who followed the plane back to the airport. Defendant was arrested and an examination showed that his blood alcohol level was 0.17 percent. On appeal, defendant argued that the state was precluded from prosecution because the statute proscribing his conduct was preempted by the Federal Aviation Act, 49 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1301 et seq. In affirming defendant's conviction, the court found that it was the clear intent of congress that criminal prosecution of defendant's conduct be left with the states and that there was no conflict within the contemplation of the doctrine of preemption between the state and federal laws.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants were arrested and charged with unlawful picketing of a residential neighborhood after they refused to stop protesting government nuclear armament in front of the home of a government official. After a trial, defendants were found guilty. The circuit court dismissed the charges because it determined that Md. Code Ann. art. 27, &sect; 580A was unconstitutional. The state argued that the regulation was not violative of the First and Fourteenth Amendments because it was a valid exercise of the state's police power to protect individual privacy by enacting reasonable time, place, and manner regulations irrespective of content. The state also argued that the exemption of labor related picketing did not create a classification which violated the Equal Protection Clause, as the classification served a compelling state interest. The court affirmed the decision because the regulation was drawn too broadly and because it encompassed within its scope activity which was constitutionally safeguarded. The court also held that the residential picketing provision were not severable from the labor related picketing provisions which were exempted from criminal prosecution.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In 1976, the county council proposed two amendments to the county charter. One bill was vetoed by the county executive and passed over his veto, and the other bill allegedly was certified to the board prior to the expiration of time for consideration of the proposal by the county executive. The county filed a declaratory judgment action against the board, seeking a declaration that both bills were invalid and an injunction against advertising or placing these bills on the election ballot. The chancellor held both bills to be valid and proper legislative acts to be submitted to the county voters at the November 1976 election. The court granted certiorari and ordered that the lower court's decree be vacated and remanded for an order of dismissal, finding that the lower court lacked jurisdiction to hear the case because there was no justiciable issue. The court held that to come within the purview of the Declaratory Judgment Act, there had to be an actual controversy, and found that the county's rights, status, or other legal relations had not been adversely affected by its own deliberately intended enactment of amendments to its own charter.</SPAN></P>

The advertiser owned several billboards in the affected area and sought to have the ordinance declared invalid and unconstitutional. The trial court found in favor of the city and dismissed the complaint. The court vacated the trial court's judgment, holding that the trial court erred by dismissing the complaint without a declaration of the rights of the parties. However, the court ruled that the ordinance, which was designed to remove slums and blight from the city, did not violate the advertiser's First Amendment rights because it was narrowly tailored and furthered an important or substantial governmental interest.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The city filed a petition to condemn the leasehold property for urban renewal purposes.

The city attached an affidavit explaining the deterioration of the property, which was a menace to the public health, and reciting that the owner had failed to correct the deterioration. The court held that the city had authority to acquire the property under Md. Const. art. XI-B, &sect; 1; Md. Const. art. III, &sect; 40A; 1949 Md. Laws 217; Baltimore City, Md., Code Pub. Loc.

Before the work was completed, the bankrupt corporation obtained a permanent first trust loan from the first holder of a deed of trust. The deed of trust was duly recorded. The holder of the mechanics' lien was never paid. It filed a mechanics' lien against the property owned by the bankrupt, recorded the instrument, and filed a complaint to foreclose its lien. Before the foreclosure proceedings could be terminated, the bankrupt corporation obtained another loan from the second holder of a deed of trust, secured by a second deed of trust, which was duly recorded. The bankrupt corporation demanded arbitration with the holder of the mechanics' lien, and a dispute, which lasted for years, ensued over whether arbitration was required before the mechanics' lien could be foreclosed. The second deed of trust was recorded after the holder of the mechanics' lien's bill of complaint to foreclose, but prior to any judicial determination of the issue. The court held that because the mechanics' lien was not established until after the recordation of the deeds of trust, it was junior in priority to both of them.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed in part and reversed in part and the case was remanded for entry of an order indicating that the mechanics' lien was third in priority. Costs were to be paid by the holder of the mechanics' lien. First priority was to the holder of the deed of trust that was recorded first. Second priority went to the holder of the deed of trust that was recorded second. Third priority went to the holder of the mechanics' lien.</SPAN></P>

Code art. 56, &sect; 157E, which prohibited the operation of retail service stations by producers and refiners of petroleum. The oil companies claimed that the legislation was unconstitutional because it violated numerous provisions of the state and federal constitutions. The court ruled that the challenged legislation was constitutional. In so holding, the court found that (1) the legislation did not violate substantive due process because it was not arbitrary, oppressive, or unreasonable; (2) the legislation did not violate the Commerce Clause because it did not discriminate against out-of-state economic interests and because the state's interest outweighed any burden imposed on interstate commerce; (3) there was no Takings Clause violation because the oil companies were not deprived of all beneficial use of their property; (4) the legislation did not violate the Equal Protection Clause because its classification scheme bore a rational relationship to the objective of preserving competition within the retail gasoline industry; and (5) the legislation was not invalid under the Supremacy Clause because it was not inconsistent with federal law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In consolidated appeals, defendant adult bookstore owners sought review of the judgments of the Superior Court of Baltimore City (Maryland) that granted plaintiff city's motions for summary judgment as to the issue of defendants' liability for the payment of annual license fees for coin-operated amusement devices required by Baltimore, Md., City Code art. 15, &sect; 71 (1966).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The summary judgements in the city's favor were based upon a decision entered by a federal court in a declaratory judgment action that the owners had filed challenging the constitutionality of &sect; 71. The federal court held that &sect; 71 was constitutional on its face and as applied, and that the city was entitled to apply a non-regulatory, non-confiscatory license tax on all coin-operated amusement devices to coin-operated movie machines. The court granted certiorari and affirmed the trial court's judgments. In so doing, the court followed the reasoning of the federal court and its conclusion. The court held that the fact that the number of devices in question was for determination by the trier of fact did not preclude the grant of summary judgment as to liability. Whether such devices were within the contemplation of &sect; 71 was a matter of statutory construction. The trial court was correct in finding that there was no genuine dispute as to a material fact with respect to the necessity of obtaining a license and that the city was entitled to judgment as a matter of law with respect to the owners' liability for payment of the fees.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In sustaining defendants' demurrer to plaintiff's petition for mandamus, the trial court held that &sect; 60B, relating to the foster care program administered by the social services administration, was unconstitutional as an invalid appropriation bill, but that it had, in effect, the same weight and value as a joint resolution of the state legislature. On appeal, the only relief sought by plaintiffs was an order requiring the governor to comply with &sect; 60B (b) &quot;in the preparation of all future budgets.&quot; The court held that &sect; 60B(b) was a constitutional statute, setting forth valid criteria for the administration of a particular government program. However, the court concluded that pursuant to the provisions of the Budget Amendment found in Md. Const. art. III, &sect; 52, and the purposes underlying those provisions, that the funding of Md. Ann. Code art. 88A, &sect; 60B(b) in future annual budgets was a matter constitutionally committed to the governor's discretion.

The decedent's mother filed a wrongful death action against the driver and the employer.

A jury eventually imposed liability on the driver for negligence and on the employer for negligent entrustment and awarded the mother and the child damages. The employer, the driver, and the child appealed. The court granted certiorari and reversed holding that there was insufficient evidence of negligent entrustment to go to the jury because the driver misrepresented to the employer that he had a valid driver's license and was an experienced driver.

The employer was ordered by the commission to comply with the mandate of the new law and to increase the weekly payments made to the employee. On appeal, the trial court accepted the county's argument that the new statute could not be applied retrospectively and ruled that it was unconstitutional and invalid. Upon review, the court held that the trial court was correct in finding that the operational effect of the statute required it to pay more than it was required to pay under the law in effect at the time of the injury. Nonetheless, the court remanded the case for a determination of the merits as to whether the supplemental payments required under the new statute would so deplete a subsequent injury fund as to required that additional assessments be made.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed the decision from the Court of Special Appeals (Maryland), which affirmed the trial court's judgment that had convicted defendant of disorderly conduct in violation of Md. Ann. Code art. 27, &sect; 123(c) (1957, Repl. Vol. 1976), resisting arrest, and assault and battery.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A state trooper overheard defendant's loud remarks containing vulgar language and a racial slur while in a restaurant. The trial court convicted defendant of disorderly conduct, and the appellate court affirmed the conviction. On further appeal, the court reversed. After reviewing the development of the &quot;fighting&quot; words doctrine, the court concluded that defendant's first remark referring to police officers did not constitute &quot;fighting&quot; words because the state trooper, a possible addressee, was not aroused by the comment. Examining defendant's second statement that &quot;The fucking niggers in this county are no better than goddamn policemen,&quot; the court concluded that based on precedent the use of the adjective &quot;fucking&quot; was not punishable in the absence of compelling reasons. The court found that the remainder of the remark was made by defendant during a conversation with friends and there was no evidence that anyone who might have heard it was so aroused as to respond in a violent manner. Thus, defendant's remarks were not the kind of personally abusive epithets that fell outside of the protection of the First Amendment. The court held that defendant engaged in protected speech.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant sought review of a judgment from the Criminal Court of Baltimore (Maryland), which imposed death under Md. Ann. Code art. 27, &sect; 413 after defendant, an arsonist whose fire had killed six people, was convicted of first-degree murder. In seeking review, defendant sought reversal based on art. 27, &sect; 413's constitutionality, the absence of instructions on a lesser degree of homicide, and rulings concerning opening and closing statements.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After a fire set by defendant killed six people, defendant was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to death under Md. Ann. Code art. 27, &sect; 413(b), (d). Accordingly, review was sought, and the court affirmed the conviction but vacated the sentence. In vacating the sentence, the court held art. 27, &sect; 413(b), (d) was unconstitutional because it lacked guidelines enabling the sentencing authority to consider mitigating factors. Based on its holding, the court remanded with instructions to impose life sentences under Md. Ann. Code art. 27, &sect; 413(a), because the unconstitutional sentence had not affected the conviction and art. 27, &sect; 413(a) had been severable from the unconstitutional provisions. In affirming, the court rejected the contention that instructions on a lesser degree of homicide had been required because murder committed during arson was first degree murder, rather than second degree murder, and there was no evidence to support a lesser offense. Finally, the court held defendant's opening had been improper because it had encouraged the jury to disregard the law, while the prosecution's closing had not been improper because it had been argument in response.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Although the court vacated defendant's death sentence based on the death penalty statute's unconstitutionality, the court remanded for the imposition of life sentences after affirming defendant's conviction for first-degree murder, notwithstanding the absence of instructions on a lesser degree of homicide and rulings concerning opening and closing statements.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiffs based their claims on strict liability, and on breach of express warranties. Defendant denied the claims and filed motions to dismiss because strict liability was not appropriate in the circumstance and that an action for loss of consortium could not be brought by a non-buyer. The court held that plaintiff husband who was injured by a defective and unreasonably dangerous product would succeed in making the seller of the product, who was in a better position to take precautions and protect against defect, bear the loss, on a theory of strict liability.

The executive, thereafter, entered into a contract on behalf of the county with the architectural firm. The issues went before the trial court, which found that both the bills were invalid because they violated the principle of separation of powers.

The court stated that there was no authority before it for a suit brought in the corporate name of a political subdivision where the conflicting officers joined in the petition and asked the courts to determine the controversy between them.

The trustees denied the client's claim on the ground that the lawyer was a corporate officer of the client and that the claim arose from his status as a corporate officer. The trial court issued a writ of certiorari for review of the trustees' decision, but it later quashed the writ on the grounds that there was no provision in Md.

The court noted that Rule 1228 had been amended during the pendency of the action to allow judicial review of the trustees' decisions. The court also observed that the trustees' decision to deny the claim had not been supported by any definitive factual findings, and it suggested that on remand the trustees should state with specificity the reasons underlying their final determination.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the reversal of defendant's conviction for murder in the second degree. The jury instructions to the effect that malice could be presumed from pointing a deadly weapon at a vital part of the body unconstitutionally relieved the state of its burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt the absence of mitigation where a jury had returned a conviction for murder in the second degree and the defense of provocation had been fairly raised. While it might have been proper to infer an intention to kill or to do grievous bodily harm from the directing of a deadly weapon at a vital part of the human anatomy, it was improper to infer &quot;malice&quot; therefrom, since the use of deadly force did not itself negate the absence of mitigating circumstances. Otherwise, the state would have been unconstitutionally relieved of its burden of proving the absence of mitigation and the burden of persuasion would have shifted to defendant to lower his guilt to manslaughter. Due process of law was offended by placing the burden on the defendant to prove, by any standard, the existence of mitigating circumstances necessary to lower a felonious homicide to the level of manslaughter.</SPAN></P>

Code art. 66B, &sect; 4.05(d) for appellees, members of the Planning Commission of St. Michaels (Maryland) and an inn owner, holding that the incorporated town was constitutionally empowered under art. 66B, &sect; 4.05(d) to zone all lands lying within one mile of its corporate boundaries.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The opponents took exception to a change made by the commissioners relative to zoning in the area around an inn, which was not within the town's corporate limits but was within one mile of its corporate boundaries. The opponents sought a declaratory judgment that Md. Code art. 66B, &sect; 4.05(d) was unconstitutional as far as it purported to confer upon the commissioners the power to zone land lying outside the town's corporate boundaries. The chancellor found that &sect; 4.05(d) was constitutional. On appeal, the court noted that &sect; 4.05(d) concerned only Talbot County. Because there was only one class of municipal corporations in Maryland and because Md. Const. art. XI-E, &sect; 1 specified that the power of the general assembly to act relative to the affairs of municipal corporations was only by general, not specific, laws, it followed that &sect; 4.05(d) was unconstitutional. However, from the very nature of 1970 Md. Laws 672 the court concluded that the general assembly would have enacted it even had it known that Md. Code art. 66B, &sect; 4.05(d) was invalid. Thus, the court separated from 1970 Md. Laws 672 only the portion purporting to grant special powers to the municipalities of Talbot County.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant, the Secretary of the Maryland Department of Transportation, challenged the decree of the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County (Maryland), which found in favor of appellee citizens in the citizens' action to declare unconstitutional within the meaning of Md. Const. art. III, &sect; 34 certain bonds issued by the Secretary. The Secretary argued that he was improperly enjoined from seeking approval for the sale of the bonds.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Under the authority of Md. Ann. Code art. 94A, &sect;&sect; 1 to 11A (Supp. 1975), the Secretary authorized the issuance of bonds whose last serial principal maturity was later than 15 years from the date of issue. The citizens filed an action claiming that the bond issuance violated Md. Const. art. III, &sect; 34 because it created debt that would not be discharged within 15 years from the time it was incurred. The trial court found in favor of the citizens, holding that the imposition, levy, and irrevocable pledge of tax revenues made the bonds &quot;debt&quot; in the constitutional sense contemplated by &sect; 34, notwithstanding the statement in Md. Ann. Code art. 94A, &sect; 9(d) that consolidated transportation bonds did not constitute a pledge of the faith and credit of the State of Maryland. The Secretary appealed, and the court affirmed. The true test of the special fund doctrine was not what came out of the fund, but what went in. The State had undertaken to provide part of the fund from a tax, so the bonds issued on the credit of the fund were in truth debts of the State. This use of the taxing authority for debt service payment for the bonds created a constitutional &quot;debt&quot; of the State.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Board's tax ordinance granted tax discounts based on the size of the real property tax bill. The recipients of the highest benefit were individual owners whose property was subject to residential or agricultural use. Owners of commercial properties received almost no benefit. The taxpayer was an electrical utility company that owned a large amount of commercial property. Its tax payment compromised 60 percent of the taxes levied. The taxpayer filed a petition to invalidate the ordinance. The parties stipulated to the relevant facts, and the trial court denied the taxpayer's claim for relief. On appeal, the taxpayer challenged the ordinance on the grounds that the statutory purpose of &sect; 48(b) was to encourage the prompt payment of taxes and that the ordinance served the purpose of alleviating the property tax burden on individuals with low or moderate incomes. The court agreed that the tax discounts established under the ordinance were not authorized by &sect; 48(b). The Board's redistribution of the property tax burden was not authorized by &sect; 48 or any other statute.

The county purportedly acted pursuant to statutory authority when it prepared the form and contents of the referendum question and certified it to the supervisors. However, the court held that such a referendum was limited to the amendments to the newly enacted re-zoning ordinance, and without recitation of the provisions, the proposed ballot question was not in accordance with the requirements of the statute and was fatally defective. The failure of the ballot question to present a clear, unambiguous, and understandable statement of the full and complete nature of the issues included in Question D constituted a deviation from the prescribed forms of the law, and the court affirmed the lower court's order nullifying the referendum.</SPAN></P>

The landowner appealed, and the court granted certiorari while the appeal was pending.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The landowner contracted with a general contractor for the erection of a building on the landowner's property. The subcontractor contracted with the general contractor, agreeing to construct the building's roof. The subcontractor fully performed its obligations and was owed payment by the general contractor. The subcontractor gave the landowner notice of its intent to claim a mechanics' lien prior to filing the mechanics' lien and a bill of complaint to enforce the lien. The landowner sought summary judgment, arguing that Maryland's lien statute unconstitutionally deprived it of its property without procedural due process of law. On appeal, the landowner again argued that the lien statute deprived owners of their property without procedural due process, in contravention of Article 23 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights (Article 23) and the Fourteenth Amendment. The appellate court partially agreed with the landowner and held that certain provisions of the lien statute were unconstitutional. Nevertheless, the court concluded that the landowner was afforded due process prior to being deprived of its property through the enforcement proceedings at the trial court level.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant sought certiorari review of a judgment which affirmed the denial of a motion to dismiss for lack of speedy sentencing. The court affirmed the judgment, concluding that even under the assumption that the sentence was part of the trial for Sixth Amendment purposes, the delay between the time of filing the motion for a new trial and the denial of the motion was not a violation of defendants' speedy trial guarantee. The court observed that defendant did not request sentencing in the intervening period and as a result he was deemed to have waived any rights conferred upon him. The court further explained that the presumptive prejudice which arises from an inordinate delay in bringing a man to trial did not present the same question as prejudice after the conviction and any such inordinate delay was merely one of the factors to be considered in the balancing test. The court found no denial of due process or the right to speedy trial was shown because the inordinate sentencing delay was entirely inadvertent on the state's part, no steps to request sentencing were taken, and no prejudice from either confinement or disappearing witnesses was sustained.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The state prosecutor would be nominated by a selection commission created by the Act and appointed for a term of six years. The state prosecutor would investigate alleged criminal offenses on his own initiative or at the request of parties specified in the Act. The trial court held that the Act was constitutional except to the extent that it purported to designate the chief judges of the Court of Appeals, the Court of Special Appeals, and the District Court as ex officio members of the commission; those provisions, however, were severable. The court held that the state prosecutor's power to initiate an investigation and commence prosecution if a state's attorney did not act was a clear invasion of the state's attorney's most awesome discretionary power: to determine whether or not to prosecute. Further, the Act empowered the state prosecutor to represent the state in any appeal or postconviction proceeding, which invaded the attorney general's constitutional duty. In each instance, the Act transferred power from what had traditionally been an elected official to an appointed official. The result sought could only be achieved by a constitutional amendment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The county's rent control ordinance generally limited rent increases to four percent of the base rent per year. Several landlords filed suit against the county seeking to have the ordinance declared unconstitutional on the ground that it constitutes a deprivation of property without due process of law in violation of U.S. Const. amend. XIV. The circuit court held that there was no exception to the general constitutionality analysis for rent control laws. The circuit court refused to find the ordinance unconstitutional. The court affirmed the circuit court's judgment. The court held that there was a real and substantial relationship between the ordinance and the public health, safety, morals, and welfare of the community and therefore the ordinance did not violate due process. The court noted that the United States Supreme Court had upheld price control legislation under the Due Process Clause regardless of whether an emergency existed or whether the business was one affected with the public interest. The constitutionality of the ordinance did not depend on whether there was an emergency shortage of rental housing.</SPAN></P>

Before construction began, an ordinance was enacted requiring construction to begin within four months of the permit. The county then revoked the permit because construction was not initiated in time. The county sought an injunction to prevent the construction of the refinery itself, on the basis that the Bailey Bill, Md. Ann. Code art. 66B, &sect; 4.01(c), (1957, 1970 Repl. Vol., 1975 Cum. Supp.), which was enacted after the permit was issued, prohibited the use of land and buildings for refining of petroleum or petroleum products. The injunction and revocation actions were consolidated, and the trial court affirmed the revocation of the permit. The company appealed, and the court granted certiorari and affirmed, holding that the company had not timely initiated construction, and that the company's substantial expenditures preliminary to the commencement of construction did not create a vested right to continue under the building permit issued prior to a change in the zoning classification of the property.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In an automobile-pedestrian personal injury action, the jury awarded respondent infant a sum as compensation for her injuries, and a sum to respondent mother as reimbursement for medical expenses she incurred on behalf of respondent infant. On appeal, petitioners asserted that a number of evidential and procedural errors were committed at the trial level. The court stated that evidence of prospective damages, as were awarded to respondent infant, had to be in terms of the certain or probable and not of the possible. The court held that it was error to receive into evidence a doctor's speculative opinion on the issue of respondent infant's potential problem in bearing children. Because this opinion was the only testimony on the subject, it followed that it was likewise error to permit abnormal childbirth complications to be considered by the jury in assessing damages. However, the court held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by refusing to send the case outside of the city for trial.

The tax court was found to be an administrative agency, created by the legislature. The legislature did not have state constitutional authority to create a new court. Since jurisdiction of both the Court of Appeals and the Court of Special Appeals was limited to review of judicial decisions, the legislature could not enact statutes which provided for those courts to have original jurisdiction over challenges to tax court decisions. Therefore, the court held that Ch. 385 of the Laws of 1971, which provided such original jurisdiction, was unconstitutional. Since its provisions were not severable, the court held it was invalid in its entirety. The court then considered the severability provisions of Ch. 448 of the Acts of 1975, and ruled that the circuit courts had original jurisdiction, with a right to appeal to the Court of Special Appeals, and that further review by the Court of Appeals would be by way of certiorari.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant filed for certiorari to the Court of Special Appeals of Maryland, which affirmed the denial of his bill of complaint, requesting a ruling that his convictions as an adult for burglary committed when he was 16 years old were a nullity in view of a later holding that the Maryland Juvenile Causes Act (Act), Md. Ann. Code art. 26, &sect; 51 et seq., (1957, 1971 Repl. Vol.) was unconstitutional insofar as it exempted defendant from the Act.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In 1960, when defendant committed the burglaries, the Act exempted Baltimore City from the uniform juvenile age requirement of 18 years. In Baltimore City, where defendant committed the burglaries, a juvenile was defined as one under the age of 16 years. Because defendant was not quite 16 when he committed two of the six burglaries, the trial court waived defendant to the jurisdiction of the criminal court for those counts. About 10 years later, a decision was rendered finding that the Act insofar as it exempted Baltimore City from the uniform juvenile age requirement of 18 years was unconstitutional. Such holding was found to apply retrospectively. The court denied defendant relief and affirmed his convictions, finding that defendant's convictions were not contaminated to the extent that the new juvenile age requirement had to apply to his convictions retrospectively. The court noted that he was accorded the right to a jury trial and was entitled to the appointment of counsel. The court also balanced defendant's rights and fairness to society at large and held that it was unnecessary to apply the holding retrospectively and nullify defendant's convictions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants, physicians and related individuals, sought review of an order of the Court of Special Appeals of Maryland, that reversed a trial court order granting their pleas of limitations in wrongful death actions under 1971 Md. Laws ch. 784, &sect; 1. The trial court held that ch. 784, &sect; 1 had not extended the limitations period to three years on plaintiffs' wrongful death actions that accrued in October and November of 1969.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Act extending the statute of limitations for wrongful death actions provided that it was to be applied prospectively and retrospectively to be applied to any cause of action arising prior to 1968. The court of appeals determined that the Act also applied retroactively to causes of action arising after July 1, 1969, finding that a literal application of the statute would produce a bizarre result. On appeal, the court reversed, finding that the statute clearly and unambiguously provided that it was applicable to causes of action that arose prior to July 1, 1968 and after July 1, 1971. The court noted that retroactive application of statutes was disfavored, particularly where substantive rights were involved. Since the wrongful death statute created a new liability not existing at common law, the court held that compliance with the period of limitations was a condition precedent to the right to maintain the action and retrospective application was only permitted if clearly expressed in the statute.</SPAN></P>

The court held that a building permit was not limited to a permit for a building, per se, but included a permit for a portion of the building or project. In addition, the court found that the retaining wall was an indispensable part of the gasoline station. The court also rejected the claim that the gas company's work was merely preliminary and did not constitute the requisite commencement of construction. The court held that construction of the retaining wall was necessary and prerequisite to the construction of the rest of the gas station. The court further rejected the citizen's claim that work was not timely because it was done right before the period expired. The court found that the work could be performed at any time during the permit period and the fact that it was done towards the end of this period and during bad weather did not indicate bad faith or non-compliance.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff volunteer fire companies and defendant county appealed a decision of the Circuit Court for Prince George's County (Maryland). The volunteer companies sought declaratory relief after the county enacted Prince George's County, Md., Code of Public Local Laws &sect; 32-17 and Prince George's Count, Md., Charter &sect;14. In a previous appeal, the court remanded to the trial court for a determination of the constitutional issues presented.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The county contended that the volunteer companies were instrumentalities of the county and that the county fire chief had authority to direct their activities and operations. The volunteer companies, in an effort to remove themselves from the control of the county, refused to submit to the county's budgetary procedures. The court held that the county, pursuant to the police power, could reasonably regulate the volunteer companies to protect the public health and safety. This meant that the fire chief was clearly in control of direct operations at the scene of any fire and that this authority was not contingent upon a volunteer company's decision to accept public funds. On the other hand, the volunteer companies remained distinct entities and the fire chief could only regulate activities directly related to the fighting of fires. With regard to funding, the court held that if a volunteer company elected to accept county funds, the county could impose conditions on use of those funds. On the other hand, if a volunteer company did not accept county funds, it was only subject to such county regulations as could be imposed under the police power.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the decree of the lower court regarding control over volunteer fire companies by the county.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court reversed and remanded for further proceedings because the land sought to be condemned was for a public rather than a private use and therefore the condemnation was permissible under Md.

Appellee commissioner held that appellant's refusal to renew appellee doctor's policy or accept applications for new policies was unfairly discriminatory under 1974 Md. Laws 234A.

Appellate court reversed, explaining that under law 234A, an insurer could not cancel or refuse to underwrite a policy for a particular risk or class of risk for any reason based on race, color, creed, or gender, or for any unfairly discriminatory reason. Appellate court held that under the statute, &quot;risk&quot; meant a person or applicant, not a particular type of insurance.

The court held that the trial court could impose a sentence of life imprisonment on the rape conviction even though it had failed to instruct the jury that it could limit the sentence by rendering a verdict without capital punishment. The court concluded that defendant had a constitutional right to have the jury instructed as to their statutory right to return a qualified verdict, but that he could waive or forfeit that right by failing to make a timely objection to the instructions. The court did not know why defense counsel did not request an instruction as to the jury's right to limit the period of incarceration by adding the words &quot;without capital punishment.&quot; It may have been a matter of trial tactics.

Appellants complained that &sect; 3-113.1 violated the equal protection and due process clause of the U.S. Const. amend XIV. Appellants claimed that &sect; 3-113.1 unreasonably required them in the purchase of a new motor vehicle to obtain a certificate of title and that such a transaction was subject to the certificate of title fee and the imposition of an excise tax. These requirements were not imposed upon new car dealers holding franchises from manufacturers and who transferred new vehicles to other dealers having a franchise from the same manufacturer. The trial court held that the statute was constitutional.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">At issue was a statute that provided that the responsibility for legal action in cases involving the Building and Electrical Code would be transferred to the city.

XI-A, &sect; 4. The court held that Md. Ann. Code art. 53, &sect; 44 was clearly a public local law. The court also found that mandating that the state's attorney prosecute all violations of the Building and Electrical Codes was an interference by the judiciary with the discretion vested in the state's attorney. Consequently, the portions of the order requiring the state's attorney to prosecute all violations of the Baltimore City Building and Electrical Codes were ordered deleted.</SPAN></P>

The State argued that only the testimony contained within the &quot;four corners&quot; of the affidavit in the application could be considered. Defendant's motion was denied, and he was subsequently convicted by a jury. On appeal, the court held that (1) the &quot;taint&quot; issue was properly preserved for appellate review, (2) the issuing judge erroneously limited his review to the &quot;four corners&quot; of the affidavit in the application for the search warrant because defendant factually asserted that the evidence was derived from information obtained in an unlawful search and seizure, and (3) defendant was entitled to an evidentiary hearing to determine whether the information relied upon to establish probable cause was illegally obtained.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Pursuant to a search and seizure warrant that was based on a detective's affidavit, the police seized over 100 grams of heroin from defendant's residence. After his motion to suppress the evidence was denied, defendant was convicted of possessing heroin with intent to distribute. The lower court affirmed defendant's conviction. The court reversed and remanded. It held that if any conversation of defendant or any conversation overheard upon his premises, whether he was present and participating in it or not, was subjected to a &quot;search and seizure&quot; by the use of any wiretap or eavesdropping device in violation of his rights under the Fourth Amendment, any information garnered as &quot;fruits&quot; of such primary illegality and &quot;come upon&quot; by the &quot;exploitation&quot; of that illegality could not be used as derivative evidence for an application for a search and seizure warrant. To hold otherwise would have permitted the prosecution to use knowledge acquired in violation of the Fourth Amendment and gain by its own wrong. Thus, defendant was entitled to an evidentiary hearing on the motion to suppress in order to determine whether or not the facts to which the affidavit was made were tainted.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner tenant sought review of a judgment from the Circuit Court for Prince George's County (Maryland), which denied his request for a declaratory judgment that Md. Code Ann., Real Prop. &sect; 8-402(b) (1974), was in violation of both U.S. Const. amend. VII and Md. Const. art. XV, &sect; 6, because it failed to provide for a jury trial in an action by a landlord to recover possession of property. Petitioner also sought an injunction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After respondent landlord was granted possession of the premises from petitioner tenant, petitioner brought a declaratory judgment action challenging the constitutionality of Md. Code Ann., Real Prop. &sect; 8-402(b) (1974), the statutory basis of the possession action. The issue was whether there was a right to a jury trial in an action by a landlord to recover possession from a tenant holding over after the expiration of the lease. Petitioner's request for declaratory judgment was denied, and the court affirmed on appeal. In the possession action, neither party sought money damages or requested a jury. The Seventh Amendment to the U.S. Constitution provided that in suits at common law, where the value in controversy exceeded 20 dollars, the right of trial by jury was preserved, and no fact tried by a jury should be otherwise reexamined in any court of the United States, than according to the rules of the common law. However, the Supreme Court of the United States had consistently held that the Seventh Amendment was not incorporated into the Fourteenth Amendment, and consequently was not applicable to state court proceedings. In addition, petitioner waived any right to a jury.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed a judgment denying petitioner tenant's request for a declaratory judgment that a statute was in violation of state and federal constitutions because it failed to provide for a jury trial in an action by a landlord to recover possession of property.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The retailers contended the ordinance violated due process as it imposed a mode of doing business which bore no substantial relation to the reduction of liter, was vague, and denied the retailers equal protection of the laws and violated the Commerce Clause. The retailers also claimed that the city was not authorized to enact the ordinance and that the state legislature had preempted the matter of deposits requirements. The court disagreed and affirmed, finding that the retailers failed to prove the ordinance bore no real and substantial relation to the public health, morals, safety, and welfare of the citizens of the city; thus, the ordinance was not arbitrary, and there was no denial of due process. The court held the definition of soft drink was not vague as it gave a person of ordinary intelligence fair notice, and therefore, the ordinance, a criminal statute, was not void for vagueness. The court found the ordinance did not create an artificial and arbitrary classification of soft drink and malt beverage containers, the ordinance did not place an unconstitutional burden on interstate commerce, and the city had the power to have enact the ordinance.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The department argued that the extensive and nullifying judicial de novo review, allowed under the wetlands statute, Md. Code Ann., Nat. Res. &sect; 9-308(b), was unconstitutional because it allowed the judicial branch to usurp the province of the administrative agency. The court held that the decisions of the department whether the land came within the statutory wetlands designation and whether it had to remain in its then existing natural state were decisions made pursuant to the state's police power within the guidelines and standards prescribed by the legislature. On appeal, a circuit court was constitutionally limited to an assessment of whether that determination was based on evidence sufficiently substantial so that the permit denial was not arbitrary and capricious. Md. Code Ann., Nat. Res. &sect; 9-308(b), which provided for a de novo trial free of the Administrative Procedure Act, with the right of electing to have a jury trial and with no right of removal, was void as unconstitutional. The circuit court was not allowed to empanel a jury and instruct it to convert itself into an administrative body with the authority to grant or deny the permit and to apply the wetlands statute.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner Board of County Commissioners sought review of an order from the Court of Special Appeals of Maryland, which reversed the trial court's order that denied respondent firefighter benefits and ruled that the Workmen's Compensation Act (Act), Md. Ann. Code art. 101, &sect; 64(A) (1957; Cum. Supp. 1971), was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The firefighter filed with the commission a claim for compensation as a consequence of a heart attack he sustained. The commission denied his claim. On appeal, the trial court affirmed the commission's order, but held that the Act was unconstitutional. The trial court's finding was based on the variance between the title of the Act, which referred to a presumption of compensable occupational disease, and the body of the Act which, without referring to &quot;occupational disease&quot; made injuries caused by various diseases presumptively &quot;compensable.&quot; On review, the court of special appeals reversed the trial court's order for consideration as for an occupational disease. On certiorari, the court affirmed the court of special appeals. The court held that there was no repugnancy between the title and body of the act. The body of the act provided that certain conditions were compensable under art 101. The title of the Act in no way conflicted with that purpose. The title simply made clear that the Act should have been interpreted as granting such benefits in accordance with the provisions of that article as they related to occupational diseases.</SPAN></P>

Ann. Code art. 26A, &sect;1 et seq., for injuries suffered when he was shot in the neck and back of his head during a robbery conducted while he was operating his taxi. After the Board disallowed the claim, the cabdriver sought judicial review and the Board's decision was vacated. The Board appealed, arguing that under Md. Ann. Code art. 26A, &sect;10(a) the decision had not been subject to judicial review. The court held that (1) the status of the cabdriver as an independent contractor rather than as an employee had not been disputed and had in fact been supported by evidence including statements from the cab company from which he rented his taxi, (2) Md. Ann. Code art. 26A, &sect;10(a) did not prohibit judicial review of improper exercises of administrative powers, (3) the petition for review had asserted arbitrary, illegal, capricious, and unreasonable action by the Board, making the matter ripe for judicial review, and (4) a slight error in captioning the application for review did not prevent review.</SPAN></P>

The court found that to the extent that the commission was reasonably convinced of the existence of problems of inflation, attrition, and regulatory lag, it could have attempted to meet them in various ways.

They alleged damages as county taxpayers and as real property owners.

The court granted certiorari to consider the question of standing. The court affirmed in part and reversed in part. The court held that the allegations of standing on the part of individuals were sufficient to withstand a demurrer, and the better-reasoned view supported them on the question of standing. However, the court found that the rule was that an organization lacked standing to sue where it has no property interest of its own, separate and distinct from that of its individual members, that was affected by any of the alleged acts. The court found that the bill of complaint included no allegations remotely suggesting that organizations possessed such separate interests, thus they lacked the necessary standing to maintain the action.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioners, a state bar association and a county bar association, filed separate petitions with the court charging respondent attorney with the commission of an act of professional misconduct, deceit, a crime involving moral turpitude, and conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice. A three-judge panel of the court recommended the attorney's disbarment. However, the attorney filed exceptions to the panel's recommendation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The bar associations alleged that the attorney's misconduct constituted a violation of Md. Code Prof. Resp. DR 1-102(A)(1)-(6), Canon 1, and that the attorney was convicted by a federal court of violating 18 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1621, regarding perjury before a federal grand jury. On the other hand, the attorney argued that his conviction was not a &quot;final judgment&quot; within the meaning of former Md. R. BV4(f)(1) because of a pending motion for a new trial based on newly discovered evidence and because the failure to hold a hearing on the &quot;ultimate fact,&quot; regarding whether perjury was indeed committed, rendered the hearing held meaningless. On consideration of the panel's recommendation, the court agreed to disbar the attorney. Thus, the court ordered the attorney's name stricken from the rolls of those authorized to practice law in Maryland. In reaching its conclusion, the court noted that the attorney's motion for a new trial had been withdrawn in open court with prejudice and that the attorney had been convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude. Therefore, the attorney's conduct plainly violated the disciplinary rules.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On appeal the arrestee argued that the trial court was empowered to order expungement or limit the dissemination of his criminal arrest record because there was no evidence of any kind that the arrestee committed any criminal offense.

The trial court granted the demurrer because it determined that it did not have subject matter jurisdiction to order the expungement of the records. The court vacated the order and held that the trial court mistakenly determined that it did not have subject matter jurisdiction. The court determined that the trial court, as an equity court, had the power to adjudicate the merits of the arrestee's petition, or grant any injunctive or other equitable relief requested, even absent specific legislative authorization.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Following the board's refusal to grant the owner a license to show the film, the owner sought review. The trial court entered an injunction, which restrained the owner from showing the film. The court ultimately dismissed the owner's appeal of the injunction. In the meantime, the trial court reviewed the evidence and issued a final order declaring that the film was obscene. On appeal, the court rejected the owner's contention that the trial court was deprived of jurisdiction to issue the final order by the injunction's appeal. The state had an interest in an expeditious decision, and an appeal of an interlocutory order did not deprive the trial court of jurisdiction. Upon review of the film, the court affirmed the categorization of it as obscene, hard-core pornography under the Miller test. The court reviewed the history of the obscenity classification and characterized the film as concentrating on genitalia and held that the brief satire served only as an introduction to sexually explicit scenes. The application of the Miller test did not violate the separation of powers under Md. Const. Decl. Rts. art. 8 because it was the judiciary's duty to construe legislation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The state required a private corporation to construct pollution control facilities in conjunction with the corporation's plan to increase production and available job opportunities.

The taxpayers objected to the issuance of the bonds. On appeal, the court confirmed the trial court's finding that the bonds were valid. The court determined that: (1) the pollution control facilities served a public purpose; (2) the funding of that portion of the project did not increase production or revenues for the corporation; (3) the parties and facilities met the definitions contained in Md.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The retailer operated a store that sold a wide range of general merchandise, including lumber, plant materials, nursery-related items, appliances, and hardware. After it was discovered that the retailer's store was open for business on Sundays, the State's attorney filed a petition for injunctive relief to prohibit the retailer form operating its store on Sundays, claiming that the retailer was in violation of the Sunday closing law. The retailer alleged that its store was entitled to an exemption from the Sunday closing law, which was extended to nurseries, because the retailer sold plants and other nursery-related items. The circuit court ruled in favor of the State's attorney and ordered the retailer to cease from operating its store on Sunday, finding that the retailer was not a nursery. The retailer appealed, and the special court of appeals affirmed. On certiorari to the court, the court affirmed and ruled that the retailer was not entitled to an exemption form the Sunday closing law where its principal business was not that of a nursery because the retailer sold a wide range of general merchandise as well as plants and other nursery-related items.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiffs, taxpayer and Maryland Sports Complex Authority, appealed from a judgment of the Circuit Court of Baltimore City (Maryland), which sustained a demurrer by intervening defendants and denied plaintiffs' request for injunctive relief in plaintiffs' action to enjoin defendant members of the Board of Supervisors of Elections of Baltimore City from submitting to voters a proposed amendment to the city charter.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiffs sought to enjoin defendants from submitting to voters a proposed amendment to the city charter, arguing that the amendment would prohibit the building of a sports stadium using public funds and would be in conflict with Md.

The court affirmed the denial of the injunction. The court applied the doctrine that if it was possible to construe the charter provision so as to avoid conflict with the United States Constitution or any public general law the court should do so. The court held that the effect of the amendment to the charter was only to prohibit construction in the city of such a stadium with funds of the city. Thus, the amendment was valid and operative.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellants filed a bill of complaint for declaratory and injunctive relief against appellees arising out of the rezoning of annexed land. Upon remand after an appeal on preliminary issues, the parties filed motions for summary judgment. The trial court granted appellees' motion for summary judgment ruling that appellees' rezoning of the annexed land complied with 1971 Md. Laws ch. 116. On appeal, the court reversed the decision. The court held that the use permitted by the city's zoning classification was substantially different from the uses specified by any of the three zones in the county's master plans, which all provided for single family dwellings, due to the town houses and garden apartments to be developed under the planned residential unit development. The city's new zoning ordinance for the annexed land had to be compared to the master plans in effect prior to the annexation. Ch. 116 did not violate Md. Const. Decl. Rts. art. 23 because it was not so vague and indefinite as to be no standard at all. Ch. 116 did not violate the Due Process Clause because it was rationally related to a legitimate state objective and was not arbitrary or unreasonable.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant entered guilty pleas to several charges, including use of a handgun in the commission of a felony.

The court ordered that the petition should be held in abeyance pending the state's application to the trial court for an order nullifying the suspension of three years of the sentence. The trial court denied the state's motion to correct the sentence and the state's petition for mandamus. Defendant was allowed to intervene. On appeal, the court dismissed the state's petition for a writ and remanded the case to the circuit court for imposition of a proper sentence. The court held that if there was a conflict between Md.

A juvenile who committed an offense in Montgomery County was subject to that county's juvenile law. A juvenile who committed an offense in Baltimore City or in any county other than Montgomery County was subject to the public general law. The court reversed the indictment dismissals in the first two cases, ruling one juvenile was not denied equal protection under the Fourteenth Amendment because pursuant to Md.

The court reversed, concluding that the circuit court was without jurisdiction, under Md. Const. art. III, &sect; 5, when it ruled that the legislative districting plan was unconstitutional. The court overruled its opinion in Secretary of State v.

A substantial property right was involved. Since there was no compensation paid by the bureau for this property taking, the bureau was required to continue the mining company's permit.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The bureau challenged the district court's decision that held that the bureau could not stop the mining company from continuing to strip mine certain property in which the holding company had mineral and mining rights. The land was within a state forest. On appeal, the court remanded the case for further proceedings. The court was faced with the question of whether a state law banning strip mining on state-owned lands was a lawful exercise of the police power or a taking of private property for public purposes, requiring payment of just compensation to the owners of the mineral rights. The court held that the statutory prohibition of strip mining constituted a reasonable regulation under the state's police power to protect the environment and to preserve state-owned land for public use. The prohibition of strip mining was reasonably necessary to accomplish the legislative purpose. The case was remanded to determine whether the strip mining ban was unduly oppressive to the mining company or the holding company.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After it computed a member's food and beverage bill, and added the state sales tax to the bill, the country club added an additional 15 per cent of the menu price and the sales tax as a mandatory service or gratuity charge. The Comptroller contended that the charge was a part of the purchase price, as defined by the Maryland Retail Sales Tax Act, Md. Ann. Code art. 81, &sect; 324 et seq. (1969 Repl. Vol.). The country club argued that the service charge should not be taxed because it received no benefit from its imposition or collection. In affirming the tax court, the court held that the mandatory 15 per cent service charge was part of the &quot;price&quot; of the country club's retail sales of food and beverages and as such was subject to the sales tax. The court also held that the imposition of the sales tax on the mandatory charge did not violate equal protection principles even though a member's voluntary tip to a waiter was not taxable. The court stated that there was a constitutionally reasonable distinction for sales tax purposes between voluntary and mandatory gratuities.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On appeal, the court held the statute to be constitutional. Although the drug stores sold prescription drugs, this comprised less than half of their business. Thus, they were not entitled to the exemption for drug stores whose basic business was the sale of drugs and related items. While the statute was a criminal statute, the hardware store had standing, under the Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act, Md. Ann. Code, art. 31A, &sect; 6, to seek an injunction to compel compliance. The court found no abuse of discretion in denying the drug stores' demurrer for failing to join necessary parties. There was no information on other drug stores, listed in the phone book but not joined, as to whether these stores had more than 6 employees per shift, or if they were open on Sundays. It also found no abuse in discretion in failing to grant the drug stores' eleventh hour request for a continuance. Finally, the court held the trial court properly permitted the hardware store to amend its complaint to correct the corporate name of one of the drug store chains. However, the court found that the drug stores should have been permitted to remain open to sell the exempt drugs and related items.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court modified the decree to permit the drug stores to sell drugs and related items, and then affirmed the decision as modified.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A promissory note was executed by a corporation in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania that authorized the confession and entry of judgment against the maker in favor of the bank at any time after it became due. The endorsers signed the note and also expressly guaranteed payment and submitted to the authorization for confession of judgment. After a default by the maker and an unsuccessful demand for payment upon the endorsers, the bank filed an action. The endorsers attacked the constitutionality of Maryland Rule 645 on grounds that it violated the Due Process Clause of U.S. Const. amend. XIV because it permitted attachment and execution of property before notice. The court held that Rule 645 was facially constitutional because the debtors were given every opportunity after judgment to present any defenses that they may have had and were merely required to meet a standard that was a minimal obstacle. The court held that Rule 645 was constitutional as applied. The court held that a waiver hearing prior to entry of a confessed judgment was not required and, if one was required thereafter, it was clearly available at the hearing on the endorsers' motion to vacate, and no more was needed.</SPAN></P>

Const. Decl. Rts. art. 15 and U.S. Const. amend. XIV by instituting a new standard of valuation based on &quot;selling price&quot; for equipment manufactured and leased by appellee manufacturers, while applying the established standard based on cost to the taxpayer for other personal property.</SPAN></P>

The tax court first found that the manufacturers and non-manufacturers could not be taxed at different rates and then found that the manufacturers could not be taxed based on the sales price. The court remanded without affirmance or reversal, finding that (1) the leased property was not &quot;stock in business&quot; per Md. Ann.

The court remanded for a determination of whether the department's policy of assessing the property of the &quot;manufacturer-lessors&quot; at its full cash value was, or was not, applied to taxable tangible personal property manufactured but not leased by its owner.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellees, Montgomery County (Maryland), members of the Montgomery City Council (Maryland), and a state park commission, brought an action for declaratory judgment and injunctive relief against appellants, City of Gaithersburg (Maryland) and property owners, regarding the annexation and rezoning of the owners' land. The Circuit Court for Montgomery County (Maryland) entered a decree for appellees. Appellants sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After the effective date of 1971 Md. Laws 116, the City annexed a parcel that included the owners' land. 1971 Md.

Code art. 23A, &sect; 9(c) (1973) to provide that no municipality annexing land could, within a five-year period, rezone the land so as to permit a use substantially different from that specified in the county's master plan. The City and the owners defended appellees' action on the sold ground that 1971 Md. Laws 116 violated Md. Const. art. XI-E. The circuit court upheld the constitutionality of the statute and declared the rezoning to be null and void. On appeal, appellants contended, among other things, that 1971 Md. Laws 116 violated Md. Const. art. XI-E, &sect; 1, which required that legislation must apply alike to all municipalities in a class. The court held that, given the plain meaning of 1971 Md. Laws 116 and its legislative history, 1971 Md. Laws 116 did not violate Md. Const. art. XI-E, &sect; 1 because its enactment was a limitation upon the home rule powers of all municipalities subject to Md. Const. art.

The court adopted the recommendations and ordered the judge censured, holding that based on our independent review of the record, the finding that the judge's actions created the appearance of impropriety was supported by clear and convincing evidence. The court held that when the judge personally and publicly assumed a command responsibility in the furtherance of the real estate project, he embarked on a course likely to collide with the prohibition contained in the Maryland Code of Judicial Ethics.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant city and its historical commission sought to enjoin appellee county from demolishing a historical church and sought a declaration that the county was required to comply with the city's historic district ordinance. Following a hearing on the merits, the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County (Maryland) denied the city's request for an injunction, but ruled against the county on other issues. The parties cross-appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The county argued that the actions of the historical commission, which ruled prior to the trial court action, that the county could not demolish the church to build a parking facility, had deprived the county of its property without due process of law and that the property was taken for public use without just compensation. The court held that the county was subject to the jurisdiction of the historical commission. In so holding, the court found that 1) the chancellor properly held that the trial court properly ruled that the city code, which provided an automatic approval of the county's demolition application if no decision was reached within 45 days, did not apply because the time for the commission action was extended by mutual agreement; 2) the trial court erred in ruling that the county was not subject to the commission's jurisdiction; 3) the county failed to establish how it intended to develop the disputed site in connection with its courthouse; 4) the legislature intended that historic zoning to be different from traditional zoning; and 5) the denial of the county's demolition application did not constitute a &quot;taking&quot; of the county's property.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed and remanded the trial court's ruling and remanded the case to the trial court for the entry of a decree declaring that the county was subject to the application of the city's historic district ordinance, and a permanent injunction prohibiting the county from demolishing the church.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The taxpayers sought refunds of personal property taxes paid as a result of erroneous assessments. The taxpayers alleged that appellants lacked standing to bring the action. The court held that, although the political subdivisions lacked standing to challenge the constitutionality of Md. Ann. Code art. 81, &sect; 39A(1973), the individual public officials had standing. Appellants alleged that the act violated the United States Constitution and the Maryland Constitution. The court held that the statute was not a special law as contemplated by Md. Const. art. III, &sect; 33 that prohibited special laws to refund money paid into the state treasury. The court held that Article 15 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights that requires uniformity in the assessment and taxation of land was inapplicable because Article 15 had nothing to do with refunds. The court held that the legislature had the power to grant an exemption retroactively. The court held that appellants had no vested right in taxes that were collected in error. Because state taxes refunds are matters of legislative grace, the statute was a proper exercise of the power of the General Assembly.</SPAN></P>

The department also appealed the trial court's order insofar as it modified the floodplain's boundaries.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On appeal, the company claimed error because the trial judge approved that portion of an order of the department that required no filling operations were to take place within the 50-year floodplain boundaries on the company's land without obtaining a permit from the department for such activities. The court found no error. The court did not agree that the company was being denied use of its property and that its property was being appropriated without compensation. To determine whether the plan as it affected the company's land was valid, it had to first exhaust its administrative remedies by making application for a permit, since upon a proper application a record would have been developed. With that record before it, a court would have been in a position to decide whether the department in applying that general statutory plan in the company's particular situation infringed upon its constitutional rights. At this point the court had no adequate record to make such a determination. On appeal, the department claimed the trial judge erred when he modified its order by changing the boundaries of the floodplain as determined by the department. The trial judge did not err in the change.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court found no error in either the approval of the decision requiring that no filling operations were to occur within the 50-year floodplain boundaries on the company's land without obtaining a permit from the department nor in the modification of the floodplain's boundaries.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff cosmetologists brought suit against defendant board of barber examiners (board) seeking declaratory and injunctive relief. The cosmetologists challenged the constitutionality of a Md. Ann. Code art. 43, &sect; 529, which permitted barbers to cut the hair of both men and women, but restricted cosmetologists to cutting the hair of women. The Circuit Court of Baltimore City (Maryland) entered a judgment in favor of the cosmetologists.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court concluded that there was no intrinsic physical difference between hair on a man's head and hair on a women's head. Therefore, the trial court struck down Md. Ann. Code art. 43, &sect; 529, as violative of the Fourteenth Amendment and article 56 of the Declaration of Rights. The court determined that the trial court properly determined that the statute could not be construed favorably to the cosmetologists without a resolution of the constitutional issues. The court found that this case did not involve discrimination based on sex under the Fourteenth Amendment or Article 56; therefore, the statute was not subject to strict scrutiny. The court determined that &sect; 529 was not rationally related to a legitimate state purpose. The cosmetologists also contended that &sect; 529 deprived them of a legal occupation without due process of law. The board contended that &sect; 529 was a reasonable exercise of police power, and thus did not result in a denial of due process. However, the court determined that the statute was unreasonable and arbitrary and held that it did deprive the cosmetologists of due process of law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the trial court's judgment in favor of the cosmetologists, which determined that a state statute limiting a cosmetologists work to women clients only was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

The board denied the store's application and the trial court affirmed.

The court held a zoning ordinance that provided special exceptions could only be granted upon a showing that a public need existed for the proposed use was not unconstitutional where the ordinance was not designed to prevent competition. The court determined that there was a reasonable basis for the denial of the store's application where the evidence indicated there were 5 filing stations nearby and that there were 20 other filing stations within a distance of 3.8 miles of the proposed site of the gas station. The court found there were two discount gas operations already in existence in the marketing area and that the need for a discount operation was already being provided for. The court concluded that the case did not become moot by the store erecting a building on the proposed site because the store could have still pursued obtaining a permit.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant landlords sought a declaratory decree that a bill enacted by appellee county council was void. The lower court concluded that various provisions of the bill were in conflict with the public general laws of the state. On appeal by both parties, the court vacated the decree and remanded for a new decree. A provision against retaliatory eviction was unlawful because the public general laws granted a landlord a legal right to evict, and appellee could not require him to agree not to do so. A provision requiring two-year terms for leases and a provision as to confession of judgment were not in conflict with public general laws. Oral leases were permitted by the public general law and could not be prohibited by appellee. Because of the complete lack of any legislative safeguards or standards, the grant of unlimited discretion to a county administrative body to fix civil penalties in any amount up to $ 1,000 was illegal. All other remedial powers vested in this body by the ordinance were legal and constitutional. An amended section making the right to a hearing absolute and not discretionary fully comported with procedural due process requirements.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The corporations brought a constitutional challenge to &sect; 266A(c)(4)(iv), which prohibited the corporations from advertising prescription drug prices or price discounts on such drugs. The trial court declared the statute unconstitutional under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. On appeal the board argued that the statute was a reasonable exercise of the state's police power. The court affirmed, holding that: (1) the statute could not be constitutionally sanctioned as an exercise of the state's police power because it prohibited advertising of consumer goods sold within the scope of the pharmacist's retail activity and it bore no relation to the wholly permissible regulation of professional services affecting the public health and welfare and (2) the statute was an unconstitutional exercise of the police power because it was in the best interest of the public to be informed of prescription drug prices to enable purchasing at the lowest available prices and there was no substantial relationship between the objectives attributed to the statute and the statute.</SPAN></P>

The trial court found that there was no sufficient evidence to overcome the presumption of the ordinance's constitutionality. Affirming, the court held that the construction company failed to meet its burden of proof that the ordinance was unconstitutional under the Equal Protection Clause. The construction company's bald assertion, without more detail, that there were similar properties in the city not affected by the ordinance simply was not sufficient to overcome the presumption of constitutionality.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Department denied the newspaper's request for an exemption of its entire newsprint because is was a raw material used in manufacturing. The tax court affirmed the assessments, but allowed 11 days' of newsprint as an exemption. On appeal, the newspaper based its claim on long-standing case law that held that the printing of newspapers was not &quot;manufacturing&quot; for tax purposes. Also, the Department cross-appealed, contending that the entire inventory of newsprint was taxable. The court held that, 1) the newspaper's mechanical operations constituted manufacturing; 2) its tools and machinery used in the manufacturing were exempt under Baltimore, Md., Code art. 28, &sect; 83(a) (1966); and its inventory of raw materials was also exempt. The court noted that although tax-exemption statutes were strictly construed, and prior case law exempted the industry altogether, much had changed in both the newspaper business and the local laws.

Appellants successfully contended at trial that the entire application of Prince George's County, Md., Code Pub. Loc. Laws &sect; 32-17 was limited by subsection (e) to volunteer fire companies and rescue squads so that the provisions of subsection (c) in regard to assets did not apply to them. The court stated that by limiting the application of the statute to volunteer fire companies and rescue squads organized after the effective date of the statute, it was unnecessary for the trial court to decide the constitutional issues inevitably arising if the statute was construed in the manner urged by the County. The court stated that it was the legislative intent of &sect; 32-17 to apply subsections (a), (b), (c) and (d) to the volunteer fire companies and rescue squads existing when the Act became effective; therefore, the constitutional issues raised had to be decided.</SPAN></P>

In its ruling, the court found that the notice that the county issued informed the citizenry that a public hearing would be held in connection with the proposed plan. That was notice that was calculated to inform any interested citizens of the need to attend the hearing if they desired to inform themselves or to express their views concerning the plan. The evidence showed that those present at the hearing were permitted the opportunity and sufficient time to express their general opposition to the plan's adoption.

On appeal, the court sought to determine whether amendments to the county zoning ordinance were properly adopted and, if not, whether their invalidity vitiated the entire zoning ordinance. The court answered both questions in the negative. There was no contention that the charter provision was anything other than mandatory if the amendments were found to have been amendments &quot;of substance.&quot; It was obvious that council and executive regarded the amendments as severable from the main body of the ordinance. Otherwise, the executive would not have vetoed some of the amendments and the council would not have sustained the veto to part, but not all, of those amendments. Had there been no amendments, the ordinance would have been complete as a vehicle for determining the permitted land uses in the district. The court determined that the invalid provisions of the ordinance could have been eliminated and the legislative intention easily carried out. Accordingly, the chancellor erred in not determining that the ordinance was severable.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Respondent state sought review of an order of the Circuit Court for Montgomery County (Maryland), which granted petitioner inmates' application for writs of habeas corpus requiring their release from respondent mental institution to correctional facilities because the institution failed to timely evaluate the inmates and file reports as required by Md. Ann. Code art. 31B, &sect; 7(a).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The inmates, who had been convicted of various crimes, were sent to the mental institution for evaluation as defective delinquents. Staff at the mental institution was unable to evaluate the inmates because the inmates refused to cooperate. In the first action, the inmates sought their release to correctional facilities because the mental institution failed to evaluate them and make reports to the court within six months, as required by art. 31B, &sect; 7(a). In a second case, the state sought and was granted a declaratory judgment, that the reporting provision of the statute was not mandatory where the inmates refused to cooperate. On appeal, the court reversed the judgment that granted the inmates' writs of habeas corpus and affirmed the judgment that declared the reporting provision directory. The court reasoned that, although the provision appeared to be mandatory, it was directory in cases where the inmate refused to cooperate since making it mandatory would have resulted in the release of uncooperative inmates due to delays that they had caused. The court noted that there was no penalty for the mental institution's failure to timely file reports under the statute.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the judgment that granted the inmates' petitions for writs of habeas corpus that required their release from the mental institution. The court affirmed the judgment that declared that the statutory requirement that the mental institution make an evaluation of the inmates and file a report with the court within six months was directory where the inmates failed to cooperate with evaluation.</SPAN></P>

The trial court ordered the audit. On review, the court modified the order of the trial court and affirmed the order as modified. The court held that the attorney's constitutional right against compulsory self-incrimination would not be violated by causing his real estate accounts to be subjected to audit as provided in the statute. The court modified the trial court's order, however, to limit the audit to the time period following November 2, 1970. Moreover, the court modified the trial court's order to limit the audit, in its initial phase, to the real estate transactions in question. The court held that, if warranted, the scope of the audit could be expanded to include other real estate transactions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The resident owned and lived in two houses, one in Baltimore City and one in Queen Anne's County. The resident was domiciled in Baltimore City.

The court affirmed and held that contrary to the resident's claim, county elections were not excluded from the scope of Md. Ann. Code art. 33, &sect; 1-1(a)(6) (1971) because they were clearly intended to be included within the statutes dealing with elections; thus the resident was granted his right by being able to vote in one election. The court also held that the resident was not denied any rights under U.S. Const. amend. 14, &sect; 1 because states were allowed to impose bona fide vote qualification, and restricting voters to those who held domicile in the locality was within the state's power.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant county challenged a decision of the Circuit Court for Prince George's County (Maryland), holding that appellee Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning Commission (commission) had standing to sue, that there were justiciable issues ripe for declaratory decree, and that the Regional District Act (Act), Md. Laws ch. 780 (1959), was a public general law and not subject to amendment or superceding by county charter.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The General Assembly created the commission and it was given the duties to administer certain park development, planing, and zoning functions within portions of two counties, the Maryland-Washington Metropolitan District. Later laws created the Maryland-Washington Regional District, which included the first district along with other areas. The commission's park and planning functions were separated, repealed, and then consolidated in the Act. On appeal, the court ruled that the commission had standing to maintain the suit for declaratory relief under &sect; 11 of the Act. Declaratory relief was proper when two agencies were in dispute. There were a number of issues that were ripe for declaratory relief. There were issues over the levying of taxes, the propriety of legislative activities on behalf of the committee, the transfer of employees between the parties, and the commission's power to acquire land, to name a few. The court also found that the Act was a public general law because it concerned several geographic subdivisions of the state and the titles indicated that they were enacted as bi-county acts. Thus, the county charter could not amend or supercede the Act.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed that the commission had standing to sue, that there were ripe issues to be decided by declaratory decree, and that the Act was not a public local law, but rather a public general law.</SPAN></P>

The commission determined that the judges had engaged in conduct prejudicial to the proper administration of justice and recommended their censure. Both judges filed motions to dismiss. The court accepted the commission's findings of fact and denied the judges' motions to dismiss. The court held that the commission's findings were supported by clear and convincing evidence and that the aim of the commission's proceedings was the maintenance of the honor and dignity of the judiciary and the proper administration of justice rather than punishment.

The municipality recommended denial of the application. The Council denied the application for want of a two-thirds majority vote as required by 1969 Md. Laws 278. Upon judicial review, the trial court declared 1969 Md. Laws 278 unconstitutional for the reason that it delegated zoning power to municipalities without providing necessary standards. The trial court ordered the Council to approve the application. Upon further review, the court reversed the trial court's order, holding that 1969 Md. Laws 278 was not unconstitutional.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant sought review of a decision of the Baltimore City Court (Maryland), which ordered the forfeiture of a monetary amount found in close proximity to controlled dangerous substances incident to an execution of a valid search warrant. Defendant pled guilty and was convicted of possession of controlled dangerous substances. After the conviction defendant filed a petition for the return of the seized funds.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Pursuant to a valid search warrant, police officers discovered a brown paper bag in defendant's bedroom. The bag contained four bags of heroin, a bottle of marijuana, and a bank money bag containing $ 1,862.10 in cash. Defendant sought to reclaim the money. The money was to be used to pay defendant's attorney. Defendant pled guilty and was convicted of possession of controlled dangerous substances. The trial court ordered that the money be forfeited to the State. On appeal, the court affirmed and rejected defendant's argument that the forfeiture statute,&nbsp;Md. Ann. Code art. 27, &sect; 297, violated his due process rights and his right to equal protection. The court also rejected defendant's argument that there was no evidence that the money was found in the proximity of the drugs. The court found that the record specifically stated that the money was found in the same bag as the drugs. The court found that the fact that the State failed to institute the forfeiture proceeding until five months after the conviction did not violate any requirement of Md. Ann. Code art. 27, &sect; 297.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the forfeiture order. The court denied the State's motion to dismiss. The court ordered that defendant pay the costs.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The local businesses challenged the ordinance claiming that it in no way promoted the public health, safety, security, or morals of the community, and was not a proper exercise of the city's police power. The city maintained that the ordinance was a valid use of police power under its charter. The trial court found that the ordinance was based upon aesthetic considerations alone, which was an invalid use of the city's police power. Upon review, the court affirmed. It found that the sole purpose of the ordinance was to achieve an aesthetically pleasing result with no thought to enhancing public welfare. Thus, it was invalid. The court observed that if the ordinance had attempted to preserve or protect something aesthetically pleasing, that might have been a valid use of the city's police power. Further, the court found that because the ordinance was an amendment to a zoning law, it was enacted without complying with the substantive and procedural requirements of the Zoning Enabling Act, Md. Code art. 66B (1957). The city derived its zoning power from the act, and not its charter.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The beauty schools protested the board's admonishment to lower their clinic prices in accordance with Md. Ann.

The trial court declared that the statute was constitutional and referred the issue of a price schedule to the board for promulgation of rules and regulations. On appeal, the court held that (1) the beauty schools could not argue that genuine disputes of material facts existed because at the trial level, they stipulated that no such issues existed, (2) the state possessed the police power to protect and promote the public health and safety of its citizenry and the statutory limitation on charges by the beauty schools restricted them to the primary function for which they were licensed, which was the training of students, (3) &sect; 537(a) had a substantial direct relationship with the health, safety, and welfare of the public and did not violate equal protection, and (4) the fact that the board had historically chosen not to enforce the statute did not subject the state to the application of either equitable estoppel or laches.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Subsequent to a decree of the circuit court declaring that the MTA was required to pay the tolls charged by the Revenue Authority for the use by the MTA buses of two bridges owned by the Revenue Authority, the MTA appealed arguing that it was performing a governmental function and a public purpose and should have been included within the ambit of the exemption provided by &sect; 502 of the Trust Indenture. The Trust Indenture was entered into pursuant to the authority of the Revenue Authority. In the alternative the MTA maintained that Md. Code art. 64B exempted it from the payment of the tolls. Affirming the circuit court's judgment, the court held that the exemption under the Trust Indenture was not a broad governmental exemption, but rather an exemption limited to specific Baltimore County officials and official vehicles, and official vehicles of the State Police of Maryland. With respect to art. 64B, the court determined that its title, which was relevant to ascertainment of its intent and purpose, was for a &quot;tax exemption,&quot; and tolls were clearly neither taxes nor charges in the nature of taxes.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant, the Administrator of the Motor Vehicles Administration, challenged an order of the Circuit Court for Carroll County (Maryland), which entered an injunction in favor of appellees, automobile wreckers. The trial court held that Md. Ann. Code art. 66 1/2, &sect; 5-203(d) (Repl. Vol. 1970) was unconstitutional on the ground that it violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The wreckers brought an action at law for declaratory judgment and injunctive relief on the ground that an assessment was unconstitutionally imposed upon wreckers and not upon scrap processors. The Administrator argued that a $ 5.00 assessment imposed by Md. Ann. Code art. 66 1/2, &sect; 5-203(d) (Repl. Vol. 1970), statute did not violate the Equal Protection Clause. Specifically, he claimed that the distinction made between wreckers and scrap processors had a reasonable relation to the legislative purpose underlying the statute. First the court dismissed the wrecker's cross-appeal because they were deemed the prevailing party in the lower proceedings. Further, the court held that the wreckers failed in their burden of proving that the statute violated a constitutional right. The court determined that the differences in classification and treatment was related to reducing the extensive storage of old automobile hulks, which in turn, reduced ecological damage.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the judgment of the trial court and entered a judgment declaring the statute constitutional. The wreckers' cross-appeal was dismissed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The state's attorney filed petitions to enjoin three grocery chains from violating Md. Ann. Code art. 27, &sect; 534H (1957, 1971 Repl. Vol.), a &quot;Sunday Blue Law.&quot; The trial court enjoined the first chain from conducting business on Sunday with more than six employees at any given time in any store. The trial court dismissed the petitions against the other two chains. On appeal, the court vacated the trial court's orders and remanded for entry of decrees enjoining the chains from violating &sect; 534H. The court held that the small business exception in &sect; 534H(c)3 did not exempt from regulation any business that, on Sunday, operated with not more than six employees on any one shift at any one location. Nothing in &sect; 534H suggested that &quot;any one shift&quot; meant &quot;any one shift on Sunday.&quot; Only those businesses that regularly operated with not more than six employees on any shift could lawfully do business on Sunday in the county. None of the chains qualified for the small business exemption. Section 534H was sufficiently explicit to enable a person of ordinary intelligence to ascertain with a fair degree of precision what it prohibited and what conduct would render him liable to its penalties.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Two vehicles belonging to appellees were forfeited pursuant to the forfeiture statute,&nbsp;Md. Ann. Code art. 27, &sect; 297 (1971 Repl. Vol.). The purpose of the forfeiture statute was to deter the violations of narcotics laws through the use of a vehicle. Nonetheless, the trial court declared that &sect; 297 was unconstitutional and ordered the return of the vehicles to appellees. The trial court found that the rules laid down in &sect; 297 were hopelessly standardless because they did not provide any guidance as to the terms and conditions for the forfeiture of an automobile. The county filed an appeal. The court held that the lack of complicity by appellees, unless rescued by a stated exception, was not a defense and in fact made no difference whether there was any conviction of a crime related to the seized vehicles. The court agreed that the forfeiture statute, as provided in &sect; 297, was a harsh law. However, the court noted that it was within the legislature's power to decide that such harshness was required for deterring the proliferation of drugs. The court reversed the trial court's judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant property owners challenged a decision from the Circuit Court for Montgomery County (Maryland), which granted summary judgment to defendants, county, trustees of the county community college, and the state Board of Public Works (trustees), on the owners' request for an injunction against expenditure of funds for the expansion of a college campus.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The principal questions presented for review involved the alleged unconstitutionality of Md. Ann. Code art. 77A, &sect;&sect; 1-10 (1957, 1969 Repl. Vol.), particularly &sect; 1 (d), giving the trustees power to purchase, lease, condemn or in any other manner acquire real and personal property deemed necessary by them for the operation of the community college. The court held that the state could delegate its power of eminent domain to a school and that no guides or standards needed to be given when the power was so delegated. However, the delegation of power to the trustees was limited by &sect; 1(d) to land deemed necessary for the operation of the community college. The court concluded that the delegation of the power of eminent domain to the trustees was not unconstitutional because of a lack of sufficient guides and standards. The court found that the affidavits in support of the summary judgment motion set forth in substantial detail all of the opportunities to be heard which were given to the property owners, sufficient to satisfy their due process rights. It also found no constitutional violation in using public funds to purchase property from a church for the school's use.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the decision to grant summary judgment to the trustees because there was no constitutional violation in delegating the power of eminent domain to them, due process requirements had been met, and public funds could be used to purchase property that belonged to a church when needed for the college.</SPAN></P>

The court noted that the invalidity of the death sentences did not affect the legality of the underlying murder convictions. The court further held that the only sentence that could be imposed was for life imprisonment pursuant to Md. Code of 1957 art. 27, &sect; 413. As to the defendant convicted of rape, his sentence was also vacated, but the court noted that a defendant convicted of rape could be sentenced to life imprisonment under Md.

Laws 792; Code of Public Local Laws of Charles County (1969 Ed.), art. 9, &sect; 337A (Chapter 792) be declared to be unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The property owner was engaged in the business of dredging sand and gravel. It owned three parcels of land, the uses of which were at issue. All three parcels were located in Charles County, Maryland, and all three were adjoined to or surrounded by state wetlands. All three parcels were within the proscription of ch. 792. In issue was whether the legislature by enacting Public Local Law, ch. 792, might absolutely prohibit anyone, including the property owner from dredging, taking and carrying away sand and gravel from the tidal waters or marshlands of Charles County. The court held that ch. 792 was a legitimate exercise of the police power by the legislature to regulate and restrain a particular use, that would be inconsistent with or injurious to the rights of the public, of property within the control of the state. Such regulation and restraint was not an unconstitutional taking of private property for public use without just compensation, as prohibited by the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution and Article 23 of the Declaration of Rights of the Constitution of Maryland.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court affirmed the order and the state petitioned for a writ of certiorari, which the court granted. The court thereafter affirmed the order dismissing the indictment, holding that the wiretap orders were void because they failed to meet certain preconditions provided in Title III of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968, 18 U.S.C.S. &sect;&sect; 2510-20 (Act), which was designed to protect the accused's constitutional rights and thus, the evidence that arose from them had to be suppressed.

The landowners presented an expert appraiser and the appraiser contended that the market data approach was the proper method to value the land because he said a market existed, although he used no service station sales for comparable sales on the ground that he found none close enough. The court stated that the fact that one lot was assessed at one figure per square foot and another lot at a different figure per square foot did not show discrimination in the absence of a showing that the two lots were in fact so similar in all respects as to be identical in value. The court also stated that there had not been even the slightest intimation of lack of good faith upon the part of the taxing authorities. Therefore, it could not be said that there had been conscious, arbitrary discrimination against the landowners.

The residents argued that they were advised that the petitions designed to take a bill to referendum could not be signed until the Governor approved the bill. The Governor signed the bills just prior to a holiday weekend and the residents confronted with the virtually impossible task of obtaining 15,000 signatures within a period of only several days. They made no effort to do this. Instead, they turned to the lower court, seeking a declaration that the enactment of the bills was unconstitutional. The court affirmed the lower court's decision because petitions designed to take a bill to referendum may be circulated for signature at any time after a bill has been enacted by the General Assembly, without awaiting the Governor's signature.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The company contended that it had acquired a vested right to operate a concrete mixing plant that could not be defeated by the adoption of the amendment to the zoning ordinance, that the ordinance amendment was unconstitutional as applied to the company in that it was not general legislation but was aimed solely at the company and was applied retrospectively to the company, and that appellee city was estopped from taking any action denying the company the right to operate the concrete mixing plant. The court held that the company did not have a vested right to operate the concrete mixing plant because the company never obtained a building permit and never began construction of the plant. The court also held that the text to the zoning ordinance amendment was not unconstitutional as applied to the company because the amendment was not arbitrary, unreasonable, capricious, or discriminatory. Finally, the court held that the city was not estopped from taking action to deny the company the right to construct and operate the plant simply because the company relied on the former ordinance when initially purchasing the property.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellants' decedent was injured in an industrial accident, and on June 15, 1968, died as a result of his injuries. At that time, Md. Ann. Code art. 67, &sect; 4(a) (Act) mandated a two-year statute of limitation after the death of the deceased person. Subsequently, the Act was amended to permit commencement within three years and the statute was to be applied retroactively. The wrongful death action was filed against appellees more than two years, but less than three years, after decedent's death. In both cases, the suits were dismissed because of expiration of the statute of limitations. On appeal, the court affirmed the dismissals. The court found that the provision that purported to give retroactive effect to the Act was unconstitutional in that it violated the equal protection of laws provisions of the Fourteenth Amendment and the Declaration of Rights of the State of Maryland, art. 23. The court concluded that a statute placing burdens upon an individual or limiting his rights could be invalidated because of an arbitrary or unreasonable classification or discrimination, such as in the case at bar.</SPAN></P>

Under Prince George's County Charter, &sect;&sect; 818, 824 county projects could not be created or abandoned unless authorized by the county budget in accordance with a council vote. Similarly, under Prince George's County Charter, &sect; 814 items could not be added to the budget except where required by state law. It was unclear whether or not the planned airpark was so authorized. Also, under Md. Const. art. III, &sect; 40 private property could only be taken for public use. The determination of whether property was taken for private or public use was a judicial one and it was unclear in which category the airpark fell into.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The taxpayer was a Subchapter S corporation, as permitted by 26 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1371 et seq., with the consequence that its earnings were attributed to the corporation's stockholders, who paid the federal income tax thereon. In 1967, the legislature enacted Md. Ann. Code art. 81, &sect; 280(a), that brought capital gains and losses of a corporate taxpayer within the ambit of the Maryland income tax for the first time. Prior to that time, the taxpayer sold certain real estate and elected to realize the gain on an installment sale basis pursuant to 26 U.S.C.S. &sect; 453. The stockholders liquidated the corporation prior to receipt and reporting of the total purchase price. As an incident to the liquidation, the corporation recognized on its federal tax return, the remainder of the gain which had been deferred. On its Maryland return, the taxpayer deducted the entire amount of the capital gain on the theory that it was not subject to tax under Maryland law in effect in year in which sale occurred. The court affirmed, however, and held that when the installment payments or the gain became a part of the taxpayer's income, whether or not a federal tax was payable, they were taxable under Maryland law.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the lower court rulings that upheld the deficiency assessment imposed on the taxpayer by the comptroller.</SPAN></P>

The court held: (1) the parents failed to make out any case supporting their claim that the transfer of the students presented any personal danger in terms of traffic safety and personal inconvenience of any substantial nature; (2) busing was required to achieve racial balance; (3) where it was possible to identify a segregated school, a prima facie case in violation of the Equal Protection cause was shown; (4) it was constitutionally permissible to require busing where de jure desegregation existed, and it was permissible to recognize the achieving of racial balance for one of the reasons of redrawing school attendance lines; and (5) the school board properly bused the students thus transferred.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The taxpayer leased a taxicab on a daily basis from an association of taxicab owners.

The association derived its income exclusively from the amount it charged for gasoline. A sales tax was collected by the association from lessee-drivers in accordance with the provisions of the Retail Sales Tax Act (act), Md. Ann. Code art. 81, &sect;&sect; 324-371(1957, 1969 Repl.

No injunctive relief was granted in the previous action, and the property owner then filed a petition praying for the contractor to have been held in contempt because the payments previously ordered had not been made. The trial court found the contractor in contempt of the earlier decree but held that he had purged himself of it by subsequently making the payments due. The trial court therefore declined to order any injunctive relief prayed for, and the court affirmed. The court noted that the property owner was in essence seeking a forfeiture of the license agreement, and it observed that equity disfavored forfeitures. The court held that where the license agreement was silent as to the remedies available upon its breach, the property owner was not permitted to declare a forfeiture.</SPAN></P>

The court held that there was a justiciable controversy, and the taxpayer had to be told that he could not prevail by a declaration rather than a dismissal. The resolution was a measure adopted by the council of a temporary and administrative character. The council had the power to adopt it. The taxpayer did not allege or prove that the council and president violated their trust or did anything they ought not to have done.

The comptroller disagreed with the trustee's interpretation and assessed a tax. The court affirmed the judgment because it was clear that undistributed capital gains were subject to income tax under Md. Ann. Code art. 81, &sect; 313(b), regardless of whether &sect; 313(b) was read as an exclusion or an exemption.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The terms of the commissioners had expired but they continued as commissioners holding over until their successors were duly appointed. Prior to enactment of charter, the board of county commissioners governed the county. Under the charter, the county executive and county council governed. The commissioners argued that the removal of public officials was inherently an executive act and that the charter preserved the doctrine of separation of governmental powers. The court reversed. A proper and perceptive reading of the relevant constitutional and statutory provisions required a finding that the power of removal for cause of a county commissioner was in the hands of both the county executive and the county council. The court found no reason why &quot;the traditional American practice&quot; that the executive proposes and the legislature disposes should not be applicable under state law both to appointments to and removal from the office of commissioners from the county.</SPAN></P>

The children's mother and stepfather demurred to the first part of the petition, while the state officials demurred to the second. The trial court sustained both demurrers. The father sought review. The court reversed as to the mother and stepfather and affirmed as to the state officials. The court found that the father stated a claim for the legitimatization of the children under Md. Ann. Code art. 93, &sect; 1-208 (1969). Although that section dealt specifically with legitimization in the context of inheritance rights, the court held that there was no reason why it should not have applied generally to determine the rights of a putative father. Thus, the court held that under proper circumstances the father of illegitimate children was entitled to bring an action for a judicial declaration that the children were his pursuant to &sect; 1-208. The court further found that the father had pleaded matter that supported his claim, including his open and notorious acknowledgement of the children.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court affirmed the trial court's denial of the city's motion for summary judgment and remanded the case for the lower court to restate its order including a declaration of the parties' rights. The provision at issue, art. 82, was not intended to be based on the requirement that a municipality had to have control over a police force to have the ability to suppress riots. Failure to have control over a municipal police force did not excuse a municipality from endeavoring to suppress or contain riots or tumultuous actions by using other reasonable means available. It was for the trier of facts to determine what action the city could or should have taken, if any, in the exercise of &quot;reasonable diligence&quot; to prevent or contain the situation at issue.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The creditor loaned money to a business. The loan was secured by the real estate owned by the business.

The trial court held that the county obtained a valid and prior lien on the realty and ordered the county's entire tax claim paid out of the proceeds of the sale. The creditor sought review and the court affirmed. The court found that under Wicomico County, Md., Code Pub. Loc. Laws &sect; 248 (1959), all taxes due and owing upon both real and personal property constituted a prior lien against all of the taxpayer's real estate. Additionally, the court found that Md. Ann. Code art. 81, &sect; 202(b) (1969) provided that whenever a sale of either real or personal property was made, all sums due and in arrears for state taxes were to be paid first. The court held that the local law was not invalid because it did not conflict with the more general state provision.

Ann. Code art. 81, &sect;&sect; 279-283, 287-289, 323-323A.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Taxpayers challenged the lower court's affirmance of the denial of its request for a refund of capital gains taxes paid on installment sales. The taxpayers challenged the constitutionality of the newly enacted 1967 Maryland income tax law (Act), on the grounds of its retroactive application to payments they received under installment agreements and uniformity. The court affirmed the lower court judgment. The court found that the Act was not directed at payments received from installment sales before the date of its enactment, but that it was the taxpayers' election to defer recognition of their gain until the years 1967 and 1968, when the Act was fully operative, that brought their gains within its scope. The court rejected the taxpayers' uniformity argument that the unequal treatment of taxpayers who did and did not elect to report capital gains on an installment basis made the tax imposed by the Act arbitrary and discriminatory and thus unconstitutional. The court also held that because Maryland had an income tax at the time of the taxpayers' sales, they knew or should have known that the fact that capital gains were not taxed was no more than an exemption.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The State filed an action against defendants, a corporation and related parties, seeking injunctive relief pursuant to Md. Ann. Code art. 27, &sect; 418A (1971 Repl. Vol.) so as to prevent defendants from selling magazines alleged to be obscene. The Circuit Court for Prince George's County (Maryland) enjoined defendants from selling, distributing, or possessing with intent to sell or distribute 18 specified magazines. Defendants appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants' counsel informed a state's attorney that defendants intended to open an adult bookstore and furnished the state's attorney with samples of the books and magazines defendants intended to sell. At the hearing before the trial court, the state's attorney offered 21 of the samples as exhibits, declared them to be hard core pornography requiring no further proof, and rested his case. On review, the appellate court examined each of the 18 books and magazines that were the subject of the trial court's order. The court found that 13 of the samples, ten of which contained text and professional photographs of nude young adults with their genital areas conspicuously displayed, were not pornographic. As for the remaining 5 samples, the appellate court agreed with the trial court's conclusion that they constituted hard core pornography. Finally, the appellate court rejected defendants' challenge to the constitutionality of the statute under which the instant action was brought, holding that the statute did not provide for prior restraint of presumptively protected literary materials and that defendants were not entitled to a jury trial on the issue of obscenity.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court modified the trial court's order by deleting therefrom 13 specified magazines. As so modified, the court affirmed the trial court's order that enjoined defendants from selling, distributing, or possessing with intent to sell or distribute the specified magazines.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The land owner possessed several hundred acres of land which it had attempted to have rezoned for combined intense residential and commercial uses.

On appeal, the judgment was reversed. Subsequently, the zoning board deleted the zoning ordinance, which provided for planned communities. The trial court ruled in favor of the board holding the deletion to have been legally and effectively accomplished. On appeal, the court affirmed and held that there was no fundamental barrier to conferring on the legislative branch of a chartered county the right to constitute itself a zoning body and that the county charter had permitted the council to act as it did.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">At the general election the voters in the State of Maryland approved eight amendments to Maryland's Constitution. The resident filed a petition seeking a declaration that each proposed amendment had been unconstitutionally placed on the ballot, and that each had been unconstitutionally submitted to the electorate. The resident argued that the legislature did not follow the mandate of Md. Const. art. XIV, &sect; 1, but rather, impermissibly and ineffectively, redelegated to appellee Maryland's Secretary of State the function of determining the form in which each amendment would be submitted to the voters. The court held that the Secretary of State was authorized to prepare ballot titles for proposed amendments. The delegations of the actions to the Secretary of State were proper. The court also determined that the ballot titles that were challenged by the resident were beyond successful attack.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The protesters filed a class action challenging a state statute, Art. 77, &sect; 77, Md. Code (1957, 1969 Repl.

The protesting teacher indicated that his objection was not based upon religious convictions but rather the belief that he could not in good conscience force patriotism upon his classes and that the statute eliminated his right to freely express his own loyalty to the United States. The state attorney general argued that the precedent relied upon by the protesters only addressed the right to dissent from the pledge and salute for religious reasons not for general objections. The trial court held the statute unconstitutional. On appeal by the state, the court determined that the statute was unconstitutional and void under prior precedents as an impermissible abridgment of the freedom of speech under the First Amendment.</SPAN></P>

The trial court determined that the town had exclusive planning and zoning authority over the annexed property and that neither the commission or the board had such authority. The trial court further held that the board and commission retained jurisdiction over buildings and infrastructure within the annexed property. The trial court further determined that 1965 Md.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant creditor sought review of the decision of the Circuit Court for Montgomery County (Maryland), which rendered judgment that the lien in favor of appellee trustees and lender was superior to appellant's lien on property owned by the borrower. The judgment appealed from was rendered in appellant's action to enjoin foreclosure of the deed of trust held by appellee lender on the borrower's property.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellee lender made a loan to borrower partner, receiving as security therefor a deed of trust on property that he had contributed to the partnership. Appellee also obtained from borrower a security interest in the partnership, but did not record the deed. Appellant creditor made two loans to the same borrower, receiving an assignment in trust to the partnership property perfected by the filing of a financing statement. Appellant thereafter filed an action to enjoin appellee from foreclosing the deed of trust. The trial court held that appellee's security interest had priority over that of appellant's. Appellant sought review. The court reversed, finding that the borrower's interest in partnership property could not be conveyed by the partner because the property was no longer his, it belonged to the partnership. The court rejected appellee's argument that it had a valid interest in the partnership, finding that it failed to perfect the interest by filing a financing statement as required by U.C.C. &sect; 9-302. The court found that under the Uniform Commercial Code the first assignee to perfect a lien would prevail and found that appellant had perfected its lien first.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The fishermen were residents of Somerset County and sought a declaration that Md. Ann. Code, art. 66C, &sect;&sect; 322 and 700, which restricted the taking and catching of crabs and oysters in Maryland, were illegal, unconstitutional, and void. The fishermen filed their bill of complaint, seeking injunctive relief against the state government officials charged with enforcement of the challenged statutes and of licensing persons to take and catch crabs and oysters in Maryland. The lower court upheld the constitutionality of the statutes and dismissed the fishermen's action. On appeal, the court reversed, concluding that the statutes were an unconstitutional exercise of police power. The court concluded that the fishermen had standing to sue because the statutory restrictions had a severe adverse economic effect on the fishermen. The court concluded that the statutes discriminated not only among the several watermen of the 13 tidewater counties in which crabs and oysters are found in marketable quantities, but also between residents of the counties and the remaining counties. The court further concluded that the statutory provisions had no reasonable relation to the public interest.</SPAN></P>

The court found no abuse of discretion by the trial judge in admitting the price that the landowner paid for the land and the 1961 aerial photograph of the land. Further, the court concluded that the landowner did not have a guaranteed right to a trial by the court because it was the right of trial by jury, which was guaranteed by the Constitution, not the right of trial by court.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The taxpayers acquired legal title to the subject farmland and sold part of it to an enterprise. When the deed was recorded, the taxpayers paid, under protest, a county transfer tax of six percent on the sale price. The taxpayers then initiated a suit against appellees to recover the tax wrongfully paid, claiming that the county code imposing the tax was unconstitutional and did not apply to the taxpayers. The trial court entered judgment for appellees, and the court affirmed on appeal, holding that the taxpayers could not recover their taxes paid under protest because no statute afforded the taxpayers a refund and because there was no right at common law to recover taxes voluntarily paid under a mistake of law, even if paid under protest and even if the statute under which the tax was paid was later determined to be unconstitutional or invalid. The taxpayers could not recover under Md. Ann. Code art. 81, &sect; 213 (1957), because the tax was not paid to the state or a state agency; nor could they recover under Md. Ann. Code art. 81, &sect; 214, because the tax was not an ordinary tax. Md. Ann. Code art. 81, &sect; 215 did not extend to recovery of the tax at issue.</SPAN></P>

A special exception was required for the other sections, pursuant to the ordinance. The commissioner's denied the applicant's request for a special exception for the third section and the trial court sustained the denial. The court affirmed because the applicant failed to establish that the proposed use was in harmony with the general plan and that the proposed use would not have an adverse effect on health or safety, nor be detrimental to adjacent properties or to the general neighborhood. Based on the fact that school facilities were not available, the commissioners' decision was not arbitrary and capricious.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant bank appealed from a judgment of the Circuit Court of Wicomico County (Maryland), which was entered in favor of appellee city that held that the bank was not entitled to recover from the city for damages that it had allegedly suffered as a result of the city's demolition of a residence on which the bank held a mortgage.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The city determined that the residence on which the bank held a mortgage violated the housing code. After giving proper notice to the owners, the bank ordered that the house was to be burned. The city overlooked the bank's mortgage when it checked the land and tax records. After the house was destroyed, the bank brought an action against the city alleging that the city was required to give notice to the bank prior to demolition. On appeal, the court held that the city code required that notice be given to the bank because the bank, as mortgagee, had a vested or contingent interest in the property to be destroyed. The court ruled that the bank had to be given an opportunity to show the trial court that the property demolished had value and was not a nuisance when it was demolished. The court also ruled that under the circumstances, the city was not entitled to sovereign immunity. The court concluded that if the bank showed that the house had actual value when it was burned, then the demolition amounted to a taking of the bank's property for which the city had to pay compensation. The court reversed the trial court's order, which was in favor of the city.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the trial court's judgment, with costs, and remanded the case for the further proceedings to give the bank an opportunity to show the value of the property, if any, when it was destroyed. The court ruled that if the bank could show such value, then the bank would be entitled to compensation from the city.</SPAN></P>

In the case at bar, the candidate had resided in Maryland for the specified three-year period and had been a resident of Montgomery County for the last year of that period. It was undisputed that he moved from another part of Montgomery County to Legislative District Number One of Montgomery County and had since been a resident of that District. An eligible candidate only had to be a resident of the district he sought to represent and had to have been a resident of the county for a year.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The minister was previously a state overseer for the colored division of the national church. The national church merged its segregated branches into a single state division, and the minister's position as an overseer was no longer necessary. The trustees of the local church approved the lease of property owned by the national church to the minister, and his congregation subsequently withdrew from the national church, forming a new religious corporation. The national church overseer for the state filed a bill of complaint for injunctive relief to prevent the minister's use and control of the property. The trial court declined to exercise jurisdiction and dismissed the action. On appeal, the court reversed, concluding that the property dispute involved a neutral principle of law, which could be resolved without infringing upon the First Amendment rights of free exercise of religion. The underlying source of the controversy was not the national church's decision to abolish the bifurcated overseer structure. The hierarchical nature of the denomination and its provisions required the national church to retain property after a local church discontinued fellowship with the organization.</SPAN></P>

Acts, ch. 3, &sect; 3-202, which had abolished dower and curtesy, were constitutional, valid, and effective in regard to all fee simple properties owned by married persons on and after the effective date.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The land sellers had agreed to sell land to the purchaser, but the purchaser refused to accept the sellers' deeds without the joinder of the sellers' spouses on the deeds. The purchaser was concerned that &sect; 3-202 was unconstitutional, and therefore, the spouses' joinder would be required to obtain title to the land free from any claims of dower or curtesy. On appeal, the court affirmed the decree, and found that &sect; 3-202 was constitutional. The court reviewed the historical background of dower and curtesy, and found that in Maryland, dower was a common-law right of a surviving spouse, which, prior to the other spouse's death, was inchoate. Therefore, the spouse had no interest or estate in the other spouse's land prior to the death of that spouse which was capable of being mortgaged, pledged or sold. The court held that no provision in either the state or U.S. Constitution prohibited the legislature from abolishing dower and curtesy because there was no taking of property without due process of law and no impairment of a contract, because the rights were not vested until death of the other spouse, and that the legislature had valid public policy reasons for the abolishment.</SPAN></P>

The court held that where property was given to a charitable corporation for such uses as were within the scope of its corporate purposes, and where there was no clear intention on the part of the donor to create a trust, the gift was not void on the ground that it was for indefinite purposes or in conflict with the rule against perpetuities.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant foreign car importer sought review of an order by the Circuit Court for Baltimore City (Maryland), which entered a judgment in favor of appellees, a port authority and various associated entities, in an action brought by appellant to challenge appellees' contracts with one another. Appellant alleged violations of Maryland's conflict of interest statute,&nbsp;Md. Ann. Code art. 19A, but the circuit court found the contracts to be valid.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The importer filed suit for declaratory relief under Md. Ann. Code art. 31A. The bill prayed that the contractual arrangements between appellees regarding leases of a port terminal be declared void and against public policy and that the port authority be required to enter into negotiations to lease a portion of the terminal to the importer. The importer also requested that the port authority be required to employ persons having no interest in the terminal facilities and that the other entities be required to remit to the port authority such monies as had been collected under the contractual arrangement and to account to the importer for such monies as had been collected from it. The court reversed. The court ruled that the facts alleged in the importer's petition, if supported by competent evidence, and not justified by the port authority, might well have established a course of conduct so repugnant to fair dealing as to entitle the importer to relief. The port authority's unexplained refusal to lease to the importer might well have involved the denial of equal protection guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment, which was binding on state agencies, such as the port authority.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff property owner brought an action against defendants, the city, a wrecking contractor, and two members of the city's police force, alleging trespass, false imprisonment, and wrongful condemnation. The city demurred to all counts of the declaration. The Circuit Court for Montgomery County (Maryland) sustained the city's demurrer without leave to amend, and the property owner appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On appeal, the property owner argued that she had 180 days under Md. Ann. Code art. 57, &sect; 18 to give notice of the alleged wrong. The trial court concluded that the city was statutorily immune from suit because notice of the alleged injury had not been given within 90 days. The court agreed with the trial court's interpretation of the statute. In actions against the counties of Anne Arundel, Calvert, Caroline, Cecil, Frederick, and St. Mary's and against any municipal corporation, regardless of whether the corporation was or was not located within any of the counties enumerated in &sect; 18(a)(2), notice of the claim had to be given within 90 days. Further, the court rejected the property owner's contention that the constitutionality of the statute was imperiled by vagueness and uncertainty. Finally, the court held that because the property owner elected to proceed against the city in tort, claiming $ 25,000 in compensatory damages and $ 25,000 in punitive and exemplary damages in her declaration, the fifth count sought unliquidated damages and fell clearly within the notice requirements of the statute.</SPAN></P>

The superior court entered judgment in favor of the churches and ordered the city to pay damages to the churches in accordance with Md. Ann. Code art. 22A, &sect; 5(d). Appellants sought review arguing that the statute was unconstitutional because it imposed an unreasonable limitation on the state's right of eminent domain and violated both the First and Fourteenth Amendments. On appeal, the court modified and affirmed the order. The court, noting that there was a strong presumption of constitutionality, found that the statute provided a reasonable measure of compensation for the churches. The court further held that the reproduction cost approach used to calculate the fair market value of improvements on the church property was consistent with the legislative history of the statute which established that the legislative intent was to give church property no greater benefit than that given to other property in a condemnation proceeding.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellants, the town, its former mayor, and the six councilmen who were elected in the regular election filed three appeals from ordered entered by the Circuit Court for Prince George's County (Maryland). The circuit court had issued a mandatory injunction requiring the holding of a special election for all town offices.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">By adopting a number of amendments to the town charter, the electorate replaced a mayor and a set of councilmen during their terms with another mayor and another set of councilmen. The displaced persons challenged the charter amendments to validly accomplish the change in terms and officials in a suit brought against appellees, the newly elected members and other citizens and taxpayers of the town. Appellants claimed that the special election was an exercise in the governmental process of recall for which there was neither constitutional nor statutory authority, and that the charter amendments reducing the terms of office from four to two years, if construed to be applicable and effective prior to the regular town election were both unconstitutional and illegal until that time. The court ruled that by Md. Const. art. XI-E, Md. Ann. Code art. 23A, the citizens were given the legal right to do exactly what a majority of them did, that was, amend the town charter to bring about the new form of government. The fact that the exercise of the right resulted in shortening the terms just as the exercise of a power to recall, had one existed, would have done was coincidental.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A shopper claimed that a food store's employee falsely accused him of shoplifting, frisked him, and unlawfully detained him. The shopper recovered compensatory and punitive damages in his action against the food store for assault and battery, slander, and false imprisonment. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment. The court found that the food store's employee testified that he stopped the shopper before he left the store, so there was no attempt by the shopper to leave without paying. Therefore, the court found that there was no showing of probable cause because there was no evidence that the shopper manifested control over the property in such a way that his intention to steal was unequivocal. The court found that there was sufficient evidence for the jury to find that the manner and method of the detention was not within the privilege &quot;necessary for a reasonable investigation of the facts&quot; because there was not a reasonable belief that the shopper had tortiously taken a chattel upon the food store's premises.</SPAN></P>

The trial court declared the Act unconstitutional and void and found that the lands of the American Legion was subject to the liens of the assessments levied by the sanitary commission for 1966, 1967 and 1968. The American Legion appealed and the court affirmed. The court held that the Act was a &quot;special act&quot; in a statutory plan that was already covered by a public general law. The court found that the practical effect and the effect intended by the sponsors of the Act was to exempt the American Legion from any assessment or charge by the sanitary commission, and, in effect, applied to one taxpayer only and to the lands of that one taxpayer.

</DIV>

On appeal, the court affirmed in part and reversed in part. The council had the power to veto the first bill and to enact the substitute bill. The council acted in good faith for proper and appropriate governmental reasons in enacting the substitute bill and not merely to avoid the referendum on the first bill. The feeling of an emergency induced by a growing school population and inadequate educational facilities, and rising costs of money and construction prompted the council to avoid a delay of several years.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The cabaret argued that &sect; 402, which imposed a tax on admissions and amusements, and &sect; 403, distinguished between the taxpayers upon whom the taxes were imposed. The laws distinguished between businesses that charged a direct admission charge for entry, and those that charged an indirect admission by increasing the price of food and drinks, etc. This difference in treatment created a sub-classification of taxpayers who were required to pay their tax calculated on an entirely different basis than others. The cabaret argued that this was unconstitutional. The trial court held that the statutes were constitutional and the court affirmed. The court held that the classifications did not deny equal protection, but were simple and appropriate classifications of taxpayers. The legislature, in passing a revenue measure, had the power to classify, and could have imposed varying tax burdens on different groups. It was only when the attempted classification had no reasonable basis in the nature of the businesses classified and burdens were imposed unequally on taxpayers between whom there was no real difference that the courts would interfere.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellants argued that venue did not lie against them in Worcester County under Md. Ann. Code art. 50, &sect; 5 (1957, Repl. Vol. 1968), which by its title governed venue in suits against joint obligors, because they were not jointly liable on the contracts in question. On appeal, the court disagreed but dismissed the appeal on other grounds. Section 5 was repealed and reenacted by 1953 Md. Laws ch. 206, which was dispositive of appellants' argument because the article and section headings of its predecessor were works of the codifier. In any event, the court concluded that ch. 206 was intended to permit a contract action on which two or more defendants were allegedly obligated to be brought in the county where any one of the defendants resided or regularly did business. Because appellees' declaration alleged that appellants and their fellow defendants were joint obligors, the court held that the motion to quash was properly denied. However, the court dismissed the appeal of its own accord under former Md. R. 835(a)(2) because the denial of appellants' motion to quash was an interlocutory order, rather than a final judgment from which an appeal could be taken.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The landowner owned a tract of land that fronted on a sewer line and that the commission identified as containing four blocks of land, he redeemed sewer benefit charges levied on two of the blocks, an apartment building subsequently was built on one of the blocks, and the commission assessed a multiunit sewer benefit charge for the apartment tract. The court affirmed the assessment, found that the property was broken up into parcels for assessment purposes and that the landowner's earlier redemption applied only to the two blocks. When the owner redeemed the sewer benefit on the two tracts, Prince George's County, Md., Code of Public Local Laws, &sect; 1571(a) (1953) provided for assessment only on agricultural, small acreage, industrial, or business and sub-division property, but, by the time of the disputed assessment, a class was added for multiunit residential properties. The court held that, under Prince George's County, Md., Code of Public Local Laws, &sect; 83-71(g), the commission was obliged to permit connection and to proceed to assess under the then applicable law, which by then provided a multiunit classification, and that the commission levied the assessment properly.</SPAN></P>

The trial court affirmed the validity of the assessment of use taxes by the comptroller, holding that the airplanes owned by the company were employed regularly and exclusively in interstate and foreign commerce in the transportation of passengers. On appeal, the court reversed. The court held that during the period of the assessment, the two airplanes were used exclusively as instruments of interstate commerce and the privilege of such use was not subject to local taxation because the language of the comptroller's Rule 64(c) exempted the airplanes from taxation. The court found that the two airplanes did not engage in any local activity that could have been realistically separated from their use in interstate commerce. The court held that the comptroller's attempted application of the use tax could not be sustained by reason of its repugnancy to the commerce clause of the United States Constitution and the provisions of the Maryland statutes.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The exhibitor claimed it had a right to show two films without the approval of the Board because a court hearing was not held within the time frame dictated by &sect; 19. Under &sect; 19, the Board was required to approve or disapprove a film within five days after submission. If the Board disapproved, it was required to apply to the circuit court within three days for a judicial determination whether the film was obscene. Then, the circuit court had to conduct a hearing within five days and enter an order approving or disapproving the film within the next two days. In the instant case, the circuit court held a hearing and issued an order on the seventh day following submission by the Board. The court on appeal affirmed. The circuit court decided the case within seven days following submission by the Board as required by the statute. The exhibitor received a final decision within the 15 days contemplated by the statute for the entire process and within seven days after the Board applied to the circuit court. The statutory scheme for film censorship was not violated because the hearing was not held within five days where the decision was issued within the seven days required by &sect; 19.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant, a Republican member of the Board of Election Supervisors of Prince George's County (Maryland), challenged a ruling of the Circuit Court for the County of Anne Arundel (Maryland), which denied the relief sought by the member in her action against appellees, the Governor and Secretary of State of Maryland. The member sought a declaratory decree that 1969 Md. Acts 1 (Act), governing the appointment of Board members, was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Act required the appointment to the Board of two majority party members, whose gubernatorial candidate received the highest number of votes, and one minority party member, whose candidate received the second highest number of votes. When Maryland's Republican Governor was elected U.S. Vice President, a Democrat was elected as his replacement. As a result, the member argued that the Act unconstitutionally abolished her office and shortened her term and that it was an unlawful emergency bill because it was not prompted by a threat to the public health or safety. On appeal, the court disagreed. Under Md. Const. arts. II, &sect; 13 and XVII, &sect; 8, the member's two-year Board term naturally expired before the provisions of the Act affected the composition of the Board. Those provisions merely prescribed the qualifications of those who could be appointed to the Board upon expiration of the member's term and thereafter, and the legislative declaration of emergency was conclusive and not reviewable. Finally, because the terms of the member and those with whom she served expired before the Act impacted the Board, the court held that the case was moot, and the appeal was necessarily dismissed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant county officials, citing Md. Const. art. III, &sect; 29, appealed a decision of the Circuit Court for Charles County (Maryland), which entered summary judgment in favor of plaintiff gasoline sellers finding unconstitutional&nbsp;Md. Ann. Code art. 56, &sect; 144A (Repl. 1964), which banned the use of promotional games in the selling of gasoline.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The gasoline sellers argued on appeal that Md. Ann. Code art. 56, &sect; 144A (Repl. 1964) denied them due process of law and equal protection of the laws. The court remanded without affirmance or reversal. The court noted that Md. Const. art. III, &sect; 29, which provided that the subject of legislation be described in its title, required that a restriction in the title of an act had to either confine the operation of the act to conform to that restriction if that construction were possible or, if such a construction were not possible, render the act void to the extent of the conflict between the restriction in the title and the provisions in the body of the act. The court determined that the trial court should not have granted summary judgment declaring Md. Ann. Code art. 56, &sect; 144A (Repl. 1964) unconstitutional for denying due process and equal protection because such a denial was not apparent on the face of &sect; 144A, especially in view of the possible restrictive effect of the provisions of its title upon its construction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court remanded the gasoline sellers' action against the county officials, challenging the constitutionality of a ban on the use of promotional games, to the trial court, without affirming or reversing the trial court's summary judgment in favor of the gasoline sellers, for further proceedings in accordance with the court's opinion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant property owner sought review in consolidated appeals of two decisions of the Circuit Court for Howard County (Maryland) related to a nonconforming use of property under Howard County, Md., Zoning Regulations (1954). In Case No. 230, the property owner sought review of the trial court's order in the property owner's action for injunctive relief, and in Case No. 305, it challenged the Board's finding of an illegal nonconforming use.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In Case No. 230, the property owner sought to enjoin the Board from conducting a hearing on the issue of whether the property owner's operation of a quarry was a valid non-conforming use where the property was classified as residential. The trial court sustained the Board's demurrer, and the hearing took place. The Board's decision that the operation of the quarry was an illegal non-conforming use was the basis of the appeal in Case No. 305. On appeal, the court dismissed the appeal in Case No. 230, and affirmed the trial court's judgment in Case No. 305. The appeal in Case No. 230 was rendered moot once the hearing had been conducted and the trial court issued a decision. In Case No. 305, the Board correctly determined that the operation of the quarry was an illegal non-conforming use. For a valid non-conforming use, the property owner had to establish the existence of a legal non-conforming use at the time of the enactment of Howard County, Md., Zoning Regulations (1954). The property owner failed to show that the operation of the quarry was valid under Howard County, Md., Zoning Regulations (1948), or that the quarry predated the adoption of the 1948 regulations.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court dismissed the property owner's appeal in Case No. 230 as moot and affirmed the trial court's determination in Case No. 305 that the use of the property owner's property as a quarry was an illegal non-conforming use.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After the police officer was assaulted by some youths in a parking lot, he filed a petition in juvenile court against the minor and three other boys.

At the conclusion of a hearing before a master, the master recommended that the minor be found a delinquent. The minor filed exceptions to the master's report and filed a motion for a jury trial which was denied prior to the hearing de novo in the circuit court and again at the hearing. The minor argued that Md. Ann. Code art. 26, &sect;&sect; 51-71A, 91-101, which created a system of juvenile courts, was unconstitutional because it made no provision for a jury trial. The court affirmed, concluding that (1) in Maryland, juvenile courts were courts of equity having the power and full right to decide without a jury every question of law and fact which might arise; (2) by the waiver permitted by &sect; 54, the legislature chose to make alternate provisions for a jury trial; and (3) the proceedings of a juvenile court were not criminal in nature and its dispositions were not punishment for crime.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff citizen appealed the decision of the Circuit Court of Baltimore City (Maryland), which entered judgment dismissing the citizen's complaint challenging the constitutionality of 1969 Md. Laws ch. 76. Chapter 76 purportedly provided for a &quot;general election&quot; for submission to the electorate of all amendments to the Maryland Constitution proposed by the Maryland General Assembly at its 1969 session.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">During its 1969 session, the Maryland General Assembly passed 1969 Md. Laws ch. 76. Chapter 76 provided for a &quot;general election&quot; for the submission of all amendments proposed during the 1969 session to the electorate for adoption or rejection. The citizen filed a complaint alleging that the &quot;general election&quot; scheduled for November 4, 1969 was not a &quot;general election&quot; as required by Md. Const. art. XIV, &sect; 1 but was a &quot;special election&quot; convened specifically to vote on the proposed amendments. The citizen's complaint sought judgment declaring 1969 Md. Laws ch. 76 unconstitutional or constitutional as well as a decision on the constitutionality of the eight proposed amendments. The complaint also sought injunction to prevent the election on November 4, 1969 from proceeding. The trial court dismissed the complaint. On appeal, the court held that the election scheduled was not a &quot;general election&quot; but a &quot;special election.&quot; The court found that general elections referred to regularly scheduled elections in which various local and national candidates were elected to office, while the November 1969 election was more similar to a special referendum election.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After the city passed an ordinance establishing a higher minimum wage than had been established by the state, the hotel and bar owners filed declaratory actions against the city to have the ordinance declared void under Md. Const. art. XI-A, &sect; 3. The trial court entered judgment in favor of the hotel and bar owners, and the city appealed. The court reversed, holding that the ordinance fell under the concurrent power theory because it did not conflict with state law or the state's legislative powers. Under that theory, additional regulation by a local government to that of state law did not constitute a conflict by enlarging upon the provisions of the statute or requiring more than the statute. The city could not prohibit what the state by general public law had permitted, but the city was allowed to prohibit what the state had not expressly permitted. The court examined the use of the preemption theory by other jurisdictions and disregarded it under the facts of the case because there was no showing that the state legislature intended to reserve to itself the exclusive right to legislate on the subject matter.</SPAN></P>

After a public hearing, the commissioners granted the petition. The landowners filed an action challenging the commissioners' decision. The trial court entered a decree affirming the decision of the commissioners. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's decree. The court held that land in question was not part of a floating zone, so the commissioners were required to make findings as to whether there had been a change in conditions since the adoption of the comprehensive zoning map or a mistake in zoning as to the land. The court determined that the commissioners had not specifically made such findings, but that the evidence showed that much of the land had been reclassified since the adoption of the map. Therefore, the court ruled that the commissioners' decision was &quot;fairly debatable&quot; and could not be reversed. The court determined that the evidence was sufficient to justify the rezoning.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Taxpayer challenged the constitutionality of a statute creating the Maryland Airport Authority.

The city contended that the transaction was unconstitutional because the state was not obligated to make the payments. Amicus curiae argued that the constitutional issue would be moot if the governor signed a bill recently passed by the legislature. The court held that the state constitution required that a debt must be authorized by a law providing for the collection of an annual tax in an amount sufficient to pay the interest and to discharge the principal. The court held the act unconstitutional because it created a debt greater in amount than the general obligation bonds which were authorized, only part of which would have been available for the purchase of the airport.</SPAN></P>

The citizens' league appealed and the court affirmed the circuit court's order. The court held that the emergency session was permissible under the 1966 amendment to Charter of Montgomery County. The court found that control and supervision of the sale and renting of housing to prevent discrimination offered nothing inconsistent with Md. Ann. Code art. 25A.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The children were transferred as a part of a redistricting plan. Some of the children lived within a one-mile radius of their former school.

The court was of the opinion that under the applicable law, the evidence before the lower court was not sufficient to warrant the issuance of the interlocutory injunction, so the order was reversed. Md. Ann. Code art. 77, &sect; 56 (1957), committed the districting and redistricting of the county for school purposes to the discretion of the board. The parents and taxpayers had the burden of showing that the board's action was illegal or an abuse of discretion, and that burden was not met. The trial court affirmatively found that the action by the board was not fraudulent, corrupt, or such an abuse of discretion as would amount to a breach of trust. There was no evidence before the trial judge to indicate that the board had acted fraudulently, corruptly, arbitrarily, unreasonably or capriciously in breach of its trust and, hence, the interlocutory injunction was erroneously issued.</SPAN></P>

The trial court dismissed the case holding that all issues could be decided in a pending criminal proceeding against the junk yard owner for violations of the ordinance. The junk yard owner appealed. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's decision. The trial court did not abuse his discretion in directing the county commissioners to file a supplemental answer and in considering the issue of the proper applicability of declaratory relief procedures in the instant case because there was no surprise to the junk yard owner. The trial court had judicial discretion to refuse a declaratory judgment if it did not serve a useful purpose or terminate controversy.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant property owner sought review of an order from the Circuit Court for Montgomery County (Maryland). The trial court, over the objections of the property owner in a condemnation proceedings, admitted into evidence testimony as to the value of a 7.94 acre parcel of land being condemned, on the basis of its use as residential-agricultural property, when the contiguous land surrounding it had been rezoned to commercial-apartment use.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">At issue was the propriety of application of restrictions to property as a limitation on evidence as to value. Montgomery Co., Md. Code &sect; 111-48f froze the value of land to be acquired for a public purpose. The court held that the property owner had to be permitted to defend himself against that ordinance. The ordinance directly impinged upon one of his constitutional guarantees. To hold otherwise was to deprive him of the opportunity to receive just compensation for his property guaranteed by Md. Const. art. III, &sect; 40. The court held that Montgomery Co., Md. Code &sect; 111-48f was unconstitutional and of no legal effect. Accordingly, it was error for the lower court to admit into evidence testimony as to the market value of the property based on R-A zoning as the highest and best use of the property. The court did not think that evidence as to the market value of the condemned property, based on the R-A zoning classification frozen by ordinance, should have been admitted over the objections of the property owner. A verdict which could have been predicated on such evidence of value would constitute a taking of the property without just compensation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the judgment and remanded the case for a new trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Pursuant to 1963 Md. Laws 41, &sect; 1 Morgan State College, which had been controlled by its own board of Trustees, was placed under the structure of the State College system. The taxpayers, one of whom was an alumnus of Morgan State College, alleged that the statute was vague and indefinite, and the contingencies which would allow the State College system to take control had not occurred. The trial court concluded they were without standing to sue and that they were barred by laches. On appeal, the court affirmed. There was no dispute about their failure to allege an illegal expenditure of tax-derived funds resulting in either a pecuniary loss to them or an increase in their taxes. Their contention that all persons who had degrees from Morgan State College acquired significant legal status, rights, recognition, and benefits which the failed to restore was completely baseless. While they argued on appeal that the transfer of control resulted in increased taxes, their pleadings neither supported that conclusion nor necessarily implied that pecuniary loss or increased taxes had been alleged.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judgment dismissing the taxpayers' action challenging the transfer of control of Morgan State College to the State College system was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

Ann. Code art. 81, &sect; 455 (1957). A lower court found that appellee's search and seizure was unlawful, and that it was unnecessary to consider two constitutional issued raised by appellee in regard to &sect; 455. The state sought review of the lower court's judgment by writ of certiorari. The court reversed the lower court's judgment and remanded the case. The court determined that the provisions of &sect; 455 were not invalid as unreasonable restraints upon interstate commerce or as regulations in an interstate commerce regulatory area in which Congress had preempted the field. The court found that a person of common intelligence construing &sect; 455 would have been adequately informed that if he was transporting unstamped cigarettes through Maryland, that he had to have the required documents or was guilty of the misdemeanor provided in the statute. The court found further that a search pursuant to a lawful arrest was perfectly legal. In the court's opinion, the search and seizure in appellee's case was not unreasonable.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellants sought review of the judgment of the Circuit Court for Baltimore County (Maryland), which affirmed the decision of a county board of zoning appeals, which reclassified a five-acre parcel of appellee landowner's property, on which the landowner operated an automobile junkyard.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The landowners operated an automobile junkyard on their property located in a residential zone. Their use was nonconforming since the adoption of zoning in the county. The landowner applied to the county's zoning commissioner for a reclassification of his property and for the granting of a special exception pursuant to the county's zoning law and zoning regulations. The request was denied. On appeal, reclassification was granted to a five-acre parcel of the land, but denied on the remainder. That decision was affirmed by the lower court. On appeal, the court reversed. The court held that the landowner failed to meet his burden of proving that the zoning classifications were invalid. The court found that the presence of a nonconforming use in that area was not evidence of error in original zoning requiring a change of classification. The court held that no evidence was presented that the use contemplated for the landowner's property was the only use for which it was fitted, and that there was no evidence of any substantial change in the character of the neighborhood.</SPAN></P>
