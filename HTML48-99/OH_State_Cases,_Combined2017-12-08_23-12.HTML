On appeal, the court found that defendant did not present any authority, either statutory or decisional, for his proposition that the appropriate remedy for a violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. ch. 5122 was dismissal of the indictment. Defendant's claim of error regarding the order of evaluation under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2945.39 failed because no objection was raised at the trial court level and moreover, the ultimate judgment entry ordering the evaluation was approved by defense counsel. Notwithstanding said approval, defendant failed to demonstrate how he was prejudiced by the manner and timing in which his evaluation occurred. Defendant's claim that he was denied a preliminary hearing ignored the fact that he was indicted within 10 days of his arrest period and was no longer entitled to one by rule. The record also reflected an express waiver of defendant's speedy trial time approved by his trial counsel.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant regularly picketed the abortion clinic. One day he chose to approach some of the employees and inquired if they were ready to die and similar admitted threats. The clinic employees called the police. The police arrested defendant. The prosecution charged him with disorderly conduct and aggravated menacing. Defendant filed a motion to dismiss the charges. The trial court dismissed the disorderly conduct charge and convicted defendant on the other charges. Defendant appealed. The court affirmed. It found that the fighting words exception to the First Amendment fell within the disorderly conduct arena and had no relevancy, despite defendant's assertions, to the aggravated menacing charges. The crime was triggered by a threat that intimidated the recipient. The elements of the crime did not include proving that defendant intended, or was able, to carry out his threat. Also, defendant's choice to exercise his constitutionally protected right to protest abortions at the time he made the threats was irrelevant to conviction on the charges. Finally, defendant's own testimony admitting his conduct provided sufficient credible evidence to support his conviction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee challenged the trial court's granting of appellees' motion for summary judgment and the dismissal of her wrongful termination complaint. The employee argued that the enactment of Crooksville, Ohio, Ordinance 93-2153 (1993), which eliminated the employee's dispatch position, did not properly set forth the reasons for its emergency enactment as required by Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 731.30. The court determined that the ordinance stated that the city was unable to maintain the dispatch positions due to the lack of funds and that its enactment was an emergency as it affected the economic well being of the city. The statement of necessity was sufficient to meet the requirements of &sect; 731.30. Appellees were not required to comply with the notice and hearing requirements of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 733.35 to 733.39 because appellees made no allegations of misconduct against the employee, rather all dispatcher positions were eliminated. The court concluded that the trial court did not err in granting appellees' motion for summary judgment because the employee produced no evidence that she had a protected property interest in her employment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a decision by the Court of Common Pleas of Washington County (Ohio) that convicted and sentenced defendant for possession of drug paraphernalia in violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2925.14 and possession of marijuana in violation of a city ordinance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was found guilty, fined, and was ordered two six-month suspensions of his operator's license for drug paraphernalia and marijuana convictions. Defendant appealed contending that the trial court erred in suspending defendant's operator's license pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2925.11(F)(1) and Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4507.16(D)(2) when defendant was, in fact, charged under a city ordinance that did not track the suspension provisions of the state statutes. The court found that because defendant was convicted under the city ordinance, the second six-month operator's license suspension for the possession of marijuana was contrary to law. Defendant also argued that the mandatory six-month operator's license suspension was unconstitutional because it was wholly unrelated to the offense of possessing drug paraphernalia because the offense did not involve a motor vehicle. The court found that the statute did not violate the Equal Protection Clause because it had a rational relationship to a legitimate governmental interest.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was indicted by a grand jury on seven charges: one count of engaging in a pattern of corrupt activity, in violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2923.32; two counts of having an unlawful interest in a public contract, in violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2921.42; two counts of theft, in violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2913.02; and two counts of theft in office, in violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2921.41. The charges resulted from alleged wrongdoing by defendant and co-defendant arising from their involvement with a pension fund at various times over several years. The jury returned verdicts finding defendant guilty on all counts. Defendant appealed and argued that the State charged her with a series of violations of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2913.02 that should have been consolidated as a single offense pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2913.61. The court found merit in defendant's argument and held that the theft offenses should have been consolidated pursuant to &sect; 2913.61.The court found that the record supported a finding that a rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the various offenses proven beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that the trial court erred because it did not suppress evidence obtained in violation of the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution, that the police did not have probable cause to arrest her, that her confession was obtained in violation of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution, and that the state failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that she contributed to the delinquency of her child, a minor. The police discovered defendant's child alone in defendant's van. A bag and large quantities of merchandise were in the van. Store tags were attached to the merchandise in the van but there were no sales receipts for the items. The court determined that the trial court correctly ruled that the police could lawfully search defendant's van. The trial court did not err when it found that probable cause was established.

The trial court overruled defendant's motion for a directed verdict dismissing the indictment. As an affirmative defense, defendant argued that he was unable to provide adequate support and did provide such support as was within his ability and means.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A petition to annex approximately 114 acres from the township to a city was filed. The annexation territory was owned by the landowners, all of whom signed the annexation petition. The county board of commissioners denied the petition, finding that the &quot;general good&quot; of the annexation territory would not be served by the annexation. On appeal, the trial court reversed the county board of commissioners' decision and ordered it to grant the petition for annexation. The township contended that such was error. On further appeal, the court disagreed with the township. The court held that where all the landowners in the annexation territory desired annexation and the city could provide adequate services, the general good of the territory would be served by annexation. Although a comparative analysis of services was proper when determining the general good, it was not the only consideration. Under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 709.033, a board was obliged to give primary consideration to the wishes of the landowners.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged a judgment of the Lucas County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio), which under Ohio R. Civ. P. 12(B), dismissed his claim against appellees, a city school board and others, for the injuries he sustained during a high school wrestling match when he was a minor. The action was filed within two years of his reaching the age of majority, but well beyond the two year limit set out in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2744.04.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Section 2744.04(A) provided for a two-year statute of limitations in which to file suit against a political subdivision. Appellant was injured in a wrestling match and filed his complaint after he attained his majority. Appellant's claim was dismissed because the trial court, relying on an unpublished decision involving another school district, held that minority did not toll a &sect; 2744.04 claim. On appeal, the court determined that the sole question before it was whether the tolling provision for minority under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2305.16 applied to an action brought under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2744.04. It determined that it did. There were other Ohio cases involving different code sections not specifically referenced in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2305.16 that held that minors would have their rights to due process violated if the tolling provisions based on their disability as minors were not applied. A minor was precluded from bringing suit on his own, and if he was precluded from bringing suit after attaining his majority because of the imposition of a statute of limitations, he was effectively barred from access to the judicial system for the redress of his injuries.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment and remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A franchisor and franchisee were involved in litigation over the location of a car dealership. The trial court granted the franchisee's motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction. The OMVB filed a motion with the court for reconsideration of the court's judgment entry striking from the record a brief filed by OMVB, on the basis that OMVB was not a proper party to the appeal. The court denied the motion. The court found that the issue was whether an administrative agency, acting in the role of an impartial decisionmaker, had standing as a party from an appeal of its own order. The role of the OMVB in the action, as a quasi-judicial body, was to render an impartial decision. Even assuming that OMVB could, under certain circumstances, be a party to an appeal of its own decision, OMVB had failed to persuade the court that the proper parties to the appeal, the franchisor and franchisees, would not adequately represent the public's interest or that the OMVB's participation was necessary or indispensable to the resolution of the matter.</SPAN></P>

Furthermore, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in granting the motion of the State to quash the subpoena and did not abuse its discretion in overruling defendant's motion to dismiss.

The trustees filed suit against the state department of taxation, the state tax commissioner and the state treasurer, alleging that the manner in which they distributed proceeds from the excise tax created arbitrary and unreasonable classifications based on artificial distinctions not rationally related to any legitimate government purpose, and did not have a uniform statewide application. The trial court found for the trustees and defendants appealed. The court affirmed and held that the method of classification set forth pursuant to Ohio Rev.

The court found no requirement that a court must have undertaken an analysis of an entire taxing scheme to determine the rationality of a method of classification in one statute.

He further admitted that in the Islamic faith, a woman could not divorce her husband and that her filing for divorce made him angry. On appeal, defendant contended that the evidence was sufficient only to demonstrate &quot;a plan of abduction.&quot; The court held that the evidence demonstrated that defendant killed two victims known to him against whom he harbored intense anger and resentment. The evidence also proved that approximately three weeks after his wife filed for divorce, defendant purchased a semiautomatic weapon and then threatened the victims. The court held that defendant's acts could be viewed as going beyond the impulse of the moment to constitute prior calculation and design; therefore, the evidence met the test of sufficiency since a rational trier of fact could have found the elements of prior calculation and design beyond a reasonable doubt.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant claimed in part that the admission of the baseball bat was irrelevant because it was not found at the scene of the crime and did not have his fingerprints or other relevant forensic evidence. In considering his appeal, the court found no error, ruling that when the State's evidence was considered collectively, the bat was not irrelevant. Defendant was charged with aggravated robbery, which under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2911.01(A)(1) required proof that he had a deadly weapon or dangerous ordinance on or about his person. Further, there was testimony from his co-defendant that defendant used the bat in the crime and that the one produced at trial was the same bat. The court rejected the claim that defendant was convicted on the tainted testimony of his co-defendant, ruling in part that there was extensive independent evidence that corroborated the co-defendant's testimony. The court also rejected defendant's claim that prosecuting the case against him alone violated fundamental fairness.

The trial court denied the motion. On appeal, the court found that the trial court properly determined that the mother was not entitled to relief pursuant to Ohio R. Civ. P. 60(B)(4) because she had a remedy by way of a breach of contract complaint. The record was void of any indication that she was forced or coerced into the compromise agreement, or that she did not understand the ramifications of entering into such an agreement. However, the trial court abused its discretion in failing to relieve the child from the agreement. Although the child was named as a party in the original paternity action, her interests were not adequately represented.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's order as to the mother. The court reversed the trial court's order with regard to the child and remanded the case for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

The evidence conflicted and was absolutely contradictory. The jury could not believe both versions of the facts and had to decide which of the witnesses were more credible. The court held that if the jury found the arresting officer's version to be more credible, as they apparently did, there was more than sufficient evidence to establish each and every element of the dumping charge. As such, denial of the motion to acquit was proper and the verdict was justified by the weight of the evidence. Defendant further contended that the trial court erred in the admission of evidence which was immaterial and irrelevant to the charge of his activity on the day of the dumping. The testimony was only marginally relevant and most of it dealt with matters which had occurred before the date in question, such as the problems with odors and dust. While the scope of the testimony may have been overly broad, the witnesses did testify as to the dumping on the day in question and their testimony was corroborated. The irrelevant portions of their testimony did not have any prejudicial effect.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The complaint alleged that the challenged provisions were unconscionable and unconstitutional. The court affirmed the denial of class certification, finding that the request was premature. Certification pursuant to Ohio R. Civ. P. 23(B)(1)(a) required a determination that separate actions would create a risk of inconsistent or varying adjudications with respect to individual members of the class that would establish incompatible standards of conduct upon the party opposing the class.Rule 23(B)(1)(b) permitted class certification if prosecution of individual actions would create a risk of adjudication that would be dispositive of the interest of others not a party to the suit.A ruling as to the validity of the challenged provisions, however, would be implemented consistently. Certification under Rule 23(B)(2), which permitted class certifications when the party opposing the class acted or refused to act on grounds generally applicable to the class, making injunctive or declaratory relief appropriate, would be premature because such relief could be had only after a determination of the validity of the challenged provisions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An officer observed a van travelling at an excessive rate of speed. The trooper pulled the vehicle to the side of the highway. The trooper asked the driver, defendant, if he had any weapons or contraband. Defendant admitted he was carrying marijuana. A pat down search of defendant was conducted. The search produced a small quantity of marijuana, some pills, big rolls of money, and a clear plastic bag containing a small white rock-like substance. Shortly thereafter, other officers arrived at the scene and informed the trooper that a van matching the description of the one driven by defendant was reportedly used in an armed robbery the previous day. Defendant was arrested. A search of the vehicle produced a loaded, operable firearm. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that: (1) defendant lacked standing to attack the constitutionality of &sect; 2925.37(A) because he was never convicted of a violation of that statute; and (2) where the trooper properly stopped the van for speeding, noted defendant was acting nervous, and the van fit the description of a vehicle used in a prior armed robbery, reasonable cause existed for the officer to believe the van contained drugs or weapons.</SPAN></P>

The court held that operating rights were not in the nature of a fixture and bound up in the physical ownership of the premises. The court held that the corporation surrendered any right to operate a nursing home on the premises at the time it entered into the lease with the operator.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In the original divorce decree, the ex-husband was ordered to pay child support for the parties' four children. The decree provided that the child support would continue until further order of the court of common pleas. Thereafter, pursuant to a request of a county child support enforcement agency request, the court of common pleas ordered the ex-husband to pay an arrearage, holding that the ex-husband's support obligation lasted until each of the children reached the age of 21. In so ordering, the court of common pleas determined that the ex-husband's obligation to provide support was controlled by Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3109.01 as it existed at the time of the parties' divorce, which required support until a child reached the age of 21, instead of under an amendment, which required support until a child reached the age of 18. In reversing the judgment, the court held that the ex-husband's support obligation ended upon each child reaching the age of 18 because the decree, which was rendered before the amendment, did not explicitly or implicitly specify a duration or term of the obligation; thus, the lower age of majority under the statutory amendment applied.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court of common pleas ruled in the medical board's favor and dismissed the college's action for a declaratory judgment as to the constitutionality of Ohio Admin.

The court further found that &sect; 4731-1-05 did not violate any due process rights because it properly forwarded the public welfare and health, noting that the flip side of not requiring massage therapists to complete lengthy schooling was narrowing the scope of their practice. The court also determined that the possibility that treatment via modalities was available from other medical practitioners showed that there was no unconstitutional interference with an individual's right to privacy.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the dismissal of the college's declaratory judgment action in which it sought to enjoin a purportedly unconstitutional scope-of-practice rule's enforcement. The court also enforced that ruling in the board's favor in that action.</SPAN></P>

The court held that neither &sect; 2506.03 nor &sect; 2506.04 gave the trial court the authority to remand the case back to the Board to conduct an additional hearing.

Both the court and the Supreme Court of Ohio affirmed his convictions on direct appeal. Defendant argued that the trial court erred in determining that all of defendant's second post-conviction claims were barred by res judicata. The court affirmed the judgment, holding that defendant's claims were barred by res judicata because defendant either did raise or could have raised all 12 claims in his first petition for post-conviction relief. Furthermore, he offered no explanation for failing to do so, and Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2953.23(A) required a good cause showing for the second or successive filing of a petition for post-conviction relief. Thus, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in dismissing the petition. The court noted that defendant was attempting to use a second petition as a vehicle for presenting favorable evidence that was not developed for the first post-conviction proceeding.</SPAN></P>

The court, in affirming the trial court's judgment, first noted that the trial court satisfied its statutory duty to determine if there were substantive grounds for relief and properly refused to grant a hearing. The court rejected other of defendant's assertions on grounds of res judicata and determined that petitioner was not entitled to raise claims in the postconviction action that had been adjudicated at trial and affirmed on direct appeal. The court further found, as to claims asserted of matters not in the record before the court, that the facts underlying such claims were either known by petitioner at the time of trial and, hence, should have been raised there, or that the claims alleged matters that were immaterial. The court next rejected petitioner's arguments, based on various grounds, that his convictions were void or voidable. The court applied Ohio R.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were charged with a violation of &sect; 2925.37(A), knowing possession of a counterfeit controlled substance as defined in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2925.01(P)(4). Defendants filed a facial challenge to the statutes, alleging that they were void for vagueness and therefore were unconstitutional. The trial courts sustained the motions, held the statutes invalid, and dismissed the charges. The State asserted that the statutes were not impermissibly vague. Defendants argued that the statutes did not give fair warning as to the prohibited conduct. The court sustained the State's assignment of error to the extent that the trial courts were premature in their finding of facial invalidity. The trial courts should have developed the facts of each case before finding that the statutes had no valid application whatsoever. Also, defendants bore the burden of proving the statutes infirm beyond a reasonable doubt. However, they did not plead sufficient facts to permit the trial courts to make a determination on the statutes' validity as applied.</SPAN></P>

The Franklin County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio) entered judgment for defendants, and the employee appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee accepted employment with the State subject to a collective bargaining agreement in effect. The employee filed a complaint alleging that she was denied equal protection when she was denied a carryover from her previous service with various governmental employers for purposes of calculating the accrual rate of her vacation benefits. The trial court overruled the employee's objections to a referee's report and entered judgment for defendants. The court affirmed the judgment. Since Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 9.44, the statute generally governing public employees' vacation leave accrual, was clearly not included in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4117.10(A)'s list of laws which prevailed over a conflicting bargaining agreement provision, it did not supersede the bargaining agreement. The bargaining agreement expressly provided that only employment with state agencies was computed for the purpose of determining the rate of accrual for new employees. The employee's prior service was not as an employee of the State, but rather she performed services under a service contract. Thus, there was no error in refusing to recognize her prior state services.</SPAN></P>

Defendant further wrote down his answers to the police officer's questions concerning drugs. On review, the court affirmed his conviction. The court held that under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2901.04's caveat, there was sufficient evidence at trial permitting the trial court to find beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant committed the offense of falsification because the statement was false; it was knowingly made, it was intended to mislead, and it was made to a public official performing in his official capacity. The fact that defendant's false statement was irrelevant as to whether his uncle was trafficking in marijuana did not change the police officer's function at the time the question was posed from &quot;official&quot; to &quot;unofficial.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the worker was granted benefits, the Board held that he was ineligible and ordered recoupment. The worker appealed.

Finding that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4141.28(O), the common pleas court dismissed. The court affirmed. It held that the common pleas court's failure to allow the worker 14 days within which to respond to the Board's second motion was harmless error; that the common pleas court's failure to mention all of the worker's arguments in opposition did not require the conclusion that they had not been passed upon; and that the common pleas court did not err in strictly construing &sect; 4141.28(O). Such strict construction in fact was required because a right to appeal that is granted by statute can be perfected only in the statutorily prescribed manner.

After his convictions, the prisoner initiated over 250 actions or appeals in various courts, naming nearly 50 individuals or entities. The prisoner did not dispute the extent of his litigiousness, but argued that his multiple filings were not frivolous or malicious. He filed a mandamus action against the county commissioners. The court granted the commissioners' motion to dismiss the action for failure to state a claim, but reserved the commissioners' request for attorney fees as a sanction for filing a frivolous civil action under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2323.51. The prisoner then voluntarily dismissed his petition. The court denied as moot the request for attorney fees, holding that because the prisoner voluntarily dismissed the petition, the court was without further jurisdiction to act in the matter. The court also exercised its inherent authority to deny the prisoner in forma pauperis status with respect to any further filing of original actions in court. The court instructed its clerk not to accept for filing any pro se original actions from the prisoner unless accompanied by $ 100 cost deposit.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the inmate argued, among other things, that the trial court erred in dismissing his complaint for failure to state a claim under Ohio R. Civ. P. 12(B)(6). The court, in affirming the trial court's judgment, determined that the inmate had not rebutted, beyond a reasonable doubt, the presumption that the provisions of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2967.15 were constitutional. The court, noting that bail hearings were permitted in proceedings for probation revocation but not for parole revocation, concluded that the inmate's due process rights were not violated because the State had a rational basis for distinguishing between such alleged violators. Similarly, the court noted that Ohio Const. art. I, &sect; 9 was coextensive with the protections under U.S. Const. amend.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of gross sexual imposition, in violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2907.05(A). Defendant filed a motion to seal his record of conviction. The trial court denied defendant's motion. On appeal, the court found that defendant's motion to seal his record was filed after the effective date of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2953.36, which prohibited the sealing of convictions of sexual offenses. Thus, the trial court did not err in applying &sect; 2953.36 to the case. Even if &sect; 2953.36 did not apply, the trial court had discretion to overrule the motion if it found that the government interest in maintaining the record outweighed defendant's privacy interest. Section 2953.36 did not violate the Ohio Constitution because its purpose was to protect children from sexual offenses, a legitimate interest of the State. In addition, an insufficient amount of time had passed to determine whether or not defendant might become a repeat offender. Finally, the court found that because defendant was not eligible to have his conviction sealed, it was not error to enter judgment without hearing the merits of defendant's motion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The bank leased a building which was located within a planned commercial unit development (PUD). The bank applied for a permit to erect a freestanding, ground-mounted sign on the premises. Over the city's objection, a hearing examiner granted the permit. The city appealed to its planning commission. The commission reversed the examiner's determination, and further denied the bank's application for a variance. Upon the bank's appeal of the commission's action to the city council, the council upheld the commission's decision. The bank appealed the decision to the trial court, which reversed the council's action. The city appealed. The court held that since the bank was a single tenant of a single occupancy building within a PUD, Section 1171.12(B)(2)(b)(2) governed the sign request rather than Section 1171.12(B)(2)(b)(1), which applied to individual tenants within a multitenant building. The court found that ground-mounted signs were a permitted use within Section 1171.08(A)(2)(a)(3) as incorporated by Section 1171.12(B)(1)(b). The court held that the lower court's judgment was supported by a preponderance of the evidence, as a matter of law.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiff challenged the decision of the Clermont County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio) granting summary judgment for the newspaper on the basis of the statute of limitations of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3205.11 and immunity from suit under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2317.05.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The newspaper published an item summarizing a sheriff's report that indicated that a male subject was arrested for molesting his juvenile daughter. The accused was not the father of the girl, rather the girl's father had reported the offense to the police. The newspaper published a correction that it incorrectly stated the relationship of the accused with the victim. Plaintiff asserted that the newspaper acted with gross negligence and a complete disregard to his constitutional rights with the irresponsible news reporting and printing of untrue statements and facts about him. The court affirmed the judgment. The cause of action accrued on the date of publication. Plaintiff failed to file his complaint until more than seven months after the statute of limitations had run from the publication date. The court rejected plaintiff's argument that the one-year statute of limitations of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2305.1 for bringing a libel or slander action was unconstitutional because it was reasonable and was not unreasonably discriminatory. Because the claim was not filed within the applicable limitations period, the trial court properly granted summary judgment for the newspaper.</SPAN></P>

After a hearing, the trustees issued a notice that required the property owners to contribute one-half of the partition fence. The property owners initiated an action. The trial court affirmed the trustees' decision, finding that there was evidence that the property owners would benefit from the fence. In affirming the decision, the court found that the trial court's decision was supported by credible, competent evidence. A real estate appraiser who testified for the rancher stated that the fence would benefit the property owners by clearly marking the boundaries of the two properties, discouraging trespassing, and preventing the rancher's cattle from coming onto their property.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant driver sought review of the decision of the Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio), which granted the post-judgment motions of appellees, an injury victim and his spouse, to tax costs and for pre-judgment interest, and denied the driver's motion for set-off of collateral sources in an action to recover for loss of service and for medical expenses for injuries sustained in a rear-end automobile collision.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The victim was injured when the driver rear-ended his car. The victim incurred $ 2279.44 in medical expenses. The driver's adjuster offered $ 2,000 to settle the claim. After the victim refused the offer, the case proceeded to non-binding arbitration. Ultimately, the dispute went to trial and the jury returned a verdict for appellees. The trial court granted appellees' post-judgment motions to tax costs and for pre-judgment interest, but denied the driver's motion for set-off. The court found that the driver's assignment of error regarding the denial of her set-off motion was rendered moot by the ruling of the Ohio Supreme Court holding Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2317.45&nbsp;unconstitutional. Further, the driver failed to explain her failure to obtain her own medical examination report until after the arbitration hearing. The evidence showed that the driver did not make a good faith monetary settlement offer and failed to rationally evaluate her liability under appellees' claims. Thus, prejudgment interest was properly awarded. However, deposition costs were not authorized by statute, and arbitration fees were not taxable as costs under Cuyahoga County, Ohio, Ct. C.P. Gen. Div. R. 29.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff city appealed a judgment of the Common Pleas Court (Ohio), which declared that City of Seven Hills, Ohio, General Offenses Code, pt. 5, ch. 511 (1993) was unconstitutionally overbroad. The trial court granted a permanent injunction that narrowly regulated residential picketing in one residential area. Defendant rabbi filed a cross-appeal challenging the injunction's prohibition on more than one group protesting at the same time.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city's ordinance, essentially banned all residential picketing, was enacted after the city learned that a Nazi war criminal had been released from prison and was permitted to return to his home in the city. After several demonstrations near his home, the city sought the trial court's aid in enforcing the ordinance. The court concluded that the ordinance was unconstitutionally broad. It issued a permanent injunction that more narrowly regulated demonstrations in the area. The court agreed on appeal that the ordinance was not subject to a narrowing construction. The city showed it had a significant government interest in the protection of its citizens by preventing potentially dangerous confrontations in a residential neighborhood. The evidence thus supported the trial court's conclusion that the city had demonstrated a clear impending danger of irreparable injury to the city and its residents. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in framing the injunction so as to prevent opposing groups from demonstrating at the same time in the area. The contested provisions were content-neutral and burdened no more speech than necessary to serve a significant governmental interest.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed in its entirety the judgment of the trial court invalidating the ordinance as unconstitutionally overbroad, and substituting a permanent injunction regulating residential picketing in the specific residential area of concern. Accordingly, the rabbi's cross-appeal was overruled. The court ordered the issuance of a special mandate directing the trial court to carry the judgment into execution.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of the decision of the Belmont County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio), which entered a jury verdict convicting him of involuntary manslaughter under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2903.04(B) and of a firearm specification under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2941.141, and which sentenced him to three years actual incarceration on the firearm specification that was to be served prior to his sentence for involuntary manslaughter.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant consumed alcohol during the evening. Thereafter, the victim, defendant's friend, drove him home. After hearing pounding on his front door, defendant retrieved a handgun. As he opened the door, the gun went off, hitting the victim in the jaw and causing her death. A jury found defendant guilty of involuntary manslaughter, and the trial court sentenced him to three years actual incarceration on the firearm specification. On appeal, the court noted that the danger to innocent persons from firearms was the same whether the intoxicated person, such as defendant, was inside his home or in a public case. Thus, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2923.15 was not overbroad because it bore a real and substantial relation to a legitimate government objective. Further, the specification in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2929.71 applied where the crime underlying a conviction for involuntary manslaughter was a misdemeanor. Moreover, defendant's motion to suppress the results of an intoxilyzer test was properly denied. Finally, the court could not say that absent the alleged error in the trial court's instructions, the outcome of the trial would have been otherwise or that a miscarriage of justice occurred.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested after a police search of an apartment in which defendant was present yielded narcotics. Defendant was tried before a jury and convicted of drug trafficking. On appeal, the court affirmed defendant's conviction, reversed portions of defendant's sentence, and remanded for sentencing. The court held that the search of defendant, who was known to be a resident of the premises, was proper because such searches were within the scope of the search warrant issued for the premises. There was no error in the denial of defendant's motion for disclosure of a confidential informant because defendant failed to demonstrate the need for disclosure. The court additionally held, however, that the order of forfeiture of defendant's property was improperly entered because the trial court did not give defendant adequate notice in conjunction with the mandatory procedural requirements of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2933.43(C). While defendant should not have been automatically exempt from a fine merely for having filed an indigency affidavit, an independent determination of defendant's indigency was necessary before imposition of the fine.</SPAN></P>

Code &sect; 4301:1-1-53, possession of gambling devices on liquor permit premises.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The corporation was the holder of a liquor license issued by the Ohio Department of Liquor Control. Three Department agents conducted a warrantless administrative search of the corporation's premises and discovered tip tickets, raffle drawings, and electronic video machines. The Commission suspended the corporation's liquor license for 60 days or required forfeiture of $ 12,000. The trial court affirmed the Commission's order. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment and held that the Department was authorized to conduct warrantless administrative searches. The court ruled that the areas searched on the corporation's premises were reasonable. The court held that under Rule 53, it was the possession of the devices on permit premises that caused a violation. The court ruled that administrative violations of Rule 53 were different from criminal violations of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2915 in that the elements necessary to prove a violation were different. For an administrative violation of Ohio Admin.

The property owners claimed in a cross-appeal that the zoning ordinance amounted to a taking of their property for which they were entitled to compensation. The court determined from the wording of &sect; 23.09.10 that the criteria was within the delegation of authority to the city and that the board did not exceed its authority by requiring the property owners to prove all six criteria in order to obtain a variance for their property. The court held that the general language in &sect; 23.09.10 that required the board to grant variances so as to carry out the intent of &sect; 23.09.10 did not make the delegation of the authority to the board unconstitutionally vague.

The trial court allowed the chief to dismiss his appeal and to subsequently refile the appeal within a year. The trial court denied the board's motion to dismiss the appeal and ultimately determined that there was insufficient evidence to support the chief's termination but that there was enough evidence to support a suspension. The board's decision was vacated, and the matter was remanded for the imposition of a suspension. The board sought review, arguing that the trial court did not have jurisdiction. The chief also sought review, arguing that the board's action against him was void. On appeal, the court held that because the notice of appeal filed by the chief was not filed within ten days of his receipt of notice of his termination, the trial court did not have jurisdiction to review his appeal.</SPAN></P>

The court stated the trial court properly concluded that several assignments of error could have been raised at trial or on direct appeal.

</DIV>

The trial court reduced the judgment entered for plaintiff against both drivers because he received monies from collateral sources. The court held that the trial court erred in applying the collateral benefits statute,&nbsp;Ohio Rev.

The court also awarded post-judgment interest. The court held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying plaintiff pre-judgment interest because the driver in the first accident made a good faith effort to settle. The court held that the trial court did not err in denying the motions of the driver in the first accident for a new trial or for judgment notwithstanding the verdict for juror misconduct because the juror gave the driver's counsel a fair opportunity to question further or accept the juror knowing of her specialty in psychology. The court held that the driver failed to preserve his claimed error regarding the admission into evidence of the medical expenses chart.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The police obtained a search warrant for a duplex owned by the lessor. During the course of the warrant's execution, the duplex was extensively damaged. The city also evicted its tenants. The lessor commenced an action against the city and various officials for the damages sustained by his property. The trial court entered summary judgment in favor of the city and the officials. The lessor appealed from that judgment. On appeal, the court found that the trial court had abused its discretion under Ohio R. Civ. P. 15(A) when it denied the lessor's motion for leave to amend his complaint because he only sought to add more specific language to it. The trial court was also required to conduct an in-camera inspection of the information complied by the police department's internal affairs division before it denied the lessor's motions to compel discovery. The city and the officials were not entitled to assert governmental immunity as a defense because Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2744.03(A)(6)-(7) did not provide immunity for willful and wanton misconduct. However, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2923.01 did not provide a cause of action for civil conspiracy.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owners filed suit against the city to enjoin collection and recover illegal assessments collected by the city for street lighting. The trial court granted the property owners' motion to maintain a class action and to certify a class of taxpayers represented by the property owners. The class represented all former or present owners of real property abutting certain streets where the assessments were collected. The city appealed. The city argued that the trial court abused its discretion in certifying the matter as a class action where the Ohio Supreme Court previously held that a taxpayer could not maintain a class action on behalf of himself and all others similarly situated to recover taxes or assessments illegally assessed. The city alleged that the trial court's decision certifying this case as a class action was unreasonable, since doing so rendered the case more complex and its management more difficult. The court affirmed. The property owners had standing to bring the action on behalf of themselves and others. Additionally, the property owners satisfied the requirements of Ohio R. Civ.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The applicant was in the business of operating construction and demolition debris (CDD) facilities and submitted a permit application with supporting plans to the city for a landfill. Despite four revised applications for permit approval, the city denied the permit for various reasons, including the inconsistency of a CDD landfill to the master plan of the industrial corridor in which it was to be built, the nuisance the landfill would create due to fugitive dust, groundwater contamination, and the lack of a landfill leachate removal system. The applicant appealed the denial of its fourth permit, but the proceedings were stayed for the applicant to submit two more applications, which were also denied. The applicant again appealed. Although the court found nothing in the statutes which could be construed to require an applicant for a demolition debris landfill permit to first obtain the required permits from the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency, the court concluded that the trial court did not err in affirming the decision of the city where the applicant did not receive approval of all of the six city agencies specified in the Toledo, Ohio, Municipal Code &sect; 1713.03.</SPAN></P>

The employee was not licensed to practice law in Ohio. Appellee filed a successfully motion to dismiss in the small claims division based on the argument that the department was not represented by an lawyer. Ohio Rev.

Code &sect; 1925.18 permitted county departments of human services to appear in the small claims division for certain purposes by means of authorized employees. The court affirmed the judgment. Because the employee was not admitted to the Ohio bar, she could not practice law. The employee practiced law by preparing, signing, and filing the complaint, and by attesting on the complaint that she was representing the department. Because under Ohio Rev. Code &sect; 4705.01 only the Ohio Supreme Court dictated who could practice law in Ohio, the legislature could not so dictate. Consequently, the portions of Ohio Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After two semesters of the Board's voting to retain the teacher as a long-term substitute, she was not renewed for the 1991-1992 year. When filing grievances produced no result, plaintiffs filed an action against defendants, alleging that the teacher was entitled to notice of nonrenewal by April 30, 1991, and that absent timely notice, her employment rolled over. In addition, she alleged they represented she would be renewed and failed to do so based on her desire to get pregnant and her pursuits of reporting suspected child abuse. The trial court entered summary judgment for defendants as to plaintiffs' 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 claim, sexual discrimination claim, and defamation claim. After a trial, the remaining issues were dismissed on the basis that plaintiffs showed no right to relief. Plaintiffs appealed. The court reversed the trial court's order, concluding that the Board failed to give the teacher proper notice of its intention not to reemploy her, failed to hold a proper statutory hearing, and failed to give her proper notice of any ultimate decision by the board in violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;3319.11(G). The other issues were moot.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted on 44 counts of telephone harassment, abduction, pandering obscenity involving a minor, and felonious sexual penetration. On appeal, the court rejected defendant's first assignment of error that the trial court incorrectly failed to suppress evidence that was unconstitutionally obtained. First, the court held that the search warrant authorized the police officers to seize certain microcassette tapes. The court further ruled that the affidavit issued in support of the search warrant established probable cause because it stated that telephone records revealed that defendant made 95 outgoing calls to women, and eight of those women reported that the caller told them that if they did not do what defendant wanted, several black men watching their house would have raped them. Second, the court held that the trial court did not err when it failed to grant a mistrial when the trial court allegedly usurped the function of the jury when it made a comment that the identity of the perpetrator was not an issue. The trial court immediately corrected his misstatement and instructed the jury that it was their role to determine whether defendant's voice was on the tape.</SPAN></P>

Rather, it bore a reasonable relationship to the State's legitimate interests in punishment, highway safety and drug control.

With respect to his modification of sentence motion, defendant argued that the trial court had erred in denying that motion because state law limited his possible confinement to 15 years. On appeal, the court held that controlling state supreme court precedent held otherwise. As to his post-conviction petition, defendant argued that trial counsel had conducted an ineffective pretrial investigation, had ineffectively advised him to plead guilty, and had ineffectively failed to pursue a direct appeal. The court held that defendant's claims lacked merit. Defendant had waived the right to contest the issue. The guilty plea colloquy revealed that defendant's plea was voluntary and intelligent.

The court affirmed defendant's conviction, holding that the trial court did not err by receiving evidence of other acts in which defendant had engaged because the evidence was offered to show motive or intent and not to show conformity with defendant's character, the absence of the limiting instruction did not cause a miscarriage of justice, the phrase closely related in time did not need to be defined for the jury as its common usage was clear, the city code was not unconstitutional as applied in defendant's case, and there was sufficient evidence before the jury to support its conclusion that defendant's victim suffered mental distress.</SPAN></P>

The customer appealed the action of the trial court, which reduced the jury's award granted to the customer. The customer claimed that she suffered personal injuries in a fall at the grocery. The grocery challenged the decision of the trial court, which overruled the grocery's motion for a new trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The customer slipped in a puddle of water in the grocery. The customer's counsel asked the veniremen if they had any interest in an insurance company that insured the grocery stores against liability. The trial court correctly overruled the customer's motion during voir dire to strike the entire panel because only a limited discussion of insurance occurred. At trial, the customer's counsel informed the jury that she had no health insurance coverage, which the customer testified to lacking on direct examination. Although the grocery's motion for mistrial under Ohio R. Evid. 411 was overruled, the trial court gave appropriate cautionary instructions. The trial court correctly held that insurance was not an issue for the jury. A witness testified that five or 10 minutes had elapsed between when he saw the puddle and when the customer was injured. The court found that the evidence of other spilled items was relevant to whether the grocery used ordinary care to prevent and remove hazards. The trial court correctly overruled the grocery's motion for a directed verdict because of the customer's evidence from the witness that the grocery had actual or constructive notice of the water.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's judgment on all of the grocery's assignments of error.

The worker asserted that the housing authority was negligent in failing to maintain the premises where he was injured in a reasonably safe manner. The trial court returned a verdict in the workers favor and found that he was 40 percent negligent. The trial court, pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2744.05, offset the award by the amounts the Ohio Bureau of Workers' Compensation paid the worker as medical benefits and total temporary disability compensation and then reduced the remaining amount by the jury's verdict of 40 percent comparative negligence. The worker alleged that the statute was unconstitutional and that the offset was improper. The court held that the worker waived any claim regarding the unconstitutionality of the statute because he failed to raise that issue before the trial court. The court declined to consider the merits of the worker's assignment of error and its accompanying arguments for the first time on appeal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant entered a plea of guilty to a charge of drug abuse. His subsequent motion to withdraw his plea was denied. The trial court granted the prosecution's motion to dispose of certain seized property, including a gun. On appeal, the court found no evidence that the possession of the gun was unlawful as to defendant. However, the trial court failed to mention that defendant was indicted secretly on the charge of having a weapon while under a disability, and the weapon specified in the indictment was the weapon the prosecution wished to dispose of. The weapon was thus essential to the new indictment. On appeal of his conviction for having a weapon while under a disability, defendant asserted that the secret indictment was void because of a plea agreement. The court noted that there was no promise not to bring further criminal action against defendant for having the weapon. However, while the trial court believed that probation was not an option, this would only have been true if defendant had had possession or constructive possession of the gun, and it was only found when, in response to an officer's question, defendant stated that there was a gun upstairs in a bedroom.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The evidence indicated that defendant entered his girlfriend's apartment and then abducted and killed their baby. On appeal, defendant contended, inter alia, that the trial court erred in refusing to grant his motion for a mistrial after the girlfriend became hysterical while testifying because the prosecution showed her a picture of the dead baby. The trial court found that the girlfriend's emotional reaction to the picture of her baby did not deprive defendant of a fair trial by improperly influencing the jury. The court held that there was no clear, affirmative evidence to the contrary, and that holding would not be disturbed. Defendant also argued that he was deprived of a fair trial when a prosecutor threw the shirt that had been wrapped around the victim's neck at defendant during the prosecution's closing argument. The court found this constituted misconduct by the prosecution, but the evidence against defendant was overwhelming, thus reducing the likelihood that the prosecution's misconduct prejudicially affected any of defendant's substantial rights. Thus, the prosecution's conduct did not deny defendant a fair trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants raised and cared for dogs and other animals. Four years prior to the filing of appellants' action, appellees had filed a complaint against the landowner, seeking to enjoin him from establishing conditions on his property that were hazardous and offensive due to odor, fumes, and noise. An agreed judgment order under which the landowner agreed to keep his animals confined and to have them licensed was entered by a lower court. The landowner was twice found in contempt of the order, and the appellate court affirmed the judgments. In appellants' action against appellees, the trial court ruled that the cause of action was barred by res judicata due to the agreed judgment. In affirming the trial court's entry of summary judgment for appellees, the court ruled that while Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 519.21 provided that the board had no power to prevent appellants from using their land for animal husbandry, the landowner was not prohibited from agreeing to abate a nuisance, which is what he did through the agreed order. As such, res judicata barred appellants' action.</SPAN></P>

He also claimed that the trial judge improperly instructed the jury that the crime of gross sexual imposition did not require the state to prove specific intent and that he erred in refusing to give a requested instruction on intoxication. The court held that (1) the conduct forbidden by &sect; 2907.05(A)(4) was readily understandable and a person of ordinary intelligence would not have to guess as to its meaning; (2) the statute provided constitutionally adequate guidelines that enabled law enforcement officers to enforce it in an evenhanded manner; (3) the statute did not impinge upon constitutionally protected conduct; (4) specific intent was a required element of the crime of gross sexual imposition; and (5) defendant was entitled to an instruction on intoxication.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, who had been convicted of aggravated murder, aggravated robbery, attempted murder, and having a weapon while under a disability, filed a petition for postconviction relief under Ohio Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's convictions and sentences, including his death sentence, were affirmed on direct appeal. The court first held that the trial court had not abused its discretion in permitting the State to file its motion to dismiss four years after defendant filed his petition for postconviction relief. Defendant had specifically requested the trial court to withhold its determination of his petition until the United States Supreme Court ruled on a particular case; defendant had thereafter failed to file any motions requesting the trial court to rule on his petition; and the State had a plausible reason, inadvertence and the great volume of postconviction work, for its delay. Furthermore, although the trial court should have given defendant an opportunity to respond to the State's motion to dismiss, the error was not prejudicial because defendant's response would have done little to supplement the volume of material before the trial court. Next, the court held that the trial court did not err in failing to grant an evidentiary hearing or to reverse defendant's convictions. Most of defendant's claims were barred by res judicata, and the others were not supported by the evidence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted by a jury in an Ohio trial court of gross sexual imposition, felonious sexual penetration, and rape of a child under the age of 13.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The only evidence directly implicating defendant was the victims' testimony. The court first held that defendant's conviction regarding the friend was not against the manifest weight of the evidence. The State's questions did not encourage the friend to answer in a particular way, and her answers presented a detailed account of a series of events which, if believed by the jury, was sufficient to support the guilty verdict. The fact that the friend was not subjected to a medical examination and that she could not provide specific dates and times of the offenses did not preclude a finding of guilty. Next, the court held that the trial court acted properly in not treating the offenses as allied offenses of similar import. The offenses occurred at many different times, and the issue of whether multiple charged offenses were allied offenses of similar import arose only if the offenses were bound together temporally. Finally, the court held that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2907.02, applying to the rape of persons under 13, did not violate equal protection. All persons convicted of the same offense faced similar punishment, and whether a victim had reached puberty was irrelevant.</SPAN></P>

In a trial before the Franklin Court of Common Pleas (Ohio), the jury found the child 49 percent negligent and awarded damages accordingly. The trial court then offset the damages by the amount of collateral source benefits. The child appealed and the school district cross-appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The child alleged the trial court erred in its instructions to the jury, and that the jury's verdict and damage award was against the manifest weight of the evidence and contrary to the law. The school district contended that the trial court erred in holding Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;2744.05(c)&nbsp;unconstitutional and in not granting the school district immunity. The court held that the trial court committed various prejudicial errors and ordered a new trial. In so holding, the court found that 1) the trial court erred in failing to instruct the jury on assured-clear distance; 2) the trial court's jury instruction on negligence per se was confusing; 3) the trial court erred in not instructing the jury as to damages for claimed loss of enjoyment of life; 4) the trial court erred in not instructing the jury as to the bus driver's duty to continue to look; 5) the verdict, which awarded no damages for noneconomic damages was not supported by the evidence; 6) the trial court did not err in refusing to admit a video of the child as impeachment evidence; and 7) the trial court did not err in denying the school district political subdivision immunity pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2744.02.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, an employee and his spouse, sought review of a decision by the Scioto County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio), which granted summary judgment in favor of appellee employer in the employee's action alleging intentional tort, negligence, and breach of statutory duty and the spouse's action for loss of consortium after the employer fell from a beam and was injured.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee was working on a construction site for the employer when he fell from a beam and was injured. In the actions brought by the employee and his spouse, the trial court granted summary judgment in favor of the employer. On appeal, the employee and his spouse alleged that there were genuine issues of material fact precluding summary judgment. The court held that, in the employee's intentional tort claim, it was possible to show &quot;intent&quot; on the part of the employer through its failure to comply with statutorily required safety measures. The court found that, since there was evidence that the employer failed to provide lifelines, as required by Ohio Admin. Code &sect; 4121:1-3-03(J)(1), the employee raised a genuine issue of material fact, which precluded summary judgment. Since the spouse's loss of consortium was attached to the employee's claim, the court ruled that, with respect to the intentional tort claim, it also had to survive.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the summary judgment order in connection with the employee's intentional tort action and the spouse's loss of consortium claim, as it related to the alleged intentional tort, and affirmed the trial court's granting of summary judgment in favor of the employer on the employee's negligence and breach of statutory duty claims and the accompanying loss of consortium claims.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff patient sued defendants, her doctor, hospital, county medical society, and other doctors, alleging medical malpractice, negligent retention of an incompetent physician, and failure to report unproven surgical practices to the state medical board on the part of the county medical society. The common pleas court (Ohio) granted summary judgment in favor of the doctors, hospital, and medical society. The patient appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The patient was injured in a work related accident and consulted the doctor, an obstetrician/gynecologist, who performed vaginoplasty. The patient experienced pain during several activities, including urination and sexual intercourse. After filing a workers compensation claim for her expenses, she became aware that some of her difficulties were due to possible medical malpractice. On appeal, the patient argued that she had a private cause of action against the medical society under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4731.224(B), that her claim against the hospital was not barred by the statute of limitations, and that the other doctors were liable for their knowledge of her doctor's incompetence. The court held that the patient was not within the special class of persons protected by &sect; 4731.224(B) because the specific language of the statute referred only to individuals licensed or certified to practice medicine or surgery. Her claim against the hospital was timely because she filed within two years of the alerting event, her conversations with her attorney after a review of her medical records. The other doctors were not liable because they owed no duty to the patient.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed summary judgment in favor of the medical society and other doctors. The court reversed summary judgment in favor of the hospital.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Approximately two hours after the grandmother picked-up the child from defendant's home, she discovered bruises on the backs of the child's thighs. The ordinance under which defendant was convicted did not conflict with state law. Specifically, the fact that the ordinance did not continue on with the offenses set forth in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 2919.22(B)(3), (4) did not create a conflict. The ordinance was not overbroad or vague. The ordinance prohibited the act of abuse. Although not defined, the court held that the term was clear enough to give fair notice to defendant. Further, by the use of &quot;no person,&quot; the statute contained explicit standards to insure unarbitrary enforcement. Medical records concerning emergency room treatment for the child were properly admitted into evidence under Ohio Evid. R. 803(4), (8). A condition of probation that defendant not operate a day-care center, babysit, have a child under the age of 12 in her home unless supervised by the child's own parent, and complete a year of monthly training had a relationship to the crime and did not violate defendant's rights of free association, contract, or speech.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant dealer sought review of the judgment of the Court of Common Pleas (Ohio), which affirmed the denial of his used motor vehicle dealer license by appellee Ohio Motor Vehicle Dealers Board due to a felony conviction. The dealer had pled guilty to two counts of theft, both felonies of the fourth degree. The dealer's application for renewal of his dealer license was denied as a result of the felony conviction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The dealer asserted on appeal that the trial court erred in affirming the denial of his application because Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4517.12(B) and Ohio Admin. Code &sect; 4501:1-3-09, which denied licenses to felons convicted after December 8, 1986 but allegedly permitted licensure to felons convicted before that date, violated his right to equal protection. The court disagreed and found that the dealer's assignment of error was without merit and that the dealer's assertion that murderers and rapists who were convicted prior to 1986 were able to obtain licenses while individuals convicted of lesser felonies after 1986 were denied licenses was unpersuasive. The court held that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4517.12(B) and Ohio Admin. Code 4501:1-3-09 operated to automatically deny licenses to recently convicted felons and that such purpose was rational and legitimate. The court held that such denials reduced the number of felons engaging in automotive sales transactions, which effectuated the legitimate state interest of reducing the risk of consumer exposure to possibly unscrupulous sales practices.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's judgment, finding that while the insured's DWRF payments were not workers' compensation they were other benefits required of the insured by the workers' compensation law within the meaning of the policy because the DWRF was created by the legislature pursuant to Ohio Const. art.

Just before his arrest, defendant dropped the victim's credit card. After waiving his Miranda rights, defendant recanted a previous statement and admitted killing the victim, claiming that he killed her in anger after she tried to run him over with her car. A prosecution witness testified that defendant had visited her around 4:00 a.m. on the morning of the victim's death, his clothing wet, and told her that he had killed the victim for her bank card. Defendant challenged his subsequent convictions and death sentence. The court rejected all 20 assignments of error. In most instances, defendant waived all but plain error by failing to object. In particular, although the jury was erroneously precluded from considering whether defendant had proven the mitigating circumstances of his voluntary manslaughter affirmative defense, no jury reasonably could have acquitted defendant of aggravated murder and convicted him of the lesser crime of voluntary manslaughter.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State challenged a decision of the trial court (Ohio), which declared two legislative enactments governing Ohio's driving while under the influence law unconstitutional and ordered the State to proceed to prosecute defendant for driving under the influence according to the old language of the law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State's failure to file a motion for leave to appeal pursuant to Ohio R. App. P. 5 prompted the court to order the State to show cause why the appeal should not have been dismissed. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2945.67(A) gave the State a right to appeal in limited circumstances including the right to appeal from a decision granting a motion to dismiss all or any part of an indictment. The State argued that it could appeal as of right under &sect; 2945.67(A) because the trial court implicitly granted defendant's motion to dismiss by invalidating the mandatory penalties provided in the legislative enactments. The court rejected that claim because it required a construction of the trial court's order as meaning something other than what was stated. Likewise, there was no merit to the State's claim that its failure to comply with Ohio R. App. P. 5 did not preclude the court from granting a discretionary appeal. The requirements of Rule 5(A) were mandatory and jurisdictional. Thus, the State's failure to fully comply therewith divested the court of jurisdiction to grant leave to appeal, and the State could not cure the defect by filing a late motion for leave.</SPAN></P>

The court held that neither party's application for reconsideration called the court's attention to obvious error nor requested the court to consider issued that were not considered or not fully considered in the court's prior opinion, and denied both of them. Subsequent to the court's prior decision, the Ohio Supreme Court held that &sect; 2305.131 violated the right to a remedy guaranteed by Ohio Const. art.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowners' property was the subject of rezoning. The property was to be rezoned from industrial to agricultural. The landowners contested the rezoning, and the trial court granted summary judgment in favor of the town board. On appeal, the court held that the town board substantially complied with the notice statute, under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 519.12(D), and that the record did not indicate that any interested party did not have notice of the hearings. The landowners were not prejudiced by the slight defects in the notice of the public hearings. The landowners also argued that the zoning ordinance was an unconstitutional taking of their property. The court stated that a party who attacked a municipal zoning ordinance on constitutional grounds had to prove both that the enactment deprived him of an economically viable use and that it failed to advance a legitimate governmental interest. The court concluded that, although the landowners' argument that the rezoning would deprive them of an economically viable use had merit, the landowners were still unable to prove that the zoning failed to advance a legitimate governmental interest. Thus, the landowners could not prevail.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was represented at all stages of the criminal proceeding, but his counsel changed several times. Defendant was convicted of aggravated murder, aggravated burglary, and aggravated robbery, and was sentenced to death. On appeal, defendant argued, among other things, ineffective assistance of counsel, and improper waiver of his right to a jury trial. The court held defendant received ineffective assistance of counsel because counsel's performance was deficient, and the deficiencies resulted in prejudice to defendant, especially in the sentence he received. With regard to defendant's next contention, the court noted that the right to a jury trial could have only been surrendered upon a knowing, intelligent, and voluntary waiver. Because of defendant's mental condition, the court determined he was unable to make a knowing, intelligent, and voluntary waiver of his right to a jury trial.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Court of Common Pleas (Ohio) dismissed appellant patient's medical malpractice action against appellee doctor because she failed to file the supplemental affidavit required by Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2307.42(C)(2)(a) to document that she consulted with her regular physician about the validity of the malpractice action. The patient appealed, claiming that the statute conflicted with the state constitution and the Ohio Rules of Civil Procedure.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">While the patient's malpractice action was pending, the state supreme court ruled in another case that &sect; 2307.42 was in conflict with Ohio R. Civ. P. 11 and was, therefore, invalid and of no force and effect. In considering the patient's appeal of the dismissal, the court ruled that the decision of a court of supreme jurisdiction overruling a former decision was generally retrospective unless the decision met three separate factors. A high court decision was not applied retroactively if it was not clearly foreshadowed, or if retrospective application retarded the operation of the statute or if produced substantial inequitable results. The court ruled that none of those factors applied to the patient's case. The decision was foreshadowed by filing practices that were used before the statute's enactment. Further, retrospective application did not retard the operation of the procedural rules nor did it produce inequitable results. The doctor had the ability to defend himself under the general filing requirements as much as he would have had under the affidavit filing mandate of &sect; 2307.42. Accordingly, the court ruled that the statute was of no force and effect in the instant action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment and it remanded the matter to the court of common pleas with directions to vacate its prior dismissal of the action.</SPAN></P>

The trial court, acting as an appellate court, dismissed for lack of jurisdiction the corporation's appeal from a decision of the Board, which held that the corporation lacked standing to commence a complaint contesting a county tax assessment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The corporation had filed a complaint with the Board, through its president, contested the county tax assessment of real property owned by the corporation. Following a hearing, the Board issued a decision dismissing the corporation's complaint. In its decision, the Board concluded that the corporation lacked standing to commence the complaint since the corporation was not the titled owner of the subject real property in the year in question. The Board thereafter notified the corporation via certified mail of its decision to dismiss the complaint. The corporation received the notification. On appeal, the corporation's sole assignment of error was that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 5715.20, which did not require the Board to notify complainants of its decisions, was unconstitutional, and the Board was required to notify complainants of its decisions pursuant to Ohio R. Civ. P. 5(B). The court held that: (1) in accordance with Ohio R. Civ. P. 1(C), Ohio R. Civ. P. 5(B) was inapplicable to the notice procedure provided for in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 5717.20; and (2) therefore, the trial court did not err when it dismissed the corporation's appeal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a per curiam opinion pursuant to an accelerated docket, the court affirmed the judgment from the trial court and ordered that appellees recover costs from the corporation.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants harvested ginseng in a wildlife area and were charged with harvesting the plant without first obtaining permission from the Wildlife Division. The State later amended the complaint to charge defendants with violating Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 1518.24(B), which prohibited the harvesting of ginseng without obtaining permission from the person entitled to the ginseng. The amendment was made because it appeared that although the ginseng was growing on public land, it belonged to a third party who had planted it before selling the land to the State. Defendants were convicted and appealed, arguing that the provisions under which they were charged were unconstitutionally void for vagueness. The State argued that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 1518.24(A) was irrelevant because defendants had been charged with violating &sect; 1518.24(B). The court rejected that argument, stating that both &sect; 1518.24(A) and &sect; 1518.24(B) were part of the same statute regarding the harvesting of ginseng and had to be read together. The court found that when read together, the provisions failed to provide fair notice that harvesting ginseng on public property during the season without permission was forbidden.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court vacated the judgment of conviction entered against defendants and vacated the sentences imposed on them. The court entered final judgment of acquittal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury convicted defendant of trafficking in marijuana under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2925.03(A)(9) and possession of criminal tools under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2923.24. On appeal, the court reversed the conviction for possession of criminal tools. The court concluded that defendant could only have been found guilty of possession of drug paraphernalia pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2925.14(C)(1) because the statute was an exception to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2923.24. The court affirmed the conviction for trafficking in marijuana. The court found that the trial court properly denied defendant's motion to suppress evidence. A potential conflict of interest involving a detective's ownership of a corporation that provided undercover drug investigators was too removed from the search and arrest of defendant to constitute error. The court also found that a prosecutor properly exercised a peremptory challenge to a jury member because Ohio R. Crim. P. 24(D) did not limit peremptory challenges to only those jurors who had taken the place of an excused juror. The court concluded that a comment by the trial court did not amount to being a witness at trial as prohibited by Ohio R. Evid. 605.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 2305.11. The trial court granted the motion. The issue on appeal was whether the application of the tolling provisions of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2305.15 would have been unconstitutional because the surgeon was engaged in interstate commerce when he moved to another state for a new job. The court affirmed the summary judgment against appellants. The court found that appellants offered no evidence to establish that the surgeon absconded or concealed himself to avoid service of process. The court further found that the application of Ohio Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant repeatedly called and tried to see his ex-fiancee. Pursuant to defendant's ex-fiancee's complaints, defendant was charged with menacing by stalking pursuant to Ohio. Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2903.211. Defendant pleaded not guilty. After the trial, the trial judgment read the verdict that stated that defendant was guilty of menacing by stalking. However, the jury informed the trial court that that the verdict was incorrect. The trial court then polled the jury and the polling revealed that defendant was not guilty of menacing by stalking. The trial court, over the objection of defense counsel, called a mistrial on the fact that the deliberation process had been compromised. On appeal, defendant argued that the trial court improperly granted a mistrial. Specifically, defendant argued that not only did Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2945.77 mandate that the trial court order further deliberations by the jury, but also that contrary to the trial court's assertions, a manifest necessity to declare a mistrial did not exist. The court, agreeing with defendant's argument, held that the trial court abused its discretion in declaring a mistrial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The village had enacted zoning ordinances governing the types of businesses allowed to operate in certain areas. The business sent a letter requesting the proper zoning. However, the village did not accept the request because it was not on the proper form. The village then sought and received injunctions prohibiting the operation of the business based on its alleged violations of the zoning ordinances. The business appealed. The court found that the zoning ordinance was constitutional because the city official was obliged to utilize objective standards in making his determination of compliance. However, the court found that the city should have accepted the letter, instead of requiring a certain form. Thus, the court was unable to opine on whether the substance of the village's denial was valid because such was never considered by the city. Finally, the court found error in the trial court's ex parte grant of a temporary restraining order because the majority of the elements required under Ohio R. Civ. P. 65(A) were not met in that there was no showing of damage or injury or any showing of the efforts made to give notice to the business.</SPAN></P>

The common pleas court determined that the action was time-barred by a two-year statute of limitations in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2744.04(A). On an accelerated appeal, the court reversed the common pleas court's award of summary judgment to defendants. Plaintiffs had a common law right to bring their action and had standing to challenge the constitutionality of &sect; 2744.04(A) and by holding that &sect; 2744.04(A) was unconstitutional as applied to minors under the due course of law provisions of the Ohio constitution, Ohio Const. art.

Both parties had conceded at oral argument that, by considering the affidavits, the trial court had converted the motion to dismiss into one for summary judgment. The record revealed that the material offered by appellants was insufficient as a matter of law to establish that appellee left the state to conceal herself from service and did not create a factual dispute on that issue. Thus, in the absence of any demonstration of the grounds necessary to toll the limitations period, the trial court correctly ruled that appellants failed to file their claim within the required two-year time period.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was affirmed as modified to reflect the entry of summary judgment rather than a dismissal.</SPAN></P>

In their answer, appellees raised the affirmative defense of the statute of limitations. Appellees filed a motion to dismiss on the grounds that appellants' action was untimely under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2744.04(A). The Portage County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio) granted the motion. Appellants sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The March 18, 1993, complaint alleged that the son, a minor, had been injured on January 14, 1991, while attending a high school industrial arts class. The disability statute,&nbsp;Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2305.16, specifically incorporated Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2305.10, the two-year limitations period for bodily injury claims. The trial court held that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2744.04(A), which provided a two-year statute of limitations for claims against political subdivisions, applied to minors and dismissed the complaint. The court affirmed. The legislature had enacted a separate provision dealing exclusively with actions against political subdivisions. That section had to be utilized when appropriate, even though the limitations period was the same. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2305.16 did not toll the running of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2744.04. By its express terms, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2305.16 applied to the statutes of limitations found in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 2305.04 to 2305.14, 1302.98 and 1304.29. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2744.04 contained no reference to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2305.16 or any disability provisions. Ohio Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was pulled when an officer noticed that the validation sticker on his car did not appear normal. The officer ran a computer check of the plate and registration and determined that the driver had been suspended. Upon approaching defendant, he noticed indicia of drunkenness. Defendant subsequently took a breath analysis and was subjected to subsequent testing before he was charged with driving under the influence. The court found that the trial court had properly denied defendant's motion to suppress the results of the intoxilyzer test on grounds it was the fruit of an unlawful search and that the breathalyzer test results were obtained or admitted in violation of the rules of evidence and his constitutional rights. The court found that the Fourth Amendment was not implicated in a computer inquiry in connection with a license plate because defendant had no reasonable expectation of privacy with regard to his plate. Further, the court concluded that the testimony of the officer who administered the breath test sufficed to satisfy the foundational requirements for the test under Ohio Rev.

The school board was not entitled to a directed verdict on the issue of the volunteer's negligence because reasonable persons could have reached more than one conclusion in that regard.

Defendant's motion for treatment in lieu of conviction was granted, and defendant was placed in a two year after care program. When defendant violated the conditions of his rehabilitation period, he was sentenced to incarceration. Defendant's motion for post-conviction relief was denied. He appealed, contending that the indictment was fatally defective because it did not name the victim of the aggravated robbery and did not contain a statement of the required mens rea. The court held that the victim's identity was not an essential element of the crime charged, and the indictment was not rendered unconstitutionally vague in its absence. The reference to a theft offense as defined by statute was sufficient to incorporate the elements of those crimes, including the required mental state of knowingly, as elements of the crime of aggravated robbery. Defendant's claim of ineffective assistance of counsel was meritless because defendant failed to sustain his burden of showing that his counsel's representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness.</SPAN></P>

After his conviction, defendant appealed, contending that the trial court had erroneously instructed the jury that it could convict defendant based upon a lesser mental state than &quot;knowingly,&quot; which was required to sustain a conviction under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2925.03(A)(7). Specifically, defendant contended that the instruction left the jury with the impression that it could find him guilty if his actions were merely probable or foreseeable. The court affirmed the conviction, holding that the mental state &quot;knowingly&quot; was cast on probability, and that anything short thereof would create an unwarranted defense to a culpable mental state of a criminal mind. Because the trial court's definition of &quot;knowingly&quot; was word for word the definition in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2901.22(B), it was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

Defendant challenged both the conviction and the sentence raising numerous points of error. The court held that each allegation of defendant was meritless, as the convictions were supported by the weight and sufficiency of the evidence. In addition, the Ohio Supreme Court had previously ruled on defendant's challenges to the death penalty, and declared the penalty to be constitutional.

Code Ann. &sect; 5747.01(A)(1) was not discriminatory and did not violate the United States Constitution. Appellees, tax commissioner and attorney general, opposed the taxpayer's action seeking a declaratory judgment and injunctive relief.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Section 5747.01(A)(1) taxed out-of-state municipal bonds, but it did not tax Ohio municipal bonds. The taxpayer requested that his claim be certified as a class action and claimed that Ohio's tax violated the Commerce Clause and 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983, and the lower court entered summary judgment for appellees. The court held because Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 5747.01(A)(1) benefitted the State of Ohio as a sovereign and was not designed to benefit its citizens at the expense of out-of-state residents, &sect; 5747.01(A)(1) did not violate the Commerce Clause. The court ruled that because the taxpayer had no claim under the Commerce Clause, his &sect; 1983 claim and his request for class action certification were moot. Additionally, to the extent that the taxpayer was seeking to obtain monetary damages under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983, his claim failed because he had sued the state officials in their official capacities, and state officials were not persons under &sect; 1983 who were liable for damages.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the lower court's entry of summary judgment, which held that the taxpayer had no cognizable claims against the commissioner or the attorney general.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the property owner argued that (1) the trial court erred in affirming the board's denial of its application because the board's decision was not supported by a preponderance of reliable, probative, and substantial evidence; and (2) the board's action in denying its application for a conditional use permit was unconstitutional because the portion of the zoning resolutions which authorized that action was vague and constituted an unconstitutional delegation of legislative power. Upon review, the court found the property owner's arguments without merit. The board's denial of the conditional use application was supported by a preponderance of substantial, reliable, and probative evidence. The property owner did not establish that the proposed gravel pit operation posed no adversity and no harm to the neighborhood. At best, its evidence tended to establish that the adverse effects would have been minimal. Elisabeth Township, Ohio, Zoning Regs. &sect; 21.08(4) set forth sufficient criteria to guide the board in the exercise of its discretion and was therefore constitutional as applied to the property owner.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State challenged a criminal judgment from the Scioto County Common Pleas Court (Ohio), which dismissed all counts in two indictments issued against defendant for making or uttering false or forged prescriptions in violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4728.61(C) and Medicaid fraud in violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2913.40(B). The trial court found that the indictment was fatally defective.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Officers arrested defendant in his medical office for writing two drug prescriptions in exchange for sexual favors. The grand jury added additional offenses. The court rejected the State's argument that the trial court waived its right to object to the indictment. The court noted that the rule provided that defendant's failure waived defenses and objections, but it did not specify whether a court's failure waived defenses and objections, and the rule permitted a court to grant relief from the waiver. The court found no evidence that the trial court abused its discretion by raising the indictment defect issue after the jury was sworn. The court pointed out that Ohio R. Crim. P. 12(B)(1) stated that objections based on defects in the institution of the prosecution had to be raised prior to trial, but Rule 12(G) granted the trial court discretion to hear such objections raised during trial. The court observed that because Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4729.61(C) did not plainly indicate a purpose to impose strict liability, recklessness was the mental state required for culpability under the statute. The court concluded that the indictments failed to state all the elements of the offenses.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, a real estate developer and a builder, appealed a decision from the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio), which granted summary judgment in favor of defendants, a village, its building inspector, and an engineer, in plaintiffs' action that sought, in part, a writ of mandamus requiring the village to vacate its order to cease certain construction and to issue building permits for a residential subdivision.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the village approved preliminary plat maps, drainage problems arose. Plaintiffs' efforts to correct them did not satisfy the village, and the village though its mayor issued a stop work order. The local ordinances of the village did not provide for an appeal from the mayor's decision to any local zoning board or authority. The court affirmed and held that the proper procedure to test an official's refusal to issue a building permit was by way of an appeal to the court of common pleas of the county in which the principal office of the political subdivision was located after all administrative remedies of appeal, if any, were exhausted. The fact that no administrative appeal was available did not excuse compliance with Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2506.01. Here, a mandamus action should have been brought in Madison County, not Franklin County. Plaintiffs' negligence claims against the village and its inspector were barred by a government function immunity under &sect; 2744.01(C)(2)(p) as well as under &sect; 2744.03(A)(6). Last, as to the engineer, plaintiffs failed to comply with Ohio R. App. P. 3(D) and their notice of appeal, which omitted the judgment appealed from, was defective.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the order that granted summary judgment in favor of defendants in plaintiffs action that sought, in part, a writ of mandamus requiring the village to vacate its order to cease certain construction and to issue building permits for a residential subdivision.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant and the State both appealed from a judgment of the Common Pleas Court, County of Summit, Ohio, by which defendant was convicted of murder, possession of a firearm, and receiving stolen property. The State claimed that the trial court improperly dismissed a physical harm specification. Defendant claimed that there was insufficient evidence to support his conviction and that the trial court erred in refusing to give a jury instruction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant and an accomplice stole a gun. Several weeks later, defendant loaded the gun, placed it against the victim's chest, and pulled the trigger after he told the victim that the bullets were blanks. Defendant claimed that he was carrying the gun for protection and that he believed that the bullets were blanks. The trial court granted defendant's motion to dismiss the physical harm specification with regard to the receiving stolen property charge and the trial court also dismissed the firearm specification. The trial court refused defendant's request to instruct the jury on mistake of fact. On appeal, the court held that the physical harm and firearm specifications were improperly dismissed. The court reasoned that defendant was guilty of receiving stolen property at the time of the homicide under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2913.51 because he retained the gun. Therefore, the court held that the specifications were appropriate. The court held that the evidence was sufficient to support defendant's conviction because the jury was justified based upon the evidence in finding beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant purposely acted to cause the victim's death.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the order by which the trial court granted defendant's motion to dismiss the physical harm and firearm specifications relative to the charge of receiving stolen property, vacated the sentence imposed, and remanded the case for resentencing on defendant's conviction for murder with a firearm specification and receiving stolen property with both a firearm specification and a physical harm specification.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a pedestrian walked into the path of defendant's car, an officer making an investigation noticed that defendant had a moderate odor of alcohol. Defendant admitted she had been drinking. Defendant filed a motion to suppress the results of the breath test and field sobriety tests, statements she made, and the testimony of the police officers who stopped her. She claimed that there was no lawful cause to detain her without probable cause for an arrest without a warrant. She also claimed that the tests were unconstitutionally coerced by a threat of the loss of a license, which was not sanctioned by Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4511.91. She argued that the tests were not conducted as required by &sect; 4511.19(B) and Ohio Admin. Code &sect; 3701-53-02. On review, the court found that the conviction could not stand because under Ohio R. Crim. P. 47, defendant should have been given an hearing in which the State was required to prove that the breath alcohol test was administered in compliance with administrative regulations. The court concluded that defendant's detention was for the purpose of an arrest, so she should have been given a hearing on all the issues she raised in the motion to suppress.</SPAN></P>

Code &sect; 3505.24 to provide that whenever assistance was being rendered to a voter in a private setting, the assistance had to be provided by two election officials of different political parties. The court held that Ohio Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The wife had suffered injuries as the result of a fall on a wooden walkway. In 1993, the wife and the husband had commenced a personal injury action against the contractor who designed the walkway in 1981. The contractor had made a motion to dismiss the action because the claims were time barred by the 10-year statute of repose under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2305.131. The trial court agreed that the claims were time barred and granted summary judgment in the contractor's favor. On appeal, the wife and the husband contended that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment because &sect; 2305.131 was unconstitutional in that they were denied a reasonable time in which to pursue their claims. The court held that the question of whether the action was instituted within a reasonable time was a factual determination that turned on the circumstances of each case. The court agreed with the trial court that the delay of 22 months was not reasonable under the facts of this case. The court concluded that the trial court was correct in finding the claims were time barred as a matter of law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, a corporation, an individual, a coalition of investigation and security companies, and a state association of private investigators sought review of the judgment of the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio), which granted summary judgment in favor of appellee Tax Commissioner of Ohio in appellants' action seeking to enjoin the Commissioner from collecting the sales tax authorized under Ohio Rev. Code ch. 5739.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Ohio legislature amended its sales tax provisions to include private investigation and security services within its definition of sales subject to the tax but exempted special duty services performed by off-duty police officers, deputy sheriffs, and peace officers employed by the state or a political subdivision. Appellants initiated an action for injunctive and declaratory relief alleging that the new sales tax violated their equal protection rights under Ohio Const. art. I, &sect; 2 and U.S. Const. amend. XIV. The parties filed cross motions for summary judgment and the trial court granted the Commissioner's motion. Appellants sought review. The court stated that whether the tax provision was discriminatory depended on whether there was a rational basis for the classification used therein. The court rejected appellants' argument that they and the exempted class were in all relevant respects alike. The court found that there were numerous differences between the classes with respect to the greater mandatory level of training required of the exempted class, their ability to carry firearms, make warrantless arrests for misdemeanors, and their visibility as uniformed law officers.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court decision that granted summary judgment in favor of the Commissioner in appellants' action challenging the constitutionality of the sales tax amendment that subjected private security and investigation services to the sales tax but exempted the same services performed by off-duty police officers, deputy sheriffs, and peace officers.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The county treasurer filed a complaint seeking the foreclosure of real property due to a tax delinquency. The trial court entered judgment against the property owners. The property owners sold the property to a buyer who defaulted in the payment of the delinquency and the property was sold at public sale. A savings and loan bought the property and requested a confirmation hearing. The trial court denied the property owners' motion for a continuance and entered an order confirming the sale. The court affirmed, determining that the property owners failed to file any assignments of error as mandated by Ohio R. App. P. 16. The property owners gave up all interests in the land when they sold it. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 5721.19(F)(1) was not unconstitutional because the extinguishment of dower rights was not an unconstitutional taking of property without due process of law. Dower was not a property right, but merely an inchoate interest, governed by statute, that vested upon the death of the spouse. The constitutional issue was not raised in the trial court and was not able to be raised for the first time in the court.</SPAN></P>

Affirming, the court said that the company suffered no taking that could have been compensated. The company did not prove that the disapproval denied the company all economically viable uses of the property. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 1509.08 was a proper exercise of the State's police power in restricting the time and place of drilling. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in finding that the Board's order was supported by reliable, probative and substantial evidence and in accordance with law. Although the company may have been inconvenienced by not being able to drill the wells until a time that the drilling would no longer have interfered with another company's mining operations, that inconvenience was not sufficient to constitute a taking.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inspector was inspecting the elevator in the basement of the landowner's premises. While he was inspecting the hydraulic system, the inspector claimed that the nip points and pulley were unguarded. He leaned over to see something and slipped, causing him to put his hand down on a belt and resulting in the amputation of his fingers. The landowner's employee stated that he did not slip, but reached deliberately into the machinery, and that the guard was in place. The court reversed the grant of summary judgment on the inspector's negligence claim. Construing the evidence favorably to him, if there was no guard in place, as required by the Ohio Administrative Code, whoever was responsible would be negligent per se. The trial court improperly weighed the inspector's comparative negligence, which was the jury's function. The court held that the elevator was an improvement to real property pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2305.131, and consequently, the statute of repose barred the inspector's products liability claims. His failure to warn claim was barred because the inspector could observe the condition of the elevator and was aware of the hazard.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a capital case, defendant challenged a decision from the Hamilton County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio), which entered a jury verdict convicting him of five counts of aggravated murder and sentencing him to death, pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2929.01. Among the many issues raised on appeal, the court considered whether the trial court committed reversible error during the trial, as well as whether the sentence was proper and proportionate.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When he was 19, defendant stole a purse from a woman at a hospital, took a cab to her home, stole valuables, and set three fires knowing that children were in the house. Five children died. A jury convicted defendant of aggravated murder and sentenced him to death. On appeal pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. 2929.05(A), the court addressed defendant's assignments of error, independently considered whether the aggravating circumstances outweighed mitigating factors, including defendant's age, family history, and mental condition, and determined whether the sentence was proportionate to penalties imposed in similar cases. Addressing assigned errors, the court held that the cab driver's identification was properly admitted, that the trial court correctly conducted voir dire, that the prosecutor's comments, to which the trial court sustained objections and for which it issued curative instructions, did not deprive defendant of a fair trial, and that denial of a mistrial was not an abuse of discretion. The court's independent review of sentencing cured any error due to failure to merge the aggravating circumstances, which outweighed any mitigating factors. The sentence was proportionate.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State appealed the judgment of the Hamilton County Municipal Court (Ohio), which granted defendant's motion to dismiss the charge against him for menacing by stalking, in violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2903.211, on the ground that &sect; 2903.211 was unconstitutionally vague because the definition of &quot;pattern of conduct&quot; as set forth in &sect; 2903.211 was vague and lacked specificity.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The complainant filed a complaint claiming that defendant had knowingly driven around her apartment complex repeatedly after having been told not to bother her, and that he had done so for approximately six months. She also claimed that defendant followed her to events and that she had called the police when she saw defendant watching her through a window. On appeal, the court reversed the dismissal of the charge of menacing by stalking, and remanded on the ground that defendant had failed to meet the criteria necessary to have raised a facial challenge to the constitutionality of the stalking statute,&nbsp;Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2903.211. The court found that if the facts were proven at trial, defendant's conduct would have been clearly prohibited under &sect; 2903.211, thus precluding a determination that &sect; 2903.211 was vague in all of its applications. The court ruled that one to whose conduct a statute clearly applied could not successfully challenge it for vagueness. Because defendant's facial challenge failed since he had not raised a challenge to &sect; 2903.211 as it applied to the facts at hand, the court did not address the standard of vagueness.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed and remanded to the trial court for further proceedings on the charge against defendant for menacing by stalking.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of a judgment of a trial court (Ohio), based upon his plea of no contest, to the charge of violating Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2925.03(A)(1), selling or offering to sell a controlled substance, cocaine, in an amount less than the minimum bulk amount. The offense was raised to a felony of the second degree pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2925.03(C)(1) because it was committed within 100 feet of a juvenile.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court denied defendant's motion to compel the State to disclose all grand jury transcripts of all prosecutions for trafficking in drugs in less than bulk since enactment of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2925.03(C)(1), which enhanced the offense of trafficking to a felony of the second degree if committed within 100 feet of any juvenile or within the view of any juvenile. The basis for defendant's motion was his contention that the grand jury transcripts would demonstrate the arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement of the enhancement statute. The court found that the request was too broad and was based on speculation that there were other complaints where the offense proscribed in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2925.03(A)(1) could have been enhanced but was not. Because defendant failed to show a particularized need that outweighed defendant's need to preserve the secrecy of grand jury proceedings, the motion was properly denied. In addition, the court ruled that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2925.03(C)(1)(b) was not unconstitutionally vague because a person of ordinary intelligence had a reasonable opportunity to know what was prohibited.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction for selling or offering to sell cocaine within 100 feet of a juvenile.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner's request for postconviction relief pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2953.21 was denied without a hearing. Petitioner claimed that he was entitled to a hearing because he had new arguments and new evidence. The court held that petitioner was properly denied a hearing because all of his claims were based on arguments of ineffective assistance of trial counsel based on evidence at trial, which could have been raised on appeal. Because petitioner missed his opportunity to raise those issues or those issues were indirectly raised in earlier appeals, they were res judicata. Thus, claims, including those admitted by the attorney, that the attorney failed to object to certain evidence, file certain motions, argue petitioner's intoxication as mitigation, present other experts to testify, or adequately voir dire the jurors were all claims that could have been raised in earlier appeals and were not. Thus, because the basis for petitioner's request for relief was not supported by any evidence outside of the record, he was not entitled to a hearing. Thus, petitioner's constitutional rights were not violated either. The trial court adequately examined the record in its decision.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant police officer sought review of a decision from the Montgomery County Common Pleas Court (Ohio), which affirmed the officer's discharge by appellee city from the city police force. The officer argued that he had not receive a timely hearing, that a civil service board member who voted to dismiss him had not been present during the hearing, and that he had not been provided certain discoverable documents.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The officer's dismissal arose out of an incident in which he had allegedly assaulted a non-resisting, handcuffed suspect by slamming his head to the floor while holding him in a chokehold. The court rejected all but one of the officer's points of error on appeal. The court held that the officer had failed to show that the delay in the proceedings against him had been unreasonable or that he had been prejudiced by the passage of time. The court found no error in the casting of a vote to dismiss the officer by a member of the board, who had not been at the hearing, because the officer had failed to show that the member had neglected to review the entire record before voting. However, the court agreed with the officer that he had been improperly denied receipt of a copy of the report on the incident from the commander of the internal affairs bureau. The trial court should have conducted an in camera examination of the report to determine if it had been discoverable. The court determined that the evidence supported the claims that the officer used unnecessary force and lied to internal affairs, and therefore the trial court had not abused its discretion in upholding his discharge.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court's judgment and remanded the case for an in-camera examination of certain documents that the officer had argued should have been provided him during discovery. The court also reversed the portion of the trial court's judgment awarding costs against the city and held that if the city remained the prevailing party on remand that the trial court should order each party to bear its own costs.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owners lived on opposite sides of an alley. Appellee property owner, without prior permission from the city, landscaped part of the unpaved portion of the alley with trees and shrubs. The property owners later built a garage with access to and from the alley and complained that the landscaping hindered their access to their new driveway from the alley. The city ratified the addition. The court found that the landscaping did not create a nuisance, as a matter of law, because there was no evidence that the landscaping had caused injury. The city's duty to keep its streets free from nuisance was met because the street was not unsafe for customary vehicular or pedestrian travel and did not cause injury to a person using the street in an expected and ordinary manner. The court found no taking because appellants were not denied a pre-existing right of access when the landscaping was added. Appellants had access to their property; optimum access was not a right available on demand to other members of the public. Because no property right of appellants was impaired by the landscaping, they had no standing to challenge a city ordinance regarding improvement of city streets.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Educational Management Information System (EMIS), Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3301.0714, was a statewide computer information network for Ohio public schools. Appellants, boards of education, challenged its constitutionality and brought a declaratory judgment action against appellees, state board, department of education, and superintendent. The lower court invalidated the portion of the statute that required school officials to collect staff social security numbers but upheld the remaining portions. The court affirmed and held that in the statute, the legislature gave the state board explicit instructions on what information to include in the system. It left to the guidelines only the procedures for how to identify, collect, implement, and report the data. The rule tracked the statute and described, in general terms, procedures to be developed to implement the EMIS information system. The rule, therefore, was constitutionally sound. The court stated that the guidelines were properly exempted form the Administrative Procedure Act.

Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 2744.03(A)(6), 2744.03(A)(7). Further, the evidence did not show that the city officials had acted wantonly or recklessly with regards to the citations that were issued. Finally, the court did not find any genuine issue of material fact on the defamation claim. The city officials were entitled to a qualified immunity on the statements that they had made concerning the citations because such statements were made in their official capacities. The court affirmed the summary judgment that was granted in the city officials' favor.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The dispute arose over the proper and constitutional zoning of approximately 300 acres of real property located in the village, and had been before the court twice. The village passed an ordinance zoning the entire property single-family residential, and that ordinance was declared invalid and unconstitutional. The village claimed that they have cured infirmities in its latest rezoning ordinance. The court noted that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2721.09 placed the burden on the village to demonstrate why the change in zoning was permissible. The village argued that the circumstances of the zoned property had changed and therefore the rezoning that had already been struck down twice was now constitutional, but the court held they failed to show that there had been significant changes in the property. Specifically, the trial court concluded that the only significant physical changes to the area surrounding the property diminished the property's suitability for development as a single-family residential area. Since the property owners were the successors in interest of the original parties, the trial court did not err by permitting their substitution as parties.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment holding the village's zoning ordinance unconstitutional and declaring that a prior injunction was enforceable.</SPAN></P>

In 1989, the lessee corporation challenged the auditor's tax valuation, but the complaint was dismissed. In 1990, the lessor corporation again filed a complaint, but the board concluded that the lessor corporation was precluded from filing a tax valuation complaint because it found that the lessor and the lessee corporation were the same entity, and Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 5715.19(A)(2) prohibited the filing of more than one tax complaint by the same person within a three-year period. Appellants sought review of the 1990 complaint's dismissal. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's judgment. The court found that regardless of whether the corporations were the same entity, the complaint was properly dismissed because the lessor corporation had filed a complaint in 1988, which was within the three-year period prohibited by &sect; 5715.19.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer purchased a large number of shares from his employer under a stock option. The taxpayer paid less for the stock than the market price. The taxpayer failed to declare the difference between the market value of the stock and the price he paid as income on his city income tax return. When the city contended that the amount was taxable, the taxpayer paid under protest. He argued that the option yielded an unrealized gain derived from intangible property. A tax board's decision in favor of the city was affirmed by the trial court. In affirming, the court determined that the exercise of the stock option was properly taxed. Pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 718.01(F), the city was not permitted to tax intangible income. However, an employee's receipt of stock options from his employer was a form of compensation that was taxable under &sect; 718.01(F). Although the employee failed to receive cash income when he exercised the option, he still received increased economic and financial wealth. It made no difference that the compensation was paid in stock rather than money. Finally, the court held that the tax board properly calculated the amount of income attributable to the taxpayer.</SPAN></P>

First, the court declined to review the claimant's challenge to the constitutional validity of the statute under which her case was decided because she failed to first raise that issue at the trial court level. Second, the court held that she was not entitled to benefits merely because the jury found that she contracted her disease &quot;in the course of her employment.&quot; Pursuant to Ohio Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate claimed that the chaplain injured him and inflicted cruel and unusual punishment upon him in violation of his Eight Amendment rights. The appellees' evidence showed that the inmate, although struck by the chaplain, only had redness on his arm following the incident and that the inmate did not need medical treatment. An affidavit submitted by the inmate stated that the inmate had been advised during a prison hearing that the chaplain had previously assaulted another inmate. Thus, the inmate claimed that he had a &sect; 1983 claim against the warden based upon the warden's failure to properly supervise the chaplain. Upon appeal, the lower court's judgment was affirmed. The court held that the inmate had only suffered a de minimis injury that had not violated his Eighth Amendment rights. Because the inmate's affidavit only related inadmissible hearsay concerning the chaplain's past history, the affidavit was not admissible, and the inmate's &sect; 1983 supervisory claim was not cognizable.

The jury determined that the employer had not committed an intentional tort. The employee asserted error in the jury instructions given by the trial court. The court affirmed. The employee's instruction outlining various safety regulations was a correct statement of the law but the regulations themselves did not entitle the employee to relief and his proposed jury instruction could have misled the jury. An instruction on the employer's duty to provide safety equipment was properly rejected as a misstatement of the law. And, the employee's proposed instruction under Ohio Rev. Stat.

The trial court entered summary judgment in favor of the builders. On appeal, the court held that the condominium's action for failure of the builders to perform in a workmanlike manner was barred by the statute of limitation under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2305.09. The court held that it was clear from the record that the condominium had decided to dredge the lake before engaging in the services of the specialists and it was a decision that might have caused damages to the condominiums, negating the specialists' negligence. The court held that under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2305.09(C) the statute of limitations barred the condominium's cause of action for fraud. The court held that the condominium's action for damages had merit because Ohio Rev.

The town board filed a complaint with to increase the assessed value of the three parcels. The county board increased the values based on the sale price of the two parcels.

The town board sought review of the order and asserted that the BTA erred in its reevaluation of the unsold parcel. The court held that the BTA had broad discretion in its consideration of evidence of valuations. The BTA held that evidence of the sale price of the two parcels was the best evidence of their value, but it noted the lack of improvements and evidence that established comparability in the valuation of the unsold parcel. The court held that the BTA had not abused its discretion in noting the inconsistencies between the parcels when it excluded the unsold parcel from the valuation of the other two parcels. The increased value of the two parcels did not violate appellees' rights to equal protection. The auditor was permitted to reappraise the parcels at any time.</SPAN></P>

Defendant further complained that his confession to the murder was admitted into evidence, that the Ohio death penalty scheme was unconstitutional, that an undisclosed witness was allowed to testify, and that gruesome photos of the victim, who he shot with arrows, were admitted into evidence. The court held that the trial court properly submitted both murder counts to the jury and allowed the jurors to be excluded. The court also held that there was sufficient evidence to prove that killing the female victim was part of an admitted scheme to take her car to use in a subsequent robbery in which he killed a clerk. The court further held that the confession was voluntary, that Ohio's death penalty scheme was constitutional, and that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the photos and the witness's testimony.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the ruled that pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2744.04(A), an action against a political subdivision, which included a school district, to recover damages for injury caused by any act or omission related to a governmental or proprietary function, had to be brought within two years after the cause of action arose. The action was not filed within two years, and the student's minority did not toll the statute because Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2305.16 did not set forth minority as one of the disabilities tolling the statute for actions against political subdivisions.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In two consolidated cases, defendant appealed from judgments of the Eastern Area County Court (Ohio), which found her guilty of driving under the influence of East Palestine, Ohio, Ordinance 434.01(A)(1), and of telephone harassment in violation of East Palestine, Ohio, Ordinance 636.14(b)(5).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested after she drove to the East Palestine, Ohio, police station. Upon her arrival, she was arrested for public intoxication, but she was later charged with driving under the influence instead. Her motion to suppress evidence was overruled, and she was found guilty at a bench trial. Her other arrest occurred after she made approximately eight calls to an East Palestine, Ohio, 911 emergency line within a 30 minute span. On review, the court found no basis for reversal. The court rejected the argument that the arresting officer lacked probable cause or a warrant to arrest her for driving under the influence. Defendant demonstrated no prejudice from what she argued was an invalid and illegal arrest. Moreover, an in-court admission was derived prior to the arrest. Finally, the court rejected the claim that East Palestine, Ohio, Ordinance 636.14(b)(5) was unconstitutional on the basis that it was overly broad. There was no First Amendment violation. The court concluded that the evidence was sufficient for a rational trier of fact to determine that all elements of East Palestine, Ohio, Ordinance 636.14(b)(5) were proven beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order requiring the owner to vacate the rental property arose in connection with her failure to comply with orders to repair certain aspects of the property. On review, the owner contended that Akron, Ohio, Environmental Health Housing Code ch. 150 was vague and overbroad in both the terms it used to define violations and in providing guidelines for enforcement. The court, however, found that the property right asserted by the owner was not a First Amendment right subject to overbreadth protection. Moreover, the ordinances did not implicate the owner's constitutionally protected conduct; thus, she could not be heard to complain of the vagueness of the law as applied to others. The Code was clear and the owner failed to bring her property into compliance, even though she had been given two years to do so. In affirming, the court concluded that sufficient evidence existed to support the board's findings. There was testimony that the front porch could collapse at any time, endangering anyone who used it. Further, there was testimony establishing a large number of necessary repairs, including wiring, plumbing, ceilings, walls, gutters, downspouts, roofing and siding.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The administrator argued that the trial court erred in not finding the employee negligent per se for traveling left of center on the highway. The employee had swung left in an attempt to avoid hitting the decedent when he realized that she was not stopping. The administrator contended that the jury should have been instructed that if the employee's vehicle was overloaded, he was not proceeding in a lawful manner, and therefore, the decedent was not negligent for failing to yield the right-of-way to him. In affirming, the court held that: (1) because there was evidence that the decedent pulled directly into the employee's lane, and the employee had one to two seconds to decide what to do, reasonable minds could conclude that he exercised ordinary care in traveling left of center in an attempt to evade the decedent's vehicle and that the accident was caused by her negligence in pulling into his lane of travel; (2) violation of the statute prohibiting driving a truck over a certain weight did not cause a driver to lose the right-of-way to a person entering a highway from a driveway; and (3) the employee was the real party in interest for his claim of lost wages and medical expenses.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was held in jail 92 days when the judge signed the entry after trial, but only 90 on the date of trial. Accordingly, he was not denied his right to a speedy trial. Second, the court found that there was no delay that was presumptively prejudicial and unconstitutional. The delay between arrest and indictment was not excessive and ultimately defendant was tried within 90 days of his arrest, as required by the speedy trial statutes. Third, allowing testimony about defendant's prior conviction into evidence did not rise to the level of plain error. Last, defendant argued that there was insufficient direct evidence to allow for a reasonable connection to the circumstantial evidence. The court found that the evidence against defendant, while circumstantial, was substantial. It could convince the average mind of defendant's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant insurer appealed a judgment by the Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio), which found that the insurer breached the terms of its underinsured motorist insurance contract with plaintiff insured and engaged in bad faith. The jury awarded $ 35,000 for damages on the breach of contract claim and $ 75,000 in damages on the bad faith claim, but declined to make an award of punitive damages. The insured cross-appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The insurer argued that the insured failed to notify it of her accident within the required 24-month period. The insured testified that she did contact her agent within days after the accident, and he assured her that she needed to do nothing further. The court held that (1) summary judgment was not proper because there was a genuine issue whether the insured gave notice, (2) the answer to an interrogatory that the insured did not give proper notice was not inconsistent with the verdict because the jury could have found that the insured waived the requirement, (3) there was ample evidence to support the finding of bad faith in the processing of the claim, (4) there was sufficient evidence of damages sustained as a result of the bad faith to support the award of $ 75,000, (5) the instruction on waiver was proper because the testimony raised a jury question, and (6) the expert testimony was properly admitted under Ohio R. Evid. 703. Regarding the insured's cross-appeal, the court held that (1) the jury instruction regarding punitive damages failed to apprise the jury of the bases for finding actual malice, and (2) an instruction should have been given regarding hedonic damages.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment, with the exception of the instruction regarding punitive damages and the refusal to instruct the jury on the availability of hedonic damages, which were reversed.

The court affirmed the trial court's judgment. Nothing on the record indicated that defendant was &quot;in custody&quot; when he made the statements in issue. He was not prejudiced by the failure to provide findings of fact, because the court was able to review the issue on the merits. The trial court did not err in the admission of the other evidence complained of. From the court's review of the record, the judgment was not against the manifest weight of the evidence because the court could not have said that the jury lost its way and created a miscarriage of justice.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the conviction and sentence of the trial court for one count of murder with a firearm specification, two counts of having a weapon while under disability, and three counts of felonious assault, each with a firearm specification. The court ordered that a special mandate issue directing the common pleas court to carry the judgment into execution. Costs were taxed to defendant.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the conviction and sentence because the trial court committed no prejudicial error with regard to jury charges. The court noted that victim-impact statements were not absolutely precluded in death penalty cases. The trial court did consider defendant's youth and lack of a prior record.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The car buyer drove his car off the road and into a tree. A fire ensued and he suffered severe injuries. He sued the manufacturer for damages resulting from those injuries, alleging that a defectively designed electric fuel pump sent gasoline into the engine compartment where it ignited. The jury awarded the buyer compensatory damages. The trial court reduced that award, deducting amounts received from other sources, and taxed the manufacturer costs. On appeal, the manufacturer challenged the trial court's exclusion of evidence that would have tended to prove that no accidents similar to the car buyer's had ever occurred with its car. In affirming, the court held that the manufacturer did not offer the substance of the evidence in one instance and failed to show the scope of an expert's knowledge in another instance. Therefore, the court held that the manufacturer did not preserve the issue for appeal. The court reversed the trial court's reduction of the buyer's award, holding that the statute relied upon by the trial court, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2317.45, was unconstitutional. The court affirmed the order for payment of costs, finding no objection in the trial court record.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Common Pleas Court, County of Lorain (Ohio) convicted defendant of engaging in a pattern of corrupt activity; two counts of theft; two counts of receiving stolen property; possession of marijuana; possession of criminal tools; and two counts of aggravated trafficking in marijuana in violation of Ohio Rev. Code &sect;&sect; 2923.32(A)(1), 2913.02(A)(1), 2913.51(A), 2925.03(A)(9), 2923.24(A), 2925.03(A)(7) respectively. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant stole items from an auto maker with a market value of almost four million dollars. He also trafficked marihuana. At defendant's request, the seven charges in the indictment were tried before the court without a jury. The court held that defendant's Fourth Amendment rights were intact; police acted on the search warrant under the reasonable belief that it was valid and constitutional. The court held that the warrant was a non-fundamental violation of Ohio Crim. R. P. 41 and that the evidence seized under such a warrant was admissible at trial. The court found that police properly seized video equipment because defendant was unable to produce receipts and an informant had reported that defendant stole audio equipment. The court held that it was reasonable for police to conclude that someone stealing audio equipment was also stealing video equipment. In reversing one theft conviction, the court held that defendant was not properly indicted for retaining government money because police willingly gave defendant's agent the cash to buy marihuana.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the conviction of one count of theft and vacated the corresponding sentence. In all other respects, the court affirmed the trial court's judgment. The court found that there were reasonable grounds for the appeals. The court taxed costs of the appeal to defendant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After Cincinnati, Oh., Municipal Code &sect; 907-5 was enacted, which made it a crime to trespass on the premises of a medical facility, the anti-abortion activists were charged for refusing to leave the premises of a medical center after being asked to do so by personnel. The appellees sought to dismiss the charges on the ground that the ordinance violated the state and federal constitutions. On review of the dismissal of the charges, the court held that the conduct that led to the arrests of the appellees under &sect; 907-5 constituted expressive conduct. Therefore the defendants were entitled to invoke the First Amendment in a prosecution for a violation of the ordinance. However, enforcement of &sect; 907-5 to exclude the appellees from engaging in expressive conduct on the premises of the medical facility did not constitute a violation of the First Amendment because the right to engage in expressive conduct was not absolute and because the forum was private property, the owner had a right to exclude others. Further, the ordinance was not unconstitutionally vague or overbroad because the ordinance did not implicate a substantial amount of protected conduct and was neutral on its face.</SPAN></P>

The lottery commission contended that the trial court erred in holding that the inclusion of the prize payment in the taxpayers' Ohio taxable income constituted a retrospective application of the law, in violation of Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 28.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayers won the Ohio lottery. The taxpayers were Kentucky residents at the time and had no contacts with Ohio. The taxpayers never received the winnings in Ohio because they were mailed to them while out of state. The court held that, under former Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 5747.02, which was applicable to the taxpayers, Ohio lottery winnings of nonresidents were not subject to Ohio income tax. The court also found that the application of amended &sect; 5747.02 to the taxpayers' lottery winnings would have violated the Due Process Clause of the United States Constitution and would have constituted a retroactive law in violation of the Ohio Constitution. The taxpayers did not reside in Ohio, the taxpayers did not receive the winnings in Ohio, and the taxpayers did not earn the proceeds in Ohio. The taxpayers did not earn the proceeds in Ohio because the proceedings were considered nonbusiness income of a nonresident, which meant that the taxpayers were not subject to Ohio income tax.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs' counsel attached to the complaint an affidavit stating that he had only recently received information that a claim existed against the physicians and that he had insufficient time to obtain a consultation with a physician to review the facts soon enough to timely commence an action upon the medical claim. The physicians filed motions for summary judgment. Plaintiffs opposed the motion, stating that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2307.42(C)(1)(b) and (C)(2)(a) permitted them an additional 90 days to obtain an expert witness and that the trial court was prevented from entertaining a motion to dismiss prior to 90 days after the complaint was filed. When the 90 days passed without plaintiffs filing a supporting affidavit, the trial court granted summary judgment to the physicians. The court held that because &sect; 2307.42 was in conflict with Ohio R. Civ. P. 11, it was invalid and of no force and effect. Accordingly, the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the instant matter such that it did not have jurisdiction to grant the physicians' summary judgment.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The patient was told she was pregnant by the doctor and the two discussed various methods of handling the pregnancy, including abortion. After the patient left, the doctor told the nurse to contact the patient. The nurse called the patient's parents' home and told the patient's mother about the patient's pregnancy and that she had sought medical advice regarding an abortion. This extremely upset the patient's family and caused the patient to suffer humiliation and mental injuries. The patient filed an action against the doctor, a second doctor, and the nurse. The trial court dismissed the action for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. The trial court denied the patient's motion for leave to amend and the patient sought review. The court found that the patient did state a claim for breach of privilege and intentional infliction of emotional distress, but not for invasion of privacy or negligent infliction of emotional distress, that the patient's action against the nurse was prematurely dismissed, and that the patient should have been granted leave to amend her complaint.</SPAN></P>

She was not at home when the eviction notice was issued and had no prior notice or an opportunity to have been heard regarding the violations. When she returned home, she ignored the citation, and she was arrested for her refusal to leave the premises. On appeal, the court affirmed defendant's convictions, holding that the order to vacate the premises was proper and sufficient to form a basis of her conviction of criminal trespass. The court determined that there was sufficient, competent, credible evidence in the record to support the trial court's finding that the sewer gas and natural gas lines in defendant's home were improperly capped and presented an immediate and serious danger. Hence, the zoning inspector had authority to order the premises vacated pursuant to a city ordinance. The notice to vacate, which was bright orange and affixed to the doors of the house, clearly notified the average person to leave the property. Because defendant's underlying arrest for criminal trespass was supported by a constitutional emergency eviction, her conviction for resisting arrest was also lawful.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The health care provider filed a lawsuit on an account against two debtors. Default judgment was granted against both debtors. The health care provider proceeded with execution of the judgment and filed a garnishment of personal earnings against one of the debtors. That debtor requested a wage hearing after her wages were garnished. The referee determined that pursuant to recent amendments to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. ch. 2716, only 12 percent of the debtor's &quot;net wage&quot; could have been attached. The health care provider objected to the referee's report, but the objection was overruled and the trial court adopted the report of the referee. On appeal, the court held that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. chs. 2716.021, 2716.051 violated the Equal Protection Clauses of the United States and Ohio Constitutions and were therefore unconstitutional. Although the statutes reflected a governmental interest, that is, regulation of the insurance industry and providing aid to students, there was no overwhelming governmental interest in the garnishment laws of Ohio except that they afforded due process to the debtor. The court observed that &sect; 2716.05 permitted garnishment of up to 25 percent of earnings.</SPAN></P>

The judgment ordered the husband to pay a certain amount of child support, refused his request for an offset of child support credits during the time he had physical custody of the child, and it held that the amount of spousal support he paid to appellee wife was not used in the calculation of child support.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The husband had physical custody of the child during the summer and the wife had physical custody for the remainder of the year. The husband argued that he was entitled to an offset of his child support obligations during the period he had physical custody because the intent of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 3113.215(C) and 3109.04(K) was to provide a mandatory deduction of child support payments for each parent who had custody under a shared parenting plan. He also contended that in calculating his child support obligation, his monthly gross income should be reduced by an amount equal to his monthly spousal support obligation. The lower court's judgment was affirmed in part and reversed in part. The court held that (1) the husband was entitled to child support credit for the duration of his custody of the child, unless the trial court found that such a credit would be unjust, inappropriate, and not in the best interests of the child, and (2) pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3113.215(A)(2), the husband was not entitled to have his spousal support payments to the wife deducted from his gross income, and added to her gross income, for the purposes of calculating child support.</SPAN></P>

The matter was remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, the worker and the wife, challenged a decision from the trial court (Ohio), which reduced appellants' award in their personal injury action against appellee corporation after convening a post-verdict collateral benefits hearing pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2317.45. The corporation cross-appealed from the jury's decision finding it liable. The jury awarded the worker damages and the wife received an award for loss of consortium.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The worker was substantially burned while employed by an independent contractor hired to weld plastic sheets to the inside of a 75-ton sand bin used in the corporation's manufacturing. The court pointed out thatOhio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2317.45 was unconstitutional, sustaining appellants' assignments of error. The court opined that the worker knew the plastic would burn, but there were risks of which he was not made aware: welding around the plastic was not recommended, the plastic dust was an unusual fire hazard, and the hose blew oxygen rather than compressed air. The court noted that whether the oxygen hose was properly coded green was for the jury to resolve. The court pointed out that the corporation could not claim that the worker lacked permission to use the hose when he could use extension cords and other equipment. The court concluded that a jury could reasonably have found that the corporation's negligence was a proximate cause of the worker's injuries and that because he was unaware of the dangers, recovery was not barred, and any negligence of the independent contractor was reasonably foreseeable and did not completely remove the effects of the corporation's negligence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court's opinion to the extent that it subtracted collateral benefits from the amount of the jury verdict. The court remanded for reinstatement of judgment in favor of the worker in the amount of the jury verdict discounted by the percentage of negligence the jury attributed to the worker.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Department of Human Services received a complaint alleging abuse against defendant's children. Defendant and her husband had four children. Defendant admitted to performing oral sex on all four children when changing their diapers. She admitted that as the children grew older, she would have them rub her breasts and vagina, and perform cunnilingus on her. She stated that these things happened 200-300 times with each child. On appeal, the expert's opinion was supported by sufficient underlying data. The expert testified to sufficient information relayed to her from the children to support her opinion that the children suffered from emotional problems consistent with those caused by sexual abuse. There was abundant evidence to support the convictions in the case. Defendant confessed to the acts alleged in the indictment, both in writing and on videotape. Further, the statute of limitations was tolled during anytime when the corpus delicti remained undiscovered. The corpus delicti of crimes involving child abuse or neglect was discovered when a responsible adult had knowledge of both the act and the criminal nature of the act. The court affirmed the judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant homeowner filed separate challenges to appellee city's zoning board's denial of a variance to build a boathouse and denial of a variance to build a boat dock, and to the constitutionality of the ordinance, but the trial court consolidated the cases. The trial court affirmed the denial of the boathouse variance and found no constitutional infirmity in the ordinance. Appellant sought review. The trial court later dismissed without prejudice the boat dock challenge for lack of prosecution. Appellant sought review of this decision. The court affirmed the denial of the boathouse variance and the ordinance decision because appellant failed to file a timely challenge. The court found that the appeal filed when the trial court first ruled on the boathouse and ordinance issues was premature because, in the consolidated case, the trial court's order was final but would not become appealable until the trial court rendered its decision in the boat dock case.

He fell through the roof and sustained a fatal injury. The administrator commenced a wrongful death action against the employer. Her original complaint contained language that could be construed as alleging an intentional tort of the employer's part. She was granted leave to amend her complaint on two separate occasions. The amended complaints did not include an intentional tort claim. The trial court granted the employer's motion for summary judgment. In its opinion, the trial court noted that the administrator's claims were couched in terms of negligence and product liability. It also stated that the negligence claim was barred by the employer's immunity provisions of Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 35 and Chapter 4123 of the Ohio Revised Code. With regard to the product liability claim, the trial court stated that the evidentiary materials did not support a dual capacity theory. It also stated that the amended complaints, unlike the original, did not give notice of an intentional tort claim. On appeal, the court adopted the trial court's opinion and affirmed its judgment.</SPAN></P>

Moreover, there was sufficient evidence that the touching was of a sexual nature. Defendant's claim of cruel and unusual punishment under the Eighth Amendment, U.S. Const. amend.

Code Ann. &sect; 2907.06, defendant's own admissions were sufficient to satisfy that requirement. Moreover, there was no error in the admission of hearsay evidence regarding a telephone conversation between the victim and her mother because the victim's statements during that conversation were excited utterances under Ohio R.

The treasurer of the school board replied that her contract was not renewed due to the financial uncertainty of the school district for the upcoming school year. The teacher demanded a hearing in accord with Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3319.11. At the hearing, she was not allowed to call witnesses on her behalf or examine or cross-examine anyone else, but the superintendent submitted an affidavit with supporting exhibits. The trial court denied the teacher's motion to strike the affidavit and granted summary judgment to the school board. On appeal, the court reversed and held that the school board failed to comply with the teacher evaluation procedures of &sect; 3319.11.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed after the common pleas court denied his post-sentencing motion to withdraw his plea of guilty. He pleaded guilty to aggravated assault with a physical harm specification in a bargain in which the State withdrew a charge of felonious assault. Four of defendant's five claimed errors were rejected without discussion of the merits because defendant, while he filed a praecipe, did not identify the hearings for which transcripts were required, and no transcripts of relevant proceedings were filed with the record on appeal. The court held that because the lack of transcripts prevented it from determining whether error had been committed, the first four assignments of error were denied. The court also denied the fifth assignment of error, rejecting defendant's claim that the statute prohibiting aggravated assault was unconstitutional as applied to him and that he should have been charged with domestic violence. In so ruling, the court found that because aggravated assault and domestic violence were not allied offenses of similar import as they each may be committed separately, defendant was not entitled to relief under the Chippendale rule.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested when he went to pick up proceeds from drug sales as part of his involvement in a drug trafficking operation between New York and Cleveland. Defendant was convicted of various drug related charges. On appeal, the court rejected defendant's claim that Ohio's RICO Statute was void for vagueness and affirmed the convictions. The court held that defendant's association with other drug dealers and &quot;mules&quot; for the purpose of transporting 30 pounds of cocaine to Cleveland and thousands of dollars in drug proceeds to New York was clearly within the conduct prohibited by the statute. Defendant had notice that such conduct was illegal. The court rejected defendant's claim that his warrantless arrest was illegal. The court held that, based on the totality of the circumstances, the police had probable cause to believe that defendant was a member of the drug trafficking enterprise that they were investigating. Defendant was not prejudiced by counsel's joint representation of defendant and his brother, who was also involved in the crime. Defendant consented to such representation, and the record disclosed no prejudice.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother argued that the absence of a provision allowing her to recover attorney fees after she established her right to child support through a paternity action, when Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3105.18(H) permitted recovery of attorney fees incurred by a party to a divorce action in establishing an entitlement to child support, was a denial of equal protection. The trial court denied the mother's request for attorney fees because there was no statutory authority for awarding attorney fees in a paternity action, and the court affirmed. The court held that the policy of permitting a party to a divorce action to recover attorney fees incurred in establishing a right to child support while not permitting a party to a paternity action to do so had a substantial relationship to an important state interest. Under &sect; 3105.18(H), attorney fees were recoverable in a divorce action as a part of spousal support, which arose out of division of the respective financial contributions of the parties to a marriage. The same rationale for permitting recovery of attorney fees did not exist in a paternity action because there was no termination of a partnership between the mother and father.</SPAN></P>

In reviewing the matter, the court determined that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in awarding $ 6,000 in spousal support to the wife because the trial court considered the factors that were set forth in Ohio Rev.

The court also held that the it was not necessary to show that the husband purposefully or intentionally violated the divorce decree in order to find the husband in contempt for his failure to make the spousal support payments. However, the court found that the $ 5,000 penalty exceeded the statutory limit allowed pursuant Ohio Rev.

Plaintiff contended that the trial court erred in finding that Ohio Rev.

Evidence established that defendant was out of the state on business for 18 days. Accounting for the 18-day tolling period, plaintiff's complaint was still untimely filed.

In reviewing the matter, the court determined that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in awarding $ 6,000 in spousal support to the wife because the trial court considered the factors that were set forth in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3105.18(C)(1), which set forth factors to be considered when determining the appropriateness and reasonableness of spousal support. The court also held that the it was not necessary to show that the husband purposefully or intentionally violated the divorce decree in order to find the husband in contempt for his failure to make the spousal support payments. However, the court found that the $ 5,000 penalty exceeded the statutory limit allowed pursuant Ohio Rev. Code Ann &sect; 2705.05, and remanded the matter with instructions to modify the penalty in accordance with the statute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment except as to the amount of the penalty for the contempt. The court remanded the case with instructions to the trial court to modify the contempt fine in accordance with statutory limits.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Services Board sought to permanently terminate the father's parental rights over his three minor children and to obtain their permanent custody for adoption purposes. The trial court considered the custodial history of the children, the recommendations of the guardian ad litem, and the relationships maintained by the children with their foster parents and each other, and found that the children needed a secure placement which could only be achieved through permanent custody and adoption. It concluded that it was in the best interests of the children to permanently terminate the father's parental rights. He appealed, urging that &sect; 2151.414(E)(5), (6) was unconstitutional as a denial of equal protection and due process of law. The court disagreed and affirmed. It explained that the father had not challenged the trial court's findings, which were based on the father's history of incarceration and his total lack of support and commitment to his children. As the trial court's findings supported the termination of the father's parental rights under the statute, the court concluded that his constitutional challenge was not ripe for review.</SPAN></P>

The court found that a fundamental right was not involved and, accordingly, the rational basis test was applicable.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The operator claimed that the ODLC &quot;converted&quot; the property of the carryout when the ODLC seized and destroyed the operator's alcoholic beverages. The trial court found that the operator sold the alcohol from his carryout without a valid liquor permit, that he lost any right of ownership, and that he failed to demonstrate any right to relief. On appeal, the court held that neither the Ohio nor the United States Constitution nor the applicable state statute,&nbsp;Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2933.41(c)(1) and (2), supported automatic forfeiture of the items seized by the ODLC. The court found that the ODLC presented no evidence at trial to show that the alcoholic beverages seized were illegally manufactured. To the contrary, the testimony of witnesses at trial indicated that the items were legally manufactured. Nor did the ODLC present any evidence that the alcoholic beverages were illegally acquired by the operator. Rather, the evidence suggested that the operator acquired the items legally from licensed distributors. Finally, the operator had not been convicted of a crime related to the items seized. Instead, he was acquitted of the charges related to the seized items.</SPAN></P>

ODOT argued that &sect; 163.53 was inapplicable because the equipment and facilities required to be moved were located on a public street. ODOT further contended that, because it did not acquire title to the property on which the power company's facilities and equipment were located, there was no acquisition as required by &sect; 163.53. The court found that &sect; 163.53 did not define &quot;acquisition&quot; and rejected ODOT's argument that acquisition was synonymous with fee simple title. The use of the property was inconsistent with the power company's use of its easement and, as such, constituted an acquisition for purposes of reimbursement for relocation expenses.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's convictions were upheld on direct appeal, and the United States Supreme Court denied his petition for a writ of certiorari.

On appeal, defendant argued that the trial court erred in dismissing the petition without granting him an evidentiary hearing, that the claims were not barred, and that they had merit. The court held that the petition did not raise substantive grounds for relief and that, therefore, the trial court correctly dismissed it without conducting an evidentiary hearing pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2953.21. Res judicata barred 53 of defendant's claims which were raised, or reasonably could have been raised, at trial or on direct appeal.

Defendant argued on appeal that the trial court reversibly erred when it permitted the State to cross-examine him from exhibits not produced in discovery and failed to instruct the jury regarding his mental state. The court affirmed defendant's convictions. The court held that even if the trial court's decision to allow the State to use tax returns for cross-examination was an abuse of discretion, the error was harmless because defendant already knew the tax returns, inasmuch as he signed them. Additionally, the tax returns were not used as substantive evidence of the crimes with which defendant was charged, but to impeach his credibility on cross-examination. The court also held that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2923.32(A)(1) and (2) alleged strict liability offenses. Accordingly, the trial court was not required to instruct the jury as to the culpable mental state with regard to the instant RICO charges, and its failure to do so was not error.</SPAN></P>

The Hamilton County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio) entered judgment for employer on the wrongful discharge claims, except as to one female employee, and entered judgment for female employees on their claims under &sect; 4112 et seq.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Employer argued that the trial court erred in denying its motion for summary judgment on female employees' sexual harassment claims. The court held that summary judgment was properly denied, as there were questions of material fact regarding whether or not the sexual harassment continued after the manager was warned to stop by his supervisor. Specifically, there was evidence that the manager continued to tell sexually based jokes and dropped his pants while boasting of his genital size. Secondly, employer argued that the trial court was barred from awarding money damages to female employees, as they never specified the amount of damages sought. The court held that employer waived its claim of error, as it failed to raise the lack of any specific monetary demand, despite adequate notice of claims for damages, until its motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict. Third, employer claimed that the trial court erred in awarding punitive damages, as there was no evidence to justify the award. The court held that there was no error, as a jury could have reasonably come to differing conclusions as to the adequacy of employer's response to female employees' complaints of harassment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant real estate developer sought review of the decision of the Court of Common Pleas, Geauga County (Ohio), which declared that appellee township's zoning amendment was a constitutional restriction upon the use of the real estate developer's land. The trial court also declared that the amendment was not retroactive legislation and that the real estate developer failed to acquire a vested right to plat his lots as a nonconforming use.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the developer obtained planning commission approval for its final subdivision plats, it began construction drawings and clearing road rights-of-way. The township sent the developer notice that a zoning amendment would increase minimum lot size requirements from one and one-half to three acres, but the amendment gave the developer two years after the enactment of the amendment to record a plat showing a nonconforming use. The developer failed to proceed with construction except for laying roadbeds and ditching, and it was unable to record its plats within the two-year completion term. The court found that the zoning amendment did not confiscate the developer's property merely because it reduced the developer's anticipated return on his investment. The developer also failed to meet its burden of establishing that the area restriction exacted an extraordinary burden upon it. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment, finding that two years was a reasonable completion term and that the developer did not have a vested interest in the zoning classification in the absence of a substantial nonconforming use of the property prior to enactment of the zoning amendment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The City's ordinance required any property owner who owned commercial or industrial buildings or apartment building with more than four suites to contract for the private collection of garbage. The property owner alleged that the ordinance constituted a denial of equal protection in violation of Ohio Const. art. I, &sect; 2 and art. II, &sect; 26. The City challenged the trial court's jurisdiction to review the constitutionality of the ordinance because the property owner failed to serve the state attorney general with his complaint. The court vacated the judgment holding the ordinance unconstitutional. The failure to serve the attorney general, as required by Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2721.12, with a copy of the proceeding precluded a common pleas court from rendering relief. There was no dispute that the property owner failed to serve the attorney general with a copy of his complaint. Therefore, the judgment holding the ordinance unconstitutional was void.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was on medication because she had suffered a miscarriage 10 days earlier. Her daughter called the police to come to the house because defendant did not seem well. When the police arrived, defendant fired several shots through the door. The pellets from the shots injured the police officers. Defendant was subsequently convicted by a jury of six counts of felonious assault and two counts of vandalism. On appeal, defendant argued that she was denied effective assistance of counsel, errors in the jury instructions, and that her sentence was cruel and unusual punishment. The court disagreed and affirmed the conviction. First, the court held that the attorney properly raised the defense of diminished capacity instead of &quot;not guilty by reason of insanity,&quot; because expert witnesses would not have testified that defendant was insane under Ohio law. Second, the court held that defendant was not entitled to jury instruction on the lesser-included offenses of aggravated assault, assault, and negligent assault because the evidence did not support such findings. Third, the court held that if defendant was found to have diminished capacity, criminal punishment was still authorized.</SPAN></P>

Crim. P. 12, two counts of an indictment charging defendant with having a weapon while under disability pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2923.13.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State charged defendant based upon his previous indictment for felonious assault. After defendant was acquitted of the felonious assault charge, he filed a motion to dismiss the second indictment, having a weapon while under disability, on the ground that once the underlying disability was resolved in his favor, the disability could no longer be used in the trial on the disability charge. In its appeal, the State alleged that the pretrial dismissal was improper because the State was precluded from proving its case. The court held that because defendant's motion to dismiss raised a question of law only, the issue was capable of determination prior to trial. Moreover, a decision as to defendant's guilt or innocence would not have assisted the trial court in its determination of the validity of the defense. The State also argued that the trial court erred in its finding that because defendant had been acquitted of the charge forming the basis of the disability charge, he could not be convicted of having weapons while under disability. The court upheld the trial court's decision, finding that by virtue of the acquittal, the prior indictment no longer had any operative effect.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the dismissal of the indictment. The court also certified the record of the case for review and final determination of the issue of whether an acquittal on a prior charge that formed the basis of a charge against defendant of having a weapon while under indictment precluded a conviction on the disability charge.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff independent insurance agents corporation challenged an order of the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio), which dismissed its action against defendant Superintendent of the Ohio Department of Insurance seeking a declaration that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 3905.01(B) and 3905.04 was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a prior action filed by the corporation, the Ohio Supreme Court ruled that &sect;&sect; 3905.01(B) and 3905.04 did not prohibit the licensing of applicants affiliated with non-insurance financial institutions. The corporation claimed that &sect;&sect; 3905.01(B) and 3905.04 were unconstitutional because any determination made by the Superintendent whether an applicant was the alter ego of a precluded affiliate would constitute an unconstitutional exercise of legislative power. The trial court dismissed the action under the doctrine of res judicata. The court held that res judicata did not apply as a bar to the corporation's claim for relief. The prior action and the current action involved two distinct claims for relief. The claim for relief in first action was a declaratory judgment seeking an interpretation of &sect;&sect; 3905.01(B) and 3905.04. The issue was whether applicants for insurance licenses were automatically precluded from licensure merely because an affiliate would be precluded. The current case sought a determination of the constitutionality of &sect;&sect; 3905.01(B) and 3905.04. The issue of constitutionality was not in issue in the first action and was not determined.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the order dismissing the corporation's action against the Superintendent seeking a declaration that the statutes were unconstitutional and remanded the cause to the trial court for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

The employee failed to show the owner was aware of a defect in the brake system, and absent any such knowledge, it had no duty to warn.

Furthermore, the court determined that the Common Pleas Court did not abuse its discretion in determining that the passenger would receive collateral benefits and in deducting the collateral benefits from the damage award because an award could be adjusted where the passenger was reasonably certain to receive collateral benefits after the entry of judgment pursuant to Ohio Rev.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Franklin County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio) affirmed a decision by the Unemployment Compensation Board of Review (Ohio) that the board lacked jurisdiction to hear an appeal filed by appellant employer, which challenged a newly-assessed unemployment contribution rate under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4141.26, because the employer failed to file its appeal in a timely manner.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The administrator of the Ohio Bureau of Employment Services (OBES) notified the employer of an increase in its unemployment contribution rate for the year 1991. The rate increase was based on a delinquent report for a previous quarter. The employer submitted a check in payment of the contribution due for the delinquent quarter. Subsequently, the employer wrote to OBES and requested reconsideration of the newly-assessed contribution rate. The administrator of OBES declined to review the employer's request for reconsideration, finding that the employer failed to timely file the request. The board upheld the administrator's decision and the board's decision was affirmed by the trial court. In affirming, the court agreed that the employer failed to file the request for reconsideration in a timely manner. The court held that the employer's remittance of a check in payment of its delinquent contributions was not an appeal of the increased contribution rate. Lastly, the court rejected the employer's claim that OBES was estopped from denying that the employer's filing constituted a timely request for reconsideration.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After being stopped for driving at night without lights, defendant failed the field sobriety tests and was arrested. Defendant alleged that the trial court erred in denying her motion to suppress evidence of her breathalyzer test.

When defendant was presented with a form waiving her rights to an attorney, she said, &quot;I think I should have an attorney.&quot; The officer continued the booking procedure without making any attempt to assist defendant in obtaining an attorney. Because of &quot;time constraints&quot;, the breathalyzer test was administered without affording defendant an opportunity to consult with an attorney. Defendant alleged that she was deprived of her right to counsel contrary to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2935.20 and her constitutional rights. The court held that the trial erred in refusing to exclude the breathalyzer results. Defendant had a statutory and a constitutional right to counsel. When defendant said she thought she needed an attorney, the officer was obliged to offer defendant the facilities to communicate with an attorney and to stop the booking process.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, an adult video store, the store's employees, and the store's corporate owners, sought review of a decision of the Richland County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio), which declared, pursuant to an action by appellee Director of Law for City of Mansfield (Ohio), that the adult video booths at the back of the adult video store were a public nuisance and enjoined the video store from operating the booths.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The video store sold a variety of standard and adult magazines and videos and maintained coin operated video booths at the back of the store for adult movies. Police discovered that customers were masturbating in the booths and a nuisance action was initiated by the Director against the appellants. The trial court found appellants guilty and issued an injunction barring appellants from operating the booths. The injunction allowed appellants to maintain one booth at the front of the store as long as they did not charge for it. Appellants sought review on First Amendment grounds. The court found that where the injunction was narrowly tailored to excise the offending booths and did not shut down the video store or bar appellants form selling adult materials, there was no First Amendment violation, regardless of the substantial evidence that the nuisance action was a pretext to regulate pornography. However, the court found that there was no rational relation between the ban on charging for the one remaining booth and abatement of the nuisance. The court also found that there was insufficient evidence that the individual employees had knowledge of and participated in the nuisance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court vacated that portion of the trial court's judgment ordering that appellants not charge its customers for the use of the one remaining video booth located at the front of the video store, reversed that portion of the trial court's judgment entered against the individually employees, and affirmed the trial court's judgment against appellants in all other respects.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city assessed a proportion of the costs of a proposed sewer project against the property owner's property. After receiving notice of the special assessments, the property owner sent a letter to the city council objecting to the amount apportioned against his property. The city board subsequently conducted a hearing and the property owner's objections were denied. The trial court approved the city's assessment. Upon review, the court affirmed. The court found the formula used by the city engineer in determining the benefit to the property owner was constitutional where Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 727.01(B) on its face, clearly dispelled any requirement that the benefits to the property be determined with exactness. The court held the property owner's assertion that he intended to operate his property as a warehouse was immaterial because &sect; 727.01(B) stated that the cost of an improvement was to be assessed in proportion to the benefits which could result from the improvement. The court concluded that an unconstitutional taking could not be found where the property owner presented no evidence to overcome the presumption of enhancement to the value of his property.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1974, the father was found in contempt of court for failing to pay the court-ordered child support. In 1991, the children had reached the age of emancipation. In 1992, the mother had filed a motion for contempt to enforce a lump sum judgment that was awarded to her in 1985 for the father's failure to pay the court ordered child support. The trial court granted the motion and found the father in contempt of court. On appeal, the father argued that the 1985 lump sum judgment was a debt within the contemplation of the constitutional guarantee against imprisonment for debt, as provided in Ohio Const. art. I, &sect; 15. The court agreed and found the trial court lacked the authority to use its contempt powers to coerce payment of the lump sum judgment. The court also agreed that once the children were emancipated, the father was no longer required to pay child support and any attempt after emancipation to enforce the payment of support by contempt was a violation of the constitutional prohibition against imprisonment for debt. The court concluded that that the father was improperly found in contempt of court.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 2925.11 following a no-contest plea. He alleged that his stop was a pretext to search for drugs and the trial court's order to exclude the testimony of certain witnesses precluded his ability to challenge the race-based drug profile allegedly used by the arresting officer.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The officer saw defendant make two left turns without signaling and run a stop sign.

The officer personally observed as required by Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4511.39. The court held that the officer satisfied the reasonable suspicion to justify the stop. The only link between the stop and drugs was the fact that drugs were discovered in the course of the investigative activity. The discovery was insufficient to demonstrate that the stop was pretextual. The court held that the trial court was entitled to find that the traffic stop was reasonable. The trial court properly determined that the officer could have lawfully taken control of any contraband that was in plain view or by feel. Defendant failed to demonstrate how he was prejudiced because the probative value of the evidence duplicated his statistical evidence offered in support of his nonexistent equal protection theory.

The decedent's mother filed a wrongful death and property damage suit and sought compensatory and punitive damages. The jury in the Erie County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio) awarded compensatory damages to the estate. The issue of punitive damages was not submitted to the jury. Both parties appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The railroad contended that the sole cause of the accident was the decedent's own negligence. The decedent's mother argued that the trial court erred by refusing to submit the issue of punitive damages to the jury on her individual property damage claim. The court disagreed with the railroad's contention. The court found that there was evidence presented from which the jury could have reasonably concluded that the railroad acted with actual malice or at the very least acted negligently and that its actions were a proximate cause of the decedent's accident. Furthermore, under the comparative negligence doctrine the fact that the decedent violated state and municipal traffic codes would not automatically establish that she was the proximate cause of the accident and would not preclude competent evidence as to the railroad's own negligence. Although punitive damages were not recoverable in the wrongful death action, the court ruled that the trial court abused its discretion in failing to award any amount for punitive damages on the property damage claim after the jury determined that liability for the collision rested with the railroad based on its finding of actual malice.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The chiropractor's motion to dismiss alleged that the trial court lacked jurisdiction because the patient failed to meet the requirements of &sect; 2307.42(C)(2), which required the patient to file an affidavit within 90 days after she filed her complaint or after receipt of requested chiropractic records. In reversing the trial court's dismissal of the patient's complaint, the court held that the patient's failure to comply with the affidavit requirement of &sect; 2307.42(C)(2) did not deprive the trial court of its jurisdiction to adjudicate the action because the requirements of &sect; 2307.42 were invalid. According to the court, &sect; 2307.42 conflicted with Ohio R. Civ. P. 11, which provided that pleadings did not need to be accompanied by an affidavit except when otherwise specifically provided by the Ohio Rules of Civil Procedure. The court found that Rule 11 prevailed over &sect; 2307.42 because the Ohio Rules of Civil Procedure controlled subsequently enacted statutes governing procedural matters.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">While monitoring traffic at a hotel known for drug activity, the police stopped defendant's car because the license plates did not match the registration.

Defendant argued that the warrantless search of the car was unconstitutional and that none of the exceptions to a warrantless search were applicable. The court affirmed defendant's conviction, holding that the police conducted a valid inventory search. Inventory searches were valid after a lawful arrest or stop if they were performed according to standard police procedure and were not a pretext for an evidentiary search. The stop was lawful because the plates were registered to another vehicle. The search was not pretextual because it did not occur until after the car was impounded and defendant was allowed to leave the scene. The vehicle did not need to be taken to the station house to be lawfully impounded if it was impounded and then searched in good faith according to standardized police procedures.</SPAN></P>

Based on that schematic, the billboard owner applied for a billboard permit to be erected in an area that was not part of the interstate system. The City issued the permit, then revoked it after the Commission determined that the billboard's location was unacceptable under the Graphics Along the Interstate System Act. The owner appealed, and the Commission upheld the revocation. The trial court reversed the Commission's decision. The City argued before the court that the billboard fronted on a section of roadway that it considered part of the interstate system because, although not built with interstate highway funds, it provided access to the interstate system. The court sustained the owner's argument that it was the funding that determined a roadway's designation as interstate or not. The court also found that the City was estopped from revoking the permit because it was lawful at the time it was issued.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed defendant's convictions, holding that the death sentence was appropriate because the aggravating circumstances of the killing clearly and beyond a reasonable doubt outweighed any evidence that was presented in mitigation of punishment. The court found that although the State made inflammatory comments in its closing statement, because it was clear beyond a reasonable doubt that the jury would have recommended the death sentence even absent the inflammatory remarks, reversal of defendant's death sentence was not required. The court held that the repeated use of the word &quot;recommendation&quot; in the jury charge and in the verdict form did not prejudice defendant. The court cautioned, however, there was no need to instruct the jury on a trial court's responsibilities after the jury recommended a sentence because those responsibilities were irrelevant to the jury's determination.</SPAN></P>

On review, the court disagreed, finding that (1) the phrase &quot;person having custody or control&quot; applied to defendant even though he had no legal relationship to the child because reasonable minds could have determined that defendant had custody or control of the child while he was playing on the swing set; (2) defendant owed the child a reasonable duty of care and protection; (3) in proving the corpus delicti, it was sufficient to show that the offense was committed through the criminal agency of defendant without knowing how he actually committed the crime; (4) there was sufficient proof that the child died and that defendant was the last person to be with him before he died; and (5) any rational trier of fact could have found that the essential elements of the crime were proven beyond a reasonable doubt, and Ohio Rev.

The court held that &sect; 3109.11 did not violate either the United States Constitution or the Ohio Constitution because the legislature appeared to have recognized the legitimate, understandable, and commendable interest that relatives of a deceased father or mother might well have in an unmarried minor child. The court agreed with the trial court's finding that the plain language of &sect; 3109.11 indicated that it must find that it was in the &quot;best interest of the minor child&quot; for visitation or companionship to be granted.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant State challenged an order of the Hamilton County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio) that dismissed a portion of defendant's indictment that elevated his nonsupport charge from a misdemeanor to a felony.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant failed to make child support payments and was charged with nonsupport in violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2919.21(A)(2). The offense was elevated to a felony under &sect; 2919.21(E), and the trial court dismissed the portion of the indictment elevating the offense to a felony. The State sought review, and the court reversed and remanded. The court held that a prior finding that defendant had failed to pay support for 26 weeks was not required under &sect; 2919.21(E). The trial court could have made the finding at defendant's criminal trial. The court was required to look at the words used in the statute and give them their plain meaning. Also, there was a presumption that the legislature did not intend that other alternatives prevent a contemporaneous court finding. Finally, the prohibition on using factual findings from other proceedings in a criminal trial precluded a prior finding of nonpayment.</SPAN></P>
