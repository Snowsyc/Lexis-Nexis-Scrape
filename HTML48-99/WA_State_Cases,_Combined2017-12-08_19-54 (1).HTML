Rev. Stat. &sect; 2494 (Remington). He claimed that &sect; 2494 was class legislation and unconstitutional in that it violated U.S. Const. amend. 14, &sect; 1, Wash. Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 3, 12, by establishing the first day of the week as a sabbath.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant alleged that Wash. Rev. Stat. &sect; 2494 (Remington) was discriminatory because it excepted the sale of certain items from the general prohibition of the sale of personal property on the first day of the week; that it violated religious freedom; that pursuant to Wash. Rev. Stat. &sect; 2496 (Remington), he had a defense because he and his community kept another day as a sabbath; and that he was not allowed to present evidence of community necessity. On review, the court found that: (1) the prohibition of certain activities on the first day of the week had been upheld as a valid exercise of the police power; (2) Wash Rev. Stat. &sect; 2494 (Remington) did not restrict who could sell the designated articles appropriate for sale; (3) &sect; 2494 did not restrict anyone's religious beliefs or practices; and (4) Wash. Rev. Stat. &sect; 2496 (Remington) did not offer a defense to the sale of goods but only to performing labor, so it would not consider the constitutionality of that section.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant taxpayer sought review of a judgment of the Superior Court for Thurston County (Washington), sustaining a demurrer to the complaint, dismissing an action for injunctive relief, upon the taxpayer's complaint against respondents, the State Tax Commission and others, asking that the collection of the tax and the issuance of the bonds by the state finance committee be restrained.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer brought the action challenging the constitutionality of an initiative measure, which received a favorable vote of the electorate. The complaint asked that the collection of the tax by the state tax commission and the issuance of the bonds by the state finance committee be restrained. On appeal, the court found that the World War I bonds for equalized compensation were brought squarely within Wash. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 3, and contained the provision that each bond should have been made payable at a time not exceeding 20 years from the date of its issuance. Because the initiative measure was explicitly placed outside of Wash. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 3, its proponents said that Wash. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 2 was applicable. The court concluded that the debt to be contracted was not to repel invasion, to suppress insurrection, or to defend the state in war. It follows that the demurrer to the complaint should not have been sustained, and that the taxpayer's complaint should not have been dismissed.</SPAN></P>

The trial court entered a judgment for the taxpayers. The trial court held that the taxpayers were not subject to the taxes levied against them because they were not doing business in the state of Washington. On appeal, the question before the court for determination was whether the moneys received by the taxpayers, referred to in the contract as &quot;royalties,&quot; paid by the respective purchasers of the hop-picking machines, were taxable under the revenue statutes of the state. The court reversed the judgment of the trial court. The court held that the taxpayers were engaged in business practice within the state and were subject to taxation within the state.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The domestic steamship company sold a steamship to the foreign steamship company. That steamship was exported to the home country of the foreign steamship company for use in its operations. The state levied a sales tax upon the sale of the steamship and the domestic steamship company paid that tax under protest. Thereafter, petitioners filed an action against respondents to secure a refund of amounts paid as a sales tax. The trial court entered a judgment in favor of petitioners, and respondents appealed. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment that directed a refund in favor of petitioners. The court rested this determination on the basis that the terms of the underlying sale and the actions of the parties clearly indicated that the steamship sold could not have been legally used or operated in waters of the state, except solely as an incident to foreign commerce. Thus, the court concluded that the sale of the steamship constituted a sale of property for export as contemplated by U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 10, cl. 2, and the domestic steamship company's payment of the relevant sales tax was illegal in violation of that constitutional provision.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer paid a deficiency assessed by the State. The deficiency was based upon business and occupation taxes imposed upon persons engaged within the state in the business of making sales at wholesale under Wash. Rev. Stat. &sect; 8370-4 (Remington Supp. 1943) et seq. The trial court dismissed the taxpayer's action to recover the taxes. The taxpayer argued on appeal that the tax was unconstitutional under U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 8 because it imposed a burden on interstate commerce. The court agreed and reversed. The court found that 40 per cent of the business on which the assessment was based was done upon contracts negotiated, made, and concluded outside the state. The only thing that transpired in the state was the delivery of products to various customers by common carriers. The court held that the deficiency assessment was based upon a tax upon amounts derived from business that the State was prohibited from taxing under the federal constitution. The court held that the tax was invalid because it constituted state interference with the freedom of interstate commerce.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The corporation whose stockholders' voting rights are here involved, was organized in 1919, under the general corporation laws of the state of Washington. The by-laws provided that each stockholder should be entitled to cast one vote for each share of stock standing in his name on the books. Appellants claimed the right to cast their votes cumulatively at a meeting to elect officers. The chairman ruled that the only permissible method of voting was that of straight voting. The court held that the right of a stockholder to vote for directors was a valuable vested property right arising out of the contract of incorporation, and it was therefore a right saved and protected by &sect; 63 of the Uniform Business Corporation Act. That right was not impaired or affected by &sect; 28(3), for to deprive the stockholder of such right was to deprive him of an essential attribute of his property. Section &sect; 28(3) of the Act, relating to cumulative voting, did not apply and hence did not divest the majority stockholders of their vested right to elect all of the directors of the corporation by the straight voting method.</SPAN></P>

The treasurer demurred to the application and filed a motion seeking the denial of the application on the basis that the legislature was without constitutional authority to establish by concurrent resolution any committee to function after adjournment sine die of that legislature and that no valid appropriation existed from which to pay the relator's warrant. The court issued the writ, holding that the legislature possessed the inherent power to investigate and that there was no constitutional restriction on the legislature's power to establish, by a concurrent resolution, an investigatory committee to function after adjournment of the legislature.

The partnership brought the action to enjoin the union from picketing the partnership's motorship and from hindering any person from transacting business with the partnership.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When the partnership brought their motorship alongside a wharf to be loaded with freight for another trip, the union established a picket line. The partnership's longshoremen refused to cross the picket line to continue loading the ship. The partnership contended that it was a limited partnership, in which one individual was the general partner and the crewmembers were the limited partners. The union contended that the partnership was a mere sham, and that the monthly drawing accounts were in fact wages of the limited partners. The trial court denied the application for an injunction. On appeal, the court found that the relationship was a usual employment relationship of master and servant. The court noted that it was the purpose of the picketing to persuade the partnership from entering into an agreement with the union so that there could be a union delegate on the motorship. The court further noted that there was no evidence of violence. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment because there was a valid labor dispute at issue and that an injunction would not lie to prohibit the union and its members from peacefully picketing the partnership's motorship.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs were property owners outside the city limits of defendant city that paid an assessment for sewer mains and then applied for utility services. However, defendant denied the application because plaintiffs applied for annexation to a neighboring city instead of defendant as required by local ordinance. Utility service was eventually established for plaintiffs and plaintiffs brought an action for damages resulting from the delays in supplying utility service. The trial court granted defendant's motion for summary judgment and plaintiffs appealed. On appeal, the court stated that plaintiffs were required to follow the ordinance requiring them to apply for annexation with defendant. However, the court also stated that, since plaintiffs paid the assessment for the sewer main, plaintiffs had acquired an enforceable right that defendants denied. Furthermore, the court found that the application of the ordinance operated as an unconstitutional impairment of contract. Consequently, the trial court was reversed.</SPAN></P>

By reducing these past rates, appellant sought a refund from respondents.

The court held that appellant made a timely, lawful retroactive rate adjustment and no constitutional principles were violated because respondents knew, even before the period in question, that they were not entitled to reimbursement for non-Medicaid expenses. Because manner of computing the rate was not in accord with appellant's rules, error occurred in the cost reports that were submitted by respondents; and appellant erred by accepting respondents' cost reports in setting the rates and by failing to discover the erroneous reporting.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent developer challenged appellant city's open-space set-aside ordinance and a city requirement that it construct a secondary access road as a condition of approval for its subdivision application. The court agreed with the trial court that the set-aside ordinance violated the Takings Clause of U.S. Const. amend. V because there was no evidence that the ordinance was roughly proportional to the impact of the proposed development. The court found that the record indicated that legitimate fire safety concerns led to the secondary road requirement and that the road was reasonably necessary for public safety. The court held that respondent failed to show that the secondary road requirement was unduly oppressive and did not demonstrate that the government action was arbitrary, irrational, or tainted by improper motive. The court found that the trial court erred in concluding that the secondary road requirement constituted a violation of due process. The court affirmed the trial court's ruling regarding the set-aside ordinance, but reversed the ruling regarding the road requirement.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After defendant county air pollution control authority gave plaintiff foundry company written notice of its violations of Wash. Rev. Code &sect;&sect; 70.94.141,.151 and Wash. Admin. Code &sect; 173-400-105, plaintiff appealed to the pollution control hearings board (board). The board granted defendant's summary judgment motion. The superior court affirmed and plaintiff appealed. On appeal, the court rejected plaintiff's argument that power to perform routine administrative functions is restricted to a quorum of the board of directors. The court also rejected plaintiff's constitutional challenge of Spokane County Air Pollution Control Authority Reg. I, art. IV, &sect;&sect; 4.01, 4.02 because those regulations do not involve First Amendment concerns. Finally, the court rejected plaintiff's contention that defendant violated section 70.94.151 when it failed to make an individual determination that plaintiff was a pollution source. Because the statute does not contemplate consideration on a case-by-case basis, defendant was not required to justify the fee by individually assessing the effects of plaintiff's emissions.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the trial court was affirmed; under state law, county air pollution control board was not required to justify the fee it imposed upon plaintiff by individually assessing the health, economic and social effects of plaintiff's emissions.</SPAN></P>

Appellant challenged the dismissal of its appeal of the order. The court found that, to the extent appellant was challenging the NOC, there was no fact material to the appeal for respondent to dispute. To the extent that appellant was challenging the agency action, the burden was on it to prove respondent did not follow the required inspection procedures.

Appellant was not entitled to self-defense instruction because reasonable person could not have perceived imminent threat of great bodily harm to parents and sister; prosecutorial misconduct through improper remarks was not so flagrant that prejudice could not have been cured by appellant's counsel through request for appropriate instruction that jury was not to draw any adverse inference; failure of appellant's counsel to object to prosecutorial misconduct was not incompetence justifying reversal because it involved nonessential testimony; and evidence was sufficient to support accomplice liability, since respondent showed appellant had general knowledge of crime.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant pled guilty to charges of vehicular homicide, felony hit and run, reckless driving, and reckless endangerment after she struck and killed a pedestrian while driving under the influence of alcohol. The trial court imposed an exceptional sentence of 108 months on the vehicular homicide charge, setting forth three aggravating factors on which the exceptional sentence was based. The factors included appellant's extraordinarily high blood alcohol content, appellant's particularized knowledge about the dangers of drunk driving, and the victim's pedestrian status. The court affirmed. The court rejected appellant's argument that because vehicular homicide and reckless driving charges were the same criminal conduct, they should not have been counted separately. The court also rejected appellant's vagueness challenge, holding that a person of reasonable understanding could comprehend that Washington's Sentencing Reform Act authorized a sentencing court, in its discretion, to impose an exceptional sentence based on conduct more egregious than typical.</SPAN></P>

Shortly thereafter, appellant's friend drove by the mall food court, and appellant started shooting toward the heavily populated area. A jury found him guilty of first-degree reckless endangerment, and the court imposed an exceptional sentence on four different bases. Appellant contended that three of the trial court's bases were not legally adequate. There was no evidence to contradict the trial court's statement that any one basis would have resulted in the same exceptional sentence. Therefore, the appellate court held that the trial court could impose the exceptional sentence solely on the unchallenged fact that appellant's crime involved multiple acts and multiple victims. Additionally, the court found no merit in appellant's claim of ineffective assistance of counsel and constitutional challenges to the Sentencing Reform Act, Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.94A.010.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, appellant contended that there was insufficient evidence to support the first-degree assault conviction and that the trial court should have counted the three offenses as the same criminal conduct for sentencing purposes. The court held there was ample evidence of injury to support the conviction.

The sentencing court concluded that appellant's convictions satisfied the requirements of Wash. Rev.

Appellant filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus challenging the legality of all of his convictions. The State conceded that the court erred by classifying appellant's Idaho burglary conviction as a most serious offense. Thus, the sentencing court's conclusion that appellant was a persistent offender had to be reversed.

Appellant also asserted that he had received insufficient notice of the possession of stolen property charges because respondent state used the term &quot;credit card&quot; instead of &quot;access device&quot; in its information. The court affirmed appellant's conviction, reasoning that the jury had sufficient evidence to conclude that the cards met the statutory definition of &quot;access device.&quot; Furthermore, although the information used the term &quot;credit card,&quot; appellant had sufficient notice of the charges against him because it referenced the specific statutory provision in its information.</SPAN></P>

Small claims statutory appeals bond and filing fee requirements did not conflict with rules of appeal, unconstitutionally discriminate against indigent appellants, or infringe on appellant's right of access to appellate courts; the requirements were rationally related to the legitimate state goal of providing an inexpensive and conclusive determination of small claims, and were thus not unconstitutional.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, a deaf man who pled guilty to a sex offense, was given a Special Sexual Offender Sentencing Alternative (SSOSA) but later violated conditions of that sentence. The court revoked his suspended sentence. Appellant argued that the court's failure to provide a signing interpreter during probation meetings violated both state statute and his due process rights. The court found that Wash. Rev. Code &sect;42.120(3), which required signing interpreters for criminal suspects, violated Wash. Const. art. II, &sect; 19 because it embraced more than one subject and did not give the public notice of the signing interpreter requirement. The court also found appellant was able to read and his intelligence was normal, and his own actions in initially complying with the conditions of his SSOSA defeated his argument that without an interpreter he did not have adequate notice of what he was required to do. He was not denied due process.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The lower court's judgment was affirmed because the statute requiring signing interpreters was unconstitutional and appellant was not denied due process by the lack of an interpreter because he understood the requirements of his probation.</SPAN></P>

The court consolidated appellant's personal restraint petition with the appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant argued for reversal of his convictions on the grounds that the state was allowed to amend its counts to add charges, the evidence did not support the verdict, his jury instructions were not given, the crimes should have been consolidated, he received ineffective service of counsel, his sentence was improperly enhanced, and, in a petition of personal restraint, that unconstitutional prejudice was shown. The court found the information for the amended charges was already in the pleadings (so defendant was on notice of the charges), abundant evidence existed justifying convictions, the crimes were against different entities, thus justifying consolidation, appellant's instructions were not based on law, and appellant failed to make ineffective counsel case. While the trial court's sentencing was valid, but it could not &quot;un-tether&quot; the firearm enhancement from the assault and &quot;re-tether&quot; it to unlawful possession, so remand was ordered for re-sentencing. Appellant's constitutional arguments lacked both a legal basis and evidentiary support.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">There was a wetland on a portion of the property appellant had purchased, so she was required to submit a wetland application to the respondent county before she could obtain a building permit. After appellant was unable to receive a building permit that satisfied her, and was denied a variance, she filed a claim against respondent county seeking damages. The court found that her Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 36.70C claim, her inverse condemnation claim under U.S. Const. amend. V, and U.S. Const. amend. XIV, her 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 claim, her interference with contract claim, and her claim for attorney fees and costs were all properly dismissed. Since appellant sold her property, her Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 36.70C claim was moot, and because there was no final decision regarding the extent to which her property could be developed, the reduction in the property's value could not be evaluated.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants sought review from the Superior Court of King County (Washington), which issued judgment for appellees in appellants' claim for damages against appellees under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants were arrested without a warrant for violation of Seattle, Wash., Mun. Code 6.270.100 (SMC 6.270.100) for topless dancing. After one of appellants was acquitted, appellants sued appellees under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983. The court reversed. The police should have obtained a warrant before arresting appellants for violation of SMC 6.270.100. Non-obscene nude dancing was entitled to U.S. Const. amend. I protection. SMC 6.270.100 was constitutional only because of the non-obscene dance exception therein. Before the police can make an arrest there must be an assessment that the performance, as a whole, was not protected under that exception. The police could not instantly make this type of assessment and therefore were required to obtain a warrant after probable cause was determined. Arresting nude dancers without a warrant and before determining such performances were obscene was an unconstitutional prior restraint that violated U.S. Const. amends. I and IV.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the lower court's decision, finding appellees' warrantless arrest of appellants for violation of an ordinance that banned stage dancers from sexual self-touching was unconstitutional because appellees were required to obtain a judicial determination of probable cause in which a court could determine whether the dancers' conduct was obscene.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought to demolish or relocate two buildings, remove 10 trees, and relocate two trees in respondent's historic preservation district, in order to construct a building. The trial court affirmed the administrative decision denying appellant's permit applications under the Land Use Petition Act, Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 36.70C.130, because it contended demolition or relocation of the existing structures was inconsistent with the La Conner, Wa., Code &sect; 15.50.080. On appeal, appellant asserted &sect;15.50.080(2) was unconstitutionally vague. The court held that, when a challenged ordinance involved land use regulation, the ordinance was judged as applied, not evaluated for facial vagueness. Additionally, an ordinance had to contain ascertainable standards for adjudication in order to limit discretionary enforcement of the law. The court reviewed &sect; 15.50.080 and determined it provided detailed and technical standards, as well as design review criteria, and therefore was not unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the lower court's decision and concluded that certain sections of the La Conner Municipal Code were not unconstitutionally vague, the Hearing Examiner had jurisdiction to hear the appeal, appellant was not denied his due process rights, and the hearings did not violate the appearance of fairness doctrine.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, convicted of attempted first-degree child molestation in violation of Wash. Rev. Code &sect;&sect; 9A.44.083 and 9A.28.020, was sentenced as a persistent offender. Appellant attacked his sentence through counsel and his underlying conviction in a pro se brief. The appellate court affirmed the decision of the trial court and denied appellant's petition. Appellant's persistent-offender status was properly supported by his earlier robbery conviction because appellant did not have a right to contest a prior conviction at his subsequent sentencing for another offense. Appellant's persistent-offender sentence was not cruel or unusual punishment and did not violate constitutional double-jeopardy protections because the imposed sentence was legislatively authorized based on the severity of the underlying offense. Appellant's attempted child molestation conviction was supported by sufficient evidence and he was not denied his U.S. Const.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with two counts of third-degree assault. A jury found him guilty on both counts. A presentence investigation report indicated defendant had previously been convicted of seven felonies, three as a juvenile and four as an adult. He also had 12 prior misdemeanor convictions and seven community placement violations. Lower court imposed an exceptional sentence. Defendant appealed. Defendant failed to show that his prior juvenile convictions were unconstitutional and state established those convictions by a preponderance of the evidence. Lower court did not err by including the three prior juvenile felony convictions in his criminal history. The calculation of his offender score was therefore correct. Court also noted defendant had an extensive misdemeanor criminal history that was not used in calculating his offender score. Four of defendant's misdemeanor convictions were a form of assault. Thus, the lower court did not err by determining his misdemeanor history resulted in a sentence that was too lenient. The imposition of the exceptional sentence was justified.</SPAN></P>

Defendant conceded that knowledge was not an element of either possession offense, but argued that court should require a knowledge element to convict.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants owned homes that sat atop a bluff. They applied to respondent for a shoreline substantial development permit to undertake three measures to curtail erosion of the bluff. Respondent granted their request as to the first two measures, but denied permission to construct a revetment. Both the Shorelines Hearings Board and the trial court affirmed respondent's decision. Appellant argued that respondent was required to consider their request in light of not only respondent's master program, but also the provision of the Shoreline Management Act that required local governments' master programs to contain preferences for single family residences. The court concluded that, at the time it acted on appellants' permit application, respondent was not required to incorporate provisions containing preferences for single family residences in its master program, because the Department of Ecology had not promulgated guidelines for use by local governments in incorporating such provisions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was affirmed, because the board's decision was supported by substantial evidence where respondent was not required to incorporate provisions for single family residences at the time it acted on appellant's permit application.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellant challenged a judgment of the Superior Court of King County (Washington), which convicted him for felony stalking.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellant was convicted of felony stalking after he made repeated calls and threats, and posted flyers seeking information on the activities of his estranged wife. The appellant had a long history of threatening both his wife and child. The appellant challenged his conviction on the grounds that his posting of flyers was a &quot;constitutionally protected activity&quot;, and that the lower court's admission of his prior bad acts was prejudicial and irrelevant. The court affirmed the appellant's conviction. The court held that although posting flyers was normally a constitutionally protected activity, as practiced by the appellant, it was directed at intimidating and threatening his wife. The court also upheld the lower court's admission of the appellant's prior bad acts. The court found that because the felony stalking statute had an element of &quot;objective fear&quot;, the evidence was necessary to prove that the victim's fear of the appellant was reasonable.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants sought review of a Superior Court of King County (Washington) decision that although appellants' property had been subjected to a property use restriction that was unconstitutionally vague, they were denied damages under claims of violations of 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983, Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 64.40, and for reverse condemnation. Respondent city cross-appealed order directing it to issue a business license and court's denial of attorney's fees.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent adopted a new land use code, and appellants' property was zoned for retail use; however, a prior property use agreement (PUA) severely limited appellants' property use. Appellants entered into a sale agreement with prospective purchasers, contingent on the removal of the restrictions. City denied prospective purchasers' application for a license to operate a retail store, based on the PUA, and a hearing officer affirmed. Superior court held the section of the zoning ordinance restricting appellants' property use was void for vagueness, but denied request for damages. Appellate court stated the appeal was timely filed; however, ordinance not unconstitutionally vague. It was clear and readily understandable that a PUA was in effect. Because ordinance was not vague, arguments appellants were due damages under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 was meritless. Respondent did not arbitrarily deny the license when the decision was based on a duly enacted ordinance, nor was respondent's PUA a taking of property. Lastly, superior court did not abuse its discretion in denying attorney's fees to respondent, and order requiring it to issue license was moot by subsequently enacted ordinance.</SPAN></P>

Ordinance was clear and readily understandable. Because ordinance was not vague, appellants were not due damages under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983, nor was license arbitrarily denied or property taken. No abuse of discretion occurred in denying respondent its attorney's fees, and order requiring it issue license was moot.</SPAN></P>

Petitioner filed a personal restraint petition seeking relief from his convictions. Petitioner argued, among other things, that his two convictions based upon one homicide violated the double jeopardy clauses of the state and federal constitutions. Therefore, petitioner contended, one of the convictions had to be vacated. The court agreed, vacating his conviction for second degree felony murder vacated.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court affirmed defendant brothers' criminal convictions, finding that each defendant's statement corroborated the nontestifying codefendant's statement against him. The appellate court noted that the sole difference in the testimonies was not a critical detail, given the crime with which defendants were charged. The appellate court concluded that admission of the statements did not pose a problem under U.S. Cons. amend. VI and severance was not mandated where the similarity in the statements rendered harmless any error and each codefendant's confession was reliable as an &quot;interlocking&quot; confession. The appellate court further found that there was no abuse of discretion in denying the motion to sever on the basis of mutually antagonistic defense, noting that each defendant presented the same defense to the jury and neither defendant demonstrated such manifest prejudice as to warrant discretionary severance. The appellate court declined the address the argument that the felony murder rule application was unconstitutional, concluding that binding precedent indicated that the rule was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

The court held that this was not a dependency proceeding, with a goal of reuniting parent and child, and thus no remedial services were required. In affirming the decision, the court found clear and cogent evidence that appellant had failed to perform his parental duties and that he had no realistic plan for caring for the child.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The City of Tacoma applied to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) for licensing of a dam project, and appellant, the Skokomish Indian Tribe, actively participated as an interested party. Respondent, the Washington State Department of Ecology, declared that although the project did not comply with Washington's Coastal Zone Program, it would decline to object to it and FERC issued the requested license. Appellant sought review of that decision, and trial court dismissed their petition as moot. Appellate court reversed. Although a state court could not provide direct relief to appellant because it had no authority to directly order FERC to reconsider its licensing decision, a state court judgment in appellant's favor would enable review of FERC's licensing of the project, and thus the court could provide effective relief. In addition, state court was the correct forum for challenging a state agency's decision. Lastly, respondent's decision was arbitrary and capricious because it explicitly acknowledged that it was inconsistent with state law, and appellant was not precluded from judicial review where it was not required under state law to seek administrative review.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was ordered by the trial court to contribute to his daughter's educational costs at a private college. He appealed that order in spite of the fact that he had previously agreed, in a child support agreement, to pay for part of her post secondary education. Specifically, he argued that Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 26.19.090 violated federal equal protection by wrongfully discriminating between divorced parents and those who were not divorced. Clarifying that appellant's duty to pay support was not a fundamental right protected by strict scrutiny review, the court rejected the challenge after determining that there was a rational relationship between the statute and the compelling state interest in properly providing for children like appellant's daughter. It therefore affirmed the decision of the trial court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The information alleged that defendant caused the death of another in the course of and furtherance of the crime of malicious mischief and or reckless endangerment. Defendant fired a bullet into a car that he thought was empty. The bullet struck a passenger and killed him. Defendant was charged by information with second-degree murder by commission of a felony. The use of a deadly weapon during the crime was added to the allegation. A jury found defendant guilty of second-degree murder and added the deadly weapons enhancement. The parties agreed that the standard range for the crime, including the firearm enhancement, was 183 to 224 months in prison and the court imposed a sentence of 17 years and 8 months. Defendant appealed, challenging the operation of the felony murder rule. Defendant argued that a conviction for felony murder was proper only when death was a foreseeable consequence of the predicate crime. The court noted that intent to kill was not an element of second-degree felony murder. Defendant's conviction and sentence was affirmed because the purpose of the felony murder statute was to punish those who committed a homicide in the course of a felony.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's conviction for second-degree felony murder was affirmed because although the felony murder rule was harsh, it served the legislature's intent to punish those who commit murder during the course of a felony.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Subsequent to his conviction for first-degree manslaughter and unlawful imprisonment, criminal defendant minor argued that the trial court erred in imposing a 60-month exceptional sentence based on disputed facts that were contained only in an affidavit of probable cause. The court acknowledged that the trial court was restricted to relying only on information admitted or proven. However, the court held that the record reflected that defendant had abandoned any objection to the trial court's consideration of facts in the affidavit by stipulating to such facts. Reviewing the record, the court found that subsequent to a beating of the victim that defendant had been involved in, defendant threatened to beat the victim again, causing the victim to jump from defendant's vehicle, where defendant abandoned him to die. Under such facts, the court held that the trial court properly relied on the aggravating factors of deliberate cruelty and the victim's vulnerability in justifying the exceptional sentence.</SPAN></P>

Because defendants raised a challenge to the information charging them with the crime before their trial began, the court strictly construed the information and concluded that it did not contain all the essential elements of the crime necessary to notify defendants of the nature of the accusations against them. Using inartful and vague language, the information merely cited to the statute and named the offense. However, the information did not express the elements essential to establish the very illegality of the behavior as required for a conviction under the statute, including the specified enterprise that defendants interfered with and the fact that such enterprise was one wherein persons were employed for a wage.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant municipality adopted an ordinance which imposed a standby charge on vacant, unimproved land that abutted city water and sewer lines. Plaintiffs were owners of such property, and as such were assessed this charge. Upon plaintiffs' challenge of the ordinance as an invalid non-uniform tax, the court found it was not a valid regulatory fee as defined under the court's three-prong test. The ordinance made no reference to the type of service or benefits the paying landowner could expect to receive in exchange for payment of the standby charge. The money collected was not allocated only for authorized regulatory purposes. Instead, the types of costs supported appeared to be public benefits that cost money. Also, there was no direct relationship between the fee charged and the service received by or the burden produced by the ratepayer. Therefore, the standby fee appeared to be more of a tax than a regulatory fee. The trial court abused its discretion when it denied plaintiff's summary judgment motion, and the case was reversed and remanded.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">This suit arose from a resolution enacted by appellant district to remedy what it perceived was an inequity in the manner in which charges were levied to finance a county-wide sewer and water system. Appellee district was granted a summary judgment on the grounds the law governing an account stated precluded appellant from making claims relating to sewer and water bills paid long ago, as was done by its Resolution. The court disagreed with the trial court's ruling that the contract doctrine of account stated was applicable, but agreed with the result and affirmed on an alternate ground. The court reasoned that by statute, the rates for the system maintenance had to be the same for the same class of customers. The court found that the county placed appellees in the same class and charged them the same rate, and could not have charged appellees what was in essence a higher rate than it charged others while they were in the same rate class. The court affirmed the decision denying appellees attorney fees under the common fund theory and 42 U.S.C.S. &sect;19831, and found that fees were not available where appellees were resisting a legislative action that benefited a class of citizens.</SPAN></P>

The court denied appellee's request for attorney fees because the requirements for recovery under the common fund theory or 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 19831 were not met.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">During an altercation, appellant fired a gun at four people and shot and killed one of them. Appellant was convicted of first-degree murder by extreme indifference to human life and first-degree assault. Appellant challenged his conviction. On appeal, the court affirmed. The first-degree murder statute,&nbsp;Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9A.32.030(1)(b), was not unconstitutionally vague as applied to appellant, who should have known that firing his gun at the four people created a grave risk of death. As appellant did not object to the jury instruction he challenged on appeal, it was necessary for him to show that the instruction contained an error that violated his constitutional right. As the error alleged involved the definition of an element of first-degree murder, it did not involve a constitutional right. Also, two other instructions set forth all of the elements of the crime. As first-degree murder did not involve the same elements as first-degree assault, there was no double jeopardy violation. The crimes charged were against multiple victims and did not merge. As the two offenses did not involve the same criminal conduct, the trial court did not err by imposing consecutive sentences.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court vacated defendant's conviction and sentence and remanded the matter for entry of findings and conclusions. Under Wash. R. Crim. P. 6.1(d), the court was required to enter written findings of fact and conclusions of law because defendant was tried without a jury. The requirement enabled the appellate court to review the issues on appeal. The trial court was instructed not to take additional evidence when it entered its written findings and conclusions.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from an order of the Superior Court of King County (Washington) entering a judgment of conviction against defendant for stalking, Wash.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When their marriage was dissolved, defendant followed his ex-wife and threatened to kill her boyfriend. After the wife remarried, defendant continued to follow her, and was eventually convicted of stalking, Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9A.46.110. At sentencing, the court considered pretrial and trial testimony, as well as the state's memorandum, the Department of Corrections presentence report, and the defense presentence report. The court then imposed an exceptional sentence of 24 months, a sentence twice the standard range. Defendant appealed his conviction on the grounds that the court erred in imposing an exceptional sentence and that the stalking statute itself was unconstitutional because it was overly broad, vague, and violated procedural due process. The court affirmed defendant's conviction, holding that defendant failed to file a motion to modify the ruling, and that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in imposing an exceptional sentence. The record adequately supported the sentence based on the trial court's finding of deliberate cruelty. Finally, the court held that the statute was not unconstitutionally overbroad or vague.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction for stalking, and held that the exceptional sentence was warranted based on defendant's deliberate cruelty against his wife.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant pleaded guilty to communicating with a minor for an immoral purpose, second degree assault, and failing to register as a sex offender after he engaged in two separate incidents of random attempted abductions of women within moments of each other and twice failed to register as a sex offender. The sentencing court imposed an exceptional sentence. On review of the sentence, the court affirmed. The evidence was sufficient to persuade a fair-minded person that the second victim's injuries were substantially greater than typical for a second degree assault case. If the sentencing court had not considered appellant's prior unscored misdemeanor of failing to register as a sex offender, the result would have been a presumptive range sentence that was too lenient. The phrase &quot;seriousness of the victim's injuries,&quot; as an aggravating factor leading to an exceptional sentence, was not unconstitutionally vague, did not infringe upon appellant's right to appeal his exceptional sentence, and did not violate appellant's right to equal protection and due process.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed appellant's exceptional sentence because the sentencing court's reasons for imposing the exceptional sentence were legally adequate and supported by the record and because the statutes authorizing exceptional sentences were not unconstitutionally vague as applied to appellant.</SPAN></P>

Appellant sent a note for the debt to respondent debtor and respondent Chief Executive Officer (CEO) signed the note, attached a Post-It brand fax transmittal memo indicating that the note came from him, and sent the note via facsimile. The note went unpaid, and appellant sued both respondent CEO and respondent debtor. The trial court found that the writing on the Post-It, along with the signature, identified respondent debtor as the principal on the note. It held that respondent CEO was not personally liable for the debt because he signed the note as an agent for respondent debtor. On appeal, the court concluded that the writing on a Post-It brand fax transmittal memo was independent of the underlying document. Respondent CEO bore the burden of rebutting a presumption of personal liability. Because he did not provide evidence that rebutted that presumption, he was personally liable on the note and the trial court's judgment was reversed.</SPAN></P>

This led to the removal of 59 dogs and 4 cats, a number of which exhibited health and hygiene problems. Respondent moved to suppress the evidence obtained from the search. The district court denied the motion and convicted her on all 18 counts. She then appealed to the superior court. The superior court reversed the convictions, finding former &sect; 16.52.070 to be unconstitutionally vague because of its lack of sufficient standards to prevent arbitrary enforcement. The state appealed. On appeal, the court concluded that the statute's failure to describe the proscribed conduct with sufficient particularity invited law enforcement to exercise an inordinate amount of discretion. The court held that the statute was unconstitutionally vague and that the district court convicted respondent without fair, solid, and substantial cause.

The second teller, who also thought that appellant was reaching for a weapon, also gave him money. Appellant was arrested carrying the money in a plastic bag. No weapon was recovered. Appellant was convicted of second degree robbery and was sentenced to prison without the possibility of early release under the Persistent Offender Accountability Act (POAA). Appellant sought review of the judgment contending that it was error to count his non-Washington robbery convictions as &quot;strikes&quot; under the POAA. The court concluded that appellant's non-Washington robbery convictions were comparable to Washington's first or second degree robbery convictions, which were &quot;most serious offenses&quot; for sentencing purposes. Thus, the court affirmed the sentencing court's calculation of appellant's offender score.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee city's ordinance required erotic dancers in adult cabarets to stay at least four feet away from patrons. In 1996, appellant adult entertainment business sued appellee in federal court and challenged the constitutionality of the ordinance. The federal court ruled the ordinance was constitutional and granted appellee summary judgment. In 1997, the Washington Supreme Court affirmed the constitutionality of a similar ordinance. Later that year, appellant sued appellee in state court, challenging the constitutionality of the ordinance. The trial court granted appellee summary judgment but denied attorney fees. The appellate affirmed dismissal but reversed and remanded for an award of attorney fees. Principles of collateral estoppel and res judicata precluded litigation of the present suit. The Washington Supreme Court already ruled that a four-foot limit was constitutional. Also, appellant's present suit arose from the same nucleus of facts and involved the same parties as its suit in federal court. Appellee was entitled to recover attorney fees because the suit was frivolous.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order granting appellee city summary judgment was affirmed. Earlier decisions involving the same ordinance and parties clearly precluded the challenge to appellee's ordinance by appellant adult entertainment business. The order denying appellee attorney fees was reversed and remanded. Appellee was entitled to attorney fees for having to defend a frivolous suit at trial and on appeal.</SPAN></P>

The lower court affirmed respondent board's finding that respondent county had complied with its remand order requiring reasonable public participation.

Rev. Code &sect; 36.70A. It then denied appellant's request for attorney fees against respondent board finding Wash. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's prosecution from the Superior Court of Walla Walla County (Washington) for prison misbehavior pursuant to Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.94.070, was dismissed because the statute unconstitutionally delegated to the Department of Corrections the power to define a serious infraction, an element of the crime. The state appealed. Defendant cross-appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, an inmate with no time credits, was charged with persistent prison misbehavior after refusing to stand for a search. The trial court dismissed the charges, solely on the ground that the legislature had improperly delegated its authority under Wash. Const. art. II, &sect; 1. On appeal, defendant argued that the delegation lacked adequate procedural safeguards. The court held that the legislature provided standards, which in general terms stated what was to be done and the administrative body that was to do it. The necessary procedural safeguards, however, were missing. Considering the four suggested safeguards as a whole, the court concluded that they did not sufficiently address the problem of delegating to the Department of Corrections (DOC) the authority to define a crime without legislative oversight or safeguard against prior loss of liberty. The suggested safeguards were inadequate to control and guard against arbitrary administrative actions or abuses of discretion prior to loss of liberty by criminal conviction. Consequently, Wash. Rev. Code 9.94.070 constituted an unconstitutional delegation of legislative authority to the DOC.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's conclusion that the legislature unconstitutionally delegated the authority to the Department of Corrections to define serious infractions. Although the legislature provided general terms to define what was to be done by the administrative body, the procedural safeguards were inadequate because they did not adequately control or guard against arbitrary administrative action or abuse of discretion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with hunting without a license and hunting while a license was revoked, as well as the gross misdemeanor of harassment, after he and a friend were confronted on private property by a person working there. The employee advised the men that hunting with dogs was illegal, and the defendant's friend responded, generally admitting that they were hunting raccoons. At trial, the admissions made by the friend were introduced as &quot;adoptive admissions&quot; and were held not to be hearsay. Defendant was convicted of the charges. On appeal, the court affirmed the convictions, finding no error in the trial court proceedings, but vacated the imposition of a fine as to the charge of hunting without a license, on grounds this charge was merged into the charge of hunting after forfeiture of license. The court found that facts were sufficient to established the corpus delicti of hunting and that the adoptive admission was properly admitted. The court held that the testimony of the witness was introduced for the purpose of impeachment as important facts in appellee's case were established by the witness, and that there was substantial evidence to support the convictions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Subsequent to his conviction, based on a guilty plea, for violating the state's controlled substance law, appellant claimed he was sentenced under the wrong statute and that his sentence constituted cruel and unusual punishment. The court first held that the judgment form merely contained a scrivener's error concerning the statutes under which appellant was convicted and sentenced. The court ordered the error corrected and held that it was not prejudicial to appellant. The court then noted that the sentence appellant received was less than the recommended sentence that he agreed upon in the plea bargain he accepted. Following analogous case law, the court held that appellant's plea agreement to a sentence that was less than the maximum recommended under state guidelines precluded his disproportionality challenge. As a result, the court upheld the sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant's conviction and sentence for violating the state's controlled substances statute was affirmed because appellant had waived his challenge to the sentence.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted and sentenced for telephone harassment and for violating a no-contact order that his sister had obtained while fearing for her safety. Defendant was ordered to leave the county after his release from jail. Defendant did not leave the county and was later arrested for violating the conditions of his sentence. The trial judge affirmed the geographic restriction, stating that the victim's right to security prevailed over defendant's right to live where he desired. Defendant filed an emergency motion, requesting an order for immediate release and stay of the geographical restriction pending further proceedings; defendant argued the restriction violated his constitutional right to travel. On review, the court found that the state had a compelling interest in protecting the victim from defendant's harassment that justified a narrowly tailored limitation on the offender's right to travel. However, the sentencing court's order imposing a geographical restriction on an entire county was also unnecessarily broad because the record did not indicate that the victim frequented so much of the county to justify a county-wide ban. The case was reversed and remanded.</SPAN></P>

Shortly before he was scheduled to be released from prison, the state filed a petition for civil commitment, pursuant to Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 71.09, seeking a determination that appellant was a sexually violent predator. After a probable cause hearing, appellant was detained and ordered to undergo a mental health evaluation to determine whether he was a sexually violent predator. Appellant challenged a trial court judgment finding him in contempt of court for refusing to participate in the court-ordered evaluation. Appellant contended that he was denied effective assistance of counsel when his attorney was not allowed to participate in the evaluation process. The appeals court affirmed the trial court decision. The court ruled that appellant had the right to have his attorney observe, but not participate in, the standardized psychological testing. The court added that while appellant was entitled to counsel at all stages of the proceedings, that did not include assistance with answering the questions in the psychological testing, because that would undermine the validity of the test.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appeals court affirmed the trial court decision because appellant's right to counsel at all stages of the proceedings did not include assistance with answering the questions in the psychological testing. The court also ruled that the sexually violent predator act was a civil proceeding and involuntary confinement pursuant to the act was not punitive or further charges.</SPAN></P>

Appellants claimed that the termination order should be reversed due to ineffective assistance of counsel. Upon review, the court held that even under the most rigorous standard of review, appellants failed to demonstrate that their counsel's allegedly deficient performance actually prejudiced them. Appellants also contended that they were unconstitutionally denied the right to a jury trial. The court held that the lower court properly denied a jury trial because the state constitution did not guarantee the right to a jury trial in a civil parental termination proceeding. Appellants alleged that respondent state agency committed discovery violations by failing to turn over relevant documents in a timely manner. The court held that the trial court remedied this problem by giving appellants more time to prepare their case, and that such error was not prejudicial. The court affirmed that the termination of appellants' parental rights was in the best interests of their children.</SPAN></P>

Defendant police officers were entitled to qualified immunity from liability under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 and from liability for false arrest because they acted reasonably under settled law under the circumstances. Defendant bank was protected by the immunity afforded by Wash. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Police officers saw defendant, who appeared to be a youth at risk, on a street corner on a school night with older companions who had been prosecuted for drug offenses. After the officers physically stopped defendant, she seemed nervous and refused to keep her hands in view; the officers frisked her, discovering illegal drugs. Defendant moved to suppress the narcotics on the basis they were illegally seized. Defendant's motion was denied, and she appealed. The court affirmed denial of the motion. The court determined the officers seized defendant when they took hold of her arm to stop her. Applying a balancing test, the court held defendant's interest in being free of police interference was outweighed by the officers' legitimate attempt to carry out their community caretaking function; defendant initially refused to let officers find out if she was in danger, and her seizure was thus justified. There was no proof defendant's stop was a pretext for an illegal search. The officers properly frisked defendant based on a reasonable belief she was harboring a weapon; the scope of the frisk was valid. The narcotics, simultaneously in plain view during the frisk, were properly seized.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Order denying defendant's motion to suppress narcotics was affirmed because defendant was properly stopped by police officers who were carrying out their function as community caretakers; there was no proof the stop was a pretext for an illegal search. Further, the frisk which uncovered the narcotics was proper because it was based on the officers' reasonable belief defendant had a weapon.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Upon a jury verdict, appellant was convicted of first and second degree murder, under Wash. Rev. Code &sect;&sect; 9A.32.030(1)(c), 9A.08.020, and 9A.32.050(b). Appellant was convicted under the persistent offender statute,&nbsp;&sect; 9.94A.120(4), and was sentenced to life in prison with no possibility of parole. The appellate court vacated the second degree murder conviction, under &sect; 10.43.020, as conceded by respondent state. However, the judgment was otherwise affirmed. The appellate court held that appellant failed to preserve an issue for review. Furthermore, it was not an abuse of discretion for the trial court to allow evidence of appellant's prior bad act because it was introduced to rebut appellant's assertions. Even if the admission was in error, it was harmless error because substantial evidence supported the conviction. Statements of appellant's inmate were not admitted in error because there was no evidence that the inmate was a state agent. Because the evidence supported the first degree murder conviction, appellant suffered no injustice on double jeopardy grounds. Finally, the appellate court held that, based on precedent, &sect; 9.94A.120(4) was constitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant's second degree murder conviction was vacated because, as conceded by respondent state, double jeopardy prohibited conviction for different degrees of a crime involving the same incident and victim. The conviction and sentence for first degree murder was affirmed because substantial evidence supported the conviction, and admission of an inmate's statement was not erroneous because there was no evidence the inmate was a state agent.</SPAN></P>

The court determined the foregoing, coupled with the opinion of an expert that appellant was more likely than not to engage in predatory acts of sexual violence if not confined in a secure facility, provided sufficient evidence to support the finding that appellant was a sexually violent predator. The court also found that treating sexually violent predators differently from persons committed under &sect; 71.05 with respect to the time at which less restrictive alternatives may be considered was rationally related to a legitimate government objective and therefore did not deprive appellant of equal protection of the laws for his commitment under &sect; 71.09.</SPAN></P>

Appellant sought review and claimed the findings supporting the sentences were clearly erroneous and legally insufficient, the exceptional sentence statutes as applied to his conduct were unconstitutionally vague, and his sentences violated equal protection. The court affirmed the sentences for the assaults because the same sentence would have been imposed under the more egregious than typical standard, and &sect; 9.94A et seq. was not unconstitutionally vague.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, a children's hospital, filed a petition for judicial review, challenging the Washington State Department of Health's determination that another hospital could perform pediatric open heart surgeries without a Certificate of Need (CN) review. The court found plaintiff was not entitled to relief under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 34.05.570(4), which allows relief for performance by an agency action, only if the action was unconstitutional, outside the statutory authority of the agency or the authority conferred by a provision of law, or arbitrary or capricious, or taken by people not properly constituted as agency officials lawfully entitled to such action. The court dismissed the hospital's petition for judicial review. Plaintiff appealed. The court reversed, finding that pediatric open heart surgery was a specialized inpatient pediatric service that required CN review, that pediatric open heart surgery was a tertiary health service that was new to the hospital, and required CN review, and the Department's determination to the contrary was arbitrary and capricious. Thus, before the hospital could perform pediatric open heart surgery, the Department must first conduct CN review.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants attacked four people, hijacked their car, took their property, and sexually assaulted a victim. The trial court convicted appellants of kidnapping, robbery, attempted robbery, and rape. On appeal, the court affirmed. The trial court did not err in refusing to sever the trial because appellants' defenses were not mutually antagonistic, and appellants did not show resulting prejudice. The admission of prior crimes into evidence was not in error, as the crimes were admissible under Wash. R. Evid. 404(b) as proof of plan, motive, and identity. The warrantless search of an appellant's apartment was legal as a resident with common authority over the apartment consented. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in finding that the charges for the kidnapping and robbery were not part of the same criminal conduct, as they occurred in different locations. The firearm enhancements were proper although the jury specially found that the defendants were armed with a deadly weapon, not with a firearm. One appellant received a fair trial as the prosecutor's statement that appellant had not gone to the police after the crimes was improper but amounted to harmless error.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was sentenced as a persistent offender after he was convicted of burglary and robbery. Defendant claimed his two prior offenses, in another state, could not be used as the elements were different under the two state laws. Since aggravated battery was the most serious offense defendant was convicted of in the other state, and was comparable to the state's crime of second degree assault, this conviction could be used. However, his prior conviction for robbery had a different intent standard and could not be used. Defendant argued his out of state conviction for battery was unconstitutional. The court ruled the state only needed to prove the conviction, not the validity of the conviction. Thus, defendant had to be resentenced based on the one prior offense. In the challenge to defendant's conviction, the court found that due process could not be presumed based upon his attorney's compensation. Defendant was required to demonstrate prejudice to his rights. It also found no error in the photo identification by the victim and affirmed the conviction.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction of both burglary and robbery, finding no errors in the identification or ineffective counsel.

Defendant filed a cross-appeal alleging ineffective assistance of counsel and unconstitutional vagueness of the sentence enhancement statute,&nbsp;Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.94A.310(3)(e).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court found three mitigating factors in setting the sentence for defendant after he had been convicted of first degree assault with a firearm. The state appealed, contending the reasons were not supported by the record. The court, in determining there was substantial evidence to support the trial court's findings of mitigating circumstances, held that the failed defense of self-defense could be used as a mitigating factor. On defendant's cross-appeal of ineffective assistance of counsel, the court found no prejudice in counsel's failure to present evidence of diminished capacity. The court also found that defendant did not meet his burden of proving the 60-month firearm enhancement statute was unconstitutionally vague beyond a reasonable doubt and it was properly run consecutive to his underlying sentence as required under Wash. Rev. Code. &sect; 9.94A.310(3)(e).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the decision granting a mitigated sentence because the facts in the record supported the reasons given.

The court disagreed with the felony stalking argument noting that, not only did an insufficiency argument admit the truth of the prosecution's evidence, but the fact that appellant contacted the victim after being served with a no-contact order was prima facie evidence of felony stalking.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged the judgment of the Superior Court of King County (Washington) that convicted him, pursuant to Wash.

Appellant asserted that the trial court erroneously instructed the jury and that the trial court's erroneous jury instructions rendered &sect; 9.68A.070&nbsp;unconstitutionally vague and violative of due process.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged his conviction of one count of possession of a depiction of a minor engaged in sexually explicit conduct, arguing that the trial court erred by failing to instruct the jury that knowledge of the minor status of the individual depicted was an essential element of the offense, by basing his conviction on a statute which did not proscribe possession of digitized images of child pornography, and by instructing the jury that visual or printed matter included material that could be viewed either with the human eye or with the aid of devices which transform it so that it could be viewed. Appellant also claimed that Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.68A.070 was overbroad and violative of due process. On appeal, the court affirmed. Knowledge of the age of the persons depicted in sexually explicit material was not an essential element of &sect; 9.68A.070. Under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.68A.011(2), the computerized pornographic images possessed by appellant fell within the proscriptions of &sect; 9.68A.070. It was not inappropriate for the trial court to clarify for the jury the definition of visual or printed matter as used in &sect; 9.68A.070.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed appellant's conviction of one count of possession of a depiction of a minor engaged in sexually explicit conduct. Knowledge of the minor status of the person depicted was not an element of the offense, the applicable statute was not overbroad or violative of due process, and the trial court appropriately clarified the statutory language in its instruction to the jury.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, a group of homeowners, filed an application for a preliminary plat with the county board of commissioners (Board). The Board denied the application, and the trial court affirmed the decision. On appeal, appellants argued that the Board had no authority to deny the plat because of risks of pesticide migration from a neighboring orchard, that the Board's decision was not supported by substantial evidence, that the decision was an unconstitutional taking of private property for public use, and that the decision violated their right of substantive due process. The court ruled that the Board had authority under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 58.17.110, to consider whether the proposed plat was compatible with the lawful operation of the neighboring orchard. Further, the court held that the test of substantial evidence was whether evidence was sufficient to persuade a fair-minded person of the truth of the declared premise, and that the Board's findings were supported by substantial evidence. The court affirmed the judgment, concluding that appellants' taking claim was not ripe under federal constitutional analysis, and that appellants could not raise a substantive due process claim.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment denying appellants' plat application was affirmed where the county board of commissioners had the authority to deny the plat and its decision was supported by substantial evidence. Appellants' claim that the decision was an unconstitutional taking of private property for public use was not ripe under federal constitutional analysis, and the claim that the decision violated appellants' substantive due process rights was without merit.</SPAN></P>

Appellant did not offer, sell, or distribute transportation services to the customers who shipped goods with appellee.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Approval of appellants' filed plan and planned unit development (PUD) application was invalidated by the trial court. The trial court improperly held that the PUD application did not vest to the zoning laws in effect when the application was filed, and this portion of its decision was reversed. However, the zoning laws to which the project did vest included the county's Interim Urban Growth Area. Consequently, the project was subject to the Growth Management Act's (GMA), Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 36.70, prohibition against growth, urban in nature, outside an urban growth area. Because appellants did not show that their project could be compatible with the primary use of such land for the production of food, other agricultural products, or fiber, or the extraction of mineral resources, it was considered urban development. Approval of the project, therefore, violated the GMA because it allowed development, which was urban in nature, to occur outside the area designated for interim urban growth. Judgment reversing the commissioners' decision to approve the application was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment invalidating county commissioners' approval of appellants' planned unit development as violative of Growth Management Act was affirmed, where the development was urban in nature and was to continue in a geographic area outside of that statutorily designated for urban development. Finding that appellants did not have a vested right to have their application considered only under the zoning laws in effect when it was filed was reversed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court of appeals upheld a judgment issuing a sentence enhancement under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 69.50.435(a) for delivery of heroin within 1000 feet of a school bus route stop. Defendant contended that the school bus route stop enhancement was unconstitutional as applied to him because he did not have fair notice that his conduct was subject to an enhanced penalty. Defendant contended that the state failed to prove that he could have learned the location of the school bus route stop by any readily understandable or available means. The court noted that the focus of a court's inquiry was not the number of children served by a bus stop, but the daily appearance of a bus picking up school-aged children, which was sufficient to put drug dealers on notice of the possibility of a school bus stop. The court found that in addition to personal observation, defendant had other understandable and available means to determine the existence of a school bus stop at the location, such as contacting the school district for a map or list of school bus stops. The court concluded that the facts were sufficient to support the sentence enhancement.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants contested a ruling from the Superior Court of Pierce County (Washington) that their building site plan did not meet zoning requirements, claiming that the requirements in effect at the time of filing differed from the ones used for approval purposes. Appellants argued for reversal under the Land Use Petition Act, Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 36.70C.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court considered whether appellants had a vested right to have the site plan application evaluated on the basis of the city code as it existed when the application was made. Because the city code allowed a developer to fix a date by filing a building permit, filing the site plan application did not vest appellants' rights to have their application processed according to the code in effect at filing. Further, where appellants offered copies of World Wide Web pages as proof of the code in existence when they filed, the court held that the web pages did not shed light on the legislative intent of the city council. Rather, they showed, at best, staff interpretation of the code. These were not legislative facts of which the court could take judicial notice. Moreover, the court declined to take judicial notice where appellants failed to move under the Land Use Petition Act, Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 36.70C, to supplement the administrative record with the web pages. Respondent city was entitled to reasonable attorney's fees in an amount to be set by a court commissioner.</SPAN></P>

They were tried together and represented by the same trial lawyer. The jury found both appellants guilty.

The court found that appellant counsel's joint representation posed no actual conflict of interest, which impinged their U.S. Const. amend. VI right to counsel. It was not enough to show a possibility of a conflict of interest; specific instances in the record were required. The court also held that there was no abuse of discretion with regard to the trial court's admission of child hearsay testimony. The trial court properly considered the nine Ryan factors of reliability, and a child's response to questions on sexual abuse fulfilled the spontaneity requirement of the analysis. The court further held that the prosecutor's closing arguments, wherein the prosecutor used the phrases &quot;I think,&quot; &quot;I don't think,&quot; or &quot;I believe&quot; when referring to the witnesses or evidence were not improper.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant contested a ruling from the Superior Court of Clallam County (Washington) denying her motion to suppress evidence of marijuana found pursuant to a search warrant. Appellant argued that the affidavit did not establish probable cause and that her motion to dismiss challenging Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 69.50.402(a)(6) for vagueness should have been granted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the conviction, finding the affidavit information sufficient to allow a reasonable inference that there was marijuana inside one or more of the buildings searched pursuant to the warrant. Further, a person of ordinary intelligence would understand that Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 69.50.402(a)(6) prohibited a person from acting so as to take responsibility for the physical or financial upkeep of real property that was used for drug related purposes. Although there was sufficient evidence to establish appellant's knowledge of the drug use and business occurring on her property, there was minimal evidence that she was personally active in drug use or distribution. Yet no reasonable juror could become confused by the language of the jury instruction. Because the statutory language was sufficiently precise to give fair warning of prohibited conduct, and clear enough to provide ascertainable standards of guilt, the court rejected appellant's vagueness challenge and affirmed the lower court's orders.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Because a reasonable person of ordinary intelligence could understand what conduct a drug house statute proscribed, and what the standard of guilt was, the statute was not overly vague, and the court affirmed the conviction.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><BR><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">DISPOSITION:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;The conviction of second degree murder is vacated; the conviction of first degree murder and the sentence of life without parole as a persistent offender are affirmed.  <BR></SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant contested his conviction and sentence for first degree and second degree felony murder from the Superior Court of Kitsap County (Washington), as well as the determination of persistent offender status based in part on an out of state robbery conviction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court vacated a second degree murder conviction because conviction on two counts for one murder violated double jeopardy protections. The court affirmed the conviction for first degree murder, finding no significant evidentiary errors. Appellant's classification as a persistent offender and sentence of life without parole were affirmed. It was not evident from the face of appellant's prior plea that he was unaware of the elements of the crime or the consequences of the plea. Accordingly, his conviction was not unconstitutional on its face. Further, the applicable definition of first degree robbery in the other state was comparable to the Washington definition where both required the taking of property from or in the presence of another person by force or fear of force while armed with a deadly weapon. Accordingly, the lower court did not err in holding that the conviction counted in determining appellant's persistent offender status. As he acknowledged that he had waived his right to allocution, appellant ratified his waiver, and it was valid. Where appellant did not make an offer of proof later at trial, the issue was waived, and could not be argued on appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Vacating the second degree murder conviction on double jeopardy grounds, the court affirmed the first degree murder conviction, classification as a persistent offender and the life sentence where appellant was aware of the crime's elements and consequences at the time of the prior plea and the applicable out of state conviction was properly counted for persistent offender purposes.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review from a decision of the Superior Court of Pacific County (Washington), which convicted and sentenced appellant for assault in the third degree by criminal negligence under Wash.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted and sentenced for assault in the third degree by criminal negligence. Appellant contended that her procedural due process rights were violated because the common understanding of assault required intentional behavior. Appellant argued that the legislature could not redefine assault to include negligent assault, and that it was unconstitutional for appellant to be convicted under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9A.36.031(1)(f). The instant court stated that the statute specifically listed criminal negligence as one way that a person could commit assault. It was clear on the face of the statute that the culpable mental state for third-degree assault had been legislatively broadened. Further, the legislature's power to define crimes and prescribe punishment was virtually exclusive, nearly unlimited, and left practically no correlative power to do the same in the courts. Thus, appellant's conviction of negligent assault did not violate her constitutional rights. Further, the court held that appellant's actions were inconsistent of a person in the position of a live-in caretaker, and that appellant's actions warranted an exceptional sentence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent agency obtained termination of appellants' parental rights with respect to their six-year-old child. Trial court found that appellants were incapable of meeting the child's needs due to their chronic mental illness. Appellants challenged the ruling on the grounds that necessary services failed to accommodate their handicap and that their parental rights were terminated solely because of their disability, in violation of state and federal handicap and discrimination statutes. They also raised various due process claims. The court affirmed the trial court's ruling. There was little likelihood that conditions would be remedied, continuation of the parent-child relationship diminished the child's prospects for early integration into a stable and permanent home, and termination was in the best interests of the child. The trial court properly based its determination on requirements in Wash. Rev. Code &sect;&sect; 13.34.180(1)-(6). The court rejected appellants' claims that there was unlawful discrimination based on mental capacity and that there was a denial of due process, as statutes protecting those with handicaps did not prevent termination of parental rights when appropriate.</SPAN></P>

Two of its employees filed separate charges with plaintiff city's human rights department alleging religious, disability, race, and national origin discrimination under Tacoma, Wash., Mun.

Defendant manifested an extreme indifference to human life and created a grave risk of death, conduct that fit only the first-degree murder statute, not manslaughter. The evidence was sufficient to support the first-degree murder conviction, because defendant killed an unintended victim and jeopardized the lives of others. The first-degree murder statute,&nbsp;Wash. Rev.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In Washington state court defendant was acquitted of conspiracy but convicted of attempted murder and burglary on the basis of vicarious liability for the actions of others. He appealed his convictions, claiming that the trial court erred in giving Pinkerton instructions on conspiracy because the Pinkerton doctrine was not the law in Washington. Defendant also claimed that even if the Pinkerton doctrine was the law, the trial court's instructions were defective because they improperly allowed the jury to hold defendant vicariously liable without finding him guilty of all elements of accomplice liability. The appellate court reversed defendant's convictions. It held that the trial court's instructions were fatally defective because they did not advise the jury that it could not find defendant guilty for the substantive acts of co-conspirators unless it also found him guilty of conspiracy. Failure to instruct on an element of an offense was reversible error, so defendant was entitled to reversal of his convictions. Because the instructions were fatally defective, the court declined to rule on whether the Pinkerton doctrine was the law in Washington.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court explained that defendant was entitled to reversal because the trial court issued jury instructions that improperly allowed the jury to convict defendant for the substantive crimes of his co-conspirators without convicting him for conspiracy.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant land owner sought approval of its development plan for a parcel of land. Its application was approved with the condition that it build an access road and connect the sewer line through the adjacent federal land. The trial court affirmed the conditions. Appellant challenged the decision arguing the conditions were unconstitutional, an unlawful taking, and violative of substantive due process, thereby arbitrary and capricious. In affirming the decision, the court found that the property could be developed and had economic viability, even though not to the extent appellant desired. Thus, there was no unconstitutional taking of the land. Since the required conditions served solely to benefit appellant, his substantive due process rights were not violated. The conditions served the legitimate public purpose of insuring adequate access to the property and sanitary disposal of waste. Requiring appellant to connect the road and sewer to existing services was reasonably necessary and not unduly oppressive.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Code &sect; 46.20.308, for his alleged refusal to take a breath alcohol test upon his arrest for driving under the influence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant driver was pulled over, and when he failed field sobriety tests, he was arrested for driving under the influence. At the station house, appellant refused to sign an implied consent acknowledgement and refused to submit to a breath test. The arresting state troopers then submitted reports to respondent department regarding appellant's refusal. When his driver's license was administratively suspended under the implied consent law, Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 46.20.308, appellant requested a hearing and subpoenaed the troopers. Two troopers did not appear, so the hearing was continued and the subpoenas reissued. At the second hearing, none of the troopers appeared. Appellant's motion to dismiss was denied, and based solely on the trooper's written reports, as permitted by &sect; 46.20.308(8), the suspension was upheld. Appellant then sought judicial review. In reversing, the court ruled that revocation of a driver's license was a property interest that was subject to due process, including the right to confront witnesses. Appellant's due process rights were violated by his inability to obtain the attendance of the troopers and the denial of an opportunity to cross-examine them.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The administrative suspension of appellant's driver's license was reversed because his procedural due process rights were denied by respondent department's reliance on police reports, as permitted by statute, when he was frustrated in his attempts to compel the attendance of the state troopers who arrested him and thus was denied the opportunity to confront and cross-examine the evidence used against him.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants appealed from the Superior Court, Spokane County, (Washington), which held former Wash. Rev. Code &sect;&sect; 46.61.5051-.5053 defined new crimes, separate from the drug and alcohol offenses defined in &sect;&sect; 46.61.502 and .504, which were not subject to minimum penalties because they required proof of additional elements, and, as the prosecutor's charging discretion was limited, were saved from alleged constitutional violations.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The lower court found no constitutional violations in the application of former Wash. Rev. Code &sect;&sect; 46.61.5051-.5053 to defendants because proof of additional elements of driving under the influence of drugs or alcohol other than those of sections 46.61.502 and .504 were required and because defendant who pled guilty or was found guilty after trial could receive exactly the same sentence. The court affirmed, holding that permitting but not requiring a sentencing court to suspend all or part of the otherwise mandatory 90-day license suspension in return for a guilty plea did not place an unconstitutional burden on the exercise of defendant's constitutional right to a jury trial. Those who pled not guilty and those who pled guilty remained subject to the same possible maximum penalty but a proper degree of leniency could be obtained in return for a guilty plea. Equal protection under Wash. Const. art. I, &sect; 12 was not violated because proof of additional elements to those required under sections 46.502 and .504 limited the prosecutor's charging discretion under former sections 46.61.5051-.5053. Only statutes with identical elements but harsher penalties violated the state constitution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decision of the lower court upholding the constitutionality of statutes providing harsher penalties for driving while under the influence of drugs or alcohol and lesser penalties for a guilty plea thereto was affirmed because the requirement of additional elements limited the prosecutor's charging authority and the maximum possible sentence could be received for either a conviction or a plea.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from the judgment of the Superior Court of Cowlitz County (Washington), entered upon a jury verdict, convicting him of first degree burglary, Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9A.52.020, and imposing a life sentence as a persistent offender under the &quot;three strikes&quot; law, Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.94A.120(4).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was implicated in a burglary, and his cohabiting girlfriend consented to a search of their home, during which deputies found a pellet gun that was taken in the burglary. A deputy advised him of his Miranda rights, questioned him, and then arrested him. He was taken to the station house, where he gave a statement without being re-advised of his rights. Defendant's motion to suppress the statement was denied, and he was convicted of first degree burglary, Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9A.52.020. Evidence was presented at sentencing that he had six prior felony convictions, including robbery and second degree assault. Pursuant to the &quot;three strikes&quot; persistent offender law, Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.94A.120(4), he was sentenced to life imprisonment. Defendant appealed. In affirming, the court ruled that deputies were not required to repeat the Miranda warnings that were given before defendant's arrest. The search was valid due to consent, and defendant failed to show manifest error in admitting the pellet gun. Also, &sect; 9.94A.120(4) was not retroactive and his sentence was not cruel or excessive, especially since first degree burglary was already punishable by up to life in prison.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The conviction and sentence were affirmed because the warrantless search of his mobile home was valid due to the consent of his live-in girlfriend; defendant was given Miranda warnings prior to his arrest, and his later custodial statements were admissible without the warnings being repeated; the three-strikes law was not impermissibly retroactive; and the life sentence was not cruel or excessive punishment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the dismissal of his motion to set aside his guilty plea for second degree burglary on grounds it was not made voluntarily and knowingly. The court affirmed, holding that under Wash Rev.

The court held that defendant failed to carry his burden of proof in showing the statute in question was unconstitutional for purposes of Wash. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant landowners sought review of an order from the Superior Court of Whitman County (Washington), which had enjoined them from building a garage or shop on their Colton property on the ground that structure was not permitted by the town's zoning ordinance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, appellant landowners contended that the Land Use Petition Act (LUPA), Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 36.70C, provided the exclusive remedy to respondent neighbors' action and that the action was not filed within the applicable limitations period. The court held that respondents were not required to comply with LUPA because they did not have standing to pursue its remedies as provided for in Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 36.70C.060, noting that the building inspector was not required to consider respondents' interests in determining whether to issue a building permit to appellants. The court further found that respondents' complaint for an injunction was timely, noting that respondents had initiated their lawsuit one week after they became specifically aware that the building permit had been issued, which was a reasonable period of time for limitations purposes. The court affirmed, finding that the local zoning ordinance properly prohibited the building of appellants' proposed structure where the structure was not &quot;appurtenant&quot; to the residence, as required under &sect; 4(c) of the ordinance, because it was built on a lot adjoining to, but separate from, the house.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from the judgment of the Superior Court of Walla Walla County (Washington), which convicted him of the aggravated first degree murder of a prison inmate, committed while he was serving a life sentence for a previous prison murder.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought reversal of his murder conviction, claiming a 20-year delay in perfecting his appeal violated due process. He alleged he was denied a speedy trial; his right to appear and defend were infringed upon by courtroom security procedures including shackles; premeditation was not proved; he was not permitted to be present at all stages of the trial, and he received ineffective assistance of counsel. The court affirmed defendant's conviction for murder of a fellow inmate under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9A.32.046 (1975). Defendant was not prejudiced by any delay in the appeal process, as there was no substantive merit to his appeal. The court concluded that the trial court did not err in denying a motion for speedy trial and granting a continuance under Wash. Super. Ct. Crim. R. 3.3(e)(3) (1976). The trial court did not abuse its discretion by declining defendant's offer to waive objection to a security order. Defendant failed to show he was denied due process or effective assistance of counsel. In short, the evidence showed that defendant committed premeditated murder, and defendant failed to show any prejudice in the conduct of the case warranting reversal.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of an order of the Superior Court of Grays Harbor County (Washington), denying appellant's suppression motion, granting the prosecution's motion to prevent appellant's use of certain defenses, and entering judgment of conviction of manufacture and possession of marijuana in violation of the Uniform Controlled Substances Act, Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 69.50.401(a)(1).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, convicted of manufacturing marijuana, was under supervision. After receiving information suggesting that appellant was distributing marijuana, the police searched and found marijuana plants. The police obtained a warrant and seized the evidence. Appellant was charged with marijuana manufacture and possession under the Uniform Controlled Substances Act (the Act), Wash. Rev. Code &sect;&sect; 69.50.401(a)(1) and 69.50.401(d). The trial court denied appellant's suppression motion and granted the prosecution's motion in limine to prevent appellant's religious and medical defenses. The trial court convicted appellant. On appeal, the court affirmed. The suppression motion was properly denied because appellant was subject to warrantless search as a condition of supervision, substantial evidence supported the finding that the police's entry was not forced, and the police reasonably suspected criminal behavior. The Act was constitutional. The trial court properly disallowed appellant from presenting a religious use defense because any such use yielded to the state's interest in marijuana regulation; appellant did not present medical evidence to prove necessity of use.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of conviction; the denial of the motion to suppress was not an abuse of discretion because the warrantless search was proper as a condition of supervision and was supported by reasonable belief that appellant was distributing marijuana; the statute was constitutional; appellant's religious use defense was forbidden, and appellant did not submit evidence in support of his medical necessity defense.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant teacher sued respondent school district for refusing to pay her for 13 days' work, during which appellant taught without a valid certificate as required by her contract. The trial court dismissed her claim for failure to meet the filing requirements of Wash. Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 28A.645.010, holding it lacked subject matter jurisdiction. Appellant contended her suit was not subject to the statute, and, alternatively, its 30-day statute of limitations violated the equal protection clause. The court affirmed, holding that the statute applied to appellant's breach of contract claim, and its exceptions did not apply. Respondent simply refused to pay appellant for 13 days of work, which was analogous to reduction of pension benefits. The plain language of the statute did not require a formal written decision, and appellant was personally notified of respondent's plan to recoup the money paid in error. As appellant's equal protection claims were not based on a suspect classification, the rational basis test applied. The statute did not limit or bar a teacher's right to file suit, nor did it inflict a procedural disadvantage on district employees not required of non-employees.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Code &sect; 42.17.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant citizen group sought access to documents, filed with the Insurance Commissioner, of the proposed acquisition of a health plan by a health cooperative. After the request was denied, appellant sued to compel disclosure. The trial court granted summary judgment dismissing the complaint. On appeal, appellant contended that Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 48.13.220(4)(g), preventing disclosure of documents filed with the commissioner, was unconstitutional. The court found that the statute was passed by a two-thirds vote, allowing it to amend the Public Disclosure Act (PDA) which had been enacted five months before. The statute was complete and did not require reference to other laws to make its meaning clear. There was no violation of the requirement that the bill not embrace more than one subject and that it be expressed in the title. Thus, the statute was constitutional. Under the PDA, public disclosure was required, except when exempt by another statute. There was no conflict requiring PDA be given priority. The court also found that its review was controlled by the Administrative Procedure Act and affirmed the decision denying disclosure.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants appealed from the Superior Court of King County (Washington), which convicted them of delivery of cocaine and involving a minor in a drug transaction; the state cross-appealed the sentence. Defendants contended that Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 69.50.401(f), which defines the crime of involving a minor in a drug transaction, was unconstitutionally vague as applied.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were charged from separate incidents with delivery of cocaine within 1,000 feet of a school bus stop and also with involving a minor in a drug transaction in violation of Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 69.50.401(f). In neither case was the minor culpable in the transaction; the minor did not handle the drugs or the money. In one case the minor was merely with the defendant during the sale. In the other case, defendant asked the minor to vouch for and to pat down the policeman posing as the buyer of the drugs. Defendants appealed their convictions, arguing that the statute was unconstitutionally vague as applied to them because it prohibited involving a minor in the transaction &quot;in any manner.&quot; The court affirmed the convictions applying the ordinary meaning of the word &quot;involve&quot; and said that an ordinary person would understand that defendants' actions were proscribed by the statute. The court also held that involving a minor in a drug transaction was a separate offense from the transaction itself with differing elements, so conviction under both statutes did not violate the Double Jeopardy clause and both crimes were to be counted for the purposes of sentencing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendants' convictions because defendants' actions were prohibited by the ordinary meaning of the statute prohibiting involving minors in a drug transaction. The court reversed one conviction for lack of evidence and reversed one defendant's sentence because the crimes of selling drugs and involving a minor in the sale of drugs were separate offenses for the purpose of calculating that defendant's offense level.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A victim reported that he had been robbed at gunpoint by three black men, one of whom had braided hair, who were traveling in a metallic blue two-door car. A police officer heard the report and, following a car and occupants of matching descriptions, turned on his emergency lights. The driver drove the car into a dark alley, and the driver opened the door but crouched in the driver's seat. He was verbally abusive but eventually complied with police demands. The police handcuffed the three occupants, one of whom was appellant. The victim identified the three men. The police saw ammunition in the car and searched, seizing a handgun. The court denied appellant's motion to suppress and convicted appellant of unlawful possession of a firearm in the first degree, revoking his driver's license under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 46.20.285(4). On appeal, the court affirmed. The trial court's denial of the suppression motion was not in error because, under the totality of the circumstances, the police made a valid Terry stop and the search of the car was justifiable for safety concerns. &sect; 46.20.285(4) was not unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>

He argued that his exceptional sentence for his second-degree murder conviction was improper because the sentencing court improperly relied upon deliberate cruelty as the single aggravating factor upon which it based the sentence. The reviewing court upheld the sentence. Deliberate cruelty occurs when the defendant's conduct in committing the offense includes gratuitous violence or other conduct that inflicts physical, psychological, or emotional pain as an end itself. Here, defendant inflicted numerous gratuitous blows over an extended and continuing period. Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.94A.120(2), was not unconstitutionally vague and permitted an exceptional sentence based upon a single substantial and compelling aggravating factor. The statute did not violate his right to equal protection.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant physician sought review of an order of the Superior Court of Cowlitz County (Washington), entering judgment for respondent in respondent's medical negligence action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent suffered from a deformed foot, and appellant physician operated on the toe in an attempt to straighten and stabilize the joints. The foot worsened, and the toes required amputation. Respondent brought a medical malpractice action against appellant. Respondent's expert witnesses testified that appellant's actions did not meet the standard of care. The trial court entered judgment for respondent with a 23 percent reduction due to her own negligence. On appeal, the court affirmed. The opinion of respondent's expert witness that appellant was not qualified to perform the surgery was both relevant and supported by the physician's training and experience. An opinion that appellant erred by not lengthening a heel cord, if admitted in error, likely had no effect upon the verdict. The trial court's refusal to direct a verdict due to the reasonable minority opinion doctrine was proper because appellant did not demonstrate that his procedures were within the standard of care. Appellant's cross-examination of respondent was effective despite numerous objection interruptions.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment for respondent; the expert opinions of respondent's witnesses were proper as the experts testified from their experience; appellant failed to show that a directed verdict due to the reasonable minority opinion doctrine was warranted; appellant's right to cross-examination of respondent was not abridged by numerous objections and court rulings.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant state interscholastic association sought review of a decision from the Superior Court of Stevens County (Washington), which reversed the administrative decision against respondent foreign student and found that appellant's rules regarding student participation in varsity sports violated U.S. Cons. amend. XIV's Equal Protection Clause.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court initially noted that even though the primary conflict was technically moot because respondent foreign student had returned to her country, discussion on appeal was warranted because the core issue was likely to recur and involved a matter of substantial public interest, that when resolved, would provide future guidance to the officers of appellant state interscholastic association. The court then held that it was not error to apply the strict scrutiny test when deciding whether appellant's residence and transfer rules violated respondent's equal protection rights, noting that respondent established that the rules discriminatorily impacted on her as a member of a suspect class based on national origin. The court further found that appellant failed to show that a compelling state interest was served by the challenged rules, noting that appellant made no effort to demonstrate that the least restrictive regulatory means were used to accomplish the stated purposes of the rules. The court affirmed, finding that it was not error to take judicial notice of the fact that typical foreign exchange students move to the United States without their family units.</SPAN></P>

Because petitioner's two 1995 convictions were not constitutionally invalid on their faces, the sentencing court properly used them to calculate her the offender score for her current conviction, notwithstanding petitioner's extrinsic evidence that her out-of-state attorney in those 1995 cases neither had court permission to appear pro hac vice nor associated himself with local counsel. Because petitioner filed her personal restraint petition attacking her 1995 convictions more than one year after they became final, and did not assert that any of the Wash. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff licensees sued defendant city in a dispute over a number of actions pertaining to denial of an application or revocation of a home business permit. Plaintiffs operated a home-based contracting business on residential property in a Tacoma neighborhood. Defendant found that plaintiffs violated city ordinances by keeping commercial equipment on their property. Plaintiffs sued defendant, claiming they had expanded their business in detrimental reliance on a permit and were entitled to damages. The lower court upheld defendant's determination that there were violations of city ordinances. On appeal by plaintiff, the court affirmed. It agreed with the lower court that home occupation regulations applied to vehicles used in connection with home businesses, and plaintiff was not entitled to park commercial equipment at his residence. The court concluded that the term &quot;equipment&quot; in former Tacoma Mun. Code &sect; 13.06.195(A)(2)(b) was not unconstitutionally vague. Thus, plaintiffs' claim to violation of due process rights was without merit. Defendant was entitled to enforce its valid zoning laws.</SPAN></P>

Appellant was convicted of second degree manslaughter. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that appellant was not denied the opportunity to argue his theory of the case based upon the trial court's refusal to give certain proposed instructions. The court properly refused the proposed supplemental instructions regarding trespass, because appellant was not charged with trespass and had no right to kill the neighbor even if he had the right to enter his property. The court also properly refused the instruction on use of a deadly weapon to eject a nonviolent trespasser, because appellant was not a nonviolent trespasser by virtue of his concealed weapon and his physical confrontation with his neighbor.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant retailer sought review of a ruling by the Superior Court of King County (Washington), which affirmed unemployment fund assessments imposed by respondent employment security department against appellant based on compensation appellant had paid to a director. Appellant claimed that the compensation was not wages and therefore was not subject to unemployment fund assessments.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant retailer decided to have one of its directors create a catalog to go on the Internet. Respondent employment security department conducted a routine compliance audit and discovered that appellant had not reported payments to the director for creating the catalog.

Respondent then issued an order and assessment against appellant for contributions to the state unemployment compensation fund. Appellant exhausted its administrative remedies and then sought review in the trial court, which affirmed respondent's decision; and appellant sought further review. The court found that respondent did not err by concluding that the director's services constituted employment under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 50.01.100. In addition, the court found that appellant failed to meet its burden of proving that Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 50.04.165 was unconstitutional and that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying appellant's motions for continuance, vacation of the judgment, and for reconsideration.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants were students that had missed nearly every day of school.

When they failed to return to school, the school filed a contempt motion. The trial court found them in contempt and sentenced them to detention. On appeal, appellants raised the issue of the right to appointed counsel in a challenge to the truancy statute. The trial court held that because no right to counsel attached unless the possibility of detention arose, and because detention was not available at an initial truancy hearing, appointed counsel was not required at the initial truancy hearing. Appellants challenged that order and the contempt order. The court affirmed holding that because the initial truancy hearing was civil in nature, and because no significant liberty interest was at stake, appellants were not entitled to appointed counsel at the initial truancy hearing. The court also held that the trial court, via statute, was entitled to order punitive contempt for failure to comply with the order of truancy.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged his first degree robbery conviction from the Superior Court of Pierce County (Washington), arguing that the evidence was insufficient to prove that he was or pretended to be armed, that the lower court erred in admitting one of his pretrial statements, and that the Persistent Offender Accountability Act, Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.94A.120(4), under which he received a life sentence without parole, was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In reviewing appellant's conviction for first degree robbery, the court found the evidence sufficient to allow a reasonable jury to find beyond a reasonable doubt that appellant obtained money by force or threat. Thus, the evidence was sufficient to support the jury's verdict. As to his pretrial statement, the court held that its admission was prejudicial, but where the lower court determined that it was relevant to show knowledge, intent, and preparation, even if its admission was an abuse of discretion, the error was harmless. In affirming appellant's sentence, the court determined that it was not disproportionate, that it was not cruel and unusual, and that appellant had failed to show a constitutional violation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found sufficient evidence to allow a jury to convict appellant of first degree robbery. The erroneous admission of appellant's pretrial statement as to prior bad acts was harmless and there was no constitutional violation in imposing a life sentence without parole under the Persistent Offender Accountability Act.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Superior Court of Jefferson County (Washington) that convicted him of first-degree escape and ordered him to pay the cost of a Spanish interpreter.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of first-degree escape. Fluent in Spanish, but not English, defendant claimed he left a prison work camp because he thought he had served his sentence. The trial court ruled that although defendant could testify to his personal understanding of the duration of his sentence, he could not relate what others had told him concerning his sentence. Defendant argued that his proposed testimony was not hearsay because it was relevant to his state of mind. The appellate court affirmed the conviction. Defendant's proposed testimony could fall within a hearsay exception if it was relevant to an issue at trial. An element of first-degree escape was that the inmate knew he was leaving confinement without permission. Defendant's testimony offered no evidence that he had permission to leave the camp. Thus, it was not relevant to a fact in issue and was inadmissible hearsay under Wash. R. Evid. 802. The appellate court, however, vacated an order requiring defendant to pay for a Spanish interpreter. The state violated notions of equal protection by requiring non-English speaking defendants to pay for an interpreter while not requiring other groups to pay for such service.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In reviewing appellant's conviction for attempting to elude a police officer under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 46.61.024, the court held that because the officer's opinion testimony as to appellant's state of mind constituted harmful error, the conviction must be reversed. Further, it held that the traffic infraction of negligent driving in the second degree was not a lesser included offense of reckless driving. The record did not indicate that the trooper was qualified to testify as an expert on the driver's state of mind, so the court found an insufficient foundation to qualify the trooper as an expert for purposes of expressing an opinion as to appellant's state of mind. Further, the trooper's opinion was not admissible lay testimony. Thus, where the trooper testified to appellant's guilt without providing an adequate factual basis, the court concluded that the admission of this evidence was error. Because the trooper's testimony addressed the critical core issue as well as appellant's credibility, the court reversed and remanded.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants were illegitimate children of decedent father. After the death of decedent's widow, appellants learned the identity of their father and filed suit to reopen decedent's estate and impose a trust on his widow's estate. The trial court ruled against appellants. On appeal, the court reversed, and held that the personal representative of decedent's estate had a duty, if she knew appellants were decedent's children, to give them notice of the probate of his estate. Also, the court ruled that former Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 11.04.080, which required that in order to inherit, illegitimate children had to have a written, signed acknowledgement of paternity by their father, was unconstitutional as a violation of equal protection. Because decedent's widow's failure to give appellants notice of probate created a jurisdictional defect in the final decree of distribution, appellants had grounds to reopen decedent's estate, and since the widow's estate contained the decedent's remaining assets, her estate was to be held in constructive trust for appellants.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the order of the trial court because the personal representative of decedent's estate had a duty to and failed to notify appellants, decedent's illegitimate children, of the probate of his estate, and therefore appellants could reopen the estate and impose a constructive trust on the widow's estate. The former statute requiring a signed statement of paternity in order for illegitimate children to inherit was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court affirmed, and held that &sect; 9.94A.120(4) was constitutional, and that the Washington Supreme Court had already rejected the same challenges defendant raised. The court stated that the statute could, under appropriate circumstances, possibly constitute cruel and unusual punishment, but that in view of the seriousness of defendant's prior convictions, for first degree robbery and robbery with a deadly weapon, the life sentence was not cruel punishment. Defendant was not denied effective assistance of counsel because he could not show that better preparation by his attorney would have revealed bases for suppressing certain letters which were admitted against him. Evidence seized from a residence where defendant had been staying temporarily as a houseguest was properly admitted because the person who rented the premises validly consented to the search. Defendant's statements to police were admissible because they were voluntary.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The issue before the appellate court was whether the initiative which required the city to obtain voter approval before it created provided off-street parking facilities exceeded the scope of the initiative power by encroaching on the functions the legislature had granted to the city council. The court held that the initiative interfered with the city council's authority under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 35.41 to create a special fund to defray the costs of a municipally owned facility. The political action committee relied on Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 35.86 which granted authority to the city in its corporate capacity to provide and finance off-street parking, primarily for persons using park or civic center facilities. The court held that the proposed initiative applied outside the limited context of Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 35.86 and conflicted with the authority granted in Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 35.41. The trial court correctly determined that the initiative exceeded its proper scope when it required voter approval before the city could pledge or use on-street meter revenues or other city funds sources for off- street parking facilities.</SPAN></P>

The trial court found that he willfully failed to pay because he continued to incur debt without paying toward his court-ordered financial obligations. Because he failed to make his bills part of the record, the court of appeals was unable to determine the nature of the debt. Nevertheless, he testified his monthly income was $ 1,400. He admitted he paid nothing toward his court costs or victim's assessment, despite having several years to pay. And he testified he owned a business and real property.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that: (1) Initiative 159, the &quot;Hard Time for Armed Crime Act,&quot; was unconstitutional because it violated the requirement that no bill shall embrace more than one subject; (2) the evidence was insufficient to convict him of assault; (3) the trial court erred by rejecting his proposed jury instruction that the intent to create a fear of injury in another may not be inferred from the mere display of the gun; (4) he was under the influence of medication and received ineffective assistance of counsel; and (5) the trial court erred by counting a prior Oregon robbery conviction in his offender score. The instant court rejected defendant's arguments, noting that the Washington Supreme Court already rejected defendant's position regarding the initiative's constitutionality. The jury could easily have found that defendant intended to create an apprehension of bodily harm in those persons within shooting range, and that two of the victims in particular had such an apprehension.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant claimed the trial court erred in: (1) admitting expert opinions; (2) instructing the jury; and (3) permitting so much prejudicial evidence as to constitute cumulative error. Defendant opened the door to the State's expert's underlying theory of acting out sexually. The trial court did not err in admitting testimony concerning delayed reporting. One particular statement could have been understood as an opinion that defendant was guilty, but the untainted evidence was so overwhelming that the jury would have reached the same verdict even without the expert's opinion. Defendant also challenged a jury instruction which stated that the defendant's finger was considered an object. It was possible to read the instruction as suggesting that the trial court was of the opinion that the defendant had used his finger to commit the offense. Nonetheless, the error was harmless. The alleged errors did not satisfy the doctrine of cumulative error.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Superior Court of Snohomish County, Washington, convicted defendant of possession of a depiction of a minor engaged in sexually explicit conduct in violation of Wash.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's daughter had found seven to nine pictures of unclothed children in various poses interested in an adult magazine which was located in her father's dresser. He explained that he had such pictures because he was writing a series of articles on the availability of child pornography on the internet, and that he had hurriedly placed the pictures in the magazine when his daughter wanted to use his computer. Defendant later destroyed the pictures. Defendant argued, inter alia, that the trial court erred in denying his constitutional right to a unanimous jury verdict. The appellate court held that the failure to elect or request a unanimity instruction was an error because the prosecutor's mischaracterization of the photographs led the jury to believe that they were presented with sufficient evidence of sexually explicit pictures. Thus, the jury could have deliberated on the basis of different images, particularly, since they did not have the pictures available to them. Even though the State may have been correct that one sexually explicit picture supported a conviction, the court could not conclude that the jury agreed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court held that, read as a whole, the record showed that the trial court barred evidence that defendant had a non-secure facility available to her. It did not bar evidence that defendant would not commit predatory acts if not confined in a secure facility. The record did not show that the trial court excluded relevant evidence, or that it refused to hear an offer of such evidence. The legislature acted constitutionally when it amended the definition of sexually violent predator. The state could not provide different procedural protections for those confined under the sex predator statute unless there was a valid reason. Equal protection required the state to comply with provisions of Wash Rev. Code &sect; 71.05 as related to the consideration of less restrictive alternatives. The legislature was not required to exercise control over persons not likely to engage in predatory acts if not confined in a secure facility and the trial court was not required to consider evidence pertaining to the proper placement of such persons. The trial court did not address a claim of cruel and unusual punishment that had not been raised below.</SPAN></P>

Tacoma, Wash., Shoreline Master Program &sect;&sect; 13.10.175(B)(14)(1), 13.10.040(D), prohibited construction of residences over water. No policy overrode this prohibition.

The court also held under Wash. Rev.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was sentenced as a persistent offender. Defendant contended there was insufficient evidence to support his conviction on one of the robbery charges because the victim recognized that the gun he displayed was a BB pellet gun, not a firearm. Defendant argued that one of the prosecutor's peremptory challenges was purposefully racially discriminatory and that his right to equal protection was violated. Defendant raised several other arguments. The court determined there was insufficient evidence to support the conviction on one of the robbery charges because the victim knew the object displayed was not a firearm. The court denied defendant's request for discovery and hearing on the denial of his Batson challenge by the trial court. The court held the trial court had not erred by counting the stayed convictions as strikes because they would have been strikes in California. The court ascertained that defendant's sentence did not violate the constitutional prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment. The court affirmed all of the convictions but one and also affirmed the sentence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of a judgment of the Superior Court of King County (Washington), which convicted him of related charges of felony harassment, felony violation of a court order, stalking, residential burglary, and misdemeanor violation of a court order.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The charges were based on a series of incidents between defendant and the victim. The court affirmed the convictions. Defendant contended that he was denied effective assistance when his trial counsel failed to object to certain evidence. The court concluded that defendant failed to establish prejudice. An ambiguous reference that defendant had been in jail did not suggest a propensity to commit the charged offense. Similarly, the fact that defendant knew some drug dealers did not constitute a crime or a prior bad act. There was no reasonable likelihood that the outcome would have been different had the challenged testimony not been admitted. The court rejected defendant's arguments that the stalking statute,&nbsp;Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9A.46.110(1), was unconstitutional. Defendant contended that his due process rights to a fair trial were violated when the deputy prosecutor improperly attempted to impeach him with prior inconsistent statements during cross-examination. The court found that the questioning fell within the normal scope of cross-examination and was not subject to the rules governing the admission of prior inconsistent statements.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sexually molested the minor daughters of his live-in girlfriend. A jury found defendant guilty of first-degree child molestation and first-degree rape of a child. The trial court sentenced him to 172 months of confinement, followed by a period of community placement. In addition to the standard community placement conditions provided in Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.94A.120(9), the court imposed several discretionary conditions. On appeal, the court affirmed defendant's convictions and sentence. The court held that the trial court properly refused to admit testimony by one daughter's ex-boyfriend concerning the daughter's reputation for truthfulness. The court stated that in light of the significant inconsistencies in the ex-boyfriend's testimony, the trial judge's decision was neither manifestly unreasonable nor lacking a tenable basis. The court also held that allowing a sex offender's community corrections officer or therapist to determine, on the basis of the offender's criminal history and sexual proclivities, whether a pornography restriction was necessary in a given case, was a reasonable, crime-related means of protecting the public from future acts of sexual violence.</SPAN></P>

Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, defendant contended the trial court erred in refusing to instruct the jury on his claim of self-defense. The court found that defendant precipitated the ensuing violent encounter, and did not, by his words or conduct, give any sign that he intended to withdraw or abandon the encounter or his aggressive conduct. Thus, there was no evidence to support defendant's request for a self-defense instruction. Defendant also challenged his conviction for felony violation of a no-contact order, arguing that he did not commit the underlying felonies. The court noted that the argument misperceived the elements of the offense. In order to convict defendant, the State was required to prove that he knowingly violated the no-contact order, and the evidence established the required elements. Defendant next contended that the stalking statute,&nbsp;Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9A.46.110(1), was unconstitutionally overbroad and vague, and violated due process requirements. Identical arguments were recently rejected by the supreme court. Defendant's final contention was the 24-month deadly enhancement to his sentence was unlawful. The supreme court had rejected identical arguments.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court held that ch. 5.14 was content-neutral and satisfied a substantial governmental interest. The proximity of table dancing was not constitutionally protected expression. The 10-foot rule was narrowly tailored. The licensing scheme of ch. 5.14 provided a reasonable and definite time limit on the county's discretion to issue a license to an erotic dance studio.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The increase in the seriousness level for theft of a firearm in Initiative 159 was valid because the crime was fairly included within the legislative title. Theft of a firearm was by definition the act of arming oneself, and the increased penalty for the crime was fairly included with the restrictive title. Defendant was not prejudiced by the trial court's refusal to dismiss all charges following a finding of prosecutorial vindictiveness. Substantial evidence supported the trial court's determination that defendant's confession was voluntary. Although there was conflicting testimony, a police officer's testimony was substantial evidence that supported the trial court's determination that the confession was voluntary. Evidence was sufficient to establish intent to deprive an officer of his weapon where the evidence showed that the defendant tried to take an officer's gun from him. The trial court erred in calculating the defendant's offender score because theft of a firearm and third degree assault constituted the same criminal conduct.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court held the district had not violated the Washington Constitution's prohibition against a municipal corporation owning assets of a private corporation, nor had it unconstitutionally deprived the shareholder of voting rights. The shareholder argued on appeal that the district's ownership of stock in the two private water companies violated Wash. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 7, and, because the district's stock holdings were illegal, it could not vote as majority shareholder to dissolve the water companies. The court held that a public irrigation district did not fall within the definition of municipal corporation for the purposes of Wash. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 7. The term &quot;municipal corporation&quot; was limited to its strict and proper meaning, and therefore excluded quasi-public corporations with limited purposes, such as irrigation districts.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pled guilty to taking a motor vehicle without permission. He was a juvenile at the time and he was ordered to pay restitution. During the pendency of the court's action the juvenile code was amended allowing extension of a juvenile court's jurisdiction, for the purpose of enforcing restitution for up to ten years. Defendant challenged the retroactive application arguing that as a punitive measure it was unconstitutional and violative of his rights to due process. The court affirmed, holding that the juvenile code was to be liberally construed in favor of restitution. Further, because the code allowed extension only for purposes of restitution, there was no violation of due process. The retroactive application did not deprive defendant of a vested right; he had been ordered to pay restitution, and thus, he was being deprived of nothing by an extension. Since the court extended its authority for restitution purposes only, the retroactive amendment did not offend due process.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's sons had behavioral problems. Defendant installed numerous locks throughout their apartment, restricting the boys' access to doors, kitchen cabinets, and the bathroom. The boys did have access to a phone and were able to exit the apartment through a window. The state charged defendant with two counts of unlawful imprisonment and two counts of assault, based on the boys' allegations. A jury convicted defendant of unlawful imprisonment. Defendant appealed and the court reversed, remanding to the trial court for a new trial. The court found that Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9A.40.010(1) was not void for vagueness as applied to him, but found that there was insufficient evidence to support the state's argument that the boys were unlawfully restrained from leaving the apartment on those occasions when they were left there alone. The court determined that the trial court abused its discretion in admitting 31 photographs of the kitchen in the apartment, because the photos were predominantly of several padlocked kitchen cabinets, the refrigerator, and the kitchen counter, and the prejudicial effect of the photographs substantially outweighed their probative value.</SPAN></P>

Appellants filed the action which alleged that the department's decision not to close treaty herring fisheries while closing the non-treaty fisheries violated Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 75.56.030.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The department did not authorize non-treaty spawn-on-kelp fisheries for a season in the interest of conservation. Appellants sought declaratory and injunctive relief, which was denied by the trial court. On appeal they claimed that the department's decision violated &sect; 75.56.030. The court affirmed the judgment below, holding that the taking of fish was not a vested or natural property right. Non-treaty fishers were entitled to their fair share of fish, but state conservation interests were paramount to their commercial interests. The department had broad police powers to manage fish resources within state borders. Unless preempted by federal law, the state, through the department, regulated fish resources with ultimate control as to whether any fish whatsoever were taken. In addition, under &sect; 75.08.012 the department was permitted to allow a fishery only if it did not impair the resource. Under the state Administrative Procedure Act, &sect; 34.05, substantial weight was given to the department's actions. Because the department action here was based on conservation-related cautions given by its technical experts, its action was not arbitrary or capricious and was, therefore, upheld.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent father filed an action against petitioner state and caseworkers, on behalf of himself and his minor child, whom he was accused of sexually abusing. The father sought damages for negligent investigation of the abuse claims, violation of 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983, fees, and costs. The Superior Court of King County (Washington) dismissed the minor's claim without prejudice and entered judgment in favor of the father. The parties appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the state argued that (1) it did not owe a duty to the father to conduct a non-negligent investigation; (2) it was error to deny its motion for summary judgment on the negligent investigation claim; and (3) it was not liable for the actions of the therapist that evaluated the minor. The father challenged the dismissal of the minor's claim. As to the father's non-negligent investigation claim, the court rejected the state's argument that there was no cause of action for negligent investigation in favor of a parent accused of child abuse. The court found that the state failed to cite any persuasive authority to establish that child protective services had no duty to the father to conduct a non-negligent investigation. As to the father's &sect; 1983 claims, the court determined that he failed to establish that the caseworkers' conduct violated a clearly established statutory or constitutional right of which a reasonable person would have known. Thus, the caseworkers were entitled to judgment on this issue, and the father was not entitled to punitive damages. Finally, the father was not entitled to attorney fees as the prevailing party in his &sect; 1983 claim.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the grant of punitive damages and attorney fees in favor of the father in his claim that the state and the caseworkers violated &sect; 1983 by negligently investigating the claim of sexual abuse against the father. The court found that there was no evidence that the caseworkers violated &sect; 1983. The court affirmed the grant of economic damages in favor of the father.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was originally arrested for obstructing a law enforcement officer when he refused to cooperate with a vehicle prowl investigation. During a search incident to arrest, officers discovered methamphetamine in defendant's pocket. Defendant claimed that the officers' handcuffing and placing him in the patrol car constituted an unconstitutional seizure, as they lacked a reasonable and articulable suspicion that he was involved in criminal activity until after they seized him. The appellate court held that the facts created a reasonable suspicion of criminal activity where the officers received a report of a possible vehicle prowl of a white car by an unidentified male and within five minutes, one officer found defendant sitting in a white car. Defendant's location in the vehicle, his suspicious and uncooperative behavior, coupled with the report of the vehicle prowl, justified the officers' investigatory stop. Defendant's refusal to put his hands up and to exit the vehicle, and giving false information, hindered and delayed the officers' investigation of a possible vehicle prowl and were sufficient to support an arrest for obstructing a law enforcement officer.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from the order of the Superior Court of King County (Washington), which convicted him of telephone harassment in violation of Bellevue, Wash., City Code &sect; 10A.84.090(A). On appeal, defendant raised the issue, for the first time, as to whether the ordinance violated the free speech provisions of the First Amendment or Wash. Const. art. I, &sect; 5, by seeking to prohibit the use of &quot;profane&quot; language.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged the facial validity of an ordinance that defined telephone harassment as making a telephone call to another with intent to disturb, embarrass, harass, intimidate, threaten, or torment such person, using any lewd, lascivious, profane, indecent, or obscene words or language, or suggesting any lewd or lascivious act; or without purpose of legitimate communication. On appeal, the court held that while content-based regulations on speech were presumptively invalid, certain categories of speech, however, could be restricted, such as the lewd and obscene, the profane, the libelous, and the insulting or &quot;fighting&quot; words, because those by their very utterance inflicted injury or tended to incite an immediate breach of the peace. The court found that that &quot;profane&quot; had both anti-religious and secular meanings and that while anti-religious speech could not be proscribed, profanity under the secular usage of &quot;vulgar or coarse&quot; language could be restricted. The court held that whenever possible it would construe an ordinance to uphold its constitutionality, so it gave the term &quot;profane&quot; its secular meaning and directed that juries should be instructed as to that meaning.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that any failure of the trial court to instruct the jury on the secular meaning of &quot;profane&quot; was harmless error.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant and another man robbed a store, taking cash and food stamps. On appeal, the court ruled that the evidence was sufficient to support defendant's conviction for second degree robbery. However, the court held that the trial court abused its discretion by admitting into evidence defendant's prior conviction for first degree escape as an unnamed felony for the purpose of impeaching defendant's credibility. The trial court erred when it substituted admission of the felony as unnamed for the required Wash. R. Evid. 609(a)(1) balancing of the probative value of admitting the evidence against the resulting prejudice to defendant. The trial court also erred by failing to excise a portion of defendant's taped statement to police, thus admitting improper character evidence without engaging in an Wash. R. Evid. 404(b) analysis. The court concluded that the cumulative effect of the two erroneous evidentiary rulings required reversal of defendant's conviction. The court applied a harmless error analysis and held that the untainted evidence was not so overwhelming as to necessarily lead to a finding of guilt of second degree robbery.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state presented evidence that defendant's attack on the victim was unprovoked, while defendant claimed self defense. The trial court gave the jury an aggressor instruction. No objection was made. Defendant was convicted of second degree assault. Under the Persistent Offender Accountability Act (POAA), the trial court imposed a sentence of life in prison without possibility of parole. On appeal, the court affirmed the conviction and sentence. First, the court held that the use of the aggressor instruction did not constitute a manifest error of constitutional magnitude or establish ineffective assistance of counsel. Defendant failed to show prejudice from the use of the instruction. Defendant either acted in self-defense or was the aggressor. The aggressor instruction could not have changed the jury's decision. Moreover, any error in instructing the jury was harmless. The jury would have reached the same result without the instruction. Next, the court held that life sentence without parole was not disproportionate to the crime and was not cruel and unusual punishment.

The court concluded that the statutes were remedial and, thus, constitutional. The court held that: (1) the prisoner's procedural due process rights were not violated because he challenged a legislative enactment and the legislative process provided all the process due; (2) his substantive due process rights were not violated because the deductions were rationally related to legitimate government interests; (3) the deductions had a remedial purpose and were not so punitive to transform them into a criminal penalty; (4) Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 72.09.111 did not violate the single subject rule of Wash. Const. art. II, &sect; 19; (5) an amendment to Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 72.09.111 did not violate the scope and object rule, Wash. Const. art. II, &sect; 38, because it only modified and added new deductions; and (6) the statutes were not special legislation in violation of Wash. Const. art. II, &sect; 28.</SPAN></P>

The passenger refused, and defendant proceeded to punch him. A bus driver ejected defendant from the bus, and defendant fled the scene without the jacket. Thereafter, defendant was convicted of first degree robbery and sentenced to life without parole under the POAA. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that sufficient evidence supported defendant's conviction because the use of force while attempting to take personal property from the passenger was sufficient to establish intent to take the jacket. Further, defendant's conduct was a substantial step towards the commission of the robbery and corroborated his intent to take the jacket. Moreover, defendant's sentence under the POAA was proper because, the people through an initiative, could rationally conclude that an attempt to commit a violent crime was serious enough to be included in the category of &quot;most serious offenses.&quot; Thus, the POAA did not violate Washington's Equal Protection Clause. Finally, defendant's sentence was not cruel and unusual because repetition of criminal conduct aggravated the guilt of the last conviction and justified a heavier penalty.</SPAN></P>

Enhancements and exceptional sentences for the marijuana convictions were imposed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Three juveniles burglarized defendant's residence and removed, in part, a safe with five kilograms of marijuana and cash. Defendant tracked down the juveniles, beat them, drove them against their will to different locations, and threatened them. On defendant's appeal from his convictions, the court affirmed. The court held that the civil forfeitures and criminal trial did not constitute double jeopardy. The evidence supported the kidnapping and attempted kidnapping charges because defendant's criminal purpose was readily inferred and he had taken substantial steps demonstrating his intent to kidnap. Defendant's consecutive sentences were proper under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.94A.400(1)(b) because the acts of kidnapping and attempted kidnapping were serious violent offenses. Defendant's single subject contentions pursuant to Wash. Const. art. II, &sect; 19 were meritless because Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.94A.310's title was not inquired into where its amendatory provisions simply revised an existing law. The trial court's imposition of exceptional sentences did not constitute cruel and unusual punishment and was warranted given the amount of drugs involved and defendant's level of sophistication.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, an owner of two adult businesses that operated panoram booths, challenged a decision of the Superior Court of Spokane County (Washington), which upheld the constitutionality of respondent city's ordinance that regulated the operation of panoram booths for the exhibition of adult motion picture films. On appeal, the owner contended that the ordinance violated the constitutional protection afforded speech by Wash. Const. art. I, &sect; 5.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city enacted a series of regulations, Spokane, Wash., Municipal Code &sect;&sect; 10.08.090(H), 10.08.100(D), &sect; 10.08.110(A), 10.08.110(C), which established line of sight, illumination, and clear glass requirements for every panoram booth that showed adult movies. The owner's constitutional challenge to the regulations failed and on its appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that the ordinance regulated speech and implicated Wash. Const. art. I, &sect; 5. However, the challenged provisions were designed to combat the undesirable secondary effects associated with the operation of the booths and thus served a compelling state interest. The challenged regulations were content-neutral and narrowly tailored time, place, and manner restrictions that satisfied the requirements of the Washington Constitution. Spokane, Wash., Municipal Code &sect; 10.08.100(D), which required that the interior of all panoram booths be visible by direct line of sight to persons in an adjacent room, was not so vague that persons of common intelligence had to guess at its meaning and would differ as to its application.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants operated adult bookstores and video arcades. They had previously challenged the constitutionality of the adult arcade licensing ordinances, and the city had adopted a new ordinance. Appellants applied for licenses under the new ordinance, but their applications were denied. An administrative hearing resulted in the denials being upheld because appellants had previously been convicted of interstate transportation of obscene material and were therefore ineligible to obtain a license. Appellants sought review, alleging that the ordinance was unconstitutional. The trial court held that the statute was constitutional, and appellants sought review. The court held that the ordinance was unconstitutional, and remanded for determination of attorneys fees to appellants. The criminal conviction disqualification provision constituted unconstitutional prior restraint because there was no showing that an applicant's past criminal convictions were directly related to his qualifications to operate an adult entertainment business. That portion of the ordinance could not be severed from the remaining act, so the ordinance in its entirety was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The defendant, who was 17 years old, told police he was 18.

The defendant argued that the trial court erred by denying his motion to dismiss because he should have been charged in juvenile court, and therefore, the adult court had no jurisdiction. The court of appeals disagreed. The case was filed in adult court only because the prosecutor believed the defendant's numerous representations that he was an adult. Before the defendant corrected that misunderstanding with proof of his true age, the State amended the information to charge a serious violent offense. Therefore the adult court properly exercised its original jurisdiction over the amended charge without requiring the State to refile or obtain a decline decision by the juvenile court.</SPAN></P>

The sole issue on appeal was the validity of the Board's reversal of appellant county's designation of forest lands of long-term commercial significance (LTCFL).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">To comply with the Growth Management Act (GMA), Wash. Rev. Code &sect;&sect; 36.70A.010-902 (1990), the county engaged in a two-year planning process ending with the adoption of Mason County, Wash., Ordinance 77-93, an Interim Resource Ordinance (IRO) designating LTCFL. On appeal, the court affirmed the superior court's judgment reversing the Board's finding that the IRO failed to comply with the GMA. The Board's order was not supported by sufficient evidence to overcome the IRO's presumption of validity or to support the Board's finding that the county improperly established a desired outcome and then developed criteria to support that outcome. The Board misinterpreted the GMA in concluding that the county could not establish a minimum parcel size when designating LTCFL and that property tax classification was an improper criterion. The Board's finding that property was unjustifiably excluded from designation was not supported by substantial evidence in light of the whole record. MCCDC failed to identify any parcel that was improperly excluded. While the superior court in part usurped the Board's role of determining GMA compliance, it properly remanded to the Board for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Superior Court of King County, Washington, convicted defendant of bribing a police officer to avoid having his arrest paperwork processed. Defendant appealed his conviction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged his conviction for bribery, alleging that he was entrapped. Unlike the normal entrapment case, the police officer was not advancing legitimate law enforcement objectives when he accepted defendant's bribe. The court of appeals held that the lower court properly declined to dismiss the prosecution for outrageous governmental behavior or for the few incidental references at trial to the police officer's religious beliefs. While the officer acted illegally in taking the bribe, the court of appeals upheld the lower court's instruction that merely affording defendant the opportunity to commit bribery would not be entrapment. This language was appropriate because it arose from the statutory definition of entrapment, which expressly applied to all crimes. However, the lower court's jury instruction went further, as it provided that &quot;a reasonable amount of persuasion to overcome reluctance does not constitute entrapment.&quot; This sentence erroneously suggested that a corrupt police officer, who illegally solicited bribes from arrestees, could use reasonable persuasion. Thus, the State failed to show that this instructional error was harmless.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants each pled guilty. They appealed from the Superior Court of King County (Washington), which imposed a $ 500 victim penalty assessment. Defendants argued that the appropriate penalty assessment was $ 100, as provided for by law at the time the offense was committed. Defendants also asserted the $ 500 penalty violated the prohibition against ex post facto laws.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants each pleaded guilty after the effective date of the amendment that imposed the higher fine. The appellate court held the statutory victim assessment penalty was imposed upon a conviction for a crime. It was the fact of conviction, not the fact of committing a particular crime, that triggered the assessment. Therefore, the legislatively mandated increase in that penalty did not implicate constitutional principles of due process or prohibitions against ex post facto laws, despite the fact that the increase occurred after the time each defendant committed their crimes, but before sentencing. The application of the higher assessment did not involve retroactive application of a statute. Further, the statute was remedial and procedural in nature, and did not affect vested or substantive rights. Thus, it could be applied retroactively in any event.</SPAN></P>

The trial court found that defendant had committed a crime while armed with a deadly weapon, and accordingly enhanced his sentence pursuant to RCW 9.94A.310(3)(a).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowners owned real property. A grantor owned neighboring land. The county allowed the grantor to divide his lot on condition that he extend his private road to the landowners' property. The grantor orally agreed and the grantor's plat map cited an easement for property to the east. But before there was final approval of the extension, the grantor sold his land to the adjacent owners. The court held that the language of the grantor's plat map, while it indicated an unmarked easement, did not unambiguously evidence intent to grant an easement. Additionally, the county's imposition of the easement on the adjacent owners was ultra vires and an unconstitutional taking. Because the county sought to exact the easement as a condition to development, there had to have been a nexus between the easement and the adjacent owner's land. But the adjacent owners' land did not create the need for the easement. The landowners' property was accessible by two easements. The adjacent owners were not estopped from challenging the county's dedication on the ground of the grantor's promise. The adjacent owners made no promises to the landowners and had no notice of the promise.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant had been convicted of assault in the second degree and was in violation of the terms of his community supervision when the department of corrections received an anonymous tip as to his whereabouts. The officers observed defendant leave an apartment and return later. At that time, the officers gained entry and placed him under arrest. On appeal, defendant argued that the trial court, in ruling on his suppression motion, applied an incorrect legal standard. The court found that the argument was not only based upon an incorrect premise, i.e., that the trial court applied an incorrect legal standard, it also was an inadequate assignment of error. Defendant next argued that the warrantless entry into the residence was not justifiable. The trial court found that the officers' belief that defendant lived at the residence was reasonable. This conclusion was supported by the anonymous tip, the officers' observations, and by their knowledge that defendant no longer lived at his previously known address. Further, there was sufficient evidence to show that defendant had constructive possession of the gun through proof of residency. The court affirmed the judgment.</SPAN></P>

There was another road which ran along the other side of adjacent property. The landowner sought approval of a plat plan. The county refused to approve the plan unless the landowner built a road which ran from the dead-end road across the front of the property up to the adjacent property. The county's plan was to eventually connect that road with the road which ran along the adjacent property. The landowner argued that the condition was a taking without just compensation. The court held that the county had to show that the condition was a valid exercise of police power by: (1) identifying a public problem the condition was meant to address; (2) showing that the proposed development would create or exacerbate the problem; (3) showing that the condition tended to solve the problem; and (4) showing that the condition was roughly proportional to the problem caused by the development. The court held that because the road would not solve the problem of lack of access to the property because the road would not connect to the existing road on the other side of the adjacent property, the condition was not a valid exercise of police power.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged the decision of the Superior Court of Snohomish County (Washington), which convicted him of first degree burglary and which denied his motion to reinstate its plea offer for defendant to accept a guilty plea on a charge of second degree burglary. Defendant asserted ineffective counsel assistance and that his sentence pursuant to the Hard Time for Armed Crime Act violated Wash. Const. art. II, &sect; 19.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The defendant alleged that his defense counsel failed to negotiate a plea to second degree burglary, which carried a standard sentence range of one to three months, compared to the 60-month sentence he received pursuant to the Hard Time for Armed Crime Act (act). The court found that, in light of all of the circumstances, the attorney's conduct in not attempting to negotiate a plea did not fall below the objective reasonableness standard. The court found that counsel took the steps necessary to provide adequate assistance, but the lack of plea bargaining was more of function of defendant's own dilatory actions than counsel's performance. In response to defendant's alleged constitutional violation based on his assertion that legislation was limited to a &quot;single subject rule&quot; pursuant to the Washington Constitution, the court noted that, by expanding the crime of first degree burglary to include entering or remaining in any building, not just a dwelling, while armed, the act did not go beyond the scope of its restrictive title. The court found defendant's sentence to be non-violative of the Washington Constitution.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the requirement burdened its constitutional right to the free exercise of religion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The church had been active at the same location for some time, but had never applied for a conditional use permit, as required in a rural estate zone under the county code. An administrative hearing resulted in an order that the church comply or it would be fined. The church brought an action against the county to challenge the determination and the trial court held that the ordinance was an unconstitutional burden on the free exercise of religion, under Wash. Const. art. I, &sect; 11, and that the $ 5,500 application fee for a permit was excessive, and the county sought review. The court held that: (1) the issue was ripe for review because the administrative order was final, the issue was purely legal, and no development of facts was required; (2) the church was required to show that the ordinance had a coercive effect on the practice of religion and had not done so; (3) if application was made and a permit granted, no abridgement would exist; and (4) the county must ensure that its application fees did not burden religious worship, approach the question with flexibility, and reduce or eliminate the fees.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment in part, in that the county zoning ordinance was not an unconstitutional infringement of the right to the free practice of religion, and affirmed the determination that required that the county adjust its application fee based upon ability of the church to pay the fee.</SPAN></P>

The jury was improperly allowed to draw the inference that defendant was aware of the court date, without an understanding of all of the facts and circumstances relevant to his subjective knowledge.

Defendant contended that POAA was invalidly enacted and was unconstitutional because it violated the doctrine of separation of powers and the guarantee of a republican form of government.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Subsequent to the trial court sentencing defendant to life imprisonment under the POAA, defendant argued that the sentence should be reversed because it was unconstitutionally imposed. The court held that POAA did not violate due process because when the trial court was only finding facts about defendant's criminal history and not about whether he was guilty of a crime, the preponderance of the evidence standard satisfied due process. Defendant contended that his 1975 guilty plea and rape conviction should not have been included as a strike against him because it was &quot;washed out&quot; under former Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.94A.360(2). The court found that under the amended Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.94A.360 the trial court should include defendant's sexual offenses because defendant had to remain crime free in order to take advantage of the &quot;wash out&quot; provisions. The court further noted that his life sentence under the POAA was not cruel and unusual punishment under the U.S. Const. amend. VIII and Wash. Const. art. 1, &sect; 14 because the offenses that defendant were convicted of were violent against the victim and his sentence was the same as any defendant convicted of three most serious felonies.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff state initiated proceedings to establish paternity and determine child support obligations for a minor, residing in Texas with his mother. The Superior Court of Pierce County (Washington) determined that defendant father was the minor's biological father. Moreover, the court awarded attorney fees to the state under the Uniform Reciprocal Enforcement of Support Act (URESA), former Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 26.21 (repealed 1994).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court determined it did have jurisdiction, and the state obtained discretionary review in the appellate court, but before the trial court received the appellate court's mandate, the father filed a motion to set child support. Between the commencement of the case and its termination, the legislature repealed URESA and enacted a new uniform code, the Uniform Interstate Family Support Act, Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 26.21. The revised act specifically allowed an award of attorney fees against an obligor, whereas the former act only referred to general costs and fees. The father argued the trial court erred by awarding attorney fees under former Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 26.21.120 for the time prior to its repeal, for awarding attorney fees for the interlocutory review and for awarding attorney fees under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 26.21.325. The court held that it was not persuaded to depart from the trial court's original holding that former Wash. Rev. Code m 26.21.020 provided a basis for its award of attorney fees to the state. Thus, the court affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's award of attorney fees to the state, excluding attorney fees pertaining to the interlocutory review. However, the court reversed that portion of the trial court's award granting interlocutory appeal fees. Moreover, the court denied that state's request for attorney fees on this appeal.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, a juvenile, pleaded guilty to several burglary counts. The Superior Court of Chelan County (Washington) ordered defendant to pay restitution and to collect restitution-extended jurisdiction to the date that defendant turned 21 years old. That same court later further extended jurisdiction over defendant for payment of restitution, thus lengthening the time to collect restitution. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In order to collect the restitution, the trial court extended juvenile jurisdiction until the date defendant would turn 21 years old. When the juvenile restitution statute,&nbsp;Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 13.40.190, was amended to permit a trial court to extend juvenile jurisdiction for up to 10 years after a juvenile reached age 18, the trial court extended jurisdiction over defendant for payment of restitution until the date defendant would turn 27. This lengthened the time to collect restitution by approximately seven years. On appeal, defendant contended that the amendment to &sect; 13.40.190 changed his punishment by inflicting a greater punishment than originally resulted from his crimes. The court affirmed. The court stated that extending juvenile jurisdiction retroactively to collect restitution did not violate the ex post facto prohibition of the Constitutions of the United States and the State of Washington because restitution was not punitive.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Several days before his scheduled release from prison, the state began a civil commitment proceeding against the prisoner under a sexually violent predator act. The state believed the prisoner met the statutory definition of a sexually violent predator under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 71.09.020(1) given his criminal history of sexual assaults against children. The prisoner challenged on jurisdictional grounds the order directing him to submit to a mental examination and the contempt order issued for refusing such examination. The court affirmed the trial court's order directing the prisoner's mental examination and the order holding him in contempt for refusing to be examined. The court ruled that the state's failure to make the proper allegations in its initial petition of the appropriateness of less restrictive alternatives to detention did not deprive the trial court of jurisdiction to issue the order for a mental examination. The error was considered harmless since less restrictive alternatives were considered at a probable cause hearing. The court found the trial court did not abuse its discretion in holding the prisoner in contempt for refusing to undergo the mental examination.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's order directing the prisoner's mental examination under the sexually violent predator act and affirmed the order holding the prisoner in contempt for his refusal to be examined. The court concluded that the trial court order could not be collaterally attacked in contempt proceedings and held the court had inherent power to hold the prisoner in contempt.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted under &sect; 9A.72.160 of making threats as defined in Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9A.04.110(25)(d), (j). Defendant asserted that Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9A.72.160 was unconstitutionally overbroad and violated the free speech protections of the First Amendment. On appeal, the court affirmed defendant's conviction and held that &sect; 9A.72.160 was not unconstitutionally overbroad. The definitions of &quot;threat&quot; in Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9A.04.110(25)(d), (j) included protected speech because they covered threats that were not &quot;true threats&quot; of bodily harm. Accordingly, the prohibited speech was entitled to some First Amendment protection. Because the speech in question was private rather than public speech, it could be regulated if the regulation was viewpoint neutral and reasonable in light of the purpose served. Relying on its recent decision analyzing the overbreadth doctrine relative to the public servant intimidation statute,&nbsp;Wash. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The oil company sought a refund of hazardous substances taxes and petroleum products taxes, contending that the trial court erred in determining that the taxes were not property taxes, and asserted that because they were property taxes, they violated the uniformity clause of Wash.

The court noted that the obligation to pay an excise tax was based upon the voluntary action of the person taxed in performing the act, enjoying the privilege or engaging in the occupation which was the subject of the excise. The court explained that the element of absolute and unavoidable demand, as in the case of a property tax, was lacking. The court determined that liability for the taxes arose from exercising control over the substances from voluntarily acquiring or producing the taxed products, not from merely possessing the substances. The court explained that once the oil company had acquired the product and paid the tax, it could have possessed the products for as long as it wished without again being taxed.

The owner picked up his truck and paid without complaint. He brought an action alleging fraud, collection of unauthorized taxes, violation of his civil rights, and collection of accounts without a license.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of an order of the Superior Court of Kitsap County (Washington), which convicted him of obstructing a law enforcement officer in violation of Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9A.76.020.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, an African-American juvenile, was at the fairgrounds when a group of persons who were allegedly gang members was being escorted out. Defendant yelled profanities and accused a law enforcement officer of racism. The law enforcement officer directed defendant to leave. Defendant refused and was subsequently arrested and convicted of obstructing a law enforcement officer in violation of &sect; 9A.76.020. Defendant appealed the conviction. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that the evidence was sufficient to support defendant's conviction because the record indicated that defendant hindered the officer's efforts to restore peace by screaming obscenities and racial accusations at him and that defendant refused to obey repeated orders to leave the fairgrounds, which resulted in raising the tension level of a situation that the officer was attempting to diffuse peacefully. The court ruled that defendant's First Amendment rights were not violated because his arrest was not based on critical speech, but on his disruptive behavior toward the officer and his multiple refusals to leave the fairgrounds.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pled guilty to assault in the second degree with sexual motivation and was sentenced as a habitual offender to life in prison without parole based on prior convictions for robbery and assault. He challenged his sentence and argued that the State was required to prove the alleged prior convictions beyond a reasonable doubt and that his prior robbery conviction was invalid. On appeal, the court affirmed and held that the State was not required to prove the constitutional validity of his prior convictions unless they were previously declared unconstitutional or were facially unconstitutional. His assertion that he was not aware of the elements of his prior offense when he pled guilty did not render the conviction invalid on its face. The State properly proved that the prior convictions existed, and defendant failed to proffer any evidence to prove they were invalid. Thus, the trial court properly sentenced him to life without parole.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant qualified for sentencing as a persistent offender under the POAA because his second degree robbery conviction was a conviction for a felony that was a &quot;most serious offense&quot; under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.94A.030(21) and he had been convicted on two other occasions of such offenses. Defendant argued that the trial court erred by refusing to allow discovery or an evidentiary hearing to show that the decision to charge him as a persistent offender was motivated by racial bias and that the POAA violated constitutional due process guarantees. The court held that the trial court did not err when it refused to allow further discovery because defendant's evidence did not show that similarly situated defendants of other races could have been, but were not, prosecuted. The POAA did not violate substantive due process. Protecting society from criminals who repeatedly committed serious violent crimes was a compelling state interest, and determining which crimes to classify as serious was an appropriate legislative function. The POAA was drafted more narrowly than the habitual criminals statute,&nbsp;Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.92.090, which had withstood a variety of constitutional challenges.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An informant was arrested after she sold cocaine to a deputy. The informant entered into a deal with police and attempted to purchase cocaine from defendant on three occasions. Each time, the task force gave her money to buy cocaine and equipped her with a hidden electronic transmitter. The informant unexpectedly refused to testify at trial and the audiotape recordings were never admitted into evidence because they were unintelligible. Defendant contended that the evidence gathered through the use of the body wire was inadmissible under Washington's Privacy Act for lack of probable cause. However, defendant did not demonstrate that the issue was a matter of manifest constitutional error reviewable for the first time on appeal. Given the testimony at trial, it was reasonable for the trial court to have found that the proffered testimony of witnesses was cumulative and irrelevant. There was no abuse of discretion in excluding a witness testimony and in limiting defendant's testimony regarding his relationship with the informant. Drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of the State, the court concluded that there was ample evidence to sustain a conviction.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, a hypnotherapist and counselor, was convicted of second degree rape for engaging in sexual intercourse with patients during treatment sessions. On appeal, his conviction was affirmed. The court held that although the prosecutor had not disclosed any intent to use a tape in its rebuttal, the trial court acted within its discretion by admitting the tape and offering to continue the case. Defendant could not have been surprised by the tape as he made it himself and knew that it was in the prosecutor's hands. Defendant's speedy trial rights were also not implicated. The court also held that defendant did not establish his affirmative defense that his patients consented to have sex knowing that it was not therapeutic. Defendant was barred by the invited error doctrine from arguing that the affirmative defense of consent in Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9A.44.050(1)(d) violated due process of law by requiring him to negate an element of the crime because he proposed the jury instruction that gave him the burden of proving the affirmative defense.

On appeal, the court affirmed the judgments of conviction and sentence. The court found that under Wash. Const. art. I, &sect; 9, proceedings under &sect; 69.50.505 were not punishment to which jeopardy attached. Defendant was sentenced to 82 months' imprisonment. The court concluded that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in imposing defendant's sentence because the sentencing range was within statutory limits and was justifiably exceptional based upon the large quantity of cocaine found in defendant's possession. The fact that defendant had substantially more cocaine in his possession than would have been necessary for personal use was a legally acceptable exceptional sentence aggravating factor.

The jury convicted him of first degree robbery, and on appeal, the court affirmed. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to admit the hearsay statement of confession because it was too vague to expose the individual to criminal liability and it did not exhibit the nine indicia of trustworthiness. The court also found no abuse of discretion by the trial court in denying defendant's requests for disclosure of an informant's identity or for an in-camera hearing on that issue because defendant was unable to show the relevance of the informant's tips. The trial court had denied defendant's motion to dismiss after the prosecutors failed to produce a police officer's field notes because defendant failed to show the materiality of those notes and failed to show that he was prejudiced by any misconduct.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The bus stop at issue was unmarked and was used by only two schoolchildren; however, the stop was designated on a map as well as in a list of school bus route stops kept by the school district. The list was available to the public. Defendant urged that he was unaware of the presence of the stop and challenged the sentence enhancement. The court found that the facts were sufficient to support the sentence enhancement for delivery of a controlled substance within 1,000 feet of a school bus route stop because there were readily understandable and ascertainable means to determine the location of the stop. Had defendant called the school district, he would have been told that the school bus stop was located at the place in question. That there was a difference in interpretation of the map by two witnesses was immaterial because whatever difficulties there were in interpreting the map could have been cleared up by telephoning the office where the map was kept. The focus of the inquiry was not the number of children served by the bus stop or what kind of bus stopped there, but that the daily pick-up of students was sufficient to put defendant on notice that the stop was there.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a confrontation between two couples at an apartment complex, an assailant put a gun to the man's temple and hit him on the side of the head. Later, the man and woman were brought outside to view two men in a show-up procedure. Defendant was identified as the assailant, and he was charged with second degree assault. After a jury trial, defendant was convicted and an enhanced sentence was imposed based upon his use of a firearm. On appeal, the court affirmed conviction and sentence. The court ruled that defendant was not denied effective assistance of counsel due to his attorney's failure to file a motion to suppress the identification. The court held that defendant failed to prove that the identification procedure resulted in a substantial likelihood of misidentification or was impermissibly suggestive. Defendant also failed to show that the identifications were unreliable. Because a motion to suppress would likely have been unsuccessful, the court ruled that defendant failed to show that he was prejudiced by his attorney's failure to bring such a motion. The court also held that Initiative 159, under which the firearm enhancement was increased, was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant developer challenged the decision of the Superior Court of King County (Washington), which held that respondent city's bonus plan ordinance used to evaluate development density was constitutional. The city filed a cross-appeal on the trial court's judgment that the development commission lacked authority or jurisdiction to revoke the developer's variance and that the variance continued to apply.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city's planning director found that the developer's revised site plan for a housing project was substantially similar to its predecessor's plan that was granted a variance and that subsequent revisions due to city review or regulation would qualify for the variance. The development commission later revoked the variance and reduced the site's bonus points that determined the development density. The developer appealed to the trial court, which held that the bonus plan ordinance was constitutional and that the development commission could not revoke the variance. The court affirmed that the variance was valid because the board of adjustment was the only entity with jurisdiction to grant or revoke a variance. The variance continued to apply because the changes in the proposed development were due to new ordinances and not the site itself. The court reversed the trial court's judgment that the bonus point award system was constitutional because: (1) the ordinance created vague and arbitrary standards for awarding higher densities; and (2) in its application, the review and awarding of bonus points was a largely subjective decision of the city and its development commission.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found that the bonus plan ordinance was unconstitutional and reversed the trial court's judgment that held that it was constitutional.

The court remanded the matter to the city council and ordered that further proceedings in the trial court awaited the final outcome of the approval process.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant had previously been convicted of several brutal assaults and rapes. He contended on appeal that prosecutorial misconduct required reversal, that his commitment constituted double jeopardy and violated substantive due process and ex post facto laws, and that the trial court erred by instructing the jury to consider the &quot;feasibility&quot; of treatments less restrictive than secure confinement. The court affirmed the judgment. The court noted that the impropriety in the prosecutor's arguments could readily have been corrected by objections and curative instructions, and determined that while the argument was improper, the court discerned no improper purpose and no likelihood that the jury's verdict reflected a desire to punish defendant rather than protect the public under the Community Protection Act. The court determined that the alleged futility of defendant's treatment was irrelevant to the question of punitive intent and did not amount to a double jeopardy or ex post facto violation. The court found that the invited error doctrine precluded review of the issue on the jury instruction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state appealed the decision of Superior Court of Thurston County (Washington), which instructed the jury on defendant's affirmative defense that his possession and possession with intent to deliver marijuana were based upon religious free exercise under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act and that the state had to prove the absence of defendant's unwitting possession of cocaine beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state charged defendant with two counts of unlawful possession of a controlled substance, marijuana and cocaine, and one count of unlawful possession with intent to deliver. Defendant asserted two affirmative defenses: that he possessed marijuana for religious purposes under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act and that he was in unwitting possession of the cocaine. The court instructed the jury on both defenses and gave an instruction that the state had to prove the absence of the unwitting possession defense beyond a reasonable doubt. After an emergency interlocutory appeal, the court reversed, holding that Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 69.50.401, which criminalized possession and distribution of marijuana even if for religious purposes, did not violate Wash. Const. art. I, &sect; 11 because the state had a compelling interest in regulating marijuana, a dangerous drug. There were no less restrictive means for protecting the safety of citizens and an exception for specific religions would encourage enlistment in those religions for the wrong reasons. Defendant, not the state, bore the burden to prove the affirmative defense of unwitting possession by a preponderance of the evidence.</SPAN></P>

He sought a new trial after two separate convictions for first degree robbery and a sentence of life without parole under Wash. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of three counts of first degree robbery in two separate jury trials presided over by different judges. He was sentenced for each conviction to life in prison without possibility of parole as a persistent offender, as he had two prior violent offenses. After he was arrested on suspicion of robbery, officers obtained consent to search an apartment where he was staying. One of the renters signed a consent card. Defendant's motion to suppress evidence obtained in that search was denied. He also unsuccessfully argued that the confrontation clause prohibited the consent card being introduced as evidence and that he should have been allowed to implicate a third party in the crimes. He appealed these issues and his sentencing as a persistent offender. The court noted that all of his challenges had been resolved previously by the state supreme court. The appellate court had no choice but to follow precedent. It found no error or abuse of discretion. The jury instructions were not vague or constitutionally deficient. The evidence supported the convictions in both cases. The judgments were affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from the Superior Court of Chelan County (Washington) juvenile court conviction of complicity to commit first degree murder, first degree burglary, attempted burglary, and theft of firearms, and a manifest injustice sentence, challenging admission of his confession, sufficiency of the evidence, and the exceptional sentence, and arguing that the theft of firearms and firearm enhancement statutes were unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The 12-year-old defendant was convicted of the death of a man shot at least 18 times with guns stolen from a friend's home. The body and the boys were found on a riverbank after shots were heard, and the boys were read their rights and arrested. The defendant confessed when his mother told him to tell. The trial court imposed a sentence of 542 weeks, citing protection of the community and rehabilitation as compelling reasons to incarcerate him until age 21, and holding that a standard range sentence, which would have been 180 to 224 weeks, would effect a manifest injustice. The court noted that these factors supported a manifest injustice disposition and substantial evidence supported them. But absent facts documenting a need to confine him for a set duration to attend a specific treatment program, the assumption that he might be released early was too speculative to support the length of his sentence. It also found that independent circumstantial evidence supported a reasonable inference that he was involved in the murder and sufficiently established the corpus delicti to justify admitting his confession. The judgment was affirmed. The case was remanded for resentencing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of conviction was affirmed but the case was remanded for resentencing, specifically for recalculation of the sentence without regard to possible good time, which was too speculative. Defendant's argument that the firearm enhancements and theft of firearms charges must be dismissed because the omnibus violence prevention act was unconstitutional was without merit, as was his challenge to his confession.</SPAN></P>

The court held that absent any of the issues raised by appellant, there existed overwhelming evidence on the record that appellant shot the victim in the heart at close range and then stabbed the victim in the heart three times.

Defendant appealed his conviction, and the state cross-appealed, contending that the trial court erred by finding that the burglary and assaults were the same criminal conduct and by imposing a sentence for the burglary only.

The trial court did not abuse its discretion by refusing to punish each crime separately under the burglary antimerger statute.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, citing the Sentencing Reform Act of 1981, Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.94A.120(6), the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 12101 et seq., and U.S. Const. amend. XIV, appealed a decision of the Superior Court of Snohomish County (Washington), which denied his request for the Drug Offender Sentencing Alternative (DOSA) and imposed a standard range sentence for possession of a controlled substance with intent to deliver.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that denial of the DOSA on the basis of his alleged disability violated the ADA and the Fourteenth Amendment. The court affirmed the decision. The court was not inclined to rule that the ADA applied in a sentencing context, but assuming that it did apply, the court stated that the relevant inquiry was whether defendant had established that he was a &quot;qualified individual with a disability.&quot; The court determined that defendant had not proved his prima facie case. The court held that defendant's perceived impairment argument failed because he had not established that he was substantially limited in a major life activity. The court held that the record did not establish a prima facie case of disability discrimination under the ADA. The court held that denial of the DOSA in defendant's case withstood a substantive due process challenge because there was a rational basis for the sentencing court's decision. The court held that the goal of making frugal use of access to the DOSA treatment, through maximizing the effectiveness of the DOSA treatment program, comprised at least a substantial state interest, and that defendant's equal protection argument therefore failed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's imposition on defendant of a standard range sentence for possession of a controlled substance with intent to deliver.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Superior Court, King County (Washington) convicted defendant of unlawful possession of a firearm and possession of stolen property. On the last day of the trial, defendant failed to appear in court. Finding he was voluntarily absent, the court denied defendant's motion for a mistrial and allowed the trial to finish without him. Defendant appealed his convictions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, defendant contended that the trial court abused its discretion in electing to proceed with the trial in his absence. Defendant urged that the trial court, in deciding whether to proceed, should have applied the &quot;complex of issues&quot; test rather than the &quot;voluntary waiver&quot; test on the ground that the Washington Constitution provided greater protection for confrontation rights than did the Federal Constitution. The court affirmed. The court stated that although given the opportunity on several occasions to interpret the State confrontation guarantee more expansively than its Federal counterpart, no State of Washington court had done so. The court further found that the Hard Time for Armed Crime Act (Act), which increased the seriousness level and sentence for defendant's firearms conviction, was not unconstitutional. The court stated that penalty enhancement provisions in the Act were within the title of the Act, were constitutional, and were severable from allegedly unconstitutional provisions. The court further stated that the provision increasing the seriousness level of defendant's offense plainly fell within the subject of the title of the Act.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

The court stated that because evidence about the nature of MRT was not properly before it because it was not presented to the trial court and defendant failed to supplement the record on appeal, it could not say that the trial court exceeded its authority in imposing the MRT condition. The court accepted the State's concession that the trial court erred in requiring defendant to &quot;obey all laws&quot; while on community placement. The court further stated that the trial court's restitution order must be vacated and the matter remanded for a new hearing because neither defendant nor her counsel were present at the restitution hearing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant alleged five bases for reversal in his appeal from his convictions.

Const. art. II, &sect; 19, (3) a juvenile adjudication constituted a conviction for purposes of the 1995 unlawful possession statute, (4) defendant failed to show ineffective assistance of counsel, and (5) defendant's pre-Miranda statement was not the product of custodial interrogation. The court noted a clerical error in defendant's judgment and sentence. Instead of stating that he was convicted of possessing a stolen firearm under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9A.56.310, the record erroneously stated that defendant was convicted of second degree possession of stolen property under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9A.56.160.

The trial judge had permitted a police officer to testify that his decision not to fingerprint the gun found in the car defendant was driving was based on unspecified information he received from defendant at the scene.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial judge had previously suppressed statements defendant had made to the officer, before having been read his Miranda rights, that the gun was not his and that he was just delivering it for a friend. However, the judge determined that defendant had &quot;opened the door&quot; by inquiring about whether the gun had been fingerprinted. After the testimony, the judge immediately gave a limiting instruction on its use. During deliberations, the jury sent a note asking about the instruction and the officer's testimony. The judge decided not to reinstruct the jury. On appeal, the court held that it was not error to permit the officer to testify, because his testimony did not substantially describe defendant's suppressed statements, defendant had &quot;opened the door,&quot; and the limiting instruction had been sufficient. The court held that a reinstruction had not been required because the jury's note had not signaled any erroneous understanding or misapplication of the law. The court also held that the penalty enhancement provisions of the Hard Time for Armed Crime Act, 1995 Wash. Laws, ch. 129, Initiative 159, were not unconstitutional because they plainly fell within the subject of the Act.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff was convicted of violating a city ordinance that prohibited the playing of car sound systems at a volume that would be audible at a distance greater than 50 feet. After the conviction against him was dismissed with prejudice, plaintiff brought this action challenging the constitutionality of the ordinance. The lower court dismissed the case as frivolous and awarded attorney's fees to the city. Plaintiff appealed and the court affirmed the dismissal but reversed the award of attorney's fees. Plaintiff's first amendment free speech claims failed because he admitted that he was not attempting to communicate a message, he was merely listening. This was pure conduct, not speech so the first amendment claim failed. The vagueness claim failed because the standard applied by the ordinance, audibility, was not subjective, and the ordinance supplied clear guidelines, audibility at 50 feet, which were understandable by people of ordinary intelligence.</SPAN></P>
