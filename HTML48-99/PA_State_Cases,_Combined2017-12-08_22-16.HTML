Appellee filed a motion for summary judgment. The lower court granted the motion. The court affirmed the summary judgment.

The court held that the distraint provisions of the Landlord and Tenant Act, 68 Pa. Cons. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from the judgment of sentence in the Court of Common Pleas of Fayette County (Pennsylvania), which convicted him of corrupting the morals of a minor, indecent assault, involuntary deviate sexual intercourse, and indecent exposure, and imposed a prison term under the provisions of 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9718. Defendant was also ordered to pay prosecution costs, a fine, and a sum to the Crime Victims Compensation fund.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was fined, ordered to pay prosecution costs, and sentenced under the Pennsylvania Mandatory Sentencing Statute. Defendant's motions for certified appeal, in arrest of judgment, for a new trial, to suppress his statements, and to declare the reporting provision of the Child Protective Services Act (Act), 11 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 2201 et seq., unconstitutional were denied. On appeal, the court affirmed. The statements to the caseworker and the police were constitutional because they were made without compulsion. The court held that the Act was constitutional and that there is no privacy right for criminal acts in the home and, thus, no Miranda warning was needed to speak to the caseworker. The court found the mandatory sentencing statute was not unconstitutional as cruel and unusual punishment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The commonwealth appealed a judgment of sentence of the Court of Common Pleas, Criminal Division, of Bucks County (Pennsylvania), which denied its motion to modify and/or resentence. The commonwealth averred that the trial court erred in not considering prior driving under the influence convictions in computing defendant's sentence under the statutorily mandated minimums of 75 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 3731.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of driving under the influence (DUI), in violation of 75 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect;3731(a)(1). In determining sentence, the commonwealth offered to the sentencing judge a total of four DUI convictions, two of which occurred prior to the effective date of the new recidivist provisions of 75 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 3731(e). On appeal, the court reversed and remanded for proper sentencing, finding that the sentencing court was required to consider convictions that occurred before the new law went into effect in imposing sentence on a subsequent conviction. The court had previously held &sect; 3731(e) to be constitutional because it did not transform a previously legal act into an unlawful one, it did not violate the constitutional provisions proscribing ex post facto laws, and did not permit the sentence attending the previous conviction to be increased. It merely notified an offender of what punishment would attend convictions based upon post-amendment violations. The court therefore held that commonwealth was entitled to pursue an enhancement of the sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The denial of the commonwealth's motion to modify and/or resentence was reversed and the conviction remanded for resentencing, because defendant's driving under the influence convictions, which occurred before enactment of statutory provisions for enhanced sentencing, should have been considered where the recidivist provisions were previously held constitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review after the Court of Common Pleas of Mercer County (Pennsylvania) used an uncounseled summary offense to enhance a subsequent summary offense to a misdemeanor, under 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 106(c)(2), 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 3929(b)(1)(ii), Pa. R. Crim. P. 316(a)(c)(i).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1980, appellant pled guilty to retail theft, a summary violation, for which appellant was fined $ 100 and assessed $ 26 costs, pursuant to 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 106(c)(2). Appellant was not represented. In 1985, appellant again pled guilty to retail theft. The trial court considered the prior conviction and enhanced the grading of the current offense from a summary violation to a second-degree misdemeanor, pursuant to 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 3929(b)(1)(ii). After the trial court denied his motion to modify the sentence, appellant sought review. The court affirmed. The court held that there was no right to counsel for all summary convictions, under Pa. R. Crim. P. 316(a)(c)(i). The court held that appellant had no right to counsel for his first summary conviction because appellant was not imprisoned. The court held that the trial court properly used appellant's first summary conviction to enhance his second summary conviction because appellant's subsequent offense did not create a right to counsel, where none otherwise existed, for the summary offense of retail theft.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's use of appellant's uncounseled summary offense conviction to enhance his subsequent offense to a misdemeanor. The court held that appellant had no right to counsel for his first summary offense because appellant was not imprisoned. The court held that the validity of appellant's first conviction was not impugned when the trial court used that conviction to enhance a subsequent conviction to a misdemeanor.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment holding that appellant failed to establish ineffective assistance of counsel because he did not disclose what evidence counsel failed to discover and how it would have aided his cause and the claims counsel failed to pursue were meritless. The court also held that the trial court properly permitted admission of appellant's prior conviction because he held a Bighum hearing. The court further held that appellant had no substantive right in the less aggressive prosecutorial effort which is commonly afforded criminal defendants not prosecuted under career criminal programs and that his claims of denial of equal protection and due process were without factual or legal support. Lastly, the court held that the trial court properly restricted the cross-examination of police witnesses because the questions were directed to matters which were not related to the incident at issue or the parties involved.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant defense attorneys challenged a judgment of the Court of Common Pleas of Potter County (Pennsylvania), which sentenced them to prison following their convictions of hindering prosecution, tampering, criminal solicitation, and criminal conspiracy.

Stat. &sect; 4910, and hindering prosecution, 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 5101, were unconstitutionally overbroad when applied to appellants representing criminal defendants. The court also held that physical evidence of crime in the possession of a criminal defense attorney was not subject to a privilege but had to be delivered to the prosecution. Additionally, the court held that the state's seizure of evidence in the possession of the attorney did not violate the defendant's rights, and it was an abuse of a lawyer's professional responsibility knowingly to take possession of and secrete the instrumentalities of a crime.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee designer-installer constructed an elevator shaft in appellant consumer's home. Appellant filed a personal injury action nearly 30 years after the construction was completed. The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of appellee finding that the cause of action was barred under Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 42, &sect; 5536, which provided for a 12-year statute of repose. Upon review, the court affirmed. The court rejected appellant's argument that appellee was not entitled to the protection of the repose statute because appellee performed periodic repair work. The court reasoned that appellee never had actual possession or control of the elevator as owner, tenant or otherwise where appellee only performed maintenance and repair work when summoned by appellant's family. The court found that appellee, as designer, manufacturer, and installer of the elevator unquestionably fell under the scope of the repose statute and appellant's claim was time-barred. The court held the date of delivery of the improvement fixed the date actuating the repose statute and the periodic maintenance did not revitalize the limitations period.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed an order that granted summary judgment in favor of appellee designer-installer in a personal injury action filed by appellant consumer. The court held that appellee was protected by a repose statute of limitations where appellee did not have a duty to maintain an elevator and did not exercise control or ownership of the elevator.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of five violations of 35 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect; 1272, regarding the illegal sale of fireworks. Appellant challenged the trial court's judgment and the court affirmed the judgment and determined that there was no merit to appellant's 10 points of error. The court held that it would not reach appellant's first six points of error because they were not properly preserved for review. The court also held that points of error alleging an improper charge to the jury were baseless because both of the charges claimed to have been omitted were included in the charge. The court rejected the argument that the trial court did not have jurisdiction because the facts clearly showed appellant delivered illegal fireworks in the county in which he was charged. The court stated that absent a knowing and intelligent waiver, a person could not be imprisoned for any offense, whether classified as petty, misdemeanor, or felony, unless he or she was represented by counsel. The court held that appellant's waiver of his right to counsel subsequent to the explanation of rights and possible consequences of self representation by trial judge was a knowing and intelligent waiver of such right.</SPAN></P>

Defendant's petition for allowance of appeal was granted, and the supreme court again affirmed the judgment of sentence. Defendant instituted habeas corpus proceedings in the federal district court, which denied defendant relief. On appeal, the court directed that the appeal should have been considered timely filed. The court granted defendant's petition for reconsideration. The court had no difficulty in concluding with substantial assurance that malice was more likely than not to flow from the proof of an unlawful killing without justification or excuse, where the act of slaying was voluntary.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed and remanded for re-sentencing the decision of the trial court. Appellee was convicted for driving while under the influence of alcohol and assessed a punishment to serve two days in jail, pay a $ 300 fine, undergo evaluation by an alcohol program, and attend a safe driving school. The trial court refused to apply a recidivist statute,&nbsp;75 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. &sect; 3731(e)(1)(ii), requiring a mandatory 30 day sentence for a second offense. The trial court reasoned that it would be violative of the constitutional provisions proscribing ex post facto laws as the previous conviction occurred before the 30 day sentence requirement was in effect. On appeal, the court held that an application of the recidivist statute was constitutional as the statute's mandatory sentence did not transform a legal act into an unlawful one.

Defendant gained entrance to the victim's home by posing as a police officer, and sexually assaulted the complainant.

On appeal, the court affirmed, and found no evidence that this testimony confused, misled, or prejudiced the jury. The court held that the testimony did not invade the province of the jury by impermissibly bolstering the complainant's credibility. Expert testimony provided by psychologists, who held doctoral rather than medical degrees, was admissible as to rape trauma syndrome, and was admissible to prove lack of consent or to corroborate testimony that a rape occurred. The court found that the lower court's desire to avoid a judge-shopping ploy was an adequate reason for denying defendant's request for a non-jury trial.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The action was commenced by a class action complaint in equity filed by appellant debtors on behalf of themselves and all others similarly situated. The complaint was filed against appellee creditor, collection agency, and sheriff which had exposed the appellants' real property to a sheriff's sale.

Appellants sought review and the court reversed that dismissal and remanded the case for a class action determination. The lower court granted appellants motion in part, holding that the notice requirements of the rules of civil procedure for sheriff's sales of real property did not comport with due process. The parties filed an appeal and a cross appeal. The court found that the appeal was properly before the court. The court held that the lower court did not abuse its discretion in failing to afford the requested equitable relief. The court found that there was no &quot;taking&quot; at the sheriff's sale in the constitutional sense because there had not been any appropriation for government use.</SPAN></P>

Appellant was sentenced to 5 to 10 years imprisonment, and his motion for reconsideration of his sentence was denied by the lower court. The court affirmed the decision of the lower court that imposed a 5 to 10 year sentence because 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 9727 was clear that when appellant pleaded guilty but mentally ill he could have received any sentence that could have lawfully been imposed on anyone convicted of the same offense. The court held that because an individual who was convicted of robbery and who was found to have visibility possessed a handgun, could have only been lawfully sentenced to an imprisonment of not less than five years, the same sentence applied to appellant.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of his judgment and sentence from the Court of Common Pleas of Bucks County (Pennsylvania) where he was convicted by a jury for statutory rape, in violation of 18 Pa. Con. Stat. Ann. &sect; 3122, indecent assault, Pa. Con. Stat. Ann. &sect; 3126, indecent exposure, Pa. Con. Stat. Ann. &sect; 3127, and corruption of minors, Pa. Con. Stat. Ann. &sect; 6301.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was tried for the crimes of statutory rape, in violation of 18 Pa. Con. Stat. Ann. &sect; 3122, indecent assault, in violation of Pa. Con. Stat. Ann. &sect; 3126, indecent exposure, in violation of Pa. Con. Stat. Ann. &sect; 3127, and corruption of minors, in violation of Pa. Con. Stat. Ann. &sect; 6301. Appellant challenged the jury verdict convicting him of these crimes by asserting that the trial court had erred in granting sexual assault counselors absolute privileges, in denying expert testimony from a defense witness, ineffective assistance of counsel, and application of the sentencing guidelines. The court affirmed most of the lower court's actions, and held that, in determining the ineffective assistance of counsel claim, the court would not second guess the trial strategies of appellant's trial counsel. The court did find, however, that the lower court erroneously used a misdemeanor conviction, one without the involvement of a deadly weapon, in its determination of sentence for appellant. As this was error, the court vacated the sentence and remanded for resentencing, but did affirm the underlying convictions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court vacated the judgment of sentence from the trial court, concluding that the lower court had improperly enhanced the sentence given to appellant because a misdemeanor conviction which did not involve the use of a deadly weapon, was improperly used in the sentencing calculations. The matter was remanded for resentencing, but all other points of error of appellant were overruled.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant mother filed a child support action against appellee father. The action was transferred by a Revised Uniform Reciprocal Support Act Petition, pursuant to 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 6741 et seq., to Maryland where appellee was living. A Maryland court granted appellee's motion for summary judgment based on Maryland's two- year statute of limitations in paternity actions. Subsequently, appellee moved back to Pennsylvania and appellant instituted another support action against appellee. The court reversed the order of the Pennsylvania lower court that found the child support decision of the Maryland court should be given res judicata effect, and held in favor of appellant mother because there was no final determination of paternity, and therefore, the doctrine of res judicata could not be invoked when a final judgment had not been rendered on the merits. The court held that a paternity action filed within six years of a child's birth was not barred by a dismissal based on the two year statute of limitations in effect when the paternity action was originally filed. The case was remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

Ann. &sect; 3731, defendant asserted four points of error. The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court, holding as to defendant's first claim of error, that the trial court did not err in allowing the commonwealth to amend its information to include defendant's prior conviction because the imposition of a recidivist penalty did not even require that the amendment to the information be made. As to defendant's contention that the failure of the police to preserve defendant's blood-alcohol test results made retesting for exculpatory purposes impossible, the court held that the Pennsylvania constitution afforded defendant no greater protection than the federal constitution under which defendant's argument had been rejected as a basis for suppression of evidence. On defendant's third point of error, the court held that the jury verdict was clearly supported by evidence either of the intoxilyzer result or the testimony of defendant's physical condition or both.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of driving under the influence of alcohol and sought review. On appeal, defendant contended that he was denied effective assistance of counsel for failing to preserve certain issues for appeal. The court affirmed and found that defendant could not show that the issues not preserved where of arguable merit. The court found that sufficient evidence was presented to support the conviction for driving under the influence of alcohol where defendant had an odor of alcohol, had difficulty walking, had alcohol containers in his vehicle, and had difficulty performing sobriety tests. The court also held that defendant's claim that his preliminary hearing was defective was without merit because a prima facie case was established against defendant based on the vehicle stop without introducing the test results. The court found that 75 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 3731 was not unconstitutional because the discretion of the district attorney does not violate due process of law. Finally, the court found that the mandatory sentencing provision of &sect; 3731 did not violate separation of powers because the charges could have been dismissed.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the only connection between appellee's activity as a trade association and the commonwealth was the manufacturer's shipment of a lawn mower bearing appellee's label into Pennsylvania, and that this unilateral action by the manufacturer was insufficient to support jurisdiction over the trade association in Pennsylvania.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged the judgment of sentence of the Court of Common Pleas, Criminal Division, of Philadelphia County (Pennsylvania), which increased his original sentence imposed on his conviction for third degree murder while in visible possession of a firearm. Appellant contended that the resentencing violated his double jeopardy rights, that 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 9712 was unconstitutional, and that the evidence was insufficient.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the trial court increased appellant's original sentence, he challenged the decision. The court affirmed. First, even though appellant had begun to serve his original sentence, the increased sentence did not impinge on his right to be protected from double jeopardy because appellant had not fully satisfied his sentence. Further, the Double Jeopardy Clause did not provide appellant with the right to perceive the length of his sentence as finally determined because pursuant to 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 9712(d), the legislature specifically provided that the Commonwealth could appeal the sentence. Second, the court rejected appellant's contention that &sect; 9712 was unconstitutional for altering the burden of proof and impermissibly delegating power to the executive, because the supreme court had recently upheld the constitutionality of &sect; 9712, specifically rejecting those same issues. And finally, appellant's visible possession of a firearm was manifested in the process of the crime: by smoke, the sound of gunfire and a gunshot wound, even though the Commonwealth's witness never actually saw the gun.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of sentence, which increased appellant's original sentence. The court held that because appellant had not satisfied his original sentence, his rights to double jeopardy were not violated, that the Mandatory Minimum Sentencing Act did not unconstitutionally alter the burden of proof or delegate power to the executive, and that appellant's possession was manifest by the process of the crime.</SPAN></P>

He claimed the statute did not provide a standard of proof by which the sentencing court could determine that defendant possessed a deadly weapon during the commission of the offense, that the state did not prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he possessed a deadly weapon, and that there was a violation of due process because the definitions of the elements of possession and deadly weapon were too vague. The court rejected those arguments and affirmed the trial court's judgment. The evidence, although circumstantial, established beyond a reasonable doubt that appellant used a device or instrumentality likely to produce serious bodily injury. Based on analysis of the statutes in issue, the court concluded they were constitutional, and there was no denial of due process.</SPAN></P>

Appellant argued that the drunk driving statute was unconstitutional. The court disagreed. Appellant also argued that her due process rights were violated because the commonwealth's failed to include in the criminal information notice of its intention to invoke the sentence enhancement provisions applicable to habitual violators of the drunk driving law. The court found that that information concerning prior drunk driving convictions must be excluded from the charge sheet because of the potentially prejudicial effect of such data upon the fact finder. However, because a guilty plea was involved, the court required that notification of intent to prosecute appellant as a recidivist must be provided to the accused prior to her entering the plea. The court found that appellant was provided such notice orally and that appellant made no objection or challenge to the validity of the conviction at that time.

The court affirmed. finding that the jury charge on statements made by buyers concerning their intended use of items purchased from appellant's store was proper; the statements were an aid in determining whether the products had a commonly recognized drug related function. The court found that the circumstantial evidence supporting appellant's conviction was sufficient. The search warrant was supported by an affidavit of an experienced narcotics agent who entered appellant's store and purchased a mask that was displayed with other items commonly used to aid in the ingestion of illegal drugs. The affidavit provided the magistrate with a rational, common sense basis for finding probable cause. The court found appellant's argument that he was prejudiced by the trial court, cutting short a line of questioning, was wholly without merit. Appellant was able to state to the jury, before questioning was cut short, that several officers had been in his store on prior occasions and had not mentioned the illegal nature of appellant's activity.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed finding that the jury charge was proper, the circumstantial evidence was sufficient to support appellant's conviction, and the affidavit submitted in support of the search warrant provided the magistrate with sufficient facts to find probable cause. Appellant's claim that he was prejudiced by the trial court cutting off a line of questioning was meritless.</SPAN></P>

Because the prosecution was appellant's first contact with the criminal justice system, and he was offered no opportunity to benefit from penal discipline, the court held that appellant was not a habitual offender and that the trial court erred in enhancing the sentence for three of the offenses. The court held that the government was legally a &quot;victim&quot; entitled to restitution, but that the trial court erred in ordering restitution because the record did not reflect appellant's ability to make restitution. Because the court reversed and remanded for sentencing, the court did not address appellant's allegation that the court erred in refusing to permit a withdrawal of his guilty plea or that the sentence was excessive.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of the judgment of sentence of the Court of Common Pleas of Montgomery County (Pennsylvania), which convicted him upon a plea of guilty of robbery, recklessly endangering another person, terroristic threats, possessing an instrument of crime and related charges in a case where defendant claimed the mandatory minimum sentencing provisions of 42 Pa.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of robbery, recklessly endangering another person, terroristic threats, possessing an instrument of crime, and related charges; he was sentenced under the mandatory minimum sentencing provisions of 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9712 (Act). Defendant sought review on the grounds that the Act was unconstitutional. On appeal the court rejected each claim of unconstitutionality and affirmed the conviction and sentence. The court held that the Pennsylvania Supreme Court had ruled that the Act did not alter the degree of guilt for the applicable crimes, that the required pre-trial notice of the crime for which a defendant was being prosecuted did not mandate notice that the Act would be applicable to a defendant at sentencing, and that the preponderance of the evidence standard used in a proceeding under the Act satisfied the requirements of due process. The court held the Act did not violate the separation of powers by conferring unlimited discretion upon the prosecutor because application of the Act was mandatory, not discretionary. The court also held the evidence presented by defendant established that his pistol was a firearm within the meaning of the Act.</SPAN></P>

The court held the prosecutor had reasonable latitude in arguing its case and permissibly argued that the evidence established defendant's guilt. The court rejected defendant's claims that the Act was unconstitutional. The court held the provisions of the Act concerning sentencing did not violate the doctrine of separation of powers of Pa.

The court held that defendant failed to overcome the presumption of a statute's constitutionality because he did not establish that the burden of proof in sentencing was procedural and thus beyond the legislature's authority; there was authority characterizing this burden of proof as substantive. The court also held that defendant did not have standing to raise the issue that the Act was unconstitutional because it did not require notice prior to trial that it would be invoked because defendant received such notice prior to trial.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant inmate was accused of assaulting prison guards during an altercation. The preliminary hearing was held at the prison, rather than at the courthouse because of &quot;security problems&quot; related to the transportation of appellant. Appellant was convicted of aggravated assault and simple assault. Appellant sought review and asserted alleged hearsay, error in the admission of his religion and a prejudicial newspaper article, and that he had a right to a public trial under the Pennsylvania and Federal Constitutions and that this right attached during a preliminary hearing. On review, the court examined both the state and federal constitutions, paying specific attention to the right of an accused to have a public trial. The court noted that the lower court gave a cryptic explanation at the preliminary hearing regarding the decision to deny appellant a &quot;public forum.&quot; The court concluded that there was presumed harm from an improperly closed preliminary hearing. However, in this case, the harm was cured during the public trial. The court therefore found that a remedy was not required, though appellant's constitutional rights were violated.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant's conversations with an informant were recorded pursuant to the Wiretapping and Electronic Surveillance Control Act, 18 Pa.

Appellant was convicted of possession of a controlled substance and possession with intent to deliver. The court affirmed. The wiretapping statute did not violate U.S. Const. amend. I or Pa.

The statute did not have a chilling effect on free speech because it simply provided a means for law enforcement officials to preserve already admissible evidence of criminal activity for use in subsequent prosecutions. The informant could have testified about the conversations in the absence of the recordings. That the statute might lead criminals to engage in self-censorship did not render the statute unconstitutional. The statute also did not violate U.S. Const. amend. IV or Pa. Const. art. I, &sect; 8.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, convicted of robbery, sought review of the judgment of the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County (Pennsylvania), which sentenced him to a term of imprisonment for not less than five years nor more than 10 years pursuant to 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 9712. Appellant argued that &sect; 9712 was unconstitutional because, among other things, it allegedly violated double jeopardy principles.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of robbery. The court below sentenced appellant to a term of imprisonment for not less than five years nor more than 10 years pursuant to 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 9712. Appellant argued on appeal that &sect; 9712, which provided that any person convicted of certain enumerated offenses shall be sentenced to a minimum term of imprisonment of five years if he or she visibly possessed a firearm during the commission of the offense, was unconstitutional. The judgment of sentence was affirmed on appeal. First, the court rejected appellant's contention that &sect; 9712 violated double jeopardy principles because &sect; 9712 did not create a separate crime; it merely provided a minimum sentence to be imposed after appellant had been convicted. Moreover, contrary to appellant's contention, &sect; 9712 in no way prevented a defendant from exercising his Pa. R. Crim. P. 1405(a) allocution rights. Finally, &sect; 9712 was not invalid because it established only a mandatory minimum sentence because, when read together with Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 1103, both minimum and maximum sentences for robbery committed with a firearm had been established.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the court below, which sentenced him to a term of imprisonment for not less than five years nor more than 10 years pursuant to a Pennsylvania law which mandated minimum sentences for certain enumerated offenses committed with a visible firearm, was affirmed. The sentencing statute did not violate double jeopardy principles, as contended by appellant, because it did not create a separate crime.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged an order of the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County (Pennsylvania) Criminal Division, which dismissed his petition for relief under the Post Conviction Hearing Act (PCHA). Appellant contended error in dismissal of his petition under the doctrines of waiver and laches, unconstitutional limitation to his right to redress by habeas corpus, and ineffective trial counsel.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of first degree murder and aggravated murder initially. Those convictions were reversed and appellant's case was retried where a jury found him guilty of the same crimes. Appellant sought review of the lower court judgment on appeal. Appellant continued to challenge the lower court order and after all other relief was exhausted. Appellant filed a petition for relief under the Post Conviction Hearing Act (PCHA), 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect;&sect; 9541-51, which was denied then sought review of the denial. Appellant contended that the lower court erred in dismissing his petition under the doctrines of waiver and laches, that use of a waiver or laches doctrine to bar consideration of his PCHA claims unconstitutionally limited his right to redress by habeas corpus; and (3) ineffective trial counsel. The court noted that laches did not apply to criminal law, and that an indicted murder defendant was entitled to an instruction on voluntary manslaughter upon request. The court also found that trial defense counsel's conduct did not prejudice the appellant, nor did it compel counsel to pursue non-meritorious points. The court affirmed the trial court judgment for the state.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the lower court order denying appellant Post Conviction Hearing Act relief though the lower court erred in finding appellant's claims barred from consideration by laches and waiver. However, appellant suffered no prejudice from the lower court's failure to instruct on imperfect self-defense, and defense trial counsel could not have been deemed ineffective in failing to insure such a charge where it no prejudice had occurred.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant entered guilty pleas on a number of charges and sought review of his sentence, contended that the sentencing guidelines were unconstitutional. Appellant argued that the statute, 42 Pa. Cons.

Appellant contended that once the commission adopted and published the guidelines, they were passed by the senate but not acted on by the house, and could not have become law without actual approval of the general assembly. The court affirmed the conviction and held that the guidelines were constitutional because the statute specifically allowed for adoption of the guidelines if not rejected by lawmakers within 90 days. The process of creating sentencing guidelines was not legislative, but creating the law that created the procedure to adopt the guidelines was legislative, the court held, and therefore constitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant brewer sought review of an order of the Court of Common Pleas of Westmoreland County (Pennsylvania) that was in favor of appellee distributors in an action to determine whether appellant's termination of a distributor contract with appellees was in violation of the Liquor Code, 47 P.S. &sect; 4-431.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant brewer granted distributing rights to appellee distributors. The distributing rights agreements named appellant as primary distributor and provided for their cancellation upon notice of either party. Shortly after the agreements were entered into, the legislature amended the Liquor Code, 47 P.S. &sect; 4-431, making it unlawful to terminate any distributing rights agreement without good cause shown. After appellant's employees went on strike, appellees refused to distribute for appellant beer that had been brewed out of state. Appellant terminated the distributing agreements, and suit was filed to determine whether this termination was unlawful under &sect; 4-43l. The trial court ruled in favor of appellees, and appellant sought review. The court reversed. The court held that the &quot;for cause&quot; requirement by operation of 47 P.S. &sect; 4-431(d)(5) did not apply to Pennsylvania manufacturers whose status as primary distributor existed prior to enactment of the amendment. The court further held that the newly enacted notice requirement did not have retroactive application. No statute was to be construed as retroactive unless clearly and manifestly intended by the legislature.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Order entering judgment for appellee distributors was reversed. The statutory amendments requiring a showing of good cause of termination and providing for 90 days notice did not apply to appellant brewer because there was a specific exclusion for Pennsylvania manufacturers, and there was no evidence the legislature intended retroactive application.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the sentence of appellant, finding that the Act did not violate his right to equal protection of the law because the sentence imposed under the Act, based upon proof of visible possession of a firearm, substantially served the legislative objective of warning potential criminals of the mandatory sentences they faced for conviction of the enumerated offenses.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant wife sought review of an order from the trial court that awarded her no alimony pendente lite and appellee husband cross-appealed an order that directed him to pay counsel fees to appellant. The court affirmed the order that denied appellant alimony pendente lite and reversed the order that directed appellee to pay counsel fees to appellant. The court found that it was error for the trial court to award counsel fees to appellant for the reason that the divorce proceeding was initiated by appellee, thereby causing appellant to defend herself. The court determined that such a conclusion would imply that one who initiates a divorce proceeding could never recover counsel fees, no matter how needy that party might be. The court concluded that counsel fees could be awarded to either party in a divorce proceeding whenever it deemed such an award was necessary for either party to maintain or to defend a divorce action, and that the determination on which party pays should be made by examining the size of the moving party's estate, the value of counsel's services, and the ability to pay.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested and convicted of robbery after an officer noticed that defendant matched the description of one of the persons who had just committed a robbery a short distance away.

Defendant argued that there was no probable cause for his arrest and that the application of &sect; 9712(a) was unconstitutional. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment, holding that defendant's equal protection rights were not violated because &sect; 9712(a) was a reasonable means of achieving a legitimate legislative purpose and therefore satisfied the &quot;rational basis&quot; test. The court found that defendant's suspicious conduct, coupled with his matching the description of the robbery suspect, gave the officer probable cause to arrest him. The court concluded that, in enacting &sect; 9712, the legislature was concerned with curbing violent crimes resulting from the use of firearms. Because defendant did not belong to a &quot;suspect class,&quot; and no fundamental interest was involved, the &quot;rational basis&quot; standard applied.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Commonwealth sought review of a judgment of sentence from the Court of Common Pleas of Erie County, (Pennsylvania), which did not impose a deadly weapon enhancement pursuant to 42 Pa.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with aggravated assault. There was no designation as to whether the charge was based upon intent to cause serious bodily injury or upon intent to cause serious bodily injury with a deadly weapon. Defendant pled guilty to the charges. The factual basis for the plea was that defendant had caused great bodily harm to the victim. During the sentencing hearing, the victim testified that defendant threatened her and held a knife to her throat. The trial court refused to impose an enhanced sentence under the Commonwealth's claim that the knife was a deadly weapon because use of a weapon was not the factual basis for the guilty plea. The Commonwealth claimed on appeal that the trial court had discretion in imposing an enhanced sentence. The court rejected the Commonwealth's claim and affirmed the sentence. The court ruled that the due process clause applied to sentencing procedures and that defendant could not be sentenced upon a factual basis that was not admitted into evidence at the guilty plea. The court also ruled that the weapon enhancement provision in 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9721 for possession of a deadly weapon was unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant raised two issues on appeal concerning his conviction and sentence for unlawful delivery of a controlled substance.

The court held that the detective involved with the case clearly acted outside the scope of his statutory authority when he conducted an investigation outside his geographical jurisdiction. However, the court also held that, under the circumstances of the instant case, suppression of the evidence gained by the detective's illegal investigation was a remedy all out of proportion to the benefits gained to the end of obtaining justice while preserving individual liberties unimpaired.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant state Attorney General's Office challenged an order from the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County (Pennsylvania), which suppressed evidence in a criminal complaint charging appellee with theft of telephone services. Appellant contended that the trial court erred in holding that the scope of appellant's authority to prosecute was specifically limited by the Commonwealth Attorneys Act, 71 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 732-205(a)(1)-(8) (1980).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant state Attorney General's Office challenged a judgment holding that appellant lacked authority to prosecute appellee attorney under the Commonwealth Attorneys Act, 71 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 732-205(a)(1)-(8) (1980). Appellee was charged with theft of phone services for using an electronic device to circumvent the phone company's billing apparatus. Prior to the preliminary hearing, appellant determined that a basis for appellant's prosecution did not exist, and turned over to the county prosecutor. The trial court suppressed the evidence on the grounds that prior to application for a search warrant appellant did not have a reasonable belief that it could prosecute appellee. Holding that scope of appellant's authority to investigate a criminal offense was limited by the statute to cases that appellant had the power to prosecute, the appellate court rejected appellant's contention that it reasonably believed it could prosecute under the state racketeering statute. However, the appellate court reversed the suppression order because appellee's constitutional rights were not violated, considering that there was probable cause to support the issuance of the search warrant.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The suppression court's order was reversed because while appellant state Attorney General's Office exceeded its authority there was no showing that appellee's right to be free from unreasonable searches was violated. The court remanded the case because there was no argument that probable cause supported the issuance of the search warrant, or that the challenged search warrant was not issued by a neutral and disinterested judicial officer.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was involved in a vehicle accident resulting in death. Defendant was transported to the hospital where blood was withdrawn, which later tested positive for alcohol. Defendant was convicted of driving under the influence of alcohol or a controlled substance, involuntary manslaughter, and related crimes. The appellate court affirmed. Defendant did have a privacy interest in the blood taken from him without a warrant. However, under 75 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 1547(a), defendant consented to the search because there was probable cause to believe that he was intoxicated. The consent was implied from the fact that there was a serious accident, defendant was semi-conscious, the police smelled alcohol, and marijuana was found in his vehicle. The trial court had the discretion to refuse to allow a witness to testify where he would only have exercised his privilege against self-incrimination. Defendant failed to allege in his motion to set aside the conviction why the verdict was against the weight of the evidence, and the issue was not preserved for review.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed an order from the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County (Pennsylvania), which entered a murder conviction. Defendant claimed a bring-down order authorizing his transport to police headquarters for questioning violated the habeas corpus statute, 12 P.S. &sect; 1887. Defendant claimed a new trial was required because his confession was involuntary, and he was denied assistance of counsel during questioning.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An elderly woman was murdered. Police questioned defendant and released him for a lack of probable cause to arrest. Later, defendant was taken into custody for a rape. A &quot;bring-down&quot; order was entered which authorized police to transport defendant to police headquarters for an interrogation regarding the murder. During questioning, police told defendant he was being arrested for the murder. Defendant confessed. The confession was used at trial, and defendant was convicted. Defendant appealed. Defendant claimed that the &quot;bring-down&quot; order violated the habeas corpus statute, 12 P.S. &sect; 1887, because it was not signed by a judge, but merely approved by the prosecutor's office and stamped by a court clerk. Defendant also claimed he was denied assistance of counsel during interrogation. The appellate court affirmed. Because there was probable cause to arrest, and defendant waived his right to counsel, suppression of the confession was denied. No new trial was required. Although defendant alleged no prejudice from the bring-down itself, the court found that the bring-down order was an invasion of defendant's rights. Thus, court orders were required for future bring-downs.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court affirmed the trial court's entry of defendant's murder conviction because although a bring-down order to transport defendant for questioning was not signed by the court, there was probable cause to arrest defendant and suppression of a subsequent confession was unnecessary. No new trial was required because defendant waived his right to counsel at questioning.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of robbery and various other crimes when he used a firearm and shot a victim in the leg to force the surrender of the victim's wallet. Defendant was sentenced to 5 to 10 years incarceration in accordance with the firearms provision of the Mandatory Sentencing Act, 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 9712. Section 9712 required a minimum sentence of five years' confinement for visible possession of a firearm during the commission of various offenses, including robbery. Defendant appealed the judgment, challenging the constitutionality of the statute. The court affirmed the judgment and upheld the statute pursuant to a recent decision of the state's high court, which addressed the same issues that defendant raised. The court provided that requiring only a preponderance of the evidence for visible possession of the firearm satisfied the minimum requirements of due process. Additionally, the power to determine the punishment for criminal conduct was within the province of the legislature, and the trial court was not deprived of its power to sentence under the statute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment and sentence of 5 to 10 years' confinement of the trial court because the statute addressing mandatory sentencing where a firearm was visible during the commission of certain crimes was constitutional under a state high court decision. The statute satisfied the minimum requirements of due process and did not violate the separation of powers doctrine by depriving the trial court of its discretion in sentencing.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff mother appealed an order from the Court of Common Pleas of Lycoming County (Pennsylvania), affirming a family court hearing officer's order dismissing a paternity suit as time-barred under the statute of limitations, 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. &sect; 6704(e). Plaintiff alleged defendant putative father's acknowledgement of paternity operated as a waiver of the statute of limitations.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant putative father allegedly executed an acknowledgment of paternity for a child that was born out of wedlock Almost eight years later, plaintiff mother brought an action for support. A family court hearing officer found the suit was time-barred under 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. &sect; 6704(e) because the action was not brought within six years of the child's birth, or two years of the acknowledgement. The trial court affirmed the order. Plaintiff appealed, claiming the acknowledgement acted as a waiver of the statute of limitations, and that defendant was estopped from raising the statute of limitations because he acknowledged paternity. The appellate court affirmed. The court found it was inequitable to suddenly find a duty to support the acknowledgment was more than seven years before the filing of an action. This acknowledgment was not a reasonable basis for instituting a paternity proceeding. An acknowledgement within the six-year period did not fix the right to pursue an action, but only fixed the time frame during which such action could be pursued should it carry beyond the basic six-year limitation. Because plaintiff failed to timely institute suit, her suit was dismissed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's order affirming a family court hearing officer's dismissal of plaintiff mother's paternity suit against defendant putative father. Because plaintiff did not sue within two years of an alleged acknowledgment of paternity, or bring a paternity action within six years of the child's birth, the action was time-barred under the statute of limitations, and to allow such a suit would be unfair to defendant.</SPAN></P>

Appellant's grandson was subsequently adopted by appellee adoptive parents in a proceeding where appellant's son-in-law relinquished his parental rights. Approximately a year and a half later, appellant learned of her grandson's whereabouts and the fact of his adoption. She filed both a complaint for custody and a petition to intervene in the adoption nunc pro tunc. At the close of the pleadings, the matters were consolidated and upon motion for judgment on the pleadings, the trial court dismissed her claim for custody and her request to intervene in the adoption proceeding. The court affirmed the trial court order dismissing appellant's complaint for custody and to intervene in the adoption proceeding. The court noted that the Custody and Grandparents Visitation Act, 23 P.S. &sect; 1001 et seq. did not provide appellant with the requirement of notice that was protected by the due process clause. The court also noted that, for sound public policy reasons, this same act terminated visitation once a child was adopted.</SPAN></P>

Defendant challenged his conviction and sentence on multiple grounds and claimed that &sect; 5903(a)(2) was unconstitutional. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's conviction and sentence. The court found that &sect; 5903(a)(2) was not overly broad such that a chilling effect was created where, although the statute on its face prohibited any showing of obscene materials, the legislative intent was properly interpreted as prohibiting only the public showing of such materials or the showing of such materials for commercial gain. The court found that &sect; 5903(a)(2) did not violate the constitutional rights to privacy, as it was not substantially overbroad in relation to its purpose of regulating the commercial sale of obscenity, activity not protected by U.S.Const.amend. I. The court affirmed the $ 10,000 fine accessed as within the trial court's discretion where based on defendant's ability to pay even where the fine would cause defendant substantial hardship.</SPAN></P>

Defendants challenged their convictions and claimed that the Pennsylvania Wiretapping and Electronic Surveillance Control Act of October 4, 1978 (the Act), 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 5701 et seq., was unconstitutional or, if valid, was improperly applied in this case. On appeal, the court affirmed and held that the Act was constitutional and uniformly more restrictive than Title III of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968, 18 U.S.C.S. &sect; 2510. The court also found that the Act was properly applied in this case, where the phone tap was obtained only after a properly authorized application based on probable cause was made. The court found that proper measure were taken to minimize the interception of nonpertinent communication and that the wire tap was obtained only after years of investigative police work showed that additional surveillance was necessary. The court found 24-hour surveillance reasonable under the facts of this case.</SPAN></P>

Defendants challenged the convictions on multiple grounds including a claim that the state criminal laws could not constitutionally punish conduct protected by U.S.Const. amend. I. The court overruled this claim and affirmed the involuntary manslaughter conviction. The court held that while defendants could lawfully withhold treatment from themselves, they owed a duty to the young child who was not capable of making decisions on his own, as parents, to seek medical attention in a case like this, where death was approaching.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee was convicted of possessing an instrument of crime in violation of 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. &sect; 907, and aggravated assault, 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2702(a)(1). After the jury returned its verdict and before sentencing, appellant prosecution notified appellee of its intent to invoke 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. An. &sect; 9712. Following the denial of appellee's post-trial motions, the trial court refused to apply the mandatory minimum sentencing statute and imposed a sentence of probation for both convictions. Appellant filed a motion for reconsideration of the sentence, which the trial court denied. The court reversed the trial court's decision. The court noted that, although the trial court purported to find the statute unconstitutional, it failed to attach any cases that supported a constitutional underpinning of its decision. Rather, it was clear that the trial court simply believed that appellant's situation warranted an exercise of discretion for imposition of a lesser sentence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court vacated the sentence imposed for aggravated assault and remanded the case for resentencing and relinquished jurisdiction.

Cons. Stat. &sect; 9712(e) and imposed the mandatory minimum sentence of imprisonment for the use of a firearm during the commission of a felony.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant robber pled guilty to robbery, corruption of minors and criminal conspiracy. The trial court determined that a carbon dioxide powered pellet gun was a &quot;firearm&quot; under 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 9712(e), and thus the mandatory minimum sentence of imprisonment for the use of a firearm during commission of a robbery was applicable. The statute defined a firearm as a weapon, including a starter gun, which was or designed or could be converted to expel a projectile by an explosive or the expansion of gas therein. Appellant sought review, arguing that the trial court erred by ruling that the pellet gun was a firearm under &sect; 9712(e). Appellant maintained that the definition of &quot;weapon&quot; found in 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 907 of the Crimes Code governed. The court affirmed, holding that the language of &sect; 9712(e) was clear and unambiguous and withstood appellant's vagueness attack, the pellet gun expelled a projectile by action of an explosive or expansion of gas, and that the introductory phrase in &sect; 9712(e) &quot;as used in this section 'firearm means'&quot; evinced the legislature's awareness of other definitions of firearm in other sections.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought reversal of his sentences for aggravated assault, possession of a prohibited offensive weapon, carrying a firearm on a public street, and resisting arrest. He alleged that he was unlawfully and duplicitously sentenced to consecutive maximum terms of imprisonment, as all of these convictions resulted from the single unlawful act of firing a sawed-off shotgun, and, that they merged for sentencing purposes. The court vacated the sentence for possessing a prohibited offensive weapon, but affirmed the remaining sentences. The court held that the charges for aggravated assault and resisting arrest did not merge with each other, nor did they merge with carrying a firearm. The court found that carrying a firearm did not merge with aggravated assault, as a conviction under the firearm statute did not merge with a violent offense, and no valid reason existed for merging the firearm violation with resisting arrest. However, the firearm offense and the prohibited offensive weapons charge merged. Possession of the same gun in the same circumstances was proof of crimes that involved each other and the statutes protected two diverse interests of the Commonwealth.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sued appellees for damages for injuries he received when his tire and multi-piece rim assembly exploded. He alleged causes of action for negligence, strict liability, industry-wide liability, market share liability, and concerted action liability. The trial court sustained preliminary objections by appellees, and appellant sought review. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment and held that appellant's claims based on negligence and strict liability failed. The court found that appellant failed to designate whether the tire, or the rim assembly was defective, or identify one of the appellees, as the manufacturer, supplier, or seller of the defective product. Because negligence and strict liability attached liability only to the entity that sold the defective product, he failed to establish the causal connection between appellees' conduct and his injuries. With regard to appellant's claims for industry-wide liability and concert of action, the court determined that those causes of action were not recognized in Pennsylvania, and refused to adopt them in this case. The court found that appellant failed to allege facts supporting market share liability.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant executrix brought wrongful death and survival actions against appellee corporations, alleging her husband died from exposure to asbestos products manufactured by appellee corporations. The lower court held that the wrongful death action was time-barred by the one-year statute of limitations, 12 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 1603 (current version at 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 5524(2)), the survival action was time-barred under the two-year statute of limitations, 12 Pa. Cons.

The court affirmed the grant of summary judgment in the wrongful death action, but vacated the summary judgment in the survival action, holding that the discovery rule applied where an action was commenced after the effective date of &sect; 5524(2) (June 27, 1978), and the date of death was on or after June 16, 1977 for a wrongful death action, or June 16, 1976 for a survival action; and because the decedent died on September 27, 1976 and the action was bought on January 24, 1979, the wrongful death action was barred by the prior statutes of limitation, but the discovery rule was applicable to the survival action.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged a judgment of sentence by the Court of Common Pleas of Crawford County (Pennsylvania), which convicted him of drunk driving and sentenced him to a 90 day prison term and a $ 1000 fine under 75 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 1543(b). Appellant argued that the statute was unconstitutional because it violated the equal protection clause, imposed cruel and unusual punishment, and violated the separation of powers doctrine.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of driving under the influence of alcohol on a suspended license. Pursuant to 75 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 1543(b), he was sentenced to 90 days in prison and a $ 1000 fine. Appellant argued that the statute was unconstitutional and that it had been applied to him retroactively. The court held that the statute was constitutional for the same reasons that a companion statute on drunk driving had survived a constitutional challenge. Enactment of statutes that defined criminal conduct and imposed penalties for it was a proper exercise of legislative power and did not violate the separation of powers doctrine. The statute did not impose cruel and unusual punishment because its penalties met current societal standards of decency. On the equal protection challenge, the statute met the rational basis test because it was rationally related to the commonwealth's legitimate interest in highway safety. Like the recidivism statutes, these penalties did not impose additional punishments for a drunk driving conviction. Nor did the fine violate due process when appellant could pay on installments and could not be imprisoned for failure to pay it. The conviction was affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed appellant's conviction and sentence for driving under the influence of alcohol. The statute under which appellant was charged was constitutional. The statute was rationally related to a legitimate state interest in highway safety. Neither the prison sentence nor the fine contradicted contemporary standards of justice. The enactment of statutes that define criminal conduct was a proper exercise of legislative power.</SPAN></P>

Appellant continued to live at the property, the property was sold at a sheriff's sale, and appellee new owner filed a complaint in ejectment against appellant. The court affirmed the grant of summary judgment in favor of appellee, holding that the Municipal Claims and Tax Liens Act, 53 Pa. Cons.

The court found that the act had no provision for notifying a property owner prior to filing a tax lien but only that the sheriff post the property and follow the statutory requirements regarding service and publication of the sale.

Appellants were convicted of second degree murder, criminal conspiracy, robbery, and the possession of instruments of crime. Appellants alleged that the evidence was insufficient to support their convictions. On appeal, the court affirmed the convictions.

Further, the court found that there was fresh pursuit of appellants and no break in the chain of events from the time the box was stolen until the decedent was murdered.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant homeowners brought an action against appellee corporation in which they claimed that the subsidence to their home had been caused by the negligence of appellee. Appellants claimed that appellee commenced or recommenced coal mining operations that caused appellants' land to shift and subside, resulting in damage to appellants' home.

The court held that the Bituminous Mine Subsidence and Land Conservation Act of 1966 (BMSLCA), 52 P.S. &sect; 1406.1 et seq., imposed a duty on appellee to give notice to appellants of its intent to mine, which duty appellants' complaint claimed appellee failed to meet. It held that appellants' complaint thus stated a cause of action under BMSLCA. The court further held that appellants' complaint also stated a cause of action under the BMSLCA of July 2, 1937, 52 P.S. &sect; 1407 because the complaint unambiguously averred that appellants' home suffered subsidence damage as a result of negligent mining activities by appellee.</SPAN></P>

Consequently, appellant's property was damaged and the transmission line caused electromagnetic radiation, noise, and vibrations. Appellant filed a suit for trespass, conspiracy, nuisance, and unconstitutional taking against appellee. The trial court sustained appellee's demurrers and dismissed appellant's claims. On appeal, the court reversed in part, affirmed in part, and held the unconstitutional taking claim was properly dismissed because appellant was not a property owner named against whom appellee's eminent domain power was to be exercised, hence, the procedures for determining damages did not come into play. As such, the proper remedy was a viewer's proceeding and appellant failed to petition for the appointment of viewers. Also, there was no challenge to the validity or scope of the condemnation. The court found a cause of action existed for trespass because appellee did not aver it was a successor of the grantee and only reasonable increases in the burden of the easement was permitted.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed appellant's conviction and sentence for official oppression because the trial court did not err in refusing to suppress the tapes and evidence of electronic interceptions when they were properly authorized and the search warrant based thereon was properly made.

The trial judge properly denied appellant's request for an instruction on the entrapment defense because no evidence was offered to show that the initial contacts between appellant and woman were instigated or encouraged by law enforcement. The court found that appellant admitted he initiated discussions regarding sexual favors, and he offered no evidence whatsoever to show that his conduct was so induced. The court concluded that consent was not an issue because appellant's action in using his official position to take advantage of a defendant whose case was pending before him was conduct covered by the official oppression statute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed appellant's sentence for attempted robbery, but vacated his concurrent sentence for criminal conspiracy because he was improperly convicted and sentenced for two inchoate crimes, criminal attempt and criminal conspiracy, which was prohibited under 18 Pa.

The court concluded that the pretrial publicity, which stressed the applicability of the new mandatory sentencing statute; quoted a police captain's statement that appellant would get &quot;no deals;&quot; noted that co-defendant had given police a statement implicating appellant; and reported the revocation of appellant's parole on a prior criminal charge, was not so sustained and inflammatory as to be inherently prejudicial and deny him a fair trial. The court found that the reporting was basically factual, the four articles could not constitute &quot;pervasive dissemination&quot; of the information, and three months had elapsed between the last of the four articles and the beginning of appellant's trial. The court concluded that a police officer's remark that he knew appellant from speaking to him before could not be construed by the jury that appellant had been involved in prior criminal conduct.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant husband challenged the judgment of the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County (Pennsylvania), which sentenced him for indirect criminal contempt of a protection order entered under the Protection from Abuse Act, 35 Pa.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In considering appellant husband's challenge of the denial of a jury trial for the indirect criminal contempt charge he incurred after beating appellee wife, the court noted that while the Protection from Abuse Act, 35 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. &sect; 10181 et seq., had been upheld regarding double jeopardy and due process, it had not been challenged regarding the denial of a jury trial. The court asserted that since 35 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. &sect; 10190 did not authorize a penalty of more than six months imprisonment, it did not violate appellant's right to a jury trial, unless the further authorization of a fine not to exceed $ 1,000 so enhanced the severity of the penalty as to render the offense of violating a protection order a serious, rather than a petty, offense. The court held that it did not, since summary disposition was essential to the effectiveness of the Protection from Abuse Act. The court concluded that the legislature did not clearly, palpably, and plainly violate appellant's constitutional rights. The judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged the judgment of sentence entered in the Court of Common Pleas of Lancaster County (Pennsylvania), upon his conviction for vehicular homicide under 75 Pa.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of vehicular homicide under 75 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 3732 after he made a left turn in front of an oncoming motorcyclist, causing his death. The court found that there was sufficient evidence to find that defendant should have known he was violating 75 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 3322 , which proscribed illegal left turns, but found that the evidence was insufficient to establish any degree of culpability higher than ordinary negligence. The court held that the evidence was insufficient to prove that defendant's failure to apprehend the hazard in time was a &quot;gross&quot; deviation from a reasonable standard of care. The court ruled that all the evidence pointed to the conclusion that defendant was at most ordinarily negligent in causing the accident. The court reversed the conviction and held that due process of law, under U.S. Const. amend. XIV and Pa. Const. art. 1, prohibited a conviction under &sect; 3732 based on defendant's ordinary negligence in violating a traffic law, where the violation was neither knowing nor criminally negligent.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found the evidence sufficient to support defendant's conviction for vehicular homicide, but reversed the judgment of sentence on the ground that the conviction unconstitutionally deprived defendant of due process of law by imposing criminal liability upon a showing of no more than ordinary negligence. The court determined that the vehicular homicide law predicated on ordinary negligence violated the constitution.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the prosecution failed to present a certificate from the commissioner of the state police documenting a search of his records and finding that appellant had not been issued a license by any authorized official within the commonwealth; therefore, appellant's conviction for carrying a firearm without a license had to be reversed. The court affirmed the conviction and sentence for a former convict possessing a firearm under 18 Pa. Cons. Stat.

The trial court denied appellant the right to intervene, appellant challenged the decision, and the court reversed the trial court's order. The court held that the trial court abused its discretion because it relied on 40 P.S. &sect; 1301.602, which was no longer viable due to the declaration that arbitration in medical malpractice was unconstitutional, and because it never considered appellant's right to intervene pursuant to the Support Law, 62 P.S. &sect; 1974(a), the Fraud and Abuse Control Act, 62 P.S. &sect; 1401 et. seq., and Pa. R. Civ. P. 2327. The court also held pursuant to 62 P.S. &sect; 1409(b)(9), appellant should have been notified that a settlement agreement had been reached among the parties in the underlying suit.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court vacated the trial court's order denying appellant department of public welfare the right to intervene and remanded to the trial court. The court held that where appellant had an interest, statute required that appellant be given notice and an opportunity to perfect and satisfy its lien prior to satisfaction of the judgment, award or settlement.</SPAN></P>

Defendants appealed from the trial court's decision to deny their motion for judgment n.o.v. and their motion for arrest of judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, a school and its owner, sent several letters, purportedly from students, to the Veterans Administration and to the Pennsylvania Association of Private School Administrators in order to discredit plaintiffs, a school and its owners and operators. The jury found defendants liable and awarded plaintiffs compensatory and punitive damages. The lower court granted defendants' motion for a new trial but denied their motions for judgment n.o.v. and for arrest of judgment. Both parties appealed. The court held that the instruction to the jury that the defendants bore burden of proving the truth of the defamatory communication was correct. Despite unrebutted testimony that, as a result of the letters, plaintiff school's income substantially decreased and it lost its accreditation, the court could not say, after reviewing the record, that the lower court reached a manifestly unreasonable judgement or abused its discretion in finding the verdict excessive. The court, therefore, modified the order granting a new trial by limiting the new trial to the issue of damages.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the conviction, holding that under the rules of statutory construction, appellant was required to put on an affirmative defense relating to his place of abode or fixed place of business. It was not an element of the crime to be proved by appellee. When interpreting statutes, the court had to look at the wording of the exception and its role in relation to the other words in the statute, whether in light of the situation prompting legislative action, the exception was essential to complete the general prohibition intended, whether the exception makes an excuse or justification for what would otherwise be criminal conduct, that was, set forth an affirmative defense, and whether the matter was peculiarly within appellant's knowledge.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the judgment of sentence of the Court of Common Pleas of Dauphin County (Pennsylvania), that convicted him of driving while under the influence of alcohol in violation of 75 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 3731 and sentenced him to a minimum term of 30 days imprisonment in addition to a fine.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted for a second offense of driving while under the influence of alcohol in violation of 75 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 3731 and sentenced to a minimum term of 30 days imprisonment in addition to a fine. The court affirmed the judgment of sentence because the recidivist section of 75 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 3731(e)(1)(ii) was not violative of constitutional provisions proscribing ex post facto laws. The court held that the enactment of &sect; 3731(e)(1)(ii) did not make criminal an act that had previously been lawful and it did not alter the rules of evidence to require less or different testimony in order to convict. The statutory amendment, which provided a heavier sentence for a second offense, was not constitutionally infirm merely because it required a sentencing court to consider a conviction that had occurred before the new law went into effect. As of the effective date of &sect; 3731(e)(1)(ii) defendant was on notice as to what would happen if he were again convicted of driving while intoxicated. The court held that the penalty defendant faced did not result from the legislation, but rather from his own acts that took place after the effective date of the legislation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of the partial summary judgment order by the Court of Common Pleas, Civil Division, for the County of Philadelphia (Pennsylvania) in favor of appellee the Pennsylvania Assigned Claims Plan. Appellant contended that the trial court's order was based on a constitutionally defective statute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant's father was killed when the uninsured car he was driving was struck by another vehicle. Appellant filed an action against appellee, the Pennsylvania Assigned Claims Plan, who counterclaimed that it was entitled under 40 P.S. &sect; 1009.501(1985) to recover the money it paid to appellant, the owner of the uninsured vehicle. Appellant contended that because the statute required her to pay the damages caused by the accident, and suspension of her license and was subject to prosecution if she failed to pay, the pay-back provision violated her right to equal protection under the law. When no suspect class or fundamental right existed, the statute must be examined to find whether a reasonable relation existed between its classification and the legislative goal. The court affirmed because here, the object of barring driver's licenses to those who do not pay judgments was to prevent future occurrences of uncompensated injury from burdening the Plan. The classification of owners into insured, underinsured and uninsured accomplishes this goal. The scheme prevented those who force the Plan to pay out benefits from repeating their acts.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that the classification in the statute was reasonably related to the legislative goal. Therefore, it affirmed the holding below that no violation of equal protection exists.</SPAN></P>

The trial court denied appellant's motion for new trial and entered judgment for appellee, and the court reversed and remanded holding that the trial court erred in its charge to the jury and such error required reversal. The court held there was evidence which reasonably established that appellant was intoxicated, so as to make it necessary to place before the jury the issue of whether he was so influenced by alcohol to be a hazard. The court held that there was corroborated testimony which put forth more than a suggestion of intoxication and, therefore, the evidence of appellant's intoxication was properly admitted, and was not prejudicial. The court further held that the admission of appellant's blood alcohol level was proper when it showed his unfitness in crossing the street. The court held that the trial court's jury charge as to the presumption of being under the influence of alcohol as set out in 75 Pa. Cons.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant and two co-defendants were tried before trial court and a jury on charges arising from an incident which occurred in March of 1980.

R. Crim. P. 1126. On review, the court affirmed the judgment of sentence. In response, appellant filed a petition for en banc reargument. The court granted the petition, and again affirmed the trial court, because trial counsel's inaction did not have any effect on the outcome of the action, his misunderstanding of R. 1126 did not result in prejudice to appellant, and the failure to act resulted in harmless error.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant mother filed paternity action against appellee father, who then moved for, and was granted summary judgment under 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 6704(b), because the action was not brought within the six year statute of limitations. Appellant challenged the trial court's grant of summary judgment, contending that statute of limitations was unconstitutional, appellee had stipulated to paternity, did not object to his name on the child's birth certificate, and had contributed to support. On appeal, the court held that the statute of limitations was long enough in duration, and related to a legitimate state interest in clearly setting a six-year time limit on appellant's action, and was therefore constitutional. Because appellant's evidence supporting appellee's contributions to support was not admitted before the trial court, it therefore was not considered on appellate review, and the court affirmed the trial court's grant of summary judgment for appellee.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In challenging his convictions for murder and involuntary deviate sexual intercourse, appellant claimed that the trial court erred in failing to suppress his confession. The court applied the totality of circumstances analysis and held that the lower court properly denied appellant's motion to suppress the confession. The court found there was no evidence that appellant was subjected to physical or psychological abuse. Both appellant and his father were informed of appellant's Miranda rights on two occasions prior to their private conference out of the presence of the officers. Both appellant and his father indicated that they wanted to waive appellant's rights and both agreed that the appellant would talk to the police without his father being present. During the course of questioning that followed, appellant on numerous occasions indicated that he did not object to talking to the officers alone without his father being present. Appellant then confessed to the murder. The court held that it was clear from the totality of the circumstances that appellant's confession was knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily made. The court affirmed the judgment of sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant's judgment of sentence for murder and involuntary deviate sexual intercourse was affirmed because his confession was knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily made, because the trial court did not abuse its discretion in failing to transfer the matter to the juvenile court or in failing to declare a mistrial, and because the age classification of the involuntary deviate sexual intercourse statute was not arbitrary.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">During appellant criminal's trial, appellant was ordered to shave his beard to facilitate an in court identification. Also, appellant's request for a mistrial, and to introduce evidence of an alibi after the prosecution has closed its case-in-chief were denied. After conviction for murder, burglary, and criminal attempt of robbery, appellant challenged the judgment of sentence. The court affirmed. Appellant's right against self-incrimination, Pa. Const. art. I, &sect; 9, as afforded by U.S. Const. amend V, was not violated by the order to shave. The Fifth Amendment excluded only evidence which was testimonial in nature, not that which was demonstrative or physical. Further, the interest of justice was served by discouragement of appellant's attempt to disguise himself. After an innocuous reference by a co-defendant indicated that appellant was involved in drug activity, a request for mistrial was correctly refused in light of a curative instruction. Appellant's attempt to introduce alibi testimony in the middle of the sixth day of trial was precluded by Pa. R. Crim. P. 305C, which required notice. Justice demanded exclusion because of the prejudice to the prosecution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant criminal's judgment of sentence for murder, burglary, and criminal attempt of robbery was affirmed as his right against self-incrimination was not violated by order to shave for identification purposes at trial. Moreover, a request for mistrial was properly refused when an innocuous reference to distinct crime was made but an effective curative instruction was given and refusal to allow alibi defense was correct when untimely made.</SPAN></P>

Subsequently, while the victim was walking outside, defendant forcibly raped her at gunpoint. He also took $ 100 from her. The medical evidence was consistent with the victim's account and a pubic hair belonging to defendant was found on the victim. At trial, defendant testified that he knew the victim to be a prostitute and that she had solicited him. The trial court denied a defense motion to offer into evidence the victim's convictions for criminal solicitation in prostitution, which all occurred in the same generally area as the alleged rape. Defendant was found guilty of rape and robbery. On appeal, defendant argued that his right to confront the witness against him was violated by exclusion of the victim's prior sexual history because it was probative on the issue of consent. The court thought that it was inadmissible under Pennsylvania's Rape Shield Law, 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 3104, because it was evidence of sexual conduct with third persons. The court also denied defendant's motion for a new trial. His convictions for rape and robbery were affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's convictions for rape and robbery because it determined that the trial court correctly excluded evidence of the victim's convictions for criminal solicitation in prostitution because Pennsylvania's Rape Shield law barred the admissibility of a rape victim's sexual conduct with third persons.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant publishers, wholesalers, and retailers challenged an order from the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County (Pennsylvania), which determined that the state obscenity statute,&nbsp;18 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 5903(a)(1), was constitutionally sound and denied appellants' request for declaratory and permanent injunctive relief. Appellants contended that the trial court erred because the statute was impermissibly overbroad and vague.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant publishers, wholesalers, and retailers challenged an order from a trial court that upheld the state's obscenity statute against constitutional attack. Appellants had filed an action seeking to have 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 5903(a)(1) declared unconstitutional on the grounds that compliance with the statute necessitated the exclusion of all minors from store premises, or required that they display solely materials suitable for children. Appellants argued that the trial court erred in upholding the statute's constitutionality because the terms &quot;harmful to minors,&quot; &quot;display,&quot; &quot;minor,&quot; and &quot;as part of the general public or otherwise&quot; were so vague that they gave no notice of the prohibited conduct. Prior to the action, none of the appellants been charged or threatened with prosecution. After determining that appellants had standing, the appellate court affirmed the order upholding the constitutionality of the statute because its language was sufficiently specific to provide notice of proscribed conduct. The appellate court held that the fact that more precise language might have been chosen did not render the statute unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order upholding the constitutionality of the statute was affirmed because appellants failed to satisfy the heavy burden borne by those challenging a statute as overbroad or vague. The court held that carefully drawn restrictions on the sale or distribution of materials not obscene for adults to juveniles was allowed, and the mere fact that appellants might engage in self-censorship did not require invalidation of the statute.</SPAN></P>

The court reasoned that in a foster care situation, the foster parents did not stand in loco parentis to the child because the state agency that was involved had responsibility for the actual care and custody of the child. The court reviewed the legislative intent and found that the purpose of the language was to clarify that the relationship between the foster parents and the child was subordinate both to the relationship between the agency and the child and to the relationship between the child and the child's parents, and that this structure helped insure that the child's best interests were considered, and that the natural parents and foster parents did not become rivals for the child.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the Pennsylvania Constitution afforded no greater protection from prosecution for the distribution and sale of obscene materials than did the United States Constitution. The court also held that the evidence was legally sufficient to support the conviction. The court found that proof was adequate to show that appellant knew the contents of the films he sold. The court stated that the doors of the viewing booths clearly provided notice of the nature of the films for sale in the store where appellant worked in a supervisory capacity. The court concluded that with only a few facts before him and without inquiring into appellant's ability to pay, the trial judge imposed a substantial fine. Accordingly, pursuant to 42 Pa. Cons.

Appellant argued that he was denied full appellate rights and the right to the representation of competent counsel on a prior direct appeal from a judgment of sentence for second-degree murder, robbery, burglary, and conspiracy.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of second-degree murder, robbery, burglary, and conspiracy. His conviction was upheld on direct appeal. He sought relief under the Post Conviction Hearing Act (PCHA), 42 Pa. Cons.

Appellant had not sought state supreme court review and was not seeking it under the PCHA. Instead, he sought to advance two new claims to the court: (1) that the felony murder rule under 18 Pa. Cons.

The court affirmed the decision of the PCHA court because numerous courts had refused to strike down the felony murder rule and counsel's failure to challenge its constitutionality could not be equated with ineffectiveness. The court dealt summarily with the colloquy issue because appellant conceded compliance with applicable law.</SPAN></P>

The court en banc dismissed the motion, judgment was entered on the verdict as molded, and appellant sought review.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were convicted of lotteries and gambling in violation of 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect;&sect; 5512 and 5513, respectively. Defendants appealed from their judgments, contending that their U.S. Const. amend. IV and Pa. Const. art. I, &sect; 8 rights to privacy were violated by law enforcement agencies' use of pen registers and Dial Number Recorders (DNR) without a court order that authorized such use. The court consolidated the appeals, reversed the convictions, and remanded for further proceedings. The Wiretapping and Electronic Surveillance Act, 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect;&sect; 5701-5726, stated that it was not unlawful for any investigative or law enforcement officer to use a pen register under 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 5704(5). The difference between pen registers as defined in &sect; 5704(5), and DNRs, was immaterial. However, though the United States Supreme Court held that the use of a pen register did not violate U.S. Const. amend. IV, Pa. Const. art. I, &sect; 8 extended greater protection. Thus, defendants and the persons with whom they telephonically communicated with had an expectation of privacy which law enforcement agencies could not violate absent a court order entered upon a showing of probable cause.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was tried without counsel after the public defender refused to represent him. The appellate court vacated the conviction, holding that appellant's right to counsel had been denied. There had been no proper determination of appellant's eligibility for appointed counsel. The trial court relied on the public defender's assertions that appellant was able to afford counsel based on his income and assets and the fact that he had made bail. The court pointed out that, after rent, appellant's daily net income was $ 10.00 and there was no evidence that his asset, a car, had any value. Also, there was evidence that appellant's mother had posted his bail. The court questioned the public defender's and trial court's beliefs that appellant would have been able to hire an attorney given his limited income and assets. There had been no guidelines used in determining appellant's eligibility and no consideration of appellant's other liabilities. The fact that appellant appeared for trial without counsel did not constitute a waiver where appellant stated that he was unable to afford an attorney.

The court affirmed defendant's 15-year probation and monthly payment in costs and fines to be forwarded to the owner of the burned-down funeral home.

Appellant had instituted a medical malpractice action by filing a complaint in accordance with the Pennsylvania Health Care Services Malpractice Act, 40 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 1301.101 et seq. The arbitrators decided unanimously in appellant's favor. Appellee doctor took an appeal de novo and a verdict was returned in his favor. The trial court denied appellant's motion to read into the record the findings of fact and the decision of the arbitrators as provided by 40 P.S. &sect; 1301.510. On appeal, appellant contended the trial court erred in so doing. The court held that in the case of &sect; 1301.510, the legislature, by inclusion of a severability clause, had expressed its intent that the constitutional provisions should stand even as their unconstitutional adjunct, 40 P.S. &sect; 1301.309, had fallen.

The court found that parental incapacity must have been shown, and that such incapacity could not have been remedied. The court found that clear and convincing evidence was required to prove this inability to remedy, and the evidence presented by witnesses at trial did not meet that standard. The court reversed and remanded the case, holding that the requirements for termination as contained in &sect; 2511(a), regarding proof of incapacity, must have been met before the termination could have occurred.

Appellant's husband was exposed to asbestos products while working as a pipe insulator aboard U.S. Navy ships both in dry dock and on navigable waters. Appellant filed the actions seven years after her husband's death and asserted that she did not discover that asbestos was the cause of his cancer until less than one year ago. The court held that admiralty law and the doctrine of laches did not apply to appellant's actions when her husband was not engaged in activity that bore a significant relationship to traditional maritime activity. The court held that the discovery rule was inapplicable to wrongful death and survival actions. The court held that appellee asbestos manufacturers were not estopped from raising the defense of statute of limitations when they had not caused appellant to delay her action through fraud or concealment.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In connection with the audit of a trust, appellant adoptees sought to participate in the share of income that had been paid to their adoptive father during his lifetime. Prior adjudication of this issue by the courts had held that the testator intended, at the time he wrote his will, to include only blood relatives in the class of those who would share in the income. Appellants argued that the prior decisions were not res judicata and despite any lack of ambiguity in the decedent's will, subsequent court decisions dictated that adopted children's rights were equal to those of natural children. The court held that it agreed with the prior decisions finding that when the testator drafted his will he used unequivocal language to limit his bounty to his blood line and no other.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant injured was a passenger in a vehicle driven by appellee driver, a resident of the commonwealth, during an auto accident that occurred in the state of her residence. Appellant brought an action in the lower court seeking damages her injuries. Appellee filed preliminary objections to the complaint alleging the complaint should have been dismissed. The lower court dismissed appellant's complaint on forum non conveniens grounds. The court affirmed the trial court's order, holding that the law of appellant's domicile governed the case and because there was no significant relationship to the commonwealth that would call for application of its law rather than that of appellant's state of domicile. The court found that dismissal of appellant's complaint should not have rest on forum non conveniens grounds because it resulted in her being unable to bring the action elsewhere. The court concluded that appellant's sole connection with the commonwealth was that appellee was a resident, that certainty, predictability, and uniformity of result would be aided by the application of the law of appellant's state, and that there was no difficulty in the application of that law.</SPAN></P>

His motions for a new trial and an arrest of judgment were denied by the trial court. On appeal, the court affirmed, finding that defendant failed to preserve his attack on the constitutionality of the felony-murder statute for appellate review. The court further found that defendant's sentence of life imprisonment did not constitute cruel and unusual punishment. Finally, the court concluded that the trial court properly denied defendant's demurrer because the evidence was sufficient to establish his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. There was no doubt that there was a conspiratorial design to commit the underlying felony, the robbery of the victim, of which defendant was a part. Defendant was the actor in the initial robbery attempt; he carried the gun used in that attempt; and after the attempt was temporarily thwarted, he engaged in the discussion of continuing the robbery and accompanied others for that purpose. It did not matter whether defendant anticipated that the victim would be killed in furtherance of the conspiracy.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant convict was found guilty, by a jury, of charges of robbery and conspiracy. The incident that led to his arrest occurred when a restaurant was robbed at gunpoint by two men, one of whom wore a ski mask and was subsequently identified as appellant. Appellant argued that the lower court erred in denying a request made by him to be tried without a jury pursuant to Pa. R. Crim. Proc. 1101. The lower court denied the request was denied because 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 5104(c) gave to appellee prosecution a right to jury trial equal to that of a defendant. Appellant also argued that the evidence of photo identifications, the gun seized from his mother's home, and his statement to the police following his arrest, should have been suppressed. The court noted that the statute giving the prosecutor an equal right to a jury trial had been declared unconstitutional by the state supreme court and therefore reversed and remanded for a new trial on this basis alone.

The court affirmed, holding that while 20 Pa. Cons.

Appellant made no incriminating statements when he was first questioned at the police station, two hours after his arrest. When the questioning resumed, appellant confessed to the robbery. At trial, the trial court denied appellant's request to waive a jury trial, which denial was based on 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 5104(c), and refused appellant's motion to suppress his confession. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded for a new trial and held the trial court erred in refusing to accept appellant's waiver of a jury trial because &sect; 5104(c) was unconstitutional because it contradicted Pa. R. Crim. P. 1101, and in denying appellant's motion to suppress his confession because it was the fruit of the illegal arrest. The court found, considering the totality of the circumstances, the warrantless arrest was not based on probable cause because there was no indication that the arresting officer had any reason to believe the informant was a truthful person nor was the officer informed of the basis for the informant's knowledge.</SPAN></P>

The commonwealth objected to the waiver and asserted its right to a jury trial pursuant to Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 42, &sect; 5104 (c). The trial court relied upon &sect; 5104 (c) and denied defendant's motion for a bench trial. A jury found defendant guilty of burglary, theft, and receiving stolen property. Defendant questioned the constitutionality of &sect; 5104 (c), and the court certified the issue to the state supreme court. The state supreme court remanded to the court for proceedings consistent with an opinion in which the same question was certified by the court where the state supreme court held that &sect; 5104 (c) was unconstitutional. The judgment of sentence was reversed and remanded for new trial because the trial court's reliance upon &sect; 5104 (c) constituted error. Further, under rule 1101 the trial court had discretion whether to accept defendant's waiver of his right to a jury trial.

The action never reached trial on the facts, therefore, 62 P.S. &sect; 1409(b)(5) permitted the department to become a party to or to consolidate its action with that of plaintiff.

Along with grounds of prosecutorial misconduct, failure of the trial court to sever, improper cross-examination and closing arguments, they maintained that venue was not proper in Dauphin County because the manipulation happened elsewhere. The court affirmed the convictions, finding their issues to be without merit.

The court declined to address the issue of whether the words &quot;refused or failed to perform parental duties&quot; contained in &sect; 2511(a)(1) were unconstitutionally vague because it had affirmed the trial court's decision on the basis of settled purpose to relinquish parental rights and that finding alone was sufficient to affirm the trial court's order.

On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that &sect; 1009.201 was not unconstitutional on equal protection or due process grounds, because the legislature's limiting of the Act to accidents which occurred in the state and/or accidents in which the victim or vehicle was insured was reasonable and rationally related to the legitimate purposes of the Act.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant juvenile was adjudicated a delinquent. He was found guilty of simple assault, indecent assault, and making terroristic threats. The juvenile probation officer filed a petition for commitment of 90 days pursuant to the Mental Health Procedures Act (act), 50 P.S. &sect; 7406. After an evidentiary hearing the mental health review officer found appellant in need of psychiatric treatment and recommended the petition be granted. The lower court ordered him committed for inpatient psychiatric treatment in the forensic adolescent unit at a state hospital. The issue before the court was one of first impression, whether &sect; 7406 applied to juveniles who had been adjudicated delinquent. The court found that 50 P.S. &sect; 7401(c) referenced the consideration of a child's age in the application of the act's provisions; nowhere else in the statute was there a distinction between adults and juveniles with regard to involuntary examination and treatment. The act gave trial courts broad authority to order examination to aid it in sentencing, or to order involuntary treatment in aid of sentencing, or when the person is severely mentally disabled and in need of treatment. The court affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the order because the lower court had authority to order a mental examination of an adjudicated delinquent to aid it in its final disposition and to order involuntary treatment.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was fined for driving an overweight truck on an interstate, under 75 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. &sect; 4943. Defendant unsuccessfully moved to suppress evidence of his truck's weight, which he asserted was illegally obtained because the Commonwealth had no right to conduct a &quot;spot check&quot; of his vehicle to determine whether it was overweight. The court affirmed. The court held that the arresting officer had probable cause to direct that the weight of the truck be checked. The officer's observations provided him with sufficient cause to order the weight checked as the travelling of a truck such as defendant's at a slow rate of speed up an incline was certainly an indication that the vehicle may have been overweight. Defendant argued that the officer's observations as to defendant's speed were contradicted by defendant in certain aspects. Such factual determinations, however, were for the trial court. Thus, the court held that the officer's training and experience, when coupled with his observation of defendant's speed in relation to other commercial vehicles, provided him with sufficient cause to check the truck for its weight.</SPAN></P>

She appealed and argued that &sect; 5902(a)(1) was overbroad and vague, the evidence was insufficient, prejudicial evidence was admitted, and the trial court erred in its jury charge. The court affirmed and ruled that the statute needed only to convey sufficiently definite warning of the conduct proscribed when measured by common understanding and practices, that prostitution had acquired a traditional meaning of indiscriminate illicit intercourse for hire, and that &sect; 5902(a)(1) was not overbroad or vague. The court ruled that the officer's testimony that he knew defendant previously did not link her to prior crimes and was not prejudicial, and that the trial court correctly refused to charge on issues not raised by the evidence. The court also found that evidence that defendant offered for a price to engage in sexual acts described in words commonly used by prostitutes, accepted the money, and undressed in preparation, was sufficient to prove that she was then engaging in sexual activity as a business, and that actual intercourse was not required.</SPAN></P>

Upon a review of the evidence the court held that there was sufficient evidence to support appellant's convictions. The court held that appellant's contention that the information was improper because it was not manually signed but stamped with a facsimile of a signature was waived, because appellant failed to preserve the allegation of error through the proper pretrial motion. Appellant argued that it was error to have convicted him of having committed crimes with firearms pursuant to 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 6103. The court held that appellant's conviction under &sect; 6103 was in error because &sect; 6103, was not intended to create a separately punishable crime under the Uniform Firearms Act. The court vacated the suspended sentence imposed for the conviction. The court did not remand for resentencing despite the vacated potion of the sentence because the court's action had no effect on the sentences imposed upon those offenses of which appellant was lawfully convicted.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was charged with rape, deviate sexual intercourse, simple assault, and terroristic threats following appellant's encounter with a fellow inmate. The trial court found that evidence of the victim's prior sexual relations with other inmates was inadmissible to impeach the victim's credibility and to imply consent between appellant and the victim. A jury found appellant guilty of all charges, and appellant was sentenced to three-to-six years imprisonment. Appellant alleged that the exclusion of evidence of the victim's prior sexual relations denied his Sixth Amendment right to confrontation. The court affirmed, holding that because appellant offered no special circumstances to outweigh the state's interest in shielding the victim from marginally relevant evidence concerning the victim's prior sexual relations, the Pennsylvania Rape Shield Law, 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. &sect; 3104 was constitutional in its application to appellant's case. The court further held that appellant's contention that the jury charge should have informed the jury that the Pennsylvania Rape Shield Law prevented appellant from introducing evidence of the victim's sexual history was without merit.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested and charged with two counts of robbery. Prior to the trial, defendant filed a motion pursuant to Pa. R. Crim. P. 1101 to waive a trial by jury. The prosecution opposed the request and asserted an absolute right to a jury trial pursuant to 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 5104(c). The trial court denied defendant's motion. He was convicted on both counts of robbery, sentenced to concurrent terms of probation, and fined. The prosecution then filed a motion to modify sentence, requesting that the trial court sentence defendant as a repeat offender. Both the prosecution and defendant appealed. The court reversed and remanded the trial court's judgment, with instructions that if defendant were to resubmit a motion for waiver of a jury trial, the trial court should proceed in accordance with Rule 1101. The court held that, while judicial economy was a concern, the trial court did not have the benefit of a recent holding that &sect; 5104(c) was unconstitutional.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his conviction for making terroristic threats, 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 2706, and harassment, 18 Pa. Cons.

The court held that there was sufficient evidence to convict on section 2706, and that evidence about prior convictions and other incidents was admissible because it was probative of defendant's intent in the present case. However, defendant was improperly convicted of section 2709 because it was not alleged in the information that charged defendant with section 2706. Consequently, defendant, in complete violation of U.S. Const. amend. VI and Pa. Const. art. I, &sect; 9, was convicted of a crime for which he was never formally charged and that was not part of the charged offense. Because defendant's charge of ineffective counsel could not be resolved from the record but may have had merit, the court vacated the conviction as to the harassment, but vacated and remanded on the terroristic threats charge, to determine if there was ineffective counsel.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant corporation appealed an order from the Court of Common Pleas of Dauphin County (Pennsylvania), sustaining defendant employer's demurrer to the corporation's attempt to join the employer in plaintiff employee's negligence suit. Defendant claimed that the employer could be joined in order to determine the proportion of causal negligence attributable to it under the Comparative Negligence Act, 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. &sect; 7102.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff employee was injured in the course of his employment through the negligence of a third party, defendant corporation. Plaintiff sued defendant corporation. Defendant joined defendant employer. Defendant demurred, claiming that it was immune from suit. The trial court sustained the objections. On appeal, the corporation claimed that the employer could be joined as an additional defendant in order to determine the proportion of causal negligence attributable to it under the Comparative Negligence Act, 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. &sect; 7102. Defendant also claimed that an amendment to the Workers' Compensation Act, 77 P.S. 481 was unconstitutional. The appellate court affirmed and held that workers' compensation was the only remedy available to employees against their employers, joinder was improper. Joinder would place the economic burden on the employer to participate in the trial and could lead to an inflated verdict and defeat the purpose of the worker's compensation act. The court found that the amendment was constitutional because the amendment's title gave sufficient notice to third parties that the liability of an employer for damages, contribution, or indemnity had changed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court affirmed the trial court's sustaining of defendant employer's demurrer to defendant corporation's motion to join the employer in plaintiff employer's negligence suit. The court held that because the workers' compensation law was an employee's sole remedy against an employer, and joinder would thwart the purposes of the worker's compensation law, joinder was properly denied.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee beneficiary filed a medical malpractice action against defendant doctors under the Health Care Services Malpractice Act, 40 P.S. &sect; 1301.101 et seq. Appellee received both Medicaid and cash assistance from appellant Pennsylvania Department of Public Welfare, but did not notify it of the pendency of the action. Appellee's medical malpractice claim was settled, and appellant presented a petition to intervene to the trial court. The trial court ordered the settlement monies placed in escrow, and then denied appellant's petition. Appellant sought review, and the court reversed the judgment denying the petition and remanded the case for further proceedings. The court found that 62 P.S. &sect; 1409(b)(1) clearly gave appellant the right to recover the reasonable value of benefits provided to appellee from the defendant doctors. The action never reached trial on the facts, so 62 P.S. &sect; 1409(b)(5) permitted appellant to become a party to or to consolidate its action with that of appellee. The court found that appellee had the duty to notify appellant of her medical malpractice action, and because appellant did not receive notice, its petition should have been granted.</SPAN></P>

The trial court refused to allow evidence that appellant had been drunk on bootleg wine and unable to form the requisite mental intent.

The court affirmed, finding that the legislature acted within permissible constitutional bounds in enacting &sect; 308. Voluntary intoxication was within the control of the actor, and unlike insanity of diminished capacity, did not result from a disease or defect of the mind. The curtailment of the defensive relevance of voluntary intoxication did not run afoul of the equal protection or cruel and unusual punishment clauses.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the conviction because it found that the amendment to the information corrected an error but did not charge an additional or different offense. 42 Pa. Cons. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee ex-husband filed a divorce action against appellant ex-wife in April 1978, and appellant filed against appellee ex-husband in April 1979. In March 1980, appellee ex-husband transferred property to appellee ex-husband's son for no monetary value. The lower court sustained appellees' preliminary objections to set aside the conveyance. On appeal, the court reversed the order. The court ruled that the Divorce Code of Pennsylvania (Code), 23 P.S. &sect; 101 et seq. applied, as appellant made application to proceed under the Code, and appellees made no opposition. 23 P.S. &sect; 403(d) authorized a nullification of any disposition of property by appellee ex-husband to appellee ex-husband's son, because the son had notice of the pending divorce and paid a wholly inadequate consideration for the property. The court found that the parties' situation must have been considered as it existed up to the date of the first divorce filing, when appellee ex-husband still owned the property. The court further found that such a retroactive application was constitutional as a proper exercise of the legislature's police power in providing for the distribution of property upon divorce.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the order that sustained preliminary objections by appellees, ex-husband and son, because the property conveyed between appellees was for no monetary consideration, occurred almost two years after appellee ex-husband filed for divorce and eleven months after appellant filed her divorce action, and property acquired during the marriage was classified as marital property for equitable distribution purposes.</SPAN></P>

The suits were all dismissed. Defendant was then charged with misdemeanor barratry, 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 5109, which prohibited vexing others with unjust and vexatious suits. The jury found her guilty and she was sentenced to six to 12 months in jail. Defendant appealed. In affirming, the court ruled that &sect; 5109, which restated the common law standard for barratry, was not void for vagueness under the Due Process Clause of U.S. Const. amend. XIV. The statute was sufficiently specific in light of defendant's particular conduct and it contained a standard sufficiently normative to inform defendant that her conduct was in violation thereof. Moreover, the evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to the commonwealth, was sufficient for the jury to find beyond a reasonable doubt that her suits were unjust and in most cases entirely groundless.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The barratry conviction was affirmed because it was supported by sufficient evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to the commonwealth, that the suits which defendant caused to be filed were unjust, and because the barratry statute, which embodied common law norms, was not unconstitutionally vague, but gave defendant adequate notice that her conduct was in violation thereof.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Subsequent to being convicted of homicide by vehicle and driving while under the influence of alcohol, defendant argued that the homicide by vehicle statute was unconstitutional and contrary to common law and that the trial court erred in admitting evidence of a blood-alcohol test. Relying on its prior case law, the court first held that the homicide by vehicle statute,&nbsp;75 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 3732, was constitutionally valid and did not violate common law. The court then held that the error, if any, was harmless in failing to advise defendant of her right to a breath test prior to testing a blood sample to determine whether defendant was intoxicated. In so holding, the court noted that the test in the case at issue was performed on a sample of blood previously taken from defendant and did not require an additional invasion of defendant's body. The court then held that defendant effectively waived her Miranda rights prior to giving a statement to police because defendant was aware of the criminal transaction the police were investigating. Thus, the court affirmed the conviction.</SPAN></P>

Appellees contended that summary judgment was appropriate because the statute of limitations had run. The court stated that in the application of the discovery rule, three independent phases of knowledge must have been known or knowable to appellant before the limitation period commenced. The court stated that appellant knew of the injuries to her son and the operative cause of the injuries shortly after his birth. The court stated that the record did not demonstrate whether appellant had knowledge of the causative relationship between the injury and the operative conduct phase until she filed suit 14 years after her son's birth. The court held that the question of whether appellant was reasonable when she failed to discover the injury prior to the running of the period of limitation was a jury question.

During the first year of his life, appellant cared for the child while living at home with her parents. The state, acting parens patriae, found appellant to be a delinquent. An incident took place wherein the appellant's parents found the child outside and unconscious. The child was placed in foster care and a caseworker began to see appellant. Appellant testified as to her efforts to comply with goals she had set with the caseworker. The evidence showed that appellant regularly visited the child.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was charged with the misdemeanor of driving while under the influence of alcohol and the summary offense of fleeing or attempting to elude a police officer. The summary charge was withdrawn. Appellant waived his right to a preliminary hearing on the drunken driving charge. Appellant sought to quash the information on the misdemeanor, contending that the subsequent prosecution was barred by 18 Pa. Cons. Stat.

Despite notice of the appeal, the trial court found appellant guilty of the misdemeanor. On appeal, the court affirmed the denial of appellant's motion to quash. The court held that the discharge of the summary offense was not tantamount to an acquittal because there was never a prosecution that resulted in a finding of not guilty or a determination that there was insufficient evidence to warrant a conviction and that, therefore, &sect; 110 was inapplicable.

The court vacated the conviction, holding that under the retail theft statute,&nbsp;&sect; 3929(b), shoplifting convictions under the 1939 Penal Code were inapplicable to increase the grade of offense. The court found there was no legislative intent to include shoplifting under the 1939 Penal Code within the meaning of &quot;retail theft&quot; in &sect; 3929(b), even though the definitions of the crimes were similar, where the statute failed to expressly include them. The court concluded that only prior retail theft convictions under the Crimes Code were intended to increase the grade of a retail theft offense under &sect; 3929(b). Because in this case only prior shoplifting offenses under the 1939 Penal Code were introduced to increase the grade of appellant's offense, the court vacated his conviction and remanded for resentencing on retail theft as a summary offense under 18 Pa.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee husband's mother transferred to appellee and appellant wife, as entireties property, a total undivided interest of 40 percent in her farm. After appellee and appellant were divorced, appellee filed a complaint that sought to partition the entireties property. The trial court ordered that the 40 percent interest be partitioned. The court affirmed. The court held that the Act of May 10, 1927, 68 P.S. &sect; 503, under which the property was to be partitioned, was not unconstitutional because it treated divorced tenants in common differently from other tenants in common. The court stated that the legislature could accord to people placed into different classes different treatment as long as the basis for the different treatment was related to the objective of the statute. The court stated that such classification had to be reasonable and rest on a distinction that had a fair and substantial relationship to the objet of the legislation. The court held that the Act's purpose was to provide for a ready, uncomplicated method of achieving some sense of economic justice upon dissolution of a marriage. The court found that the Act was a reasonable method of achieving such purpose.</SPAN></P>

After the supreme court ruled that the section of the Health Care Services Malpractice Act which gave health care arbitration panels original exclusive jurisdiction over medical malpractice claims was unconstitutional, an appellee transferred jurisdiction to the trial court. Appellants filed a second action in the trial court for trespass against all appellees and for breach of warranty against corporate appellees. After a hearing the trial court dismissed the second action on the grounds that the two actions were identical, and appellants sought review. The court was unable to form an opinion from mere assertions as to whether the parties, causes of action, and relief sought were the same in both actions, and remanded to the trial court either for an insertion into the record of the pleadings in the first action or for an opinion describing with specificity where the identity of the elements was found.

The court rejected defendant's claim that the homicide by vehicle statute was unconstitutional because it presented the possibility of a prison term without a finding of culpability. The court noted that under the crime of homicide by vehicle, the commonwealth was required to show only that defendant knew, or should have known, that he engaged in the conduct claimed to be in violation of &sect; 3732, and that, at the very least, death was a probable consequence of the conduct.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant mother sought review of an order entered by the Court of Common Pleas of Lebanon County (Pennsylvania), which granted appellee putative father judgment on the pleadings because the trial court found that appellant's paternity action was barred by the statute of limitations.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant mother filed a complaint against appellee putative father, which alleged that he was the father of her son, more than six years after the child's birth. The complaint also alleged that appellee had provided funds for the purchase of a bicycle and that her son had also received money from appellee on his most recent birthday. The trial court granted appellee's motion for judgment on the pleading because it found that the action was barred by the statute of limitations. On appeal, that order was reversed. Under 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 6704(e), all paternity actions had to be filed within six years of a child's birth, unless the putative father had voluntarily contributed support. In that case, the matter had to be commenced within two years of the receipt of the support. However, the circumstances that surrounded any contribution had to establish that it amounted to an acknowledgement of paternity. Under the former statute, 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 4323(b), which was replaced by &sect; 6704(e), a single contribution of $ 10 had been held sufficient to meet this burden.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of criminal attempt to commit rape and indecent assault in one case, and in another was convicted of simple assault by a prisoner. Both cases were consolidated for appeal. The court affirmed appellant's sentence for the simple assault charge because the term was within the statutory limits. The court held that there was no evidence of actual prejudice nor was the pre-trial publicity so extensive that it justified a presumption of prejudice. It was not error for the trial court to have denied appellant's motion for change of venue. The court found that appellee commonwealth had violated Pa. R. Crim. P. 305b(1)(b) when it did not turn over inculpatory evidence to appellant. The trial court's remedy, which allowed appellant a suppression hearing, was adequate and was not an abuse of discretion. Under Pa. R. Crim. P 305E the trial court had discretion in choosing an appropriate remedy. There was sufficient evidence that sustained the guilty verdict for attempted rape. The victim testified that appellant told he was going to rape her, pushed her down, hit her, and covered her head with a shirt.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury convicted defendant of retail theft under 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 3929. The trial court denied defendant's post-trial motions and sentenced him to serve one to two years in prison. On appeal, the court vacated the judgment and remanded the case for resentencing. The court held that the trial court erred in failing to place on the record, as required, its reasons for imposing the sentence it did. The case was remanded to afford the trial court an opportunity to resentence defendant in accordance with the sentencing code and to include a statement of reasons for the sentence imposed. The court found that &sect; 3929, which created a presumption that any person who intentionally concealed unpurchased property intended to deprive the merchant, was not unconstitutional because it satisfied the reasonable doubt standard. The evidence clearly showed beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant removed items from the store, intending to deprive the store of it, and such intent followed beyond a reasonable doubt from defendant's behavior in concealing the items.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury convicted appellant of homicide by vehicle. Subsequently, the lower court denied appellant's motions for a new trial and in arrest of judgment. Thereafter, appellant was sentenced to imprisonment for a period of 6 to 12 months. Appellant sought review, claiming that the Pennsylvania Motor Vehicle Code, 75 Pa. Cons. &sect; 3732 was unconstitutional. Further, appellant claimed that the lower court erred by interrogating her at the sentencing hearing concerning the assertion of her constitutional right to remain silent, and to thereafter rely on her silence as the basis of its sentence of imprisonment. The court affirmed the conviction, but remanded the matter for resentencing. The court found that the lower court's charge required the commonwealth to sustain a stricter burden of proof. Further, the court found that appellant was entitled to assert her privilege against self-incrimination and the lower court could not expressly penalize her for so doing. The lower court should not have relied on appellant's silence as the basis of the sentence imposed. Thus, the lower court improperly penalized appellant for asserting her constitutional right against self-incrimination.</SPAN></P>

The trial court granted defendants' motion for summary judgment. On appeal, the court held that under 40 P.S. &sect; 1009.301(a)(5)(B), defendants were not liable unless appellants' medical bills exceeded $ 750, but that diagnostic X-rays and rehabilitation costs in excess of $ 100 were not included in calculating the $ 750 threshold. After examining the purposes and definitions of the Act in 40 P.S. &sect;&sect; 1009.102 and 1009.103, the court held that plaintiff wife's dynamic cerebral was a diagnostic tool using X-rays, and that plaintiff wife's physical therapy was for rehabilitation because it was not part of the treatment from an independent practicing professional, or part of her professional nursing care or hospitalization. Thus, the dynamic cerebral and physical therapy costs over $ 100 was excluded. Therefore, because plaintiffs' expenses were below the &sect;750 threshold, defendants were entitled to summary judgment and the court affirmed the order.</SPAN></P>

The trial court sentenced appellant to two concurrent terms of six to 23 months incarceration. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment of sentence. Appellant's prosecution was not time barred, the court held, because Pa. Stat.

The court rejected appellant's challenge to the bribery statute,&nbsp;&sect; 4701(a)(3), finding that its prohibition against a public servant's contravention of a &quot;known legal duty&quot; was not unconstitutionally vague as applied to appellant. Despite instructions from his supervisor, the court noted, appellant not only allowed the unlawful activity for remuneration, but also used a bulldozer to cover the wastes and shared his dishonest profits with other city employees to prevent their reporting the illegal dumpings.</SPAN></P>

The trial court imposed a sentence of life imprisonment after accepting appellant's plea.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant driver was operating a vehicle that struck appellee injured party, who was trying to push a disabled car, causing appellee serious injury. Appellee filed suit, and the jury rendered a verdict against appellant. The trial court then assessed delay damages against appellant pursuant to Pa. R. Civ. P. 238, and appellant challenged this ruling on appeal. The court affirmed and held that appellant neither raised the issue of the constitutionality of Rule 238 in the trial court nor notified the court administrator of Pennsylvania of his constitutional challenge to the rule as required by Pa. R. App. P. 522. Therefore, the court held that appellant had waived the issue. The court also pointed out that the Pennsylvania Supreme Court had already found Rule 238 constitutional and not a violation of due process or equal protection as guaranteed by the Pennsylvania and United States Constitutions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's assessment of delay damages against appellant driver in a personal injury suit brought by appellee injured party because appellant failed to raise the issue of the constitutionality of such assessment at trial and also failed to notify the court administrator of his challenge.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The lower court convicted defendant of theft by deception, receiving stolen property, misapplication of government property, tampering with witnesses, and criminal conspiracy. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that the lower court did not err in denying defendant's motion to dismiss the charges because 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. &sect; 108(c)(2) (repealed) provided an exception to the statute of limitations whenever the public officer or employee had continuously occupied any office or employment. The lower court did not err in admitting evidence of other crimes as there was no prejudice. The lower court properly instructed the jury not to consider the consequences to defendant if they returned a guilty verdict. The jury charge covered the requested point regarding other alleged accomplice-witnesses. The trial court did not err in refusing to charge the jury that lack of force was not an element of the misdemeanor of witness tampering because the instruction would have created confusion. The trial court's procedure in reading to the jury the statutory definition of misapplication of government property was sufficient to place the issue of intent properly before the jury.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, injured, was crossing the street on foot when an automobile struck her. Appellee insurance company refused to compensate appellant under the Pennsylvania No-fault Motor Vehicle Insurance Act (Act), 40 P.

Appellant, a self-employed florist and had shown no income in her newly opened business. The court held that strict application of the formula set forth in &sect; 205(a) did not permit appellant to recoup a reasonable amount of work loss, and caused an absurd and unreasonable result. The court held that insurance statutes were not designated by the legislature as requiring strict construction. The court held that in suffering a deficit from her newly opened business appellant was an individual &quot;who has not previously earned income from work.&quot; The court reversed and remanded holding that her probable income could have been determined in accordance with the formula appearing in &sect; 205(d), subsection (c). Thus, the question of appellant's work loss benefits should have gone to the jury as a triable issue of fact, and the granting of a summary judgment was incorrect.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee District Attorney of Cambria County filed a complaint in equity under the injunction provision of the anti-obscenity statute,&nbsp;18 Pa.

Appellants alleged that there was insufficient evidence to submit the matter to the jury because appellee presented no evidence concerning the community standard of the element of the offense. The court held that the materials themselves were sufficient evidence for the jury to determine whether the average person would find that the materials appealed to prurient interest. Appellants alleged that appellee's remarks to the jury were improper because they had inherently religious implications. The court held that any error was cured because the trial court specifically instructed the jury to ignore their personal religious and moral beliefs. Because the court modified the injunction to encompass only those materials actually found to be obscene by the jury, it did not consider appellants' allegations that the injunction was vague and overbroad.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant driver challenged an order by the Allegheny County Court of Common Pleas (Pennsylvania), which denied his motion to quash the appeal from an arbitration award filed by appellees, car driver and car owner. Appellant claimed that appellees were forbidden from filing an appeal from arbitration because they failed to comply with Pa. R. App. P. 1701(b)(3), and, thus, their appeal was not timely filed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant driver crashed into a car that was driven by appellee car driver and was owned by appellee car owner. The arbitrators found in favor of appellant, and appellees filed a motion asking the lower court to forego payment of the appeal bond asserting that requiring payment before appeal chilled their constitutional right to a jury trial. The lower court denied the motion, and appellees then filed an appeal and bond. Appellant claimed that the filing of a motion contesting the bond amount had not tolled the time requirements in Pa. R. App. P. 1701(b)(3) and that appellees were estopped from filing the appeal. The court held that appellees were not allowed any additional time for perfecting an appeal. In addition, it said that the clock continued to run pursuant to Pa. R. App. P. 1701(b)(3) while they filed their motions. However, the court also held that the general rule was inapplicable because the motion challenged the very appeal procedure itself and not the lower court's order per se. The court reasoned that appellees' belief that once the fee was paid, they would forever lose their ability to challenge the constitutionality of the rule, was a reasonable one.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed. It concluded that appellees, car driver and car owner, could proceed with their appeal and trial de novo. The court reasoned that because appellees thought that if they paid that appeal bond they would be waiving any right to challenge it later, they were excused from strict compliance with the court rule regarding perfecting an appeal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant motorist sought review of an order entered by the Court of Common Pleas of Delaware County (Pennsylvania), which granted appellee driver's motion for judgment on the pleadings in appellant's action to recover damages resulting from a motor vehicle accident.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant motorist was injured when appellee driver crashed his car into hers. Over two years after the accident, appellant filed suit against appellee to recover damages, including the medical expenses she incurred as a result of the accident. The trial court granted appellee's motion for judgment on the pleadings, finding that appellant's claim was barred by the two year statute of limitations of the No-fault Motor Vehicle Insurance Act (Act), 40 P.S. 1009.101 et seq., as appellant did not file suit within two years of the accident. The court reversed, concluding that the limitations period of the Act did not begin to run until the claimant knew or by the exercise of reasonable diligence should have known that one of the threshold conditions for filing suit, as set forth in &sect; 301(a) of the Act, had been reached. The court thus remanded the matter to the trial court for consideration of whether appellant filed suit within two years after she knew or should have known that her medical expenses would exceed $ 750, which was the &sect; 301 (a) threshold condition plaintiff sought to establish in her pleadings.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the order granting appellee driver's motion for judgment on the pleadings because the two year limitations period of the no-fault act began to run not on the date of the accident, but on the date on which appellant motorist knew or should have known that one of the threshold conditions for filing suit under the act had been reached. The court remanded the matter for consideration of whether appellant timely filed suit.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The commonwealth filed appeals from orders of the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County (Pennsylvania), in which a juvenile court judge sua sponte granted an injunction to cease use of Philadelphia Police Department Directive 95 and granted motions to expunge two juvenile defendants' records, and other juveniles sought review of a judge's order, sitting in equity, which refused to enjoin the directive and grant them class certification.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">This case consolidated appeals involving the legality of Philadelphia Police Department Directive 95, which directed the fingerprinting and photographing of juvenile arrestees over age 15. The commonwealth appealed a juvenile court judge's orders that granted motions to expunge two juvenile defendants' records that were made under the directive and that granted an injunction to cease use of the directive. Other juveniles sought review of a judge's order, sitting in equity, which refused to enjoin the directive and grant them class certification. After the appeals were filed, legislation was enacted that specifically authorized the fingerprinting and photographing of juveniles. The court found that the appeals were not entirely moot and reversed the sua sponte injunction order because it effected class-wide relief after the lower court properly denied class certification. The court also reversed the expungement order because that remedy was not available to the two juvenile defendants who were adjudicated delinquent. The court affirmed the order that denied the injunction and refused class certification because the cases were fact-specific and did not represent a class.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the juvenile court's orders that enjoined the police directive and expunged records made under it, and concluded that the injunction improperly mandated class-wide relief after class certification was denied, and that expungement was not available to juveniles who were found delinquent. The court affirmed the order that denied class certification and injunctive relief because the cases did not represent a class of arrestees.</SPAN></P>

On review, the issue was whether the trial court had personal jurisdiction over appellant. The court affirmed, holding that 42 Pa. Cons.

Appellee natural parents changed their minds about consenting to such adoption. The trial courts held that, as an adoption case, the only issue was whether the record indicated any reason why appellees' interests as mother and father of the child should have been involuntarily terminated. In a consolidated action from two separate trial courts, it was determined that no such reason existed, and appellants were ordered to return the child to appellees. Pursuant to the Adoption Act, 1 P.S. &sect; 414, consent to an adoption was required of parents of an adoptee who had not reached the age of 18 years. Consent of the parents was not required if a decree of termination with regard to such parents had been entered. The court held that consent to an adoption by the natural parents could have been withdrawn at any time before entry of the final decree of adoption.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of a judgment of sentence from the Court of Common Pleas of Cumberland County (Pennsylvania), which found appellant guilty of willful non-support of his minor son.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of willful non-support of his minor son. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment of sentence and held that the evidence was sufficient to enable the fact finder to infer a willful refusal by appellant to support his son due to the fact that appellant had worked during the period that he did not make support payments. The court also held that the officer's destruction of his notes was not a suppression of the evidence by the commonwealth and did not render his testimony incompetent. The notes were used to produce an office memorandum, which the officer could have used to refresh his recollection, and which was made available for inspection by defense counsel. The court also held that the statute appellant was charged under, Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 18, &sect; 4321(a), was not violative of the Equal Rights Amendment of the state constitution, Pa. Const. art. I, &sect; 28. Under Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 1, &sect; 2301(a), where statutes were enacted where there was a designation restricted to a single sex, the references to a single sex was deemed applicable to both sexes. Thus, Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 18, &sect; 4321(a) applied to both parents, and appellant's argument failed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that the evidence was sufficient to enable the fact finder to infer a willful refusal by appellant to support his son.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of a judgment of sentence of the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County (Pennsylvania), for prostitution under 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 5902(a) and criminal conspiracy under 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 903(a)(1). The trial court denied defendant's petition for a mistrial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of prostitution, under 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 5902(a), and criminal conspiracy under 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 903(a)(1). On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment and disposed of several of her allegations regarding the constitutionality of 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 5902 because of lack of standing. She was charged with violating 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 5902(a)(1) in that she engaged in sexual activity as a business, and thus only had standing to object to the constitutionality of that section. She did have standing to argue that the term &quot;sexual activity as a business&quot; in &sect; 5902(a)(1) was too vague, but the court found no merit in the argument, because it provided a person of ordinary intelligence with fair notice of the type of conduct proscribed. The court held that &sect; 5902(a) did not violate defendant's right to privacy, as the proscribed activity was a commercial activity, and that the statute was rationally related to a valid state interest. Where an officer's statement regarding investigating criminal activities did not give the jury any basis for inferring that he had investigated defendant on a prior date, the motion for the mistrial was correctly denied.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of sentence for prostitution and criminal conspiracy. The court concluded that all the state was required to show was that the prohibition of prostitution was rationally related to a valid state interest, as it did not affect defendant's right to privacy. Defendant's motion for a mistrial was properly denied, and as there was not basis for the jury to infer that appellant had engaged in prior criminal activity.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the word &quot;terrorize&quot; did describe a category of activity with the requisite precision to place defendant on notice as to what conduct was proscribed by the statute. The court disagreed with defendant's claim that the commonwealth failed to produce evidence to the effect that he possessed the requisite intent to put the victim into a state of extreme fear or fear which agitated the body and mind. The court found that the record indicated the terror of the victim and described the defendant's demeanor as worse than a mad animal. The court held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to grant a mistrial, because the commonwealth had a sufficient interest in the welfare of its citizens so as to enable it to proscribe defendant from making terroristic threats to others.</SPAN></P>

Both girls were placed with their maternal aunt and appellant continued to maintain regular contact with the children. After she underwent psychiatric care and counseling appellant filed a petition for a hearing to regain custody. The lower court denied the petition based on testimony from an unidentified witness about appellant's relationship with a same-sex partner. Appellant sought review, alleging that she was denied the right to confront the witness. On appeal, the court reversed the lower court's decision because appellant was deprived of due process by the admission of hearsay into evidence. The court found that the information furnished by the unidentified witness was critical to the court's final determination and appellant should have been afforded an opportunity to confront the witness. The court held that a portion of 42 Pa. Cons. Stat.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged the order of the Court of Common Pleas of Montgomery County (Pennsylvania), which dismissed his pretrial motion to quash criminal informations. He argued that, because the trial court had dismissed a summary charge due to the Commonwealth's failure to make a prima facie case, double jeopardy, and/or collateral estoppel, and/or 18 Pa. Cons.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged the order of the trial court, which dismissed his pretrial motion to quash criminal informations. On appeal, the court held that the trial court's dismissal of a reckless driving charge constituted an acquittal. However, under 75 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 3732, reckless driving was not a necessary element of the crime of homicide by vehicle. The second element of that offense was met if it was established that defendant violated any law of the Commonwealth or municipal ordinance pertaining to the use of a vehicle or to the regulation of traffic. Proving a speeding charge against defendant would not involve relitigation of the reckless driving charge, so neither double jeopardy nor collateral estoppel barred the prosecution. Section 3732 did not require a showing of reckless or negligent culpability on defendant's part in order to sustain a conviction. Because the other offenses with which defendant was charged required proof of facts not common to reckless driving and each offense was designed to prevent a substantially different harm or evil, neither 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 110, nor a case decided under that statute, barred the prosecutions. The court affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the denial of defendant's motion to quash. The dismissal of the reckless driving offense constituted an acquittal on that charge.

Defendant's other charges required proof of different facts not common to reckless driving, so the statute did not bar the prosecutions.</SPAN></P>

When appellant arrived at the station and became aware that he might be criminally involved, he volunteered to make a statement in the presence of his lawyer. No statement was taken from appellant until he was fully advised of his Miranda rights. Prior to trial, a judge denied appellant's motion to suppress, finding that the statement was voluntary and was not the product of any coercion resulting from the passing reference to the City Charter provision. The statement was used during the trial and appellant was found guilty of simple assault, aggravated assault, criminal conspiracy, and possession of an instrument of crime and was sentenced to four years probation. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that the statement was voluntary and thus was not suppressible, the state established appellant's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, and the impeachment by prior inconsistent statements and rebuttal were proper.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant insurer sought review of the order of judgment by default entered as a sanction under local court rule, Phila. Ct. R. Civ. P. 145, for appellant's failure to answer interrogatories propounded in appellee beneficiary's action in assumpsit to recover the proceeds of decedent's insurance policy. The court affirmed the order. The court held that local Rule 145 conflicted with Pa. R. Civ. P. 4019 and was invalid. Therefore, the Prothonotary lacked the power to enter a judgment by default against appellee, and the judgment was null and void. The court held that Pa. R. Civ. P. 4019 established a mandatory procedure. Where answers to interrogatories had not been filed, a motion had to be presented to the trial court to determine the default. However, under local Rule 145 no such motion was required. Because of the conflict, the local rule could not stand.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of theft by deception in violation of 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 3922. The court affirmed, finding that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to declare a mistrial due to the prosecution's remarks. The court held that &sect; 3922 was not void for vagueness because the statute gave a person of ordinary intelligence notice that his conduct was forbidden, and because the wording of the statute did not encourage the police and the courts to exercise unfettered discretion. The court further found that defendant's pre-arrest delay of 66 days did not result in any prejudice to defendant and was not sufficient to constitute a denial of due process. The court also determined that the trial court did not err in refusing to give a requested jury instruction as the trial court correctly stated the jury's role in judging a witness' credibility. Finally, the court determined that the trial court properly refused to suppress identifications because the photographic array used was free from impermissible suggestiveness, and, under the totality of the circumstances, the identification of defendant was reliable.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A school bus owned by defendant corporation and operated by one of its employees ran over and killed a child who had just gotten off the bus. After defendant was charged with homicide by vehicle, it filed a motion to quash the information against it. The lower court granted defendant's motion to quash, but did not rule on defendant's grounds for the motion, instead holding, sua sponte, that the information issued against defendant was insufficient. The commonwealth appealed. On appeal, the court found that it was error for the trial court to quash the information, sua sponte, as insufficient. The court reversed. The court held that homicide by a vehicle may be committed by &quot;any person who unintentionally caused the death of another person&quot; and that the definition of &quot;person&quot; included a corporation, thus concluding that the defendant could be charged with homicide by vehicle. The court also concluded that the fact that the legislature may have inadvertently failed to provide suitable punishment for the offense when committed by a corporation would not excuse the wrongdoer from prosecution just because it happened to be a corporation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant father was ordered to pay child support for two children that he fathered although out of wedlock. The order was entered and it required payment until the children reached the age of 16 years. However, appellee mother obtained an order extending support obligation under 18 Pa. Crim. Stat. &sect; 4323. The court held that the purpose of the criminal act was to impose the obligation to support children born out of wedlock, converting a moral duty into a legal obligation to provide support until the child's 16th birthday. The court held that no special circumstances existed to warrant the extension, and reversed that order under the criminal code. Appellant claimed the statute of limitation barred any further suit as it required commencement within six years of the birth of the children, or acknowledgement of paternity. The court said that because appellant had pled guilty to bastardy and continually paid support monthly since that time, the statute of limitations had not run, and that he had acknowledged paternity.</SPAN></P>

Appellant filed a timely petition to appeal the arbitration award in forma pauperis wherein he alleged that he did not have the necessary funds to pay the security and fees required for appeal. The trial court denied the petition under 5 Pa. Stat. &sect; 72 without a hearing because appellant did not allege that he was impoverished. The court reversed, holding that the absence of a specific allegation &quot;of poverty&quot; was not fatal, and that appellant was entitled to an evidentiary hearing at which time he would have the affirmative burden of proving not only his present inability to pay the appeal costs but also his poverty. The court held that as a condition precedent to the trial court's denial of appellant's petition to proceed in forma pauperis, the trial court was required by section 72 to conduct a hearing.</SPAN></P>

The court disagreed, finding that &sect; 3732 had recently been declared constitutional by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court. However, the court noted that counsel who made the claims of ineffectiveness came from the same public defenders office as trial counsel. At issue was whether a member of the same public defender's office as trial counsel could have raised the issue of ineffective assistance of counsel where it was not obvious that trial counsel was ineffective. The court found that, if a genuine issue of effectiveness of trial counsel existed, then the public defender should have requested the trial court to appoint appellate counsel who was not a member of the public defender's office. The best interest of defendant was not served where his counsel had to establish that an associate from his own office acted in an incompetent manner at trial.</SPAN></P>

The court also concluded that &sect; 5122(a)(3) was not unconstitutional despite defendant's assertion that the language of the statute did not state precisely what was meant by &quot;under his control.&quot; The court held that the fact that the legislature could have chosen clear and more precise language equally capable of achieving the end which it sought did not mean that the statute was unconstitutionally vague. The court further held that &sect; 5122(a)(3) gave adequate notice to a person of ordinary intelligence that the conduct which formed the basis of the charge was forbidden by statute and, thus, was constitutional under the due process standard.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The commonwealth appealed from an order suppressing evidence discovered in a warrantless search of a public bathroom stall. As a result of the search, defendants were charged with violations of Voluntary Deviate Sexual Intercourse statute,&nbsp;18 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. &sect; 3124. The court found that subsequent to the filing of the appeal, that statute was found to be unconstitutional. Additionally, the court found that the suppression issue raised by the commonwealth was moot, and an appeal could not lie. Accordingly, the commonwealth's appeal was dismissed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The commonwealth's appeal of the trial court's suppression of evidence was dismissed because the suppression issue was moot as the statute upon which defendants were charged had been deemed unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
