<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Although he did not represent himself as an attorney, defendant performed legal research, drafted pleadings, and performed other such legal work for his clients. The State demonstrated that he had poorly represented some of his clients and acted unethically. Defendant appealed his conviction and on review, the court affirmed. The court held that Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 2.48.180, which prohibited the unlawful practice of law, was not unconstitutionally vague, that the evidence was sufficient to convict him on the theft and collection agency counts, and that the jury instructions related to the unlawful practice of law charges were not erroneous. The court found that the nature and character of the services he performed, which included preparing forms and interceding during a hearing, were in clear violation of the law, which prohibited an unlicensed person from conducting such activities. The Due Process Clauses of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments, &sect; 2.48.180, and the phrase &quot;practice law&quot; were sufficiently defined to prevent inordinately arbitrary enforcement. Further, the definition of the challenged phrase allowed an ordinary person to know that &sect; 2.48.180 proscribed his conduct.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Subsequent to his conviction for brandishing a weapon, defendant appealed. The court affirmed and held that the restriction in Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.41.270 on the right to bear arms was not unconstitutional. The statute minimally restricted the rights of the individual, it was narrowly drawn, and it promoted a substantial public interest. The public interest in security outweighed the individual's interest in carrying weapons under circumstances that warranted alarm in others. The court found that the statute was not unconstitutionally vague because it applied only to conduct that posed a threat to others and found that the statute was sufficiently definite to provide defendants with adequate notice of prohibited conduct and provide adequate enforcement standards. Because any reasonable person would feel alarmed upon seeing, on a residential street at night, a man carrying a visibly loaded assault rifle in an assaultive manner, defendant's conduct fell within the statute's constitutional core. The court rejected the claim that the statute was overbroad because the restriction on self-defense was minimal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner was charged with second-degree rape and found to be incompetent to stand trial. The trial court ordered three 180-day commitments, the last one based on petitioner being in custody and committing a felony. He was transferred to the SCC. The state initiated further civil commitment proceedings and the petitioner was granted a stay pending the outcome of the appeal. The petitioner was no longer detained under any action taken by the trial court that had originally committed him and Wash. R. App. P. 16.4 precluded a direct challenge to that decision.  Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 71.05.320(2) provided that confinement for further treatment could be supported by the satisfaction of any subsection. The jury finding that the petitioner should be recommitted under subsections (c) and (d) was well supported by new evidence in the record. The trial court did prove that the petitioner was incompetent to stand trial. Ample evidence supported the petitioner's continued commitment including his pedophilia and sexual aggression problems.  Wash Rev. Code &sect; 71.05.020(17) did not forbid placement in the SCC because it was not a correctional institution. The court affirmed the petitioners' commitment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a consolidated appeal, the court reviewed (1) the claim of petitioner, the State of Washington, that the superior court erred in finding that Wash.

Code &sect; 46.37.530(1)(c) was unconstitutional and (2) respondent driver's claim that that section was unconstitutionally vague and failed to include specific regulations to determine whether he was in compliance with the provision allowing his use of a motorcycle roll bar and seat belt.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In two consolidated cases, the court reviewed lower court decisions challenging the validity of &sect; 46.37.530(1)(c). In the first matter involving two , the State contended that the lower court erred in finding that the cited provision of the Washington Head Injury Prevention Act was unconstitutionally burdensome and confusing. The court on appeal affirmed the lower court's decision based on its determination that the statute failed to provide two motorcycle drivers with fair notice to allow them to determine which protective helmets did meet the minimal safety requirements and also failed to provide citizens with the fair notice required by due process guarantees. In the second action brought by a city, the driver challenged the validity of the same section because no regulation had been adopted providing the minimum standards for a motorcycle operator's use of a roll bar and seat belt instead of a protective helmet. The court in the latter matter determined that, in the absence of administrative adoption of specific standards, the driver was entitled to the benefit of his good faith effort to comply with the law by having roll bars on his motorcycle.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court dismissed the charges against the first two motorcycle drivers and reversed the judgment against the third driver, who had used a roll bar and seat belt in lieu of a protective helmet.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the civic organization claimed that the trial court erred in denying its request for a writ of mandamus, and that the board should have been compelled to hold a public hearing and then vote on the proposed ordinance. The court held that Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 36.70, by its terms, delegated the power to zone to the board's legislative authority.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The dissolution court found that the divorce rendered the former wife ineligible for the death benefits of her former husband, a city firefighter. The former wife sought a declaration that the death benefit provisions of &sect;&sect; 41.26.030(6) and 41.26.160 were discriminatory because the class of retired LEOFF members was predominantly male and the class of former spouses adversely impacted by the provisions was disproportionately female. The former wife appealed the order granting the department's motion for summary judgment and denying her motion. The court held that the surviving spouse was not entitled to judicial notice of the imbalance of LEOFF membership but presented a justiciable controversy of substantial public interest, which was not rendered moot by amendments to the definition of a surviving spouse. The court reversed because the provisions violated due process by depriving the former wife of her property interest in her community contribution to the LEOFF fund without prior notice or opportunity to challenge the deprivation. The court held that the provisions did not violate the Equal Rights Amendment and were rationally related to protecting the limited fund.</SPAN></P>

Four aggravating factors, which consisted of multiple incidents or injuries, deliberate cruelty, future dangerousness, and the atypicality of the conduct, were considered in sentencing. After an appeal, the case was remanded for resentencing because of the determination that future dangerousness could not be considered. Defendant was resentenced, and he appealed. The court affirmed the conviction for malicious harassment, but the sentence was reversed because the offense was complete when the victim exited his vehicle. Accordingly, the aggravating factors could not be used to enhance that charge. However, defendant's First Amendment rights were not violated because his selection of a victim on the basis of a particular characteristic was behavior, not speech.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant voters sought review of a judgment from Superior Court, Pierce County (Washington), which found for respondents, Pierce County and its auditor, in the voters' action for a declaratory judgment and writ of mandamus respecting the adoption of Pierce County, Wash., Code Ordinance 91-74S, and the referendum provisions to rescind a car tax, Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 82.80.090.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">&nbsp;Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 82.80.020 authorized counties to adopt a $ 15 vehicle fee. By Pierce County, Wash., Code Ordinance 91-74S, the county enacted the fee, and provided that the normal referendum provisions, contained in Pierce County, Wash., Charter &sect; 5.70, would not apply to the rescission of the ordinance. Instead, rescission of the ordinance was governed by Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 82.80.090, which placed a very onerous burden on a petitioner to collect a lot of signatures in a very short time frame to have the referendum provision qualify for the ballot. In affirming the judgment, the court held that &sect; 82.80.090, being state law, trumped any contrary &quot;Home Rule&quot; charter provisions. Thus because &sect; 82.80.090 by its terms was the exclusive method for subjecting any county ordinance imposing a tax or fee under &sect; 82.80.020 to a referendum vote, the issue was concluded against the voters. The court also rejected the voters' challenge to the constitutionality of &sect; 82.80.090, holding that it did not abridge Wash. Const. art. II, &sect; 1(b).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of the judgment of the Superior Court for Yakima County, Washington, which convicted defendant of possession of a controlled substance with intent to deliver pursuant to Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 69.50.401(a)(1)-(iii). Defendant's standard range sentence was enhanced by 24 months pursuant to Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.94A.310(5) because the crime occurred within 1,000 feet of school grounds in violation of Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 69.50.435(a).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After he was convicted of possession of a controlled substance and his sentence was enhanced, defendant sought review of the judgment of conviction and the sentence imposed. On appeal, defendant contended that the trial court committed prejudicial error when there was a failure to prove intent to deliver to a person within the school zone and to demonstrate the accuracy of the system used to measure the 1,000 feet. Defendant challenged the constitutionality of Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 69.50.435 and the imposition of financial obligations as part of his punishment without ascertaining his ability to pay. The court held that defendant's mere possession of more than personal use amounts of a controlled substance within the school zone was sufficient proof to allow the imposition of the sentence enhancement. The court adhered to the measurement of the prohibited zone as the radius of a circle that emanated from the location of the school grounds. The court rejected defendant's constitutional challenge. The court held that the constitution did not require factual findings on defendant's ability to pay in light of the statutory safeguards afforded to defendants unable to pay.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested after police observed him and his brother in an area known for a high volume of hand-to-hand drug transactions. They arrested one man who was observed smoking what appeared to be marijuana right after he interacted with defendant. He cooperated and testified in defendant's trial. A jury found defendant guilty of delivery of a controlled substance. He was sentenced to 29 months' confinement, followed by one year of community placement that included an off-limits order under &sect; 10.66 that prevented him from entering a designated downtown area. On appeal, the court affirmed the conviction. There was sufficient evidence that supported the conviction, and the court would not substitute its judgment for the trier of fact on credibility determinations. The off-limits statute was not overbroad, applied only to known drug traffickers, and properly limited felons during community placement. The court reversed the trial court's decision with respect to the extent of the limits imposed on defendant and remanded for the trial court to revisit its order as to the breadth of the off-limits order and to consider possible exceptions as provided in Wash.

No appeals were taken from any of the orders granting the petitions for deferred prosecution and assessing court costs.

The lawsuits were consolidated for argument before the superior court. The limited courts moved for a summary judgment of dismissal, which was granted.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was twice convicted of harassment in violation of &sect; 9A.46.020.

Code &sect; 9A.46.020 so as to require repeated threats demonstrating a pattern of harassment. One threatening act was sufficient to support a harassment conviction if the other elements were proven. The court held that the evidence was sufficient to prove the remaining elements of harassment in one case against defendant.

Defendant was convicted of one count of telephone harassment, pursuant to Wash. Rev. Stat. &sect; 9.61.230. The court affirmed. The court concluded that Wash. Rev. State. &sect; 9.61.230(1), prohibiting making telephone calls with intent to harass and using lewd, profane, or obscene words, was not overbroad because it regulated conduct with minimal impact on speech, the implicated speech had little constitutional protection, and the restriction was reasonable. The court also found that Wash. Rev. Stat. &sect; 9.61.230(2), prohibiting calls at an &quot;extremely inconvenient hour&quot; was not overbroad because it regulated pure conduct. The court held that the phrase &quot;extremely inconvenient hour&quot; was not unconstitutionally vague because it provided adequate notice of the proscribed conduct. The jury was instructed on the alternative means doctrine and the court found that the state presented sufficient evidence to prove each means of committing the crime.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Testimony at defendant's trial tended to establish that defendant sold a piece of rock cocaine to an undercover officer while standing in a bus shelter. The jury found defendant guilty of delivery of a controlled substance. It returned a special verdict finding that the delivery was made in a public transit stop shelter. Accordingly, the trial court imposed an enhanced sentence, pursuant to Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.94A.310(5) and Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 69.50.435. The court noted that the legislature's attempt to deter drug sales in bus shelters by enhancing the penalty for activity in those places was a legitimate means of reducing the incidents of drug dealing in areas frequented by schoolchildren and protecting users of public transportation. Under either goal, &sect; 69.50.435(a) was rationally related to a legitimate state end. Thus, &sect; 69.50.435(a) was constitutional. Further, the undercover officer's insistence that defendant join him in the bus shelter was well within the normal amount of persuasion an officer was permitted to use. Thus, the evidence was insufficient to support defendant's proposed entrapment instruction, and the trial court properly refused to give it to the jury.</SPAN></P>

The trooper retrieved a glass pipe containing drug residue. In the search incident to his arrest, the trooper found more drugs, cash, a glass pipe, and a knife. Defendant contended that he was unreasonably seized in violation of the Fourth Amendment's protection against unreasonable searches and seizures. The state argued that the seizure was a limited detention authorized by Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 46.64.015 for the issuance of traffic citations. The superior court found that the lack of a fastened safety belt provided the trooper with a well-founded suspicion and was based on objective facts. The appeals court reversed, concluding that the safety belt violation or the officer's suspicions did not warrant a Terry stop. It concluded that (1) the seizure of defendant was unreasonable and that evidence obtained as a result of the seizure should have been suppressed; and (2) the pat-down search of defendant would have been justified only if the trooper could have pointed to specific and articulable facts creating an objectively reasonable belief that defendant was armed and dangerous.</SPAN></P>

King County, Washington, Ordinance 10336 clarified the county's position that all land north of a certain area should have been zoned AR-5. A hearing was held on the ordinance before its adoption. Notice of this hearing and of the proposed corrections was published in two newspapers, and property owners were sent a copy of the meeting agenda. The corrections explicitly adopted AR-5 zoning for the landowners' property. The court found that the ordinance and the process used to pass it evidenced the county's intent to adopt AR-5 zoning for the whole area, including the landowners' property.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, a Salvadoran native, applied for amnesty and in connection with his application obtained a medical test for AIDS. His and the doctor's inability to communicate led to defendant's belief that he had AIDS and he dropped his amnesty proceedings and became involved in drug trafficking. He was convicted of certain drug violations and after completion of his sentence was turned over to the Immigration and Naturalization Service for deportation. Defendant then learned that he was not infected with AIDS and asked for asylum. He requested that the trial court vacate his conviction, which was a barrier to being granted asylum. The state failed to appear and the trial court vacated the conviction pursuant to Wash. R. Crim. P. 7.8(b)(5) in order to help defendant with his deportation status. The state appealed. The court reversed, holding that the trial court's vacatur of the conviction amounted to a judicial pardon and violated the doctrine of separation of powers. The court stated that although a trial judge's discretion under Rule 7.8 was very broad, it did not extend to intruding on the power to pardon vested solely in the governor pursuant to Wash.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Superior Court for King County (Washington) awarded damages to appellant landowners for injury to their properties caused by excessive water run off from a private residential development owned by respondent developers. The landowners appealed the dismissal of certain claims and limitation of damages.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowners alleged that increased runoff and deposits of sediment on their property were caused by the development's clearing and grading of land. The landowners' inverse condemnation, tort, and injunctive relief claims against the county were properly dismissed because the damages were not the result of the county appropriating or regulating their use of the land and no exception to the public duty doctrine applied. The landowners' inverse condemnation claim against the developers was properly dismissed because there was no close nexus between their conduct and any entity of the state. The limitation of the landowners' damages to those occurring within the three years prior to the filing of their suits was proper because one landowner knew of the injury to his property eight years prior to filing suit and the other failed to exercise due diligence. The trial court erred in limiting the landowners' damages to the lesser of restoration costs or the diminution in value of their properties because the damage was temporary, thus, the proper measure of damages was the cost of restoration.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court remanded for computation of the landowners' damages using restoration costs as the measure of damages, which were not to exceed the pretort value of the properties.

The taxpayer contended that U.S. Const. amend. XVII was ineffective and, accordingly, all acts thereunder were invalid.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The department assessed industrial insurance taxes against the taxpayer and he appealed. The Board of Industrial Insurance Appeals (board) affirmed the assessment. The taxpayer filed an action against the department and the board, contending that U.S. Const. amend. XVII was ineffective due to deficiencies in the manner that the amendment was proposed and ratified. Accordingly, he contended that all congressional acts thereafter were invalid, including the declaration that paper money was legal tender. The taxpayer, therefore, claimed that the department's requirement that he pay his assessments in paper currency was invalid. The trial court affirmed the assessment and dismissed his claim, and he appealed. The court affirmed, holding that the board was entitled to judicial immunity because it was acting within a judge-like function. Further, U.S. Const. amend. XVII had been properly passed and Congress had the power to require that taxes be paid from paper currency. The court held that there was no abuse of discretion in the trial court's denial of the taxpayer's motions to amend his complaint and for reconsideration.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The council engaged private legal counsel to resolve a long-standing dispute between the council and the mayor as to the appropriate manner of modifying the town code's standards for street construction as they applied to a proposed improvement. The mayor was of the view that the proper procedure was that prescribed by the code for a variance. The council sought to have the mayor disburse the council's legal fees and to sign the council's resolution and street ordinance. The trial court granted summary judgment to the mayor, and denied the council's request for a writ of mandamus. The court affirmed on appeal. The court held that the council lacked authority to retain private counsel and that the mayor had no obligation to sign the ordinance. Pursuant to Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 35.27.290, the mayor had a ministerial duty to sign valid ordinances passed by the council, however, that duty did not apply to invalid ordinances.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant first argued that prosecutorial comments made during the state's closing argument denied him a fair trial. The court held that there was no impropriety and the state did not impermissibly comment on defendant's assertion of his Fifth Amendment right not to have born witness against himself. The court also determined that the remarks made were a reasonable inference from the evidence. Next defendant contended that he was improperly convicted of attempted robbery and kidnapping in violation of the double jeopardy clause of the Fifth Amendment. The court disagreed and held that each offense included an element that was not included within the other and therefore the offenses were not the same and double jeopardy did not prohibit defendant's conviction for both offenses. Defendant also alleged that the evidence was insufficient, but the court determined that the circumstantial evidence was enough as to have allowed the jury to infer that defendant committed the offenses. Finally defendant argued that he was denied ineffective assistance of counsel, but the court held that there was no such denial. Defendant's convictions were affirmed.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the sentence, but held that the trial court violated the state and federal ex post facto clauses by applying the sexual motivation statute,&nbsp;Wash. Rev.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The law enforcement officers saw defendant's coyotes in plain view. Defendant claimed that he was entitled to them because his permit request was on appeal. Defendant attacked the officers when they entered the backyard against his wishes. When defendant's attorney stipulated to a bench trial for assault and unlawful possession of wildlife and he failed to try to suppress the evidence of the coyotes, defendant claimed that he was denied effective assistance of counsel. The court affirmed the convictions. Though there was no exception to enter the backyard without a search warrant, the exclusionary rule did not apply to the assault. Thus, the attorney was not ineffective because the motion to suppress would have been denied. The trial stipulation did not include a stipulation to the law, was not a guilty plea, and defendant was not prejudiced. Defendant was properly charged under &sect; 9A.36.031(1)(g) where Wash Rev. Code &sect; 9A.36.031(1)(a) was not a special statute. Thus, there was no defense to the assault that the officers violated defendant's constitutional rights.

Although the director performed a quasi-judicial role, she was not entitled to absolute immunity because her position was not subject to any judicial procedural restraints. However, she was entitled to qualified immunity because the law regarding the constitutional rights of college students to engage in the process of electing student officers was not clearly established and because her actions, which were taken in good faith and comported with the legal advice she was given, were those that a reasonable official would have taken under similar circumstances.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate was convicted of two counts of second degree burglary and one count of robbery. He received a 17-month sentence for the burglary charges and a consecutive 13-month term for the robbery charge. He was incarcerated in the County's jail after he was convicted of burglary and while he was awaiting trial on the robbery charge. When he was transferred to the Washington Department of Corrections, the County certified 79 days of incarceration and 12 days of earned early-release time. The inmate challenged that calculation via a personal restraint petition. The court denied his petition. When an inmate was incarcerated in a county jail, Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.94A.150(1) specified that the award of good time was determined in accordance with the procedures promulgated by that institution. Similarly, when he was in the Department's custody, its procedures governed the award of good time. The court found that the inmate's right to equal protection was not violated by the County's less generous earned-release policies because they were rationally related to its interest in controlling the inmates in its custody.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In separate, unrelated cases, two defendants acquitted of murder on self-defense grounds requested reimbursement for &quot;loss of time&quot; and legal fees pursuant to Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9A.16.110. The Superior Court for Pierce County (Washington) denied both defendants' requests and defendants appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court first determined that the statute governing reimbursement for defendants who expended money to demonstrate their claim of self-defense applied to both defendants. The state argued that neither defendant proved that they would have had earnings had they not been prosecuted, while defendants argued that their time was compensable because they were deprived of the value of a free life and the opportunity to obtain employment. The court agreed with the state and found that there was no evidence that defendants would have had earnings but for being prosecuted, so there was no reimbursement for loss of time. As to attorney fees, the court held that the statute was an indemnification-reimbursement statute and only required defendants to be reimbursed for fees paid or owed. Since one defendant was indigent and not required to pay any legal fees, he was not entitled to indemnity or reimbursement. The other defendant who had paid $ 2700 and was obligated to pay $ 1700 more in attorney fees was entitled to reimbursement and indemnity.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's judgment as to both defendants regarding loss of time and as to the indigent defendant for attorney fees.

The case was transferred to the juvenile's residence county, where the probation officer recommended and the juvenile court commissioner imposed an additional &quot;no contact&quot; condition. The trial court initially overruled and then reinstated that modification. On appeal, the court affirmed. It held Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 13.40.060(3) (1977) provided express authority for modification of a juvenile disposition order, even in the absence of a violation of the prior order.The court found no merit in the juvenile's due process argument because he had not identified any procedural violation. There was no reason to reach the juvenile's equal protection argument because the State conceded that Wash. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The superior court ruled that the stop of defendant's truck was invalid. The State argued that the police officer was authorized to stop the truck for the purpose of checking whether the driver had a specialized forest products permit because the truck was carrying cedar blocks. The State contended that the stop was not governed by the regular Fourth Amendment principles that ordinary applied to traffic stops but that the Fourth Amendment standards applicable to pervasively regulated industries applied. The court disagreed and held that the State's argument failed because the record did not show that the forest products industry was pervasively regulated. Nothing indicated that the forest products industry had the sort of tradition or history that would have made it a pervasively regulated industry. However, even if the forest products industry was pervasively regulated, the court held that the Fourth Amendment standards applicable to such industries would not allow the police to randomly stop a moving vehicle without probable cause or articulable suspicion.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the affirmance of conviction for obstructing a public officer under Seattle, Wash., Mun. Code &sect; 12A.16.010, contending the statute violated certain constitutional rights, including that of a jury trial on the issue of whether the officer was acting lawfully. After losing his appeal in superior court, defendant sought further review. In affirming the conviction, the court noted that an ordinance is presumed constitutional, and the party challenging its validity has a heavy burden. The court found nothing in the Wash. Code of 1881 indicating that juries must decide if an officer was acting &quot;lawfully.&quot; The court noted that judges often determine such factual questions, which must be raised at trial by defendant. Because defendant failed to raise the issue at trial, the court held that he lost his defense and could not raise it on appeal. The court ruled the right to have a jury determine the lawfulness of police officers' actions was not a fundamental principle of justice deeply rooted in Washington's law. The court found no conflict in the ordinance and state law because under both, obstructing an officer was forbidden.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After police seized a cocaine dealer's pager, a detective returned defendant's call to the pager and arranged a meeting with defendant where a substance thought by defendant to be cocaine was exchanged. As a result, defendant brought a motion to suppress claiming that the evidence had been obtained in violation of the privacy act, pursuant to Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.73. On appeal, the court held that the trial court properly denied the motion. In pertinent part, the court first rejected defendant's argument that monitoring his incoming number on the pager was an illegal search in violation of Wash. Const. art. I, &sect; 7. Instead, analyzing the issue on federal constitutional grounds, the court noted that the monitoring of the pager did not constitute a &quot;search.&quot; Similarly, the court rejected defendant's argument that Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.73.030(1) was violated since police, by monitoring the pager, intercepted a private communication. Rather, the court held that there was no reason to find that the communication was intended to be &quot;private.&quot; Nevertheless, the court held that the seriousness level of the offense was miscalculated where defendant's conviction was for an unranked offense.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The driver was arrested for driving under the influence of an intoxicant, and refused to submit to a breath test to determine his blood alcohol content. At a hearing held by the Department of Licensing his license was revoked. The revocation was sustained by the trial court in a de novo trial. On appeal, the driver claimed that his refusal to submit to the breath test was not knowing and intelligent because he was confused by the implied consent warnings as given, by his lack of access to an attorney, and by the arresting officer's earlier request that he take a breath test in the field. The court affirmed the trial court's finding that the driver was not denied access to counsel, nor received an inadequate warning of his rights, and did not properly request that he take the test. With respect to the driver's claims there were statutory deficiencies with the officer's unsworn report to the Department of Licensing, the court held the law provided that an unsworn statement certified or declared by the person to be true under penalty of perjury could be substituted for a sworn statement whenever a sworn written statement was required to prove a matter in an official proceeding.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State appealed the decision from the Superior Court for King County (Washington), which after convicting defendant for the delivery of cocaine, sentenced defendant to 30 months imprisonment. The State sought a 24-month enhancement when the delivery was within 1,000 feet of a school.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An undercover agent bought cocaine from defendant. The State contended that a sentence in the range of 45 to 51 months was appropriate. On appeal, the court favored the State. Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 69.50.435(a) of the Uniform Controlled Substances Act (Act) called for an enhancement if cocaine was sold near a school. The latest amendment included the term &quot;may&quot; while a prior version used the term &quot;is punishable.&quot; The court first found that the amendment did not create a substantive change. A superior court had discretion to enhance &quot;up to&quot; double the imprisonment. However, the Act had to be viewed in connection with the Sentencing Reform Act of 1981 (SRA), Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.94A. Under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.94A.310(5) of the SRA, a 24-month addition was mandatory when the crime under the prior section of the Act was proven by the State. The court then rejected defendant's claim that even if the SRA applied, it only broadened the top range thus making the 30-month sentence appropriate. The SRA required the enhancement of the bottom range as well.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city was deeded a 100-foot-wide railroad right of way solely for railway purposes, which deed provided for reversion to the grantors and their heirs if the right of way ceased to be used for a railway. The city executed a conditional agreement transferring its interest in the southern half of the railroad right of way to a third party, in return for a perpetual easement for the extension of a trail through a portion of the railroad right of way. In the landowner's action to quiet title to the southern half of the railroad right of way, the trial court granted summary judgment to the city. On appeal, the court affirmed with respect to the city's absolute fee simple acquisition to four of the lots in the earlier condemnation proceeding, including the reversionary interest in the adjacent right of way, but found that the city had likely only acquired a prescriptive easement in the remaining lot. Whether the condemnation extended to the reversionary interest in the fee held by the landowner presented a question of fact for trial on remand.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owners filed preliminary plat applications for residential developments. The county planning department required preparation of environmental impact statements (EIS's). Subsequently, the board of county commissioners rezoned the area, changing the density requirements.

The county claimed that the date of vesting was the final date the EIS's were filed. The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of the developers. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's decision. The court held that: (1) the county's insistence that the date of vesting was the final date the EIS's were filed impermissibly conflicted with Rev. Wash. Code &sect; 58.17.033 which required vesting in all cases when the preliminary plat applications were filed; and (2) the county's interpretation contravened the state requirement that it prepare an EIS only when a major action was pending because before submittal there was no action pending and nothing to review.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The victim, a resident of a care facility for the mentally ill, testified that defendant put his finger or his tail in the place where her period came. A jury convicted defendant of second-degree rape under &sect; 9A.44.050(1)(b), having sexual intercourse with a person who was incapable of consent by reason of being mentally incapacitated. Affirming the conviction, the court held that the state did not have to establish the victim's mental incapacity by expert testimony in every case because the jury was able to make a rational decision as to mental capacity without expert testimony. The victim's testimony was direct evidence of her lack of capacity and demonstrated her inability to comprehend basic facts such as the time of day, much less the nature or consequences of sexual intercourse. Further, the evidence was sufficient to sustain the conviction because the victim's conflicting responses to questions demonstrated her confusion and lack of clear understanding of sexual matters. The court ruled that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in excluding evidence of the victim's past sexual behavior because her prior acts could have occurred due to the same lack of capacity.</SPAN></P>

Defendant contended, in part, that &sect; 6.48.010 was unconstitutionally overbroad and vague, the trial court improperly commented on the evidence to the jury, and the trial court improperly instructed the jury.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant called police and reported that somebody was ripping the arms and legs off of a baby. When the police officer arrived, he found defendant in front of a woman's health clinic. Defendant directed the officer into the clinic claiming that babies were being murdered inside the clinic. On appeal, the court held that Yakima, Wash., Mun. Code &sect; 6.48.010 was not unconstitutionally overbroad because &sect; 6.48.010 was viewpoint neutral and reasonably drawn as it proscribed only willful false, misleading, or exaggerated reports. The court ruled that &sect; 6.48.010 was not unconstitutionally vague because it gave adequate notice of the prohibited conduct and persons of common intelligence were able to reasonably ascertain the prohibited conduct. The court found that the trial court's instruction that a moral objection to abortion did not justify a violation of law was not an impermissible comment on the evidence. The court ruled that the trial court's instruction on the City's burden of proof under &sect; 6.48.010 accurately informed the jury of the applicable law. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to instruct the jury on the law of third trimester abortions.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Code &sect; 23B.13.020, applied to a proposed reincorporation of the corporation in another state without any negative change on business operations or negative impact on the interests of minority shareholders.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The corporation had migrated its entire operation to the east coast over a period of years. The directors deemed it beneficial to reincorporate in Delaware and to change the corporate name without any fundamental change in the nature of the business or any adverse consequences to shareholders. Two-thirds of the shareholders approved the change and the dissenters gave notice of intent to demand payment for their shares pursuant to Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 23B.13.210. On cross-actions for declaratory judgment, the trial court held that the &quot;merger&quot; triggered Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 23B.13.020. On appeal, the court examined the statute and found that it did not address the situation. The court examined legislative intent and found that the statute was intended to remedy the victimization of minority shareholders by majorities that made fundamental changes in the corporation. The court found that the dissenters here could not point to any real harm or economic loss from the proposal and held that the court should not unnecessarily interfere with corporate management nor enable a minority to frustrate a corporate action taken in good faith that did not result in any harm to the minority.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant employer challenged the decision from the Superior Court for Snohomish County (Washington), which entered judgment for respondent employees in their suit for the right to apply accrued vacation pay to pension rates in accordance with contracts signed with the employer. The trial court held that the contracts along with past administrative practice created a vested right to apply the accrued vacation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employer entered into individual contracts with the employees to keep the policy that 60 days of vacation could be accrued and applied to computing pension benefits. Later, the employer changed its policy and limited accrued vacation up to 30 days. The appellate court affirmed. Pension rights were contractual rights, which vested at the beginning of the employment relationship. The vacation pay was a type of pension right since it directly related to the level of benefits an employee would receive. A labor contract that ratified the new policy could not alter the rights of the employees under the private contracts. The union was not a necessary party. The suit was not preempted by &sect; 301(a) of the Labor Management Relations Act of 1947, 29 U.S.C.S. &sect; 185(a) since the employees were employed by a political subdivision of the state. The suit was properly brought in the superior court rather than before the Public Employment Relations Commission. The suit was not a labor dispute, which precluded jurisdiction under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 49.32.050. Some of the employees were entitled to attorney's fees, but since it was impossible to separate the claims, the entire fee award would stand.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment in favor of the employees was affirmed. The contracts regarding accrued vacation pay concerned vested pension rights, which could not be altered without the assent of the employees. A labor contract did not alter the contractual right. The union was not a necessary party. The suit was not preempted, and the superior court had jurisdiction. The attorney's fees award was proper.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant applied for appointment of an attorney at public expense but was denied because of his wife's income. He was asked repeatedly by the judge at his omnibus hearing whether he wished to represent himself, stated that he did, and indicated that he understood the ramifications of self-representation; he was found to be knowingly, voluntarily, and intelligently proceeding pro se. He did not testify at his trial because he did not wish to use the question-and-answer format. On review, the court found that the superior court properly discharged its responsibilities with respect to his waiver of counsel because he was specifically advised of his right to appointed counsel and of his right to challenge the determination that he was not indigent, that Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 10.101 required that his wife's income be included in the determination, and that he validly waived the right to retained counsel as shown by recorded colloquy. The court found that a defendant pro se did not have a right to testify in any manner in which he chose, that there was ample opportunity for him to testify during trial, and that there was no abuse of discretion in requiring questions and answers.</SPAN></P>

The court held: (1) the statutory phrase &quot;pattern or practice of assault and torture&quot; contained in the homicide by abuse statute,&nbsp;Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9A.32.055, was not constitutionally vague under U.S. Const. amend. XIV, or Wash.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's conviction was based upon the testimony of the victim, who claimed to see defendant shoot the gun. Shortly after the trial, the victim recanted his testimony in an unsworn written statement. Defendant filed his petition for post-judgment relief more than one year after the date of his conviction. Defendant contended that the victim's unsworn written statement was newly discovered evidence that entitled him to an automatic reversal of his conviction. The court affirmed the denial of defendant's petition for post-judgment relief and ordered a hearing in his personal restraint petition. The court held that (1) defendant's post-judgment relief petition, which was filed more than one year after the conviction, was time barred; (2) defendant's personal restraint petition was not time barred; and (3) an unsworn out-of-court statement was not the equivalent of an in-court recantation, and that such a statement did not automatically trigger a new trial, even where the testimony of the person making the statement was the sole basis for defendant's conviction.

The court affirmed, holding that the prosecutor could file more serious charges when plea negotiations proved unsuccessful without violating due process and that &sect; 9.94A.440 created no substantive rights; therefore, there was no basis for defendant's claim that he was entitled to relief based on the alleged noncompliance with the prosecution standards.

Code &sect; 69.50.435 for committing that offense within 1,000 feet of a school ground. The State proved that defendant facilitated the delivery of cocaine to an undercover officer. It also proved that the cocaine transaction occurred within 1,000 feet of a school ground. The trial court entered a judgment of conviction and added 24 months to defendant's sentence for the special offense of delivery within 1,000 feet of a school. On appeal, the court affirmed the conviction that was entered by the trial court. The court held that the offenses of delivery of cocaine and doing so within 1,000 feet of a school could both be properly proved by using the accessory provisions of Washington law. The court also rejected defendant's argument that the special offense was unconstitutional because the statute did not require proof that defendant knew that selling within 1,000 feet of a school was illegal.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court reversed the sentence enhancement but affirmed the conviction. The court found that &sect; 69.50.435(a) provided specific language which had to be interpreted to require proof of possession with intent to deliver plus proof that the intended locus of the purchaser of the controlled substance was to be within the prohibited school zone. The court concluded that there was no evidence of defendant's intent to deliver to a person within the prohibited zone. The court held that an inference could have been drawn from the quantity in defendant's possession that he intended to deliver a controlled substance. The court stated the delivery could have taken place outside of that 1,000 feet. The court held that the State failed to prove the elements of &sect; 69.50.435(a) necessary to support a sentencing enhancement under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.94A.310(5).</SPAN></P>

The court rejected defendant's argument that his payment of a civil infraction fine for unregistered contracting barred his prosecution under the doctrine of collateral estoppel holding that collateral estoppel did not apply in defendant's case because there was no prior proceeding pursued to a final result. Under the same rationale, the court also held that the &quot;same evidence&quot; test and the doctrine of double jeopardy were inapplicable. The court determined that there was no evidence in this case that the prosecutor, in filing a second information with an elevated forgery charge, was intentionally retaliating against defendant. The court reasoned that the evidence indicated that the prosecutor changed the attempted forgery count to forgery because the deputy prosecutor mistakenly believed the felony charge could not have been filed in district court. The court held that there was sufficient evidence to support defendant's conviction because in viewing the evidence in favor of the state, any rational trier of fact could have found defendant guilty of the charged crimes.</SPAN></P>

The trooper made no attempt to determine reasonable alternatives. There was ample adjacent parking. The trooper decided to impound only after asking twice to search the vehicle and made no inquiries as to the availability of another driver coming to pick up the car. Faced with defendant's refusal, the troopers decided to impound the car and proceeded to search the vehicle. They did not search the vehicle as a result of the passenger's arrest. Under these circumstances, the impoundment was unreasonable, and the search was unrelated to securing the passenger or the scene.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of unlawful possession of a controlled substance with the intent to manufacture or deliver it within 1,000 feet of the perimeter of school grounds. The court affirmed finding that the officer's testimony about the defendant's apparent drug sales prior to arrest was admissible because, although prejudicial to defendant, it was probative of his intention to sell the drugs he possessed when arrested. The evidence was logically relevant where it related to the material issue of defendant's intent to sell, it was legally relevant where it made such intent more probable than not, and it provided the jury with a complete picture of the events leading to the arrest. The Washington schoolyard statute under which defendant was convicted, was not ambiguous where it was clear that the language &quot;within 1000 feet&quot; modified the entire phrase &quot;possess with intent to deliver,&quot; rather than merely &quot;deliver,&quot; as defendant argued. The question for the jury was whether, at the time that defendant possessed the cocaine within 1,000 feet of the school, he also intended to deliver it. The evidence was sufficient to support the finding that he did.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An inmate was convicted of robbery and imprisoned under the law in effect before the Sentencing Reform Act (SRA). While on parole from that conviction, he was convicted of manslaughter and again sentenced to the penitentiary. The inmate was given a new term to serve on the robbery conviction, but the Board later permitted him to serve his sentence under the SRA. The Board conditionally approved a parole plan, but the authorization was withdrawn when the inmate committed prison infractions. The inmate claimed that the Board lost jurisdiction over him once his SRA sentence expired and that he was entitled to certain procedural safeguards before parole could be revoked. The court affirmed the Board's action, holding that the Board retained jurisdiction over the inmate where neither the maximum term for the robbery or manslaughter convictions had expired when the parole authorization was withdrawn. The grant of parole was contingent on the submission of an acceptable plan and the inmate's compliance with the Board's rules and regulations governing parole. Because an adequate plan was not submitted and the inmate never actually entered on parole, no due process rights were implicated.</SPAN></P>

The court found that defendant's claim was purely one of law, which was that Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.73.230 was unconstitutional, and that therefore, written findings or conclusions would have been superfluous. The court also rejected defendant's claim that &sect; 9.73.230 was unconstitutional under Wash. Const. art. 1, &sect; 7 and U.S. Const. amend. IV and XIV. The court held, in line with the unanimous federal authorities, that 1-party consent did not violate the Fourth Amendment. The court rejected defendant's argument that his sentence was erroneously enhanced on the basis that he or an accomplice was armed with a deadly weapon at the time of the commission of the crime.

Defendant was in the street photographing his car and the neighbor called the police in the belief that he was violating the restraining order. The same officers who had arrested him before arrived and during this arrest, they found a tape recorder among defendant's papers. Defendant was charged with recording his arrest, a private conversation, in violation of Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.73.030. The court reversed and held that the conversation was not private. The court rejected the State's request that it adopt the view that public officers performing an official function on a public thoroughfare in the presence of a third party and within the sight and hearing of passersby enjoyed a privacy interest that they were entitled to assert under the statute. The court held that the arrest was not entitled to have been private and the officers could not reasonably have considered their words private. Because the exchange was not private, its recording could not have violated &sect; 9.73.030.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">As a result of a 1977 jury conviction for aggravated first-degree murder, the inmate was sentenced to death under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9A.32.046 (1975). An alternative sentence of life without the possibility of parole was imposed pursuant to former Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9A.32.047. The mandatory death penalty for aggravated murder under former Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9A.32.046 was declared unconstitutional in 1979. The inmate appealed his death sentence to the Washington Supreme Court, which in 1979 converted his sentence to life without the possibility of parole. On his third petition, the inmate argued that his sentence of life without the possibility of parole was unconstitutional. The court held that the alternative sentence of life without possibility of parole provided for by former Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9A.32.047 was constitutional because only the mandatory imposition of the death penalty in Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9A.32.046 (1975) was held unconstitutional. The court concluded that irrespective of whether the inmate was found guilty by a jury or on a plea of guilty, his sentence would have been life without the possibility of parole pursuant to the alternative sentencing provision in 1975.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Police officers listened in on a telephone conversation between defendant and an informant in which they learned defendant wanted to buy a considerable amount of marijuana. There was no electronic interception or recording of the conversation, just the officers standing next to the informant and listening to the conversation. Based on that information the officers arranged a &quot;sting&quot; operation and ultimately arrested defendant. Defendant sought to suppress all the evidence gathered as a result of that conversation under Washington's Privacy Act (Act), Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.73, and Wash. Const. art. 1, &sect; 7. The trial court denied the motion, and defendant sought review. The court held that listening in to a telephone conversation with the consent of one of the parties to the conversation violated neither Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.73 nor the state constitution. There was no &quot;interception&quot; or &quot;recording&quot; as defined by the statute, and by long established state and federal law, there was no reasonable expectation of privacy by defendant because of the possibility that the other party to the telephone conversation might consent to others listening in.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following a trial, defendant was convicted of possession of methamphetamine with intent to deliver. Upon review, the court affirmed. The court held that items seized from defendant's home during the execution of a search warrant for a co-occupant fell under the plain view doctrine where the seizure of the items did not involve an intrusion on defendant's right of privacy any greater than that allowed by the lawfully issued search warrant. The court determined a second search of defendant's home a couple of days later that was done without a search warrant was lawful under the exigent circumstances exception to a search warrant where police had knowledge defendant's residence was a drug transition point and officers observed a juvenile bolt to the bathroom and close the door and flush the toilet. The court concluded defendant was not denied effective assistance of counsel on the basis that his counsel stipulated that defendant's residence was within 1,000 feet of a school bus route stop, thus making a sentence for a guilty verdict subject to enhancement under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 69.50.435(a) where the decision to enter into the stipulation was a trial tactic.</SPAN></P>

On reconsideration, the trial court determined that the onsite recreational facility ordinance was entirely valid on its fact, but was invalidly applied when the city permitted the apartment complexes to substitute additional landscaping for onsite recreational facilities. The court found that the fee was not a tax since the condition of the payment of the same was directly tied to the property. The court also held that the city was estopped from asserting that it was not bound by the agreement it made with the apartment complexes to permit the substitution of the recreational facilities for landscaping.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that Wash. Rev. Code ch. 9A.44.130 violated the Ex Post Facto Clauses of the federal and Washington State constitutions. He argued that the requirement to register operated to his disadvantage to such an extent that it was in effect an additional punishment, the retrospective application of which violated the ex post facto prohibition, and was therefore unconstitutional. The State contended that the statute's purpose was regulatory, rather than punitive, and that unless it had the effect of imposing additional punishment, it did not violate the prohibition against ex post facto laws. The court held that effect of the statute was not so punitive as to override the intended regulatory purpose. Much of the information required by the statute was public information generally available to interested persons who made a reasonable effort to obtain it. The court found that, while registration was disadvantageous to a registrant, the disadvantages were relatively minor and were not sufficient as to make the registration statute punitive in overall effect. The court found that it was a regulatory statute, which did not violate the prohibition against ex post facto laws.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The president contended that the trial court erred in not vacating the arbitration award and for denying relief from the judgment. The court held (1) arbitration awards were favored by the courts and would not be overturned absent a claim of prejudice as error without prejudice was not grounds for reversal. (2) A creditor's remedies for fraudulent transfer included avoidance of the transfer and attachment so the attachment here was valid. (3) The statutory warranty deed effectively passed title of the property from the company to its president so the trial court's finding that it had not was invalid. However, (4) the transfer of the property from the company to its president was both intentionally fraudulent and constructively fraudulent, so remand was proper for reconsideration of the fraudulent transfer claim.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowner claimed that state and county regulations that prohibited development in floodways and the county's adoption of floodway maps placing his property within the floodway deprived him of all economically viable uses of his property. The landowner brought an action against the county and the state for a writ of mandamus, money damages, and for a denial of substantive due process. The trial court granted summary judgment to the county and the state. The court reversed and held that an issue of material fact existed with regard to the landowner's &quot;taking&quot; claim where there was a question as to whether the landowner's property had any economically viable use remaining under the regulations. The landowner had the right to demonstrate that the regulations stripped his property of all economically viable use to state a &quot;taking&quot; claim.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee Washington Department of Labor and Industries brought an action against appellant employer for violation of the overtime provisions of the Washington Minimum Wage Act (act). The court modified the summary judgment in favor of appellee by reversing the award of exemplary damages of double the amount of unpaid overtime wages and affirmed the judgment as modified. The trial court erred in awarding what amounted to treble damages because this exceeded the damages allowed by Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 49.52.070. The Federal Motor Carrier Act did not preempt the act because the act did not impede interstate commerce, and the trial court properly held that the act's overtime wage provision could not be construed to be a burden that was clearly excessive in relation to the local benefit. Appellee's rule applying the act to appellant as an interstate motor carrier did not violate the state Administrative Procedure Act because appellee followed state law on the matter and its rule reduced appellant's burden. Appellee was entitled to attorney fees under &sect; 49.52.070 because, in using its de jure authority, it stood in the employees' shoes and brought its action on their behalf.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After obtaining a default judgment on the debt, the creditors perfected their judgment lien by filing, in accordance with the then-current law, an abstract of judgment in the county in which the debtor owned real property. Several years later, the debtors filed a homestead declaration on the property and subsequently filed for bankruptcy protection. After their debts were discharged, passed Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 6.13.090, requiring that, for a judgment lien to attach as a lien in excess of a homestead exemption, the judgment had to be recorded with the county recording officer. Four years thereafter, the creditors obtained a writ of execution on their lien and the trial court quashed the writ on the grounds that the lien had not been filed in accordance with the new law. The court reversed the trial court's order, finding error in the retroactive application of &sect; 6.13.090, and held that the creditors held a valid lien against the property in excess of the debtor's homestead exemption. The court reasoned that &sect; 6.13.090 could not be construed to operate retroactively because to do so would deprive the creditors of their vested property right in the lien against the debtors' property.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was cited for driving with a suspended license and challenged the constitutionality of the statute. The court found that the stop was lawful under both the state and federal constitutions. The court noted that, in order for an investigative stop to be valid, the officer had to have specific and articulable facts which, taken together with rational inferences from those facts, reasonably warranted such an intrusion. The court held that &sect; 46.16.710(3) sufficiently limited the officer's discretion because it authorized stops only of vehicles with the marked license plates and provided that the scope of the stop was limited to the sole purpose of ascertaining whether the driver had a valid license to operate the vehicle.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with a violation of Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.68A.090, which proscribed communication with a minor for immoral purposes. The charge was based upon defendant's alleged communication with a 12 year old boy in which defendant showed the boy some magazines, asked him to come into the bathroom with him, asked him questions about the magazine photos, and asked to see the boy's pubic hair. The boy declined and the conversation ended. Defendant successfully challenged the charge in the trial court, but on appeal by the state, the appellate court reversed the dismissal. Defendant sought review. The court reversed the appellate decision and reinstated the dismissal. The court found that the statute was unconstitutionally vague as applied to defendant's conduct. The court found that the &quot;immoral purposes&quot; referred to in &sect; 9.68A.090 were those identified in Wash. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parties cross-appealed from the Superior Court for Pierce County (Washington) judgment for plaintiff contractor in its contract suit against defendant transportation department over a wage dispute. The department challenged jurisdiction while the contractor appealed the court's failure to award damages for lost profits and its refusal to find an apprenticeship training program provision unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parties contracted for ferry repair and refurbishment. When the work was done, the department cited the contractor for failure to pay the prevailing rate of wages. The contractor sued for an injunction, damages, and a declaration that the department's enforcement of the prevailing wage statute was unconstitutional and void. The trial court found for the contractor on the wage dispute, enjoining enforcement of that provision and awarding lost profits, but against the contractor on the apprenticeship training program. The appellate court reversed the ruling on the wage dispute and affirmed the ruling on the apprenticeship training program. The determinative issue was jurisdiction. The department could not waive the requirement as to the prevailing wage rate, nor acquiesce to payments below that rate. Under Wash. Rev. Code 39.12.010 and the contract, the contractor was required to pay the prevailing rate. Its only other choice was arbitration. As it filed suit instead, the doctrine of exhaustion of remedies prohibited superior court taking jurisdiction. In addition, the contractor did not establish that the apprenticeship training program was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment for the contractor on its prevailing rate of wages challenge was reversed for lack of jurisdiction, as was the damages award. The judgment rejecting the challenge to the apprenticeship training program's constitutionality was affirmed. When the contractor failed to pay the prevailing rate, the department was authorized to issue notices of violation and file liens against its bond. The lost profits did not result from improper liens.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Code &sect; 66.44.270(2). The arresting officer saw defendant put a brown paper bag into a trash receptacle. The officer made the arrest after determining that the bag was full of empty beer bottles and hearing defendant say that he had consumed some beer. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that there was insufficient evidence to support his consumption conviction and that the statute, mandating the Department of Licensing to revoke his license, was unconstitutional. The court affirmed the conviction and found that the statute was not unconstitutional. Although the arresting officer did not actually see defendant consume any beer, there was sufficient evidence to convict defendant of the crime of consuming alcohol as a minor. The officer had probable cause, including defendant's admission that he had consumed some beer, to believe that a crime was committed, which was all that was required under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 10.31.100. The court found that Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 66.44.365(1), which mandated the lower court to inform the Department of Licensing to revoke defendant's license, was constitutional. Applying the rational relationship test, the court found that the class affected by &sect; 66.44.365(1) consisted of minors from the ages of 13 to 17, not from 13 to 21. There was a reasonable relation between the legislation's objective and the distinction between minors and those who were between 18 and 21.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of three counts of second-degree assault after he intentionally exposed his victims to the HIV virus. This act was a criminal offense under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9A.36.021(1)e. The trial court imposed an exceptional sentence after his conviction for count one. The court imposed standard range sentences for the other counts. On appeal, the court held that there was sufficient evidence to show that defendant intentionally exposed his victims to the HIV virus after being counseled concerning safe sex. The court found that the public health doctor had not violated Wash. Rev. Stat. &sect; 70.24.105(1) by informing the prosecutor of defendant's identity and the HIV test result because the statute allowed prosecutors access to otherwise confidential information held by public health officers. The court ruled that Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9A.36.021(1)e was not unconstitutionally vague because any reasonably intelligent person would understand what he was being charged with. Lastly, the court concluded that the trial court abused its discretion in imposing an exceptional sentence.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The county adopted Whatcom County, Wash., Ordinance 90-1, creating the district with the power to impose taxes, and Ordinance 90-9, providing for a solid waste excise tax. Respondents sought a declaratory judgment that the tax was valid, but the taxpayers claimed that Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 36.58.140 and the ordinances were unconstitutional. The trial court granted summary judgment for respondents and the court affirmed the judgment, ruling that the district was a quasi-municipal corporation and independent taxing authority under Wash. Const. art. VII, &sect; 1.  Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 36.58.140 specifically permitted the district to levy and collect the excise tax, which was sufficient to fund its waste disposal activities. The district thus had express authority to implement the tax. The court also rejected the argument that the legislature did not have the constitutional authority to delegate the power to levy and collect taxes to a quasi-municipal corporation. Wash. Const. art. XI, &sect; 12, permitted such delegation to other municipal corporations, the district was such a corporation, and Wash. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from an order of the Superior Court for King County Washington, which convicted him of first degree reckless endangerment. He was tried jointly with another defendant. The other defendant's appeal was heard first and his conviction affirmed sub nomine. Defendant contended that even if the inference created by Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9A.36.045 was constitutional, an instruction on that inference was improper and inaccurate.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At trial, defendants testified that they accidentally discharged a firearm while they were driving around in a car. The court had previously held that &sect; 9A.36.045 was constitutional because the inference it created, that a person who unlawfully discharged a firearm from a moving vehicle was acting recklessly, was not unconstitutionally vague. On appeal, the court held that the trial court's instruction, based on a pattern instruction dealing with the inference of intent in the burglary statutes, was proper. The courted noted that no pattern instruction for reckless endangerment had yet been drafted. For constitutional purposes, the inference of reckless conduct in the endangerment statute and the inference of intent to commit a crime in the burglary statute were indistinguishable. Because the burglary instruction had been approved by the state's supreme court, it followed that an instruction based on it also met constitutional standards and adequately informed the jury as to use of the permissive inference. Because the facts justified a rational inference from the proven fact of the discharge of the firearm to the inferred fact of reckless conduct, the instruction was proper.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from an order of the Superior Court for Franklin County Washington, which sentenced him for his conviction for delivery of cocaine. Pursuant to Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.94A.360(17), the trial court added one point to his offender score because he committed the offense while under community placement. He contended that the statute violated his constitutional due process and equal protection rights.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The one point difference in offender score made a difference of 10 months on the low end and 14 months on the high end of the sentencing range. It also meant that he would be given additional time under his old charge when his parole was revoked. On appeal, the court found no error. A statute was presumed constitutional and a challenging party had the burden of demonstrating the invalidity of the statute beyond a reasonable doubt. Defendant did not explain, or cite any authority to support, his assertion of unconstitutionality. The court found that the statute did not violate equal protection guaranties under either the rational basis or intermediate scrutiny tests. Equal protection was not violated by giving different punishments for the same criminal act when those different punishments were based on culpability, criminal history and other facts that varied from one defendant to another. The court found that the statute furthered a substantial State interest, to protect society and to deter offenders on community placement from committing subsequent crimes. Further, the statute was rationally related to the State's purpose of protecting the public.</SPAN></P>

Evid. 404(b); rather, they were relevant to the court's finding that defendant's motivation was sexual, as well as to defendant's identity; (2) the facts that defendant removed the vibrator and condoms, examined her photographs, and did not take anything of value were sufficient to support the finding of sexual motivation beyond a reasonable doubt; (3) Wash. Rev.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted on eyewitness testimony, his own statements, and the presence of trace elements of cocaine on one hand and in a pipe. Defendant was an indigent and did not object to the imposition of costs at sentencing but now claimed state and federal equal protection violations. On appeal, the court addressed only the issue of the imposition of costs. The court noted that under Wash. R. App. P. 2.5(a)(3), issues raised for the first time on appeal generally would not be heard unless there was an issue of constitutional magnitude. The court found that the trial court's failure to make factual findings on defendant's ability to pay was not a constitutional error that required resentencing. The court held that imposition of assessments on an indigent, per se, did not offend the Constitution and that constitutional principles would be implicated only if the government sought to enforce collection of the assessments at a time when defendant was unable to comply through no fault of his own. The court held that defendant had waived his objection to the imposition of costs and that any constitutional issues were not ripe for review.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was convicted of possession of a controlled substance with intent to deliver. On appeal, defendant argued that the recording of his conversations with the informant under Wash. Rev.

The court disagreed and affirmed. The court held that the statute authorized the recording of private conversations in the course of certain criminal investigations where (1) one party had consented to the recording, (2) probable cause existed to believe that the communication involved drug dealing, (3) the recording was authorized by a supervising officer, (4) a written report was prepared, and (5) the written report was properly submitted to a judicial officer for review. The court held that because the recordings were obtained through the informant's consent, no search had occurred, and, thus, no warrant was required. The court held that defendant took a risk that the conversations might be overheard or repeated. He had no expectation of privacy.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">As a condition of building permit approval, the city required the owners to pay a sidewalk construction fee. The owners also incurred costs for recreational facilities required by Mountlake Terrace, Wash., Ordinance 3.3.7. The owners brought an action seeking recovery of the sidewalk construction fees and the amounts expended to comply with the recreational facility ordinance. The trial court entered judgment in favor of the city, but offset the judgment by the amounts paid for sidewalk construction fees and for additional landscaping. On appeal, the trial court's judgment was affirmed in part and reversed in part. The court ruled that the ordinance was not a tax and that the ordinance on its face did not violate Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 82.02.020. The court ruled that the city's application of the ordinance did not violate the owners' right to substantive due process and was not a taking of property without just compensation. The court determined that one of the owners was estopped from asserting that it was entitled to recovery of the landscaping expenses. The court held that the owners were entitled to attorney's fees with respect to the litigation over the sidewalk construction fees.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The action concerned the financing of the city's convention center. The city council did not place the issue on the ballot because it determined that it was not a proper subject for an initiative because it involved administrative acts. The citizens filed an action against the city to compel it to place an initiative on the ballot. The trial court granted the city's motion for summary judgment. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that all major policy decisions concerning the proposed convention center were made by December, 1989, and that actions taken thereafter were in furtherance of existing policy and thus were administrative. Further, Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 35.42.200 bespoke a legislative intent that the city could execute leases where the indebtedness limit was not exceeded without submitting the decision to do so for voter approval. The initiative in question would require the convention center authority to obtain voter approval prior to issuing any revenue bonds. That could result in a substantial impairment defeating the expectations of the parties under the contracts.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was ordered to pay restitution and a victim penalty assessment without a specific finding that he had the ability to pay. On appeal, defendant argued that the imposition of $ 3,145 in restitution and a $ 100 victim penalty assessment, without considering his ability to pay, violated his right to equal protection because if he could not pay, he would have been subject to arrest prior to a show cause hearing, whereas a person who was able to make payments would not. The court affirmed the judgment and held that there was no requirement to examine defendant's ability to pay at the time of sentencing and that provisions of the sentencing statute protected an involuntarily defaulting defendant from being punished for a present inability to pay either restitution or a victim penalty assessment. Additionally, defendant was entitled to petition the sentencing court if he was unable to make his restitution payments. In doing so, he would not have been subject to arrest prior to a show cause hearing. Any inquiry at sentencing as to future ability to pay was necessarily speculative. The court upheld the constitutionality of Wash. Rev. Code &sect;&sect; 9.94A.142 and 7.68.035.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant fell asleep at the wheel of his truck while driving under the influence. The truck drove off the road and collided with a utility pole. Two men were working around the pole. One suffered several injuries, and the other died. Defendant pleaded guilty to vehicular homicide and vehicular assault. The trial court sentenced him to 38 months for vehicular homicide and 14 months for vehicular assault. On appeal, defendant argued that the Washington Sentencing Reform Act of 1981 (SRA), Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.94A.400(1)(a) violated equal protection because it unconstitutionally treated perpetrators of vehicular assault or vehicular homicide differently depending on whether or not multiple victims were in one car. The court held that the legislature was entitled to provide less punishment to defendants whose victims occupied one vehicle. The classification was rationally related to the legitimate purpose of the SRA, which was to insure that punishment was proportionate to the seriousness of the offense. Victims in the same vehicle were necessarily hurt by one impact, whereas multiple victims not in the same vehicle almost necessarily involved more than one impact.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The husband and wife executed a community property agreement. He then shot and killed her. As a security for attorney's fees in defending the murder charge, he gave his attorneys a deed of trust to real estate that he and his wife had held as community property. He then sought to partition the community real estate for half the property. The superior court denied the request for partition, ruling that he forfeited all his interest in the community property, and therefore the attorney acquired no interest in the property through the deed of trust. On appeal, the court reversed the judgment that the husband forfeited all the community property and remanded for further proceedings in the partition action. The court held that by slaying his spouse, the husband was only precluded under the slayer statutes from acquiring the slain spouse's interest in their community property because the purpose of the statutes was to prevent a person from profiting from his wrongful act, not to exact a penalty. The husband already had an interest in one-half of the community property so he would not have profited from her death, and he should not have been penalized by being deprived of his interest.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the patient contended that the trial court erred in failing to make a determination on the question of whether he had &quot;not in good faith volunteered&quot; within the meaning of &sect; 71.05.230(2). Although the case was technically moot, the court considered it because issues of substantial public interest were presented. In order to sustain the constitutionality of &sect; 71.05.230(2), the court construed the statute as requiring the trial court, before ordering involuntary treatment, to make a specific determination that a potential detainee had not in good faith volunteered for appropriate treatment. In the instant case, the court found that the state proved by a preponderance of the evidence that the patient had not volunteered in good faith.

S. &sect; 1983, and the claim of outrage. The court reversed the summary judgment with respect to the claim of negligent investigation of the sexual abuse allegations and the &sect; 1983 claims. The court noted that contrary to the trial court's conclusion, the state recognized the tort of negligent investigation, but also noted that the caseworkers might be entitled to qualified immunity, and so summary judgment was not appropriate because factual issues remained on this issue. The court also held that dismissal of the parents' &sect; 1983 claims was similarly inappropriate because the caseworkers were entitled to qualified, not absolute immunity, in their investigation of claims of child abuse, and factual issues were presented on the immunity question. However, the court affirmed the trial court's dismissal of the outrage claim, held that the parents could not make out a case of negligent infliction of emotional distress, and also held that the trial court did not err in refusing to grant summary judgment on the claim of malicious interference with the parent-child relationship.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment, except for the dismissals of the claims for negligent investigation of sexual abuse and violations of &sect; 1983, which were reversed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant first claimed that the statutory term &quot;unlawfully&quot; was unconstitutionally vague as applied. The court disagreed and held that the statute adequately informed persons of common intelligence what conduct was prohibited. The term &quot;unlawfully&quot; was given meaning by readily ascertainable sources of law that provided sufficient meaning to the phrase such that persons of ordinary intelligence would not have to guess at its meaning. The court also held that the term &quot;unlawfully&quot; excluded an accidental discharge of the weapon. Defendant had not requested a jury instruction that told the jury that an accidental discharge was not an unlawful discharge. In spite of the lack of such an instruction, both the defense attorney and the prosecutor explained in their closing arguments that an accidental discharge was not a violation. The trial court's definition of &quot;recklessness&quot; also advised the jury that an accident was not reckless conduct.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1977 defendant pleaded guilty to indecent liberties. The court held that the state, to enhance his charge of communication with a minor for immoral purposes from a gross misdemeanor to a class C felony, was not required to prove the validity of the prior conviction beyond a reasonable doubt, but only that it was facially valid. The failure of the guilty plea form to include a waiver of defendant's right to remain silent did not render the 1977 conviction facially invalid because the court was satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant pleaded guilty knowing that if he went to trial he had a right to remain silent. Additionally, although the trial court did not properly instruct the jury on &quot;immoral purposes&quot; the error was harmless. The court was satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that if the requested instruction had been given the jury would have returned exactly the same verdicts. Finally, the prosecutor's statements during closing argument that the jury was sitting as representatives of this whole community and the jury decision would determine if defendant will be set free or held to account were not improper.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant stipulated that he sold cocaine to an undercover officer in a city park. An enhanced sentence was imposed under &sect; 69.50.435(a) because the sale occurred in a public park. On appeal defendant contended that &sect; 69.50.435(a) was unconstitutional because there was no mens rea requirement for the enhancement and neither equal protection nor due process requirements were met. The court rejected these claims. The court found that a crime could be defined based on conduct alone and without any mental element. Further, the court noted that a defense based on lack of knowledge was not denied defendant because the underlying crime included the mental element of knowledge. The court also held that &sect; 69.50.435(a) did not violate equal protection. The law applied equally to all members of the class of persons who sold controlled substances in a public park, and the State's interest in protecting children provided a reasonable ground for distinguishing those who sold controlled substances in areas frequented by children. In addition, the court held that &sect; 69.50.435(a) provided adequate notice of the prohibited conduct, as required by the constitutional due process guaranties.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The original information alleged that defendant had caused damage to property in excess of $ 50 by damaging tires of parked vehicles. During the trial, the trial court permitted evidence to show that there was also vandalism to mailboxes as part of the same series of events. The trial court then permitted an amendment to the information, which deleted the monetary element but added destruction of mailboxes as an alternative way that the crime was committed. Defendant objected to amendment but did not request a continuance. On defendant's appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's action permitting the amendment pursuant to Wash. Super. Ct. Crim. R. 2.1(e). The court noted that the amendment merely added an alternative way of committing the crime, but the principal element in the new information was inherent in the original information. Any prejudice could have been cured by asking for a continuance, which defendant declined to do. The court also held that evidence of the mailbox vandalism would have been relevant and admissible even without the amendment because it was res gestae evidence.</SPAN></P>

After a few moments, the detectives entered the apartment. The detectives saw defendant standing over the toilet dumping the contents of a plastic bag into the toilet. The bag was retrieved and found to contain 5.5 grams of cocaine. The police detectives proceeded to search the van in which defendant arrived at the scene. The detectives testified that they decided to seize the vehicle under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 69.50.505(b)(4).

The court held that the warrantless inventory search of a vehicle seized under the drug trafficking forfeiture statute,&nbsp;&sect; 69.50.505(b)(4) was valid.

Defendant contended that restitution for loss of future child support payments was an unconstitutional forfeiture and that the trial court was required to reduce the restitution obligation owed by the amount of insurance payments received by the victims' families. The court affirmed the trial court's order of restitution and concluded the order did not violate Const. art. I, &sect; 15 since the order was not premised on defendant being incapacitated from owning property, but was imposed to achieve legitimate goals of sentencing. The court held Wash. Rev.

The ordinance properly permitted voluntary agreements between developers and the county for payment of a fee to mitigate the direct impact of the traffic problems of the county. However, the court held that the developer correctly contended that the traffic his development would contribute, when properly calculated under the ordinance, did not justify application of provisions of the ordinance to the developer.

Defendant claimed that the conviction was improper because he had no knowledge of his friend's use of what appeared to be a firearm. On appeal, the court upheld the conviction. The court stated that the conviction for rendering criminal assistance in the first-degree was proper because defendant knew that a robbery had been committed. The court stated that defendant did not need to know the degree of the robbery at the time that he rendered assistance. Despite defendant's contention, the court concluded that the charging statute,&nbsp;Wash. Rev.

Defendant contended on appeal that the evidence was insufficient to establish an intent to deliver. He also argued that the enhancement was improper because he was not charged with a violation of Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 69.50.435(a) and because Wash Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The motorist was stopped by a police officer who was outside his jurisdiction after the motorist was observed weaving between the lanes and speeding. Once the motorist was stopped, the police officer requested assistance from local police. The local police took the motorist to the police station where he refused to take a breathalyzer test. As a result, his driver's license was administratively revoked. The trial court upheld the revocation, and the motorist appealed. The court affirmed. The motorist contended that the revocation was improper because the police officer who initially stopped him lacked authority to do so because he was outside his jurisdiction. However, the police officer acted under a written consent agreement from the jurisdiction in which the motorist was stopped. Under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 10.93.070(1), any qualified general authority peace officer with prior written consent could operate outside the officer's primary jurisdiction.

However, the trial court's ruling did not affect the employee's federal civil rights claims. The court held that the employee failed to comply with the statute because he failed to file his claim with the office of risk management before filing the action. The employee's argument that he fulfilled the statute requirements by filing his claim with the State after filing his action was not sustained. Thus, the claim filed with the State was untimely. The State was not estopped from relying on the nonclaim statute, but the nonclaim statute did not apply to defendant university officials in their individual capacities.

Code &sect;&sect; 9.68A.040(1)(b), 011(3)(e) were unconstitutionally vague or overbroad. The court disagreed and affirmed. It explained that Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.68A.011(3)(e) defined the term &quot;sexually explicit conduct&quot;, as exhibition of the genitals or unclothed pubic or rectal areas of any minor, for the purpose of sexual stimulation of the viewer. The language &quot;for the purposes of sexual stimulation of the viewer&quot;, rather than making the statute vague, served to clarify and narrow the reach of the statute. This language permitted a trier of fact to distinguish between pictures of the sort in issue and those taken for &quot;legitimate scientific, medical, or educational activities.&quot; The court concluded that the statute satisfied due process requirements because any person of common understanding would know that causing photographs to be taken of a nude 16-year-old girl would fall within the proscription of Wash.

As an officer approached, defendant attempted to hide on the van's floor. As defendant exited the van, the officer observed two knives in the van. Defendant was convicted of attempted kidnapping in the second degree, and the court affirmed. By offering the girls a dollar if they would go to with him, defendant took a substantial step toward the commission of the crime because, if the girls had complied, their movements would have been restrained by their presence in the van, and the restraint would have been without consent. Once they were restrained in the van, defendant would have been secreting or holding the girls in a place where they were not likely to be found. Defendant's conduct was strongly corroborative of a criminal intent to kidnap the girls because he suggested a location a child might find appealing, offered the girls a bribe to accompany him there, and when the police arrived, he attempted to avoid detection.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">To support its claim that the offenses occurred within a 1,000-foot radius of a school bus route stop, the State called the school district's director of transportation. His testimony revealed that bus stops were not marked and were changed according to the needs of the children. The trial court enhanced defendants' sentences under Wash. Rev. Code &sect;&sect; 69.50.435 and 9.9A.310(5). The court reversed, holding that the statutes were unconstitutional. Because the location of school bus stops was not reasonably ascertainable, due process was violated. Equal protection was violated because there were no reasonable grounds to distinguish between persons who engaged in the delivery of drugs within a 1,000-foot radius of a school bus route stop and those who did so elsewhere. School bus route stops and their immediate vicinity were not necessarily places where children were often highly concentrated or even present other than on specific days and at specific times. Given the fact that only one small area within the city limits was not within a 1,000-foot radius of a school bus route stop, the statutes did not further a substantial interest of the State.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Superior Court for Yakima County, Washington, convicted defendants of delivery of a controlled substance, cocaine. Because the deliveries both occurred within 1,000 feet of a school ground, their standard range sentences were enhanced by 24 months pursuant to Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.94A.310(5) and former Wash.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A police officer saw one defendant engaged in what appeared to be a drug transaction.

An officer contacted defendant two at a park, and he was found to have heroin with him; he also admitted to giving some cocaine to a girl. Both incidents were within 1,000 feet of a school ground. The court rejected the argument that Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.94A.310(5) and former Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 69.50.435 violated the right to equal protection under the law. The sentence enhancement legislation applied alike to all persons in the designated class, who were those persons violating Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 69.50.401(a) within 1,000 feet of a schoolyard. There were reasonable grounds to distinguish between persons who engaged in the delivery of drugs within 1,000 feet of school grounds and those who delivered drugs elsewhere. The court found that the legislation was rationally related to the legitimate legislative purpose of providing increased protection for children. Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.94A.310(5) furthered a substantial state interest and was constitutional even under the intermediate scrutiny test.</SPAN></P>

Defendant's offender score was 10, and his standard sentence range was 22 to 29 months, all counts to run concurrently. Subsequently, defendant walked away from the honor camp. The escape court set his offender score at 11, and the court imposed a 51-month sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, defendant argued that some or all of the eight forgeries were based on the same criminal conduct, and the escape court should have used a lower offender score and a lower standard range. The forgery court's determination that the eight counts were not based on the same criminal conduct became final when it was not appealed, and defendant was not entitled to reopen the matter before the escape court. The escape court was obligated to follow the forgery court's decision, and its calculation of points was proper. The eight counts were indeed based on different criminal conduct. The eight forgeries occurred at different times or places, or involved different victims, or both. The decisions by both the forgery court and the escape court were correct. Given defendant's offender score of 11, the escape court was entitled to find that a sentence at the low end of the standard range, 51 months, was not clearly excessive within the meaning of Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.94A.390(1)(g), and the court was not required to grant an exceptional sentence downward as a matter of law.</SPAN></P>

R. 11 for the filing of a frivolous lawsuit against the count and board. The trial court held that neither facts nor law supported the attorney's position when he filed the complaint or when he moved for summary judgment, and a reasonable inquiry would have revealed this to him. On review, the court affirmed. Although a lawyer could not engage in formal discovery before a lawsuit, nevertheless it was expected that the lawyer had a reasonable factual basis with which to begin. Where important facts were easily ascertainable and where telephone calls and correspondence would have led a prudent person to further inquiry before resorting to legal process, the lawyer who simply filed suit and waited for the facts to sort themselves was subject to Wash. Super. Ct. Civ. R. 11 sanctions if it turned out that no facts supported his case. The court affirmed the imposition of sanctions in the form of attorney fees.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The entrepreneur was arrested and cited several times for selling sporting event tickets in a restricted area. The charges were eventually dismissed. The entrepreneur filed an amended complaint that alleged that the law was unconstitutional and that he had been damaged by a denial of rights and privileges guaranteed by the state and federal constitutions. The entrepreneur did not file a claim with the city as required by Seattle Wash. Mun. Code &sect; 5.24.005. That ordinance stated that no action should be commenced against the city until a written claim for damages had been presented to and filed with the city comptroller. It further prohibited the filing of a lawsuit within 60 days of the filing of the claim for damages unless the applicable statute of limitations would have expired within that period of time. By answering without raising the defense of failure to comply with the claim-filing ordinance and proceeding to defend the case for an appreciable time period while awaiting the running of the statute of limitations, the city took a type of misleading affirmative action. By doing so it was estopped from raising the defense of failure to comply with the ordinance.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment from the Superior Court for King County (Washington), which convicted him of attempted rape and robbery.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The evidence at defendant's trial for attempted rape and robbery showed that the victim was struck from behind by an assailant, a struggle ensued while the assailant attempted to rape the victim, the victim's purse and briefcase fell to the ground and the assailant made no attempt to retrieve them, the assailant forced the victim to move to a park area a block away, the victim was able to run away, and the defendant was later arrested shortly afterwards with the victim's address book and business card in his pocket. Defendant was found guilty and sentenced. On appeal, the court affirmed and held that: (1) there was sufficient evidence to show that defendant was guilty of robbery because a jury could have found that a taking occurred in the victim's presence when she was removed and prevented from approaching the place of the taking by the force and fear imposed by defendant; (2) the trial court properly instructed the jury on the definition of taking for purposes of constituting robbery; and (3) the robbery and attempted rape involved two objective intents that were properly considered by the trial court as separate crimes for purposes of defendant's sentence.</SPAN></P>

There was no requirement that defendant actually intended to cause bodily harm to the judge. All that was required was that defendant directed a threat to a judge. Criminal intent was not inferred because the legislature defined the crime as punishable for conduct alone. Communications that qualified as threats were outside the realm of protected speech. Furthermore, one could not innocently threaten to harm another person.

The court affirmed the decision of the trial court. The court determined that the couple went from an arbitration award against them to an adverse judgment at trial, plus statutory costs. Therefore an argument that the couple's claim was somehow more merited was somewhat disingenuous. The court held that the guardian ad litem was not entitled to recover expert witness fees under Wash. Super. Ct. Mandatory Arbitration R. 7.3. The court explained that costs under the Mandatory Arbitration Rules were limited to those items set forth in Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 4.84.010 and to award other than statutory costs would give a party recovering costs under the Mandatory Arbitration Rules an unwarranted recovery.

After the city informed the property owners that it could not approve the hotel because of the proposed height of the hotel, the property owners requested to examine all documents of the city prepared or reviewed in connection with the project.

The city argued that the documents were exempt from disclosure under the deliberative process exemption to the Washington public disclosure statute because they were preliminary recommendations and included opinions. They also argued that the documents were exempted by the work product doctrine and attorney client privilege. The court found that because the city cited the documents publicly in connection with its action denying the hotel, the deliberative process exemption did not apply. The court also found that it appeared that the work product doctrine and attorney client privilege also would not justify denying access to the documents, but it was necessary for the trial court to first conduct an in camera review of the documents before the court could rule definitively.</SPAN></P>

Further, the information was not defective where it did not describe the manner in which the assault allegedly occurred because the various manners in which an assault could have been committed did not comprise &quot;essential elements&quot; of the offense of fourth degree assault.

The trial court also denied the DNR's motion for summary judgment on the issue of damages.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with false swearing under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9A.72.040 for allegedly lying under oath while being interrogated by his insurance company's lawyer, who was investigating defendant's fire loss claim. The trial court arrested the judgment convicting defendant. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's decision. Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9A.72.040 provided: (1) A person was guilty of false swearing if he made a false statement, which he knew to be false, under an oath required or authorized by law. Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9A.72.010(3) defined the phrase &quot;required or authorized by law&quot;, as follows: an oath was required or authorized by law when the use of the oath was specifically provided for by statute or regulatory provision. The court disagreed with the state's argument that the investigation into the fire loss claim was an examination under oath and was approved under an insurance regulation. The court found that Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9A.72.040 failed to warn defendant of the potential for criminal prosecution by taking the insurance company's oath. The court concluded that the trial court's decision was correct.</SPAN></P>

The employee claimed that the administrative complaint process provided by the Industrial Insurance Act, specifically Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 51.48.025(2), did not preclude an independent tort action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee became temporarily disabled after his office was moved to an unventilated area where he was exposed to carbon monoxide fumes. When the employee returned to work, he was unable to resolve with his employer whether or under what conditions he could continue his employment. The employee filed suit for wrongful discharge and a claim for compensation benefits, which the employer did not contest. The trial court dismissed the employee's wrongful discharge suit. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court found that a tort claim for wrongful discharge did not arise because the Industrial Insurance Act, Wash. Rev. Code tit. 51, had its own remedial provisions. The court held that those provisions, Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 51.48.025, were exclusive and that the employee could not maintain an action for wrongful discharge. The court also rejected the employee's claims that &sect; 51.48.025 violated his right to equal protection, that it irrationally restricted the time period in which a class of discharged workers could initiate legal action to redress their injuries merely because they were discharged for asserting workers' compensation rights, and that it was unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court held that the municipal code was constitutional because it was not in conflict with Wash. Rev.

The court found that defendant's charging document was in the form of a citation since it was issued at the scene of the alleged crime. Since the document was a citation, the court ruled that it was sufficient since defendant was assumed to know the circumstances surrounding his arrest since it took place at the scene.</SPAN></P>

The court ruled that the defense had and did make use of a private consultant's report on the brakes of the defendant's car; therefore, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying his request for appointment of an accident reconstruction expert. The court held that there was substantial evidence that defendant did not apply his brakes. Under the rule of statutory construction, defendant was properly charged with both vehicular homicide and felony murder predicated on his attempt to elude a police car. The court concluded that the trial court's failure to give a Sherman instruction was harmless error. It was not within reasonable probability that the outcome would have been materially affected had the error not occurred.

He and his companions entered an elevator and stopped the elevator between floors by prying open the elevator doors as a prank. The student was injured after he jumped from the stalled elevator to the next lower floor level. The student brought an action for negligence against the university as a common carrier with respect to the condition of the elevator. The jury rendered a verdict for the university. On appeal, the court reversed the decision and held that the trial court erroneously instructed the jury on the university's duty of care as a common carrier. The university's knowledge of the pre-opening of the elevator doors by others and campus drinking raised a question of fact as to whether the university was negligent in failing to act on that knowledge, and the trial court's instruction removed the question of negligence from the jury. However, the court concluded that the university had no common law duty to prevent students from drinking and that the trial court's instruction to that effect was properly given. Further, the trial court did not err in rejecting proposed premises liability instructions or in excluding testimony.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was convicted of second degree assault, and the trial court imposed an exceptional sentence of 90 months, stating that the accuracy of the standard range was not an issue because he wanted defendant behind bars until at least the majority was reached by the child. Defendant appealed. The court affirmed the conviction but reversed the sentence and remanded for resentencing because the trial court's sentence was clearly excessive. The trial court failed to base the sentence on the proper offender score, and thus, on the crime itself, which contravened the stated purposes of the Sentencing Reform Act of 1981.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent horse owners brought suit against the board alleging that a rule enacted by the board, regarding the eligibility of a horse to race, violated 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 and several constitutional provisions, including the commerce clause. The board sought to dismiss the claim for lack of personal jurisdiction. The trial court denied the board's motion. On appeal, the court reversed. The court held that jurisdiction was not properly exercised over the board. The only act committed by the board was the enactment, in California, of a rule that purports to affect the eligibility of certain horses to race in states other than California. There was no evidence that the board attempted to enforce the rule in Washington. The court rejected the argument that the board had committed a tortious act in Washington because the rule violated a constitutional provision.

Rev. Code &sect; 69.53.010(1). The court did not find the statute unconstitutionally vague, as did the trial court. Rather, the court held that the statute did not criminalize defendant's acts or omissions. The court noted that the single jury instruction purporting to define the crime abbreviated the statute, stating only that it was unlawful for one knowingly to rent or make available for the prohibited use a building. The court held that &sect; 69.53.010(1) made criminal only the positive act of putting into possession of property, by renting or leasing or in a way similar to renting or leasing, one who defendant then knew intended to use the property for a prohibited purpose. The statute did not criminalize passive acquiescence in such use, based on knowledge acquired after possession was delivered.</SPAN></P>

Defendant claimed, among other things, that the information was defective because it only alleged defendant &quot;unlawfully&quot; delivered cocaine and did not specify that he knew the identity of the substance he delivered. The court held that an information which charged a crime in the language of &sect; 69.50.401(a) was sufficient, and it was not necessary to include the nonstatutory element of guilty knowledge. Further, the trial court correctly refused to instruct the jury that possession was a lesser included offense of delivery. There was no affirmative evidence that defendant simply possessed cocaine. He denied possessing cocaine at all. The State's evidence was that he delivered it. Moreover, contrary to defendant's claims, defendant attempted the transfer of the cocaine. The officers merely refused to accept the cocaine, choosing instead to make their arrest at that time. Finally, in light of the time spent on defendant's case, apportioning $ 700 of the $ 4,000 contract sum received by defendant's court appointed attorney to defendant's case was reasonable.</SPAN></P>

Appellants, trustee and executor, sought review of the superior court's decision denying a usury penalty deduction under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 19.52.030. The lender filed a cross-appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The borrower suffered financial setbacks and negotiated a loan. The borrower's aunts executed a deed of trust, securing the loan with their house. Subsequently, the lender refinanced the loan. The borrower signed an affidavit stating that the refinanced loan was for commercial purposes. After the borrower failed to make payments, the lender issued foreclosure notices. The borrower and his aunts sought injunctive relief. The trial court granted the lender's summary judgment motion on the borrower's usury claim and held that the notes were usurious as to the aunts but denied a usury penalty deduction under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 19.52.030. In a consolidated appeal, the court reversed the grant of summary judgment and held that a factual issue existed as to whether the lender reasonably relied upon the borrower's business purpose certificate. Thus, summary judgment was improperly granted under the business purpose exemption of Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 19.52.080. The court vacated the trial court's judgment as to the aunts' trustee because the aunts were sureties, and, as such, their liability rested upon the determination of the borrower's liability and on potential suretyship issues.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court held that the lab report was not per se unconstitutional, and as a Rule 6.13(b) hearsay exception met the Confrontation Clause test. The court determined that defendant did not waive a constitutional right but rather a right under Rule 6:13(b) when the lab report was admitted under the rule that it was constitutional.

Defendant had also sold an undercover officer several films that contained children involved in sexually explicit acts. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded. The court found that although the affidavit in support of the search warrant did not provide probable cause for the seizure of adult pornography, pornographic drawings, sexual paraphernalia, or correspondence or papers, and therefore the search warrant was overbroad, the valid portions of the search warrant could be severed from the invalid portions. The court reasoned that the affidavit and the warrant unmistakably indicated that child pornography was the primary target of the warrant, and under those circumstances, it was irrelevant that a substantial portion of the warrant was invalid. The court also found that the use of the word &quot;children&quot; rather than the statutory term &quot;minor&quot; did not defeat the validity of the warrant.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed, remanded her case for a new trial, and found that the superior court committed reversible error by not giving the jury a unanimity instruction and instructions defining all the elements of the crimes charged. On all three counts on which she was convicted, the court found that the evidence was sufficient to support a finding that she participated in multiple events of the offending activity any one of which would have been sufficient to convict her. Accordingly, she was entitled to a jury instruction to the effect that all 12 jurors were required to agree that the same underlying criminal act has been proved beyond a reasonable doubt in order to assure a unanimous verdict. The court also ruled that the instructions on two counts for the violations of &sect; 68.46.210 and Wash. Rev.

He further contended that the omission rendered the subject information fatally defective and required dismissal. Defendant asserted that nonstatutory elements such as guilty knowledge were required to be included to withstand constitutional attack. The court on appeal affirmed the trial court's judgment based on its determination that, because defendant had failed to raise any objection to the sufficiency of the information in the trial court, the challenged information was immune from attack unless found so obviously defective as not to charge an offense by a reasonable construction. The court found the information followed the language of the statute which clearly defined the crime.

Rev. Code &sect; 70.44.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant municipal corporation and hospital district sought to recover losses from its treasurer's unsuccessful investments. Appellee insurer brought a declaratory action to determine its duty to cover the loss under the policy. The policy covered claims for a wrongful act for all loss for which an officer or director became legally obligated to pay, if the loss was one for which the district was permitted by law to indemnify its officer or director. The trial court found the policy did not cover the claim. Appellee argued that the loss had to have resulted from a third party action and not for the wrongful act of another officer. On appeal, the court reversed, finding that while claims against directors and officers traditionally were third party suits such as shareholders' derivative actions, coverage for direct action was not antithetical to the purposes of the policies. If an insurer did not want to cover such claims, they could easily write exclusions in their contracts.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's order in declaratory action by municipal corporation that an insurance policy did not cover loss was reversed because where such a corporation was permitted by common law to indemnify its treasurer for a loss caused by its own claim, the policy was available to pay the claim where it had not excluded coverage.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, a spiritual leader and the foundation with which he was affiliated, challenged two judgments of the Superior Court for King County (Washington), one of which entered summary judgment in favor of respondents, newspaper and reporters, and the second of which dismissed the leader and foundation's defamation complaint for failure to comply with discovery rules.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A spiritualists and his foundation filed a series of actions in which they alleged that they were libeled in newspaper articles. The spiritualist and foundation contended the trial court erred in dismissing the action for failure to comply with discovery orders because the material requested violated their First Amendment rights of freedom of association and free exercise of religion. The court held that the findings of prior cases and the fact that protective orders were issued already determined there was no probability of a constitutional issue. Further, the court ruled that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in dismissing the complaint pursuant to its broad discretion under Wash. R. Civ. P. 37, that the concept of &quot;frivolity&quot; as set forth in Wash. Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4.84.185 pertaining to the award of attorney's fees was not unconstitutional, and that the trial court's finding of a violation of Wash. R. Civ. P. 11 was not an abuse of discretion. The court remanded on the issue of the amount of attorney's fees, however, because the record was not clear as to the trial court's reasoning for the amount set. The newspaper's request for attorney's fees on appeal was denied.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the decisions of the trial court in favor of the newspaper and reporters, except as to the issue of the amount of attorney's fees. The court, retaining jurisdiction, referred the matter to the trial court judge who entered the orders for an additional finding as to attorney's fees to be awarded the newspaper and reporters through trial or, alternatively, for supplementation of the record.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner attorney sought review of the order of the Superior Court for Spokane County (Washington) that granted partial summary judgment on the issue of liability to respondent clients in their action for legal malpractice.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The clients alleged that the attorney was negligent in not filing an underinsured motorist claim with their insurer before the effective date of a Washington statute that placed a cap on noneconomic damages. The court found that the attorney's decision not to file the claim was correct, not because his prediction that the statute was unconstitutional proved to be accurate but because Washington law did not apply to the client's claim. The court noted that the automobile accident and injury occurred in Florida and that the tortfeasor was a resident of Florida. The court applied a significant relationship test to conclude that Florida had the most significant relationship to the clients' claim and that Florida law, therefore, applied to it. Contrary to the argument made by the clients, the court found that the significant relationship test, a tort choice-of-law test, was appropriate because whatever claim they had for underinsured motorist coverage depended upon the tort liability of the negligent driver.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The partial summary judgment of liability in favor of the clients was reversed and the cause was remanded with directions to the trial court that summary judgment be entered in favor of the attorney.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of violating a city lewd conduct ordinance pursuant to Seattle, Wash., Seattle Municipal Code &sect; 12A.10.070. On review, the issues raised was whether the charges against defendant should have been dismissed because the ordinance in question was unconstitutionally overbroad and vague and whether the charges should have been dismissed for failing to sufficiently state a crime. The court held that the complaint was insufficient and that the ordinance was unconstitutionally overbroad. In support of the finding that the complaint was insufficient, the court found that the complaint omitted the statutory element that defendant had to know that the lewd conduct was likely to cause reasonable affront or alarm. Therefore, the court concluded that because the complaint failed to allege facts supporting the omitted element, it was constitutionally defective, violating defendant's due process right to be apprised with reasonable certainty of the nature of the accusation against him. Further reasoning, the court found that the ordinance contained no exemption for nonobscene, expressive nude activity, and concluded that the ordinance was facially overbroad.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the owner's vehicle was seized he elected to have a forfeiture hearing in superior court. The owner contended that the superior court erred by denying his motion to dismiss, by admitting hearsay testimony, and by denying his motion to suppress. Appellant contended that the trial court violated his rights to compulsory process under U.S. Const. amend. VI and Wash. Const. art. 1, sec. 22 by failing to order the production of a material witness who could corroborate the owner's testimony that he did not use his Porsche to complete the drug transaction. The court held that the lower court did not err by refusing to dismiss the case because even if the witness had testified, his testimony would not likely have changed the result. The court held that whether the hearsay the owner objected to should have been excluded was immaterial because the same evidence would have come in through the owner's own testimony. Neither did the trial court err in denying the owner's motion to suppress certain evidence because even if the testimony in support of the search warrant that was objected to was excised, the remaining information established probable cause.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parents of an adult who was killed in a traffic accident filed suit against the driver who was at fault. They sought damages under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 4.24.010 for their son's companionship, assistance, services, love, counsel, guidance and support. The action was dismissed on summary judgment, but the case was remanded to allow the parents to show that they were dependent on their son for support, a prerequisite for suit under &sect; 4.24.010. Again, summary judgment was granted for the driver, and the parents sought review. The court affirmed the judgment, holding that the parents could not maintain their action unless they were financially dependent on their son. The dependence necessary to support an action had to be based on a current condition, not on a promise of future services or anticipated future dependence. Because it was undisputed that the parents were not financially dependent on their son, summary judgment in favor of the driver was proper. The court rejected the parents' claim that &sect; 4.24.010 violated equal protection guarantees. Parents who were financially dependent on an adult child were affected more directly by that child's death than were nondependent parents.</SPAN></P>

This decision was upheld on appeal wherein it was also established in the decision upholding the dismissal that the money and glasses were given in exchange for certain favors, but that the state was improperly allowed to amend the information after completing its case in chief. The court reversed, noting that Cr. R. 2.3(e) was applied to situations in which property had been voluntarily given and that the individual had the burden to prove her right to possession. The court concluded that the transaction resembled an illegal contract because it was connected to a bribe and that the court should have left the parties as it found them, with the city in possession of the property.</SPAN></P>

The trial court denied attorney's fees. The court affirmed. The court noted that the ordinance's open booth requirement involved no subject matter restraint and held that the county's concern that the panoram machines presented a health hazard justified its enactment. The court found that the open booth requirement did not constitute an invasion of customers' privacy. The license fees were found to be reasonably related to the costs of administration and enforcement of the ordinance. The 30-day time period to decide on license applications was held to be reasonable.

The court concluded that the prosecutor's representation of defendant, who was the county auditor, did not create a conflict of interest because there was no evidence that any information that the prosecutor obtained in the previous actions was interwoven with this action's facts. The court also held that Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9A.68.010(1)(b) was not overbroad because implying an element of corrupt intent ensured that protected activity was not punished, that there was not unfettered discretion in charging defendant because Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 42.20.010(1), (2) lacked the corrupt intent or agreement elements that were contained in Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9A.68.010(1)(b), and that a remand was needed because the factual findings as to the bribery counts were inadequate for determining if each requisite element was found.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Code &sect; 46.20.021. The superior court affirmed the district court ruling and denied the drivers' motion to reconsider.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On two separate occasions, the police officer arrested the drivers for driving without valid driver's licenses. The district court found that the beliefs of the drivers were sincere and central to their religious convictions, but determined that the statute requiring the drivers to obtain a valid driver's license was a valid exercise of police power and furthered a compelling state interest in road safety. The district court found the drivers guilty of operating a motor vehicle without a valid driver's license. The superior court affirmed the district court ruling and denied the drivers' motion to reconsider. On appeal, the court affirmed the superior court, finding that requiring the drivers to obtain a driver's license had not unconstitutionally infringed upon their freedom of movement. While the drivers had met the first criterion for First Amendment protection because their convictions were sincere and central to their beliefs, the state had a compelling interest in protecting the safety of all third party highway users who shared the road.

Rev. Code &sect; 51.24.060(2), with respect to a settlement the worker obtained in a third-party action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The worker sustained work-related injuries, and pursuant to statute, he elected to pursue a third party action against the party who caused the injuries, seeking $ 900,000. After he settled that action for $ 150,000, he asked the Department to substantially compromise its &sect; 51.24.060(2) lien against the settlement. The Department made a minimal lien compromise sufficient only to allow the worker the full benefit of a fee reduction undertaken by his attorneys. A hearing examiner approved the Department's compromise, and after the worker was refused administrative review, he appealed to the trial court. On appeal, the court ruled that, as a matter of law, the Department's policy against compromising in cases where settlement had already occurred was not permitted by Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 51.24.060(3). The plain language of the statute militated against the Department's ability to use the fact that a case had already settled as a significant factor against compromise. Moreover, while the Department's asserted interest in protecting insurance funds was not unreasonable, that interest could not override other, equally legitimate, considerations such as the plight of injured workers.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's judgment and remanded the action to the Department for consideration of the worker's compromise request.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent trustees of a marital deduction trust brought an action for a declaration of rights, naming appellant charities and respondent beneficiaries of the family trust as defendants. The charities sought review of the decision of the Superior Court for King County (Washington), which entered a judgment awarding the residue of the marital deduction trust to the beneficiaries of a family trust as opposed to the charities.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The testatrix's husband created a marital deduction trust in her favor and granted her a testamentary power of appointment. The testatrix's will contained a gift of the residue to the charities. The issue was whether the testatrix validly exercised her power of appointment over the trust, and thus whether the trust funds were to be given to the charities, or consolidated with the family trust. The charities appealed a judgment that the testatrix did not validly exercise her power of appointment in accordance with former Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 11.95.060. The court affirmed. The court addressed only the argument that Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 11.95.060(2) was enacted in violation of the state constitution, because the remaining contentions were meritless. The court held that &sect; 11.95.060 did not violate Wash. Const. art. 2, &sect; 19 because the title of the act referenced the general subject of trusts and there was a rational unity between the trust and a power of appointment. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in refusing the charities' request for attorney fees because the charities' &quot;benefit to trust&quot; argument was properly considered and rejected below under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 11.96.140.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court, which entered a judgment awarding the residue of the marital deduction trust to the beneficiaries as opposed to the charities.

The court determined that permitting religiously affiliated child welfare agencies to file parental termination petitions did not involve the type of excessive entanglement of church and state that raised Establishment Clause concerns. The court ruled that the issue could not be raised for the first time on appeal because the alleged error as framed in the appeal was not &quot;truly of constitutional magnitude.&quot; The court determined that whatever &quot;symbolic link&quot; may have arisen from the mere filing of the termination petitions by the religiously affiliated child welfare agencies was insufficient to render &sect; 13.34.180&nbsp;unconstitutional on its face.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Decedent jumped out of the window of his hospital room to his death moments after his mother came to visit him. The mother claimed that Wash. Rev.

However, the mother, as the parent of an adult son, had to be dependent in order to recover damages. The court found that &sect; 4.24.010 did not affect fundamental rights or create a suspect class, it was subject to minimal scrutiny and the court concluded that the state had a rational basis for creating a claim for the wrongful death of a child on whom a parent was dependent. The court found that the it was error to dismiss the mother's claims for outrage and negligent infliction of emotional distress. The mother was not economically dependent on her son as she was within the class of immediate family members enumerated in &sect; 4.24.010 and the economic status of dependency was not relevant.

The court affirmed the judgment. The court stated that under the Fourth Amendment and Wash.

A bench trial was conducted, and at conclusion of the trial, defendant's counsel filed a motion to dismiss on the basis that &sect; 9.68A.090, was unconstitutionally vague. The trial court denied the motion and found defendant guilty as charged on both counts. The court reversed the judgment, by holding that &sect; 9.68A.090, was unconstitutionally vague as applied to defendant's conduct because his conduct did not clearly fall within the constitutional &quot;core&quot; of the statute, as defined by the legislature.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Superior Court for Grant County (Washington) that found him guilty of one count of possession and two counts of delivery of lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD). At the time of a search, defendant had been a member of a job corps, and the LSD was found in his underwear after a strip search by the corps' personnel. Defendant admitted during interrogation by the personnel that he had sold two LSD tablets.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was a job-corps enrollee, and the supervisor was told by a student leader that defendant had been selling drugs. After a search of the enrollee's pockets by which an unidentified leaf part was found, an LSD tablet was found in his underwear during a strip search. Defendant also confessed in writing to selling two LSD tablets. He appealed his conviction to the court. The court reversed the trial court's judgment and directed dismissal of the cause. An apparently voluntary confession became involuntary with any direct or implied promise however slight. The court found that the supervisor implied to defendant that things would go easier by dealing with job-corps personnel rather than the police, and this combined with the length of the interrogation and the type of questioning made the confession improperly obtained. Also because the LSD tablet was seized as a result of a search which, per the court, exceeded permissible scope, the ensuing confession was tainted per the fruit-of-a-poisonous-tree doctrine. Regarding the search, the court found, inter alia, that the job corps appeared to violate 20 C.F.R. &sect; 684.94(b)(3) by seeking evidence for a criminal prosecution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Ruling in favor of defendant, the court reversed the trial court's judgment and ruled that the cause of action was dismissed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The ordinance in question prohibited development of substandard lots in common ownership when the lot was needed to satisfy the least restrictive of lot area, lot coverage, setback, or yard requirements. The property owners argued that the ordinance exceeded the reasonable police power of the City, constituted a taking of property without due processor compensation, and violated their right to equal protection. The court affirmed the judgment because there was no evidence that the property owners had applied for a building permit, therefore had not obtained vested rights. The court noted that it was clear the ordinance would promote public interest in encouraging infill housing and encourage rehabilitation of existing housing. Furthermore, the court found that under the rational basis test, the ordinance did not violate the owners' equal protection rights.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's three-year-old son died a few hours after defendant kicked the child in the abdomen, which caused a ruptured bowel. On appeal, defendant argued that the felony murder rule should not have applied to the felonies with which he was charged. Defendant also argued that the 60-year sentence was &quot;clearly excessive&quot; and that it constituted cruel and unusual punishment under the state and federal constitutions. The court disagreed and affirmed the conviction and sentence, holding that defendant was properly convicted because any felony will support a charge for second-degree felony murder. The court also held that the trial court had substantial and compelling reasons to impose a 60-year sentence in that defendant not only knowingly inflicted grievous bodily harm, but also ignored obvious signs of suffering, as well as statements by others that the child needed immediate medical treatment. In holding that the sentence was not clearly excessive, and certainly not cruel and unusual punishment, the court stated that considering the gravity of defendant's offense, it would have been perverse to declare his sentence &quot;shocking to the sense of justice.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A driver was arrested while driving defendant's car. In the car, officers found cocaine. They seized the car, and, at the forfeiture hearing, defendant denied knowledge of the cocaine, testified that that was the only time that he loaned the car to the driver, and that the car was blue when he bought it for $ 7,000. The State presented evidence that defendant paid $ 9,000 for the car, that it was yellow and black, and that police had seen the driver operating the car before. The trial court found that defendant's testimony was not credible and that he failed to show that he had no knowledge that the car was being used to transport a controlled substance. On appeal, the court affirmed. Wash. Rev. Code &sect;&sect; 69.50.505(a), (e) and &sect; 69.50.506(a) unambiguously provided that defendant had to prove that the offense was committed without his knowledge or consent. Also, there was sufficient evidence to support the finding that his testimony denying knowledge or consent was not credible. A bill of sale indicated that the price of the car was $ 9,170. Police had seen the driver operating the car before. Photos developed from negatives found in the car showed that it had been yellow and black.</SPAN></P>

The court rejected this contention, finding that no equitable defenses could preclude enforcement of lawful tariff rates and that no act or omission by the carrier, except for expiration of the statute of limitations, could prevent enforcement of those rates. The court also rejected the shipper's claim of accord and satisfaction, finding that the carrier had to charge rates in accordance with legally required and filed tariffs and that even a misquotation by the carrier would not preclude the carrier from seeking the proper charges.

The city surveyed governmental agencies that managed public golf courses in order to negotiate a new contract with the independent contractor. The city gave the independent contractor a copy of the golf survey report that it complied but refused to provide copies of the completed questionnaires. The independent contractor filed an action against the city to obtain access to the public records. The trial court held that the survey report was the final document, that the questionnaires were not public record because they were merely the &quot;sense impressions&quot; used to create the report, and that the production of the documents was moot because they had been discarded. The court reversed and remanded. The court held that the action was not moot because questions of costs, attorney fees, and the statutory award remained. The questionnaires were public record because they were prepared by a governmental agency, responded to by other governmental agencies, and were the final evidence of the knowledge obtained.

They searched defendant's garbage can, which was on the street right of way, about 15 feet from his property line. On the basis of evidence partially obtained from the garbage can, a search warrant was issued. Based on the evidence seized from defendant's residence, he was charged with possession of legend drugs and controlled substances. Thereafter, the trial court granted defendant's suppression motion, concluding that probable cause to search the residence did not exist without the information obtained from the garbage. The court noted that Wash. Const. art. 1, &sect; 7 generally provided greater protection against warrantless searches and seizures than the Fourth Amendment. Upon consideration of case law factors used to determine whether to resort to independent state constitutional grounds, the court concluded that art. 1, &sect; 7 should not be construed to provide greater protection to garbage than was provided by the U.S. Constitution. This was especially so in light of the lack of law preexisting the Washington Constitution and the lack of current regulation designed to protect a privacy interest in garbage.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, who was convicted of possession of cocaine, claimed that an investigative stop was unconstitutional under state law because it was without the &quot;authority of law&quot; required by Wash.

Defendant argued that the constitutionality of such a stop under federal constitutional law did not obviate the necessity for an independent state constitutional law analysis, and that no principle of state law authorized a stop absent probable cause. The court rejected defendant's position and affirmed his conviction. A prior decision of the state's highest court had held that investigative stops were constitutional under Wash. Const. art. 1, &sect;7, that the scope of the protection afforded by the provision was freedom only from unreasonable searches and seizures, that articulable and individualized suspicion by an officer gave rise to the reasonableness necessary to justify the intrusion, and that the intrusion did not rise to the level of requiring &quot;authority of law.&quot; Alternatively, the &quot;authority&quot; was based on the need for societal protection from criminal activity and officers had that authority by the nature of their office and to protect themselves from danger.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with two counts of delivery of cocaine and was subsequently convicted of both counts. Defendant appealed, claiming that the information charging him with the offense was constitutionally insufficient requiring dismissal of the charges because it did not enunciate the guilty knowledge element, which was necessary in an information charging unlawful delivery. The court affirmed and ruled that although the better practice would be for prosecutors to allege &quot;knowingly&quot; in plain language, the information in defendant's case containing the phrase &quot;unlawfully and feloniously&quot; was equivalent to alleging that defendant knowingly performed the act of which he was accused. Thus, the information against defendant was constitutionally sufficient because the State's inclusion of the phrase &quot;unlawfully and feloniously&quot; supplied the element of knowledge necessary for the averment in the information.</SPAN></P>

He fatally stabbed one officer in the chest with a sword and barricaded himself in his apartment for 17 hours. The acting commander at the scene tried several times to communicate with the decedent. The Emergency Response Team was sent in to retrieve him. After he attacked one officer and it appeared as if he was charging the other officers with his sword, he was shot to death. Upon review, the court found that the estate failed to demonstrate that the city's official policymaker sanctioned any policies that might have given rise to the alleged constitutional deprivation. The court observed that prior incidents that involved barricaded individuals ended with the officers safely removing them. The court stated that even if the acting commander had wrongfully carried out his duties, no wrong could be ascribed to the city's policymaker and the city could only have been liable under the theory of respondeat superior. The court stated that was not a proper ground for municipal liability under &sect; 1983. The court affirmed the judgment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment from the Superior Court for Snohomish County, Washington, that convicted him of theft in the first degree, filing a false claim of loss, and two counts of forgery.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that the trial court erroneously instructed the jury regarding the elements of the offenses, that the State failed to prove that he committed the offenses in Washington, and that there was insufficient evidence to support the convictions. Defendant also claimed that his sentence was disproportionately excessive. The court determined that evidence showed that defendant stole property and then participated in claim scheme to obtain insurance funds for the stolen property. The court held that there was sufficient evidence to support all of the counts, except the theft count, which was based upon an alleged false report of a burglary, which did in fact occur. The court also held that it was not necessary for the jury to find that the offenses were committed in Washington, because jurisdiction was undisputed by the evidence, and the jury instructions sufficiently included the elements of the offenses. The court also held that defendant's sentence was in proportion to the amount of money that was involved and did not violate U.S. Const. amend. VIII or Wash. Const. art. 1, &sect; 14.</SPAN></P>

The deferred prosecution was revoked and at trial defendant argued that the police report was insufficient to support conviction, he was denied access to his attorney after his arrest, and he was denied the opportunity to secure a blood test. The trial court found that the police report contained sufficient evidence to support defendant's guilt for driving while intoxicated and that defendant, by stipulating to deferred prosecution, had waived the right to raise new defenses. The trial court also found that the police had not denied defendant access to his attorney. The lower court affirmed and so did the court. The court held that the proper construction of Wash. Rev.

The distributor brought an action for wrongful termination and tortious interference. The lower court held that the Act was inapplicable and dismissed the tortious interference claim. The court affirmed the lower court's decision and held that the supplier relied on its right to terminate the distributor for any reason upon reasonable notice. Thus, the Act substantially impaired the distribution agreement. Further, there was no showing that the Act was a legitimate exercise of police power. Therefore, under U.S. Const. art. 1, &sect; 10 and Wash. Const. art. 1, &sect; 23, the Act was limited to distributorship agreements after its effective date.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant had wanted to impeach the informant with undated and unsigned letters that were allegedly written by the informant 15 years earlier in which he tried to induce a witness in an unrelated case to give false testimony. Defendant alleged that he was unconstitutionally denied the right to confront the informant. Defendant also argued that the trial court improperly instructed the jury on the effects of his decision not to testify. On appeal, the court affirmed the convictions. Defendant's right to confront a witness was subject to the state's compelling interest in having witnesses come forward to testify without fear of revealing a prior conviction. The trial court had already admitted evidence of the informant's drug use, his prior forgery and shoplifting charges, and payment by the police. Using the letters as extrinsic evidence of the informant's credibility was improper under Wash. R. Evid. 608(b). There was no abuse of discretion by the trial court. The court found that the trial court instructed the jury of defendant's failure to testify under Wash.

A Washington state trooper traveled to the hospital in Oregon where he found defendant unconscious in the emergency room. The trooper testified that he smelled intoxicants coming from defendant's mouth. The trooper advised defendant, while unconscious, that he was under arrest for vehicular homicide and then directed a nurse to draw a blood sample. The sample showed a blood alcohol level of .15. Defendant was convicted of vehicular homicide, and the court affirmed. It held that the arrest in Oregon by a Washington trooper was lawful under the Uniform Act on Fresh Pursuit, Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 10.89.010. The court also ruled that the State had established a prima facie case that the blood sample was unadulterated.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff employee appealed a judgment of the Superior Court for Snohomish County (Washington) dismissing her claims of age discrimination, harassment, emotional distress, and constructive discharge. The employee claimed that she established a prima facie case of age discrimination under the direct evidence theory and therefore, the trial court erred by applying the McDonnell Douglas analysis.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee filed suit against the employer alleging age discrimination and other related claims. In dismissing the age discrimination claim, the trial court concluded that although the employee satisfied her prima facie case, she failed to satisfy her burden of proving that age was the determinative factor in the employment decision. On review, the employee claimed that she established a prima facie case of age discrimination under the direct evidence theory and therefore, the trial court erred by applying the McDonnell Douglas analysis. The appeals court rejected the employee's claim that the direct evidence theory was presented to the trial court because she failed to state the law regarding that theory or request the trial court to apply the direct evidence theory. In addition, the court declined to adopt the distinction made by federal courts in construing cases involving direct evidence of discrimination because it was likely to confuse the jury. Thus, because age was merely one factor in the promotion decision, but discrimination was not the determinative factor, the employee did not meet her burden of proving the proffered reasons were a mere pretext for discrimination.</SPAN></P>

He contended that his manic depression illness rendered him incapable of refusal, and that requiring him to exercise an intelligent judgment whether to submit to a blood alcohol test was an unconstitutional denial of due process. The trial court upheld the revocation of the license and the driver appealed. The court affirmed. The court held that temporary psychosis or insanity was not a defense to license revocation for refusing to submit to a test to determine the alcohol content of one's blood or breath. The court held that &sect; 46.20.308 did not state that the driver's decision to refuse the test must have been knowingly and intelligently made. The driver, who was a conscious person who had been given the required warnings and a meaningful opportunity to be heard, but who was incapable of responding knowingly and intelligently to the warnings, was not deprived of any right granted to him under &sect; 46.20.308.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was prosecuted for failing to return a leased truck contrary to Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9A.56.095(1)(b). The leasing company had a residential address for him, and it later found a post office box address. Apparently on the advice of police, the company sent statutory notice by certified mail, addressed to defendant's post office box. The notice was returned unclaimed. Defendant was convicted in a bench trial after the trial court rejected his claim of inadequate notice. It held that the Legislature intended the statutory term &quot;last known place of residence&quot; to be used synonymously with the term &quot;last known address,&quot; and specifically found that when a statute called for the mailing of notice by registered or certified mail, it was the intent of the Legislature that notice was complete upon mailing to defendant's last known address, whether a street address or a post office box. The court reversed, rejecting the trial court's interpretation of what the court held was a crystal clear statute. Because the State failed to prove that the notice required as a prerequisite of prosecution was given in the manner clearly specified by the statute, defendant's conviction was reversed.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Code &sect; 82.38, the contractor appealed a judgment of the Superior Court for King County (County) upholding an administrative decision denying reassessment and assessing a final amount of additional tax, penalties, and interest.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The department claimed that the contractor did not maintain adequate records on its use of tax exempt fuel and that the contractor owed special fuel tax on all the diesel fuel it purchased during the reporting period. The contractor contended that its record keeping was adequate to prove the off-road use of the fuel that it claimed was exempt. The court determined that an amendment to the former Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 82.38.140 exempting the contractor from record keeping operated retroactively because the amendment was procedural and did not affect substantial rights. The court further found that the department had no vested rights to the special fuel tax paid under protest. The court concluded that the department made an error of law because its findings of fact, conclusions of law, and proposed order were clearly based on the former statute and, therefore, the department applied an inappropriate legal standard. The court further found that the record was insufficient to determine whether the contractor had proved the amount of fuel that had been consumed in off-road vehicles.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the trial judge remanded to the Commission, and the Commission affirmed the legality of &sect; 260-70-021. The owner again appealed, and the trial court affirmed the Commission. The court affirmed the judgment. The Commission did not err by failing to apply criminal law to its administrative hearing because the procedure was a civil process. The Commission did not err by not dismissing the case because the State destroyed an optional blood sample, as the urine test was positive. There was no merit to the claim that the owner received improper notice, and the Commission properly exercised its wide discretion when it received evidence as to the horse's urine sample.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A former member brought an action against a political party (party) seeking damages for the political party's refusal to return a political contribution. The political party counterclaimed against him. The lower court granted the former member's motion, which compelled the political party to provide discovery concerning the political party's eviction from former headquarters, and search for new headquarters. The lower court entered a default judgment in favor of the former member on the party's counterclaims. The court affirmed in part and reversed in part, holding that: (1) the court had jurisdiction over the former member's tort and contract claims against the party, inasmuch as the claims concerned the party's legal disputes, rather than the party's internal or political disputes; (2) the party failed to establish that the discovery requests concerning the party's eviction from the former headquarters, and search for new headquarters would have impinged on the party's First Amendment rights, as was required for a protective order prohibiting such discovery; and (3) the lower court did not specify whether a sanction less harsh than default would have sufficed.</SPAN></P>

The city claimed in part that the civil rights violations were not the proximate cause of his damages.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">While an appeal was pending in his dispute with the city over a building permit, the permit applicant filed an action for damages, alleging due process and equal protection violations, violations of 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983, and negligent and tortious interference with business expectations. He also sought attorney's fees under 42 U.S.C. &sect; 1988. The city appealed from a jury verdict in his favor. The court affirmed the judgment below in part and reversed it in part. The court ruled that he exercised his own business judgment in a number of respects, which precluded a finding that the city's actions were the proximate cause of his damages. Thus, the issue of proximate cause should not have gone to the jury, and his civil rights claims should have been dismissed as a matter of law. His substantive due process claims also failed. To show a denial of substantive due process, he had to show conduct that was arbitrary and unreasonable. The fact that the city was steadfast in its position and never sought an outside opinion did not demonstrate arbitrary or unreasonable conduct. That the city's interpretation of the relevant statute was wrong, but was not a violation of substantive due process.</SPAN></P>

King County, Wash., Code &sect; 11.04.190 made all animal control violations misdemeanors, and King County, Wash., Code &sect; 11.04.200 mandated a civil penalty in addition to or as an alternative to criminal punishment. The court stated that it was constitutionally permissible to provide civil or criminal penalties, or both, in the same act. The court also noted that the maximum civil penalty was $ 250. The court ruled that the &quot;civil penalty&quot; in King County, Wash., Code &sect; 11.04.200, based on a properly proven violation of King County, Wash., Code &sect; 11.04.230(H), was constitutional. Further, the court held that King County, Wash., Code &sect; 11.04.230(H), which proscribed maintaining any animal that had exhibited vicious propensities and constituted a danger to the safety of others, was sufficiently definite.

The State's interest in protecting its children from sexual exploitation was sufficiently compelling to justify prohibiting possession of child pornography. Therefore, &sect; 9.68A.070 did not impermissibly violate defendant's constitutional right to privacy. Defendant's overbreadth and vagueness arguments were sketchy and confused, and contained only minimal citations to authority.

The father alleged that he had been denied procedural due process, there was insufficient evidence to support the termination, and Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 13.34.180(1), (2) was unconstitutional. The child had previously been declared dependent through proceedings initiated by respondent social services department.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">As an infant, the child was determined to be dependent. The parents were offered counseling and substance abuse treatment; however, they were unsuccessful. The father's parental rights were terminated when the child was three years old. On appeal, the father alleged that his due process rights were denied during the dependency proceedings. The court affirmed the termination and held that any procedural due process error that affected the father's participation at the dependency hearing was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. The child was five years old, and the father's belated challenge to the process afforded him resulted in the child's spending over two additional years in foster care. The father participated in some of the proceedings and had waived appellate review of venue, process, and personal jurisdiction challenges not timely raised in the trial court. The attack on the constitutionality of Wash. Rev. Code &sect;&sect; 13.34.180, 13.34.190(1), which permitted a termination to be based in part upon a dependency established by a preponderance of the evidence, was without merit. There was substantial evidence to support the termination, which was in the child's best interests.</SPAN></P>

This issue was not properly before it. The court affirmed the dismissal of the petition, holding that the lapse of time between defendant's first arrest in Washington and the Governor of Massachusetts' issuance of the extradition warrant was beyond the scope of the court's consideration in the habeas corpus proceeding.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court had previously issued a dependency order removing the children from the mother's custody upon its determination that the mother suffered from chronic mental illness.

After a hearing, the trial court entered an order terminating the mother's parental rights to the children. The mother appealed the termination and dependency review orders. The court held that the dependency review orders were proper because the record clearly demonstrated that the children had been harmed by the mother's delusions and would have been in danger of suffering additional harm if continued in their presence. The mother's delusions were not constitutionally protected speech but, even so, the protection of the welfare of the children prevailed over the mother's rights.

However, the teacher applied for and received unemployment compensation for the weeks during the Christmas vacation period. Thereafter, the department issued a determination notice denying the teacher's eligibility for unemployment compensation and ordered him to repay the money. On appeal, the court affirmed and held that Wash. Rev.

All substitute teachers were treated alike under &sect; 50.44.050, in that none received unemployment compensation during a school vacation if they were reasonably assured of employment in the succeeding term. There was a rational basis for the classifications in &sect; 50.44.050 and substitute teachers were treated alike under the statute.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowner bought two tracts of land within the relevant tract, and paid two membership fees. Assessments were levied on the lots for improvements to a water system. The landowner argued because the association did not follow its bylaws as to notice or quorums for a meeting and membership approval of the assessments, it was without power to collect interest and attorney fees on a delinquent assessment. On appeal, the court held that because a poll did not request a vote on whether the capital assessment should be made, but only dealt with financing, there was no approval by the relevant membership of the capital assessment. The trial court's conclusion that the assessment was appropriately made was erroneous. But the court held that the landowner, by his actions or inactions, was estopped to challenge the validity of the assessments. And, although a departure from 1-person, 1-vote could have been justified, no authority was found which was persuasive that such a departure was constitutionally mandated. Accordingly, the court held that the landowner could not challenge the validity of the assessment and that limiting the landowner to one vote was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court reversed the conviction for negligent driving and affirmed the obstruction conviction. First, the court did not find any actual prejudice that would have disqualified the appellate judge, and, thus, there was no reversible error. Second, for purposes of Wash. Rev.

Third, defendant's actions met the elements of the municipal code and the related state statute with respect to obstructing a law enforcement officer, Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9A.76.020(3), when he delayed the officer's preparation of his report and he falsely stated that he did not have a driver's license with the intent to hinder the report.

A third defendant, who was charged with first degree theft, was granted a new trial. On appeal, the court reversed in part and affirmed in part. The court held that the first degree theft convictions were reversed and remanded for a new trial because defendants were improperly charged with theft by taking of money. Evidence of short weighting could constitute theft of money by deception, but was not theft by taking of money. When one was charged with committing a crime by more than one method and there was a deficiency in proof as to one or more methods but the jury was, nevertheless, instructed as to those methods, the verdict was required to be set aside unless it was ascertained that it was founded on one of the methods with regard to which substantial evidence was introduced.</SPAN></P>

The court disagreed, holding that the irrigation district was a political subdivision referred to in &sect; 35.82.210, and, therefore, the statute exempted the housing authority from the special irrigation assessments of irrigation district. The court noted that a conflict between &sect; 35.82.210 and Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 87.03.665 was resolved to give the exemption under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 35.82.210 priority because it was the most recent enactment and specifically exempted the housing authority property from special assessments. The court also rejected the irrigation district's argument that &sect; 35.82.210 was unconstitutional because it impair the obligations of contracts or resulted in taking without just compensation. The court affirmed the trial court's order, holding that the exemption did not violate either the federal or state constitutional prohibitions against impairment of contracts or the taking of private property without just compensation.</SPAN></P>

The shop building was not on the tax rolls and never had been appraised. As he approached an air vent, he noticed what he characterized as the strong smell of marijuana. He told the sheriff of his observations. The court held that the appraiser's inspection was not a search within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment because the appraiser was on legitimate business; he did not spy into the residence; he did not enter either building; his route was a normal one; he acted openly and honestly; he did not get any closer than necessary to conduct his inspection; his discovery was accidental; and he did not create an artificial vantage point to smell the growing marijuana.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was jailed on an investigation of fraud.

The court agreed with defendant that the ordinance could not prohibit calls made only for the purpose of embarrassing the listener. Such speech was protected. However, the City had a substantial interest in protecting its residents from fear and abuse at the hands of persons who used the telephone to harass, torment, and intimidate others. The ordinance was not broader than necessary to effect the City's purpose because it did not proscribe the communication of ideas, only the communication of threats.</SPAN></P>

Only the negligence theory was presented to the jury, who awarded damages to the orchard owners, but reduced the award due to their contributory negligence. On appeal, the court affirmed and held that there was no evidence indicating the irrigation district intentionally allowed water to seep into the orchard so they could only be held liable for negligence based on their actions to prevent and alleviate seepage on the orchard owners' property. The court also held that, pursuant to Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 7.48.160, the irrigation canal could not be deemed a nuisance because the irrigation district existed by virtue of Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 87.03. The seepage was not an unconstitutional taking because it was a consequential damage, not anticipated in the plan of the canal, as the orchard was planted several decades after the canal was built.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested and convicted of criminal trespass for entering the premises of a medical center to distribute anti-abortion literature. On appeal, defendant challenged her arrest under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 10.31.100 because she was arrested for a misdemeanor not committed in the presence of the arresting officer. Defendant also asserted that she had a constitutional free speech right to enter the premises of the medical center and distribute anti-abortion information. The court found that the medical center was private property and that its owners could bar the exercise of free speech of any nature, regardless of the possibility to reasonably regulate it. The invitation extended by tenants of the medical center to its patrons seeking medical attention was not sufficient to classify the center as open to public use. Defendant had no constitutional right of access to the center for free speech activities. As to the illegality of defendant's arrest, the court held that it did not make the citation issued to defendant defective.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The municipal court convicted defendants of simple assault in violation of Seattle, Wash. Municipal Code &sect; 12A.06.015(A). Defendants contended that the ordinance was in conflict with state law, and thus was prohibited by Wash. Const. art. 11, &sect; 11. Defendants also argued that the ordinance was unconstitutionally vague. The court held that in determining whether there is a conflict between municipal and state law, the rule was that no real conflict could exist unless the ordinance declared something to be right which the state law declared to be wrong, or vice versa. Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9A.36.010-.040 defined three serious degrees of assault and left the definition of simple assault to the common law. The municipal ordinance was not in conflict with the State law because the municipal ordinance did not proscribe exactly the same conduct as was proscribed by State law. The municipal ordinance was not unconstitutionally vague because it was of such specificity that persons of common understanding would be on notice that offensive touching was proscribed. Persons of ordinary understanding understood the meaning of offensive touching.</SPAN></P>

Section 9.61.160 was not void for vagueness on its face because it satisfied the due process requirements of adequate notice and adequate standards to prevent arbitrary enforcement. The language &quot;threaten to bomb&quot; in &sect; 9.61.160 clearly meant expressing an intent to cause injury or damage. The words &quot;threaten&quot; and &quot;bomb&quot; were terms readily understood by persons of ordinary intelligence. Also, &sect; 9.61.160 was not overbroad because it was readily susceptible to a narrow construction consistent with the statutory definition of &quot;threaten,&quot; which limited its application to unprotected speech.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mayor instigated the chief's firing after becoming seriously dissatisfied with the chief's performance. The chief claimed, among other things, that the city failed to provide an adequate pretermination hearing. The court held that due process required some kind of a hearing prior to the discharge of an employee who had a constitutionally protected property interest in his employment. However, there was no legal support for the chief's claim that a hearing was required prior to the decision to discharge, rather than the discharge itself. Further, a pretermination hearing need not have been elaborate to satisfy the requirements of due process. Something less than a full evidentiary hearing was sufficient. In the case at bar, during the six-week period prior to his discharge, the chief retained legal counsel, and the chief discussed his performance deficiencies with the mayor. Moreover, both the chief and his attorney were shown material later relied upon by the mayor in discharging petitioner. Hence, the chief received notice of the grounds for the proposed discharge, an explanation of the mayor's evidence, and an opportunity to be heard prior to discharge.</SPAN></P>
