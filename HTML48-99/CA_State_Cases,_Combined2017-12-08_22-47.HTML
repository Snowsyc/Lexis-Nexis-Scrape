<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner labor union appealed from an order of respondent Agricultural Labor Relations Board (California), entered after remand, finding that although defendant grower's refusal to bargain violated the Agricultural Labor Relations Act, make-whole relief was not appropriate.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent Agricultural Labor Relations Board (the Board) initially found defendant grower guilty of refusal to bargain in violation of the Agricultural Labor Relations Act, and ordered make-whole relief for his employees, pursuant to Cal. Lab.  &sect; 1160.3. After interim proceedings, and on remand, respondent ruled that make-whole relief was inappropriate, because defendant had shown that his failure to reach agreement with petitioner union was not a result of a refusal to bargain, but resulted from legitimate and independent economic causes. Petitioner sought review, and the court affirmed. The court found that substantial evidence had been presented that the parties' central disagreement was based on petitioner's insistence that defendant pay wage rates comparable to those petitioner had obtained from another grower in another county; that growers based in defendant's county, in direct competition with defendant, paid substantially lower wage rates; that it would not be economically feasible for defendant to pay the rates demanded; and that defendant thus demonstrated that the parties would not have agreed, even if the employer had not refused to bargain.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order was affirmed. Respondent Agricultural Labor Relations Board properly found that make-whole relief was not appropriate, because defendant grower's failure to reach an agreement with appellant labor union was not caused by defendant's refusal to bargain but, resulted from the parties' independent inability to agree on wage rates.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant taxpayers challenged an order from the Superior Court of San Luis Obispo County (California), which found that respondent, San Luis Coastal Unified School District's, measure, authorizing respondent to use a pre-Proposition 13 tax override to pay for the lease purchase of new facilities, was proper under Cal. Educ. Code &sect; 39308 and did not violate Proposition 13, Cal. Const. art. XIIIA, &sect;1.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Before Proposition 13, Cal. Const., art. XIII A, &sect; 1, was passed, respondent San Luis Coastal Unified School District's voters approved a measure for the lease-purchase of three school sites. After Proposition 13 and after the tax levy had been reduced to zero, the electorate authorized respondent to use the original tax override to pay the lease-purchase debt for more new facilities. Respondent filed an action in the district court, seeking to validate the measure and appellant taxpayers challenged the action, contending that the taxes would violate Proposition 13, which limited ad valorem taxation to one percent of the value of the project. The trial court disagreed, and the court affirmed, finding that the proposed tax override was based on a &quot;prior indebtedness&quot; that was not subject to Proposition 13. Because the court found that the earlier lease obligation was not yet paid and discharged and that the new taxes were for the same basic purpose as the original taxes, the &quot;prior indebtedness&quot; exception, codified in Cal. Educ. Code &sect; 39308.5, allowed respondent to use a continuing tax override for the new facilities. Such application of &sect; 39308.5 was not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the lower court's judgment, finding that respondent San Luis Coastal Unified School District's tax override was a &quot;prior indebtedness&quot; that had not been discharged, that such &quot;prior indebtedness&quot; fell under the exception to Proposition 13's one-percent limitation on ad valorem taxes, and that such application of the exception statute was not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the decision of the Superior Court of Mendocino County (California), which convicted him after a jury trial for charges of possession of cocaine under Cal. Health &amp; Safety Code &sect; 11350(a) and resisting a peace officer under Cal. Pen. Code &sect; 148 when he did not give his identity during the booking process after his arrest.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Police were called regarding noise from a party where defendant was present. After police entered the party, they smelled marijuana. Defendant stood up from a couch but the officers ordered him to sit back down. The officers found a bag of what was later confirmed to be cocaine. After defendant was arrested, he refused to give his name during the booking process. His identity was later confirmed. There was an outstanding warrant for a drug charge but reference to that warrant was limited. Defendant was tried and convicted for possession of cocaine under Cal. Health &amp; Safety Code &sect; 11350(a) and resisting a peace officer under Cal. Pen. Code &sect; 148. Defendant contended that since the latter charge should not have been brought because he contended that his behavior did not constitute resisting a police officer, and as such, evidence regarding the outstanding warrant should not have been introduced. The court affirmed the lower court's conviction because defendant's refusal to disclose his identity at the booking interview served to resist, delay, and obstruct the responsible peace officer in the discharge of his duties and thus, fell under the realm of Cal. Penal Code &sect; 148.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the lower court's conviction of defendant for possession of cocaine and resisting a peace officer because defendant consistently refused to give his identity during the booking process, which frustrated the process and was in violation of the state statute pertaining to resisting a peace officer.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner, girlfriend of decedent, sought a peremptory writ of mandamus to vacate the decision of the Superior Court of Los Angeles County (California), that ordered the personal representative of decedent's estate to destroy all of decedent's sperm in the custody and control of a sperm bank at the request of the real parties in interest, decedent's personal representative and adult children.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner, decedent's girlfriend, sought review after the lower court entered an order requiring that decedent's sperm be destroyed. The court reversed the order finding that it had been entered prematurely because the validity of decedent's will and his contract with the sperm bank, both of which contained instructions that petitioner was entitled to the sperm and that she could become impregnated with it if she so chose, had not been determined. The real parties in interest, decedent's personal representative and adult children, argued that Cal. Health &amp; Safety Code &sect; 7054.4, which addressed destruction of human tissue, required that the sperm be destroyed. The court found that &sect; 7054.4 was not intended to address issues relating to sperm. The court concluded that at the time of his death, decedent had an interest in his sperm, because he had decision making authority regarding it, and that this interest was sufficient to constitute property within the meaning of Cal. Prob. Code &sect; 62, and as such, the probate court had jurisdiction over the vials of sperm. The court found that artificial insemination with the sperm of a decedent did not violate public policy.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted the peremptory writ of mandate and directed the lower court to vacate its order requiring that decedent's sperm be destroyed, enter an order denying the request to destroy the sperm, and conduct further proceedings finding that it was an abuse of discretion to order the sperm destroyed without first addressing the validity of decedent's will and his contract with the sperm bank, both of which contained disposition instructions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent trial court issued an order finding petitioner father in contempt for failing to pay child support, medical insurance, and attorney fees. Petitioner sought a writ of habeas corpus and alleged that respondent had no jurisdiction to render the order as there was not substantial evidence that petitioner could make the payments. The court granted the petition and annulled the contempt order. Petitioner presented evidence that he made insufficient money to make the payments at issue. The appellate court concluded that the respondent's decision to disbelieve petitioner's evidence of his inability to pay was erroneous. No evidence was presented to controvert petitioner's contention that he could not pay. Respondent also inferred petitioner's ability to pay from his earlier stipulation to an increase in child support payments. However, the court stated that this was only circumstantial evidence and that a criminal contempt conviction based on circumstantial evidence required circumstances to be entirely consistent with the theory of guilt. Here, the child support order did not necessarily lead to the conclusion that petitioner had the ability to pay.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant city approved plaintiff clinic's grant application upon the condition that no abortions be performed at the clinic.

However, the appellate court concluded that because plaintiff did not request that relief in its complaint the trial court correctly refused to take that extra step. In addition, the trial court's refusal to order payment of private attorney general fees was affirmed as the constitutional privacy right issue was incidental to the plaintiff's primary objective of obtaining grant money. The court rejected defendant's argument on cross-appeal that the abortion restriction was lawful. Defendant was not permitted to condition receipt of federal funds upon the waiver of a state constitutional right. Federal law did not place any restrictions on the distribution of funds and did not require preemption of state laws.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court affirmed the trial court's decision that plaintiff clinic was not entitled to the grant money because plaintiff did not request that relief in its complaint, nor was plaintiff entitled to private attorney general fees as the claim was primarily to obtain the grant money. The court denied defendant city's cross-appeal because preemption of state constitutional rights was not required in the administration of grant funds.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner redevelopment agencies filed a petition for writ of mandamus and requested an immediate stay against respondent taxing authorities. The California Supreme Court transferred the matter to the court, which denied the request for a stay, but found good cause for review of the issue.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied petitioner redevelopment agencies' request for a writ of mandamus challenging the implementation of Cal.

XVI, &sect; 16 did not prevent the legislature from altering the levying and collection of taxation on redevelopment project property in a manner consistent with which it altered such on other property. The court held that respondent property tax collectors substantially complied with Cal. Gov't Code &sect; 907 in giving notice to petitioners and that mere threats to withhold funds were not a violation of &sect; 907. The court determined that Senate Bill No. 1559, 1992 Cal. Stat. 697, amended Cal. Rev. &amp; Tax Code &sect; 97.5 to include community redevelopment agencies and to subject them to the apportionment of property tax revenues. The court also held that the legislature indicated plainly that it intended to clarify rather than change its enactment and that the specificity of the statute concerning the dates and applicability of the statutes supported the conclusion that the legislature intended Senate Bill No. 1559 to apply retroactively.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied the petition for writ of mandamus and awarded costs to respondents.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged his conviction entered in the Superior Court of Los Angeles County (California), after a jury returned guilty verdicts on 17 separate counts of the crime of securities fraud in violation of Cal. Corp. Code &sect; 25401. Defendant alleged that aiding and abetting the violation of Cal. Corp. Code &sect; 25401 did not exist as a criminal offense.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted on 17 separate counts of the crime of violation of Cal. Corp. Code &sect; 25401 as an aider and abettor. Defendant appealed on the grounds that aiding and abetting of such a Corporations Code crime did not statutorily exist. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that the principle under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 31 of aiding and abetting was not new, and that defendant's participation in the offense was sufficient to prove his knowledge of the wrongdoing and his general intent. The court concluded that the state had proven a pattern consistent with criminal conduct whereby factual representations were made to the purchasers of debentures which were inaccurate and misleading--which representations defendant knew to be false and unfounded while contemporaneously failing to impart any negative information which, if known to the individual investors, would have provided them the basis for an informed decision. The court ruled that it would not disturb the verdict on appeal, and that there was no juror misconduct.</SPAN></P>

Defendant appealed on grounds that the residency requirement of Cal. Penal Code &sect; 4852.01(c), violated the equal protection clauses of the U.S. constitution and the state constitution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pled guilty to second degree burglary in February 1966, and was sentenced to two years probation. After successfully completing probation in March 1969, defendant was granted dismissal of the charge pursuant to Cal. Penal Code &sect; 1203.4. In June 1971, defendant moved from California to Oregon. In December 1991, pursuant to Cal. Penal Code &sect; 4852.01 et seq., defendant, as a resident of Oregon, filed a petition for certificate of rehabilitation and pardon in Tulare County Superior Court, which was denied because defendant wasn't a resident of California for three years prior to the filing of the petition. Defendant appealed on grounds that the residency requirement violated the equal protection clauses of the U.S. and California constitutions. The court found that there was a rational basis to limit the petitions to residents, and that there was a legitimate state interest in limiting the benefits of pardon to residents as an enhancement of employability and productivity of its residents. The court affirmed the trial court and held that the residency requirement was bona fide, appropriately defined, uniformly applied, and did not violate the equal protection clauses.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was affirmed because the trial court properly denied defendant's petition for certificate of rehabilitation and pardon by applying a three year statutory residency requirement which did not violate the equal protection clauses of the federal and California constitutions.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiff successfully urged the trial court that requiring the fees as a condition of approval of the project constituted an unconstitutional taking of his land. The court reversed that holding and ruled that the land-use restrictions did not deprive plaintiff of all economically beneficial use of the land. The court found that the governmental purpose supporting a denial of the project was the loss of community recreational facilities which would be occasioned by the luxury townhouse development. The court found that the amount was not excessive or arbitrary, and that it was not compulsory. The court found that it was applicable only if plaintiff voluntarily chose to develop the property. The court found that the fee was not a special tax requiring approval by referendum, nor did it violate plaintiff's equal protection rights. The court also upheld the art fee levied in lieu of the placement of art on the project.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner plaintiffs sought a writ of mandate to overturn respondent trial court's refusal to permit an amendment of their complaint against respondent church to allege a claim for punitive damages. Petitioner claimed that the requirement of Cal. Civ. Proc. Code &sect; 425.14 that parties obtained court permission to plead for punitive damages was unconstitutional, in that it violated the establishment clause of the First Amendment and California's constitutional guarantee of a jury trial. The court applied the three-prong Lemon analysis and upheld the challenged statute because it had a valid secular purpose, did not have a primary effect of advancing religion or any particular religion, and did not foster excessive government entanglement in religion. The court found that &sect; 425.14 was a reasonable accommodation of religion, which served the interests embodied in the free exercise clause and was not violative of the establishment clause. The court said that &sect; 425.14 did not deprive litigants of a jury trial, but found that the trial judge erred when it applied the wrong standard to petitioner's evidentiary showing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of an order of the Superior Court of Santa Clara County (California) that denied his motion to suppress evidence. He summarily pled no contest to possession of methamphetamine for sale while armed with a firearm, driving with a suspended or revoked driver's license, resisting arrest, possession of a concealed firearm, and carrying a loaded weapon in a city.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After police stopped defendant, who was driving erratically, they saw an open tequila bottle behind the driver's seat. While retrieving the container, officer saw an envelope that contained a controlled substance. Defendant pled no contest to numerous charges, including possession of methamphetamine for sale while armed with a firearm, after a motion to suppress was denied. The court affirmed the judgment. Defendant claimed that the officer could not legally seize the open container because it was stored in an area not normally occupied by the driver or passengers, and Cal. Veh. Code &sect; 23255 provided that an open container may be kept in an area of a vehicle not normally occupied by the driver or passengers. The court held rejected defendant's interpretation of the statute, finding that the legislature intended to make open containers inaccessible to drivers. The statute was not unconstitutionally vague because individuals of common intelligence could understand that &sect; 23225 subjected individuals inside a vehicle without a trunk to liability if they stored open containers of alcohol within reach of the driver. Thus, seizure was proper and discovery of other evidence valid.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's convictions were affirmed. The court found that motion to suppress evidence of crimes was properly denied because the open container law provided that it was illegal to store an open container of an alcoholic beverage inside a vehicle without a trunk if the container was within reach of either the driver or his or her passengers. Thus, the officer had cause to seize the alcohol and ultimately discover the other incriminating evidence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, council member and voter, challenged a city charter provision imposing term limits on elected city officials. The trial court denied plaintiffs' petition for a writ of mandamus and to enjoin defendants, city and city clerk, from enforcing the limits. The court affirmed. The court found that the adoption of term limits was authorized by Cal. Const. art. XI, &sect; 5(a), because it implicated a municipal affair, the election of municipal officers, and the issue of term limits for city officials was not of statewide concern. The court held that there was no conflict with the state statutory scheme governing local elections and that state law did not preempt the city charter provision. The court held that the provision did not violate the free speech or equal protection guarantees of the federal or state constitution, because it did not preclude plaintiff council member from seeking election to other offices, including that of mayor, and voters retained the right to vote for any qualified candidates. The court found that the interests of defendant city in incumbency reform outweighed any injury to incumbent officeholders and those who would vote for them.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant City of Long Beach appealed from an order of the Superior Court of Los Angeles County (California), which awarded fees and costs to respondents, individuals and corporation affiliated with a movie theater, pursuant to the Civil Rights Attorney's Fee Awards Act of 1976, 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1988, as prevailing parties in an action to restrain a criminal prosecution brought by the city in violation of their constitutional rights.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court ordered defendant City of Long Beach to pay respondents, individuals and corporation affiliated with a movie theater, attorney fees pursuant to the Civil Rights Attorney's Fee Awards Act of 1976, 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1988, in connection with their successful constitutional challenge of a zoning ordinance. On appeal, defendant argued that the award was improper as a matter of law. The court held that respondents were entitled to attorney fees as the prevailing parties. The doctrine of prosecutorial immunity did not apply because respondents had sought prospective relief and the liability of the municipality, not that of the prosecutor, was at issue. The fact that only the People, real party in interest, and appellant, were named in the pleadings was of no consequence because the course of proceedings revealed defendant as the real party in interest and it had adequate notice of the suit and an opportunity to defend. The court held that an award of &sect; 1988 fees in a writ proceeding arising from an attempted criminal prosecution was consistent with Congress' intent to authorize such awards to a prevailing party in any proceeding.</SPAN></P>

The latter held confirmation hearings on the appointments of respondent director and secretary, both of whom opined that APA-type hearings were not required. They were informed that their confirmations by the full Senate would have been difficult, so they eventually agreed to the hearings and their nominations were approved by the Senate. The court held that the real party in interest, Senate Rules Committee, interfered in the administration of the law, that its actions were unconstitutional, and that the purported agreement with respondent director and secretary was void. The law did not require formal adjudicatory hearings. The court issued a peremptory writ of mandate ordering respondents to proceed with the license application.</SPAN></P>

Jury Instructions - Civil No. 12.42, which enumerated factors to consider in determining whether an object was a weapon, was not error because No. 12.42 did not construe &sect; 4574 (a). At trial, the jury requested a definition of the word &quot;likely&quot; in the phrase &quot;likely to cause great bodily harm&quot; and the court's response that it meant &quot;has the potential for use as a deadly weapon&quot; was not error. The court found that it was not prejudicial to admit the nail in an evidence bag that read, &quot;3 inch nail with toilet paper handle,&quot; because a deputy testified that he wrote the words on the bag and hence they did not amount to an unsupported characterization by an anonymous declarant. The court vacated appellant's sentence imposed under Cal.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the trial court's judgment that included a conviction for the murder of a fetus during the course of a robbery. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment except for the conviction of fetal murder, which was reversed and remanded for retrial. The court found that the trial court's jury instruction that defined fetal viability under then existing law was prejudicially erroneous. The court also held that the criminalization of feticide without regard to the level of fetal development did not violate a mother's privacy interest in terminating her pregnancy, equal protection or due process; therefore, no reason existed not to apply Cal. Penal Code &sect; 187(a), in accordance with its plain meaning. Finally the court held that although not retroactive in application, the killing of a fetus with malice aforethought, which killing did not fall under any of the exceptions listed in &sect; 187(b), was murder; therefore, in order for a fetus to be a subject of the murder statute, it need only be shown that it had progressed beyond the embryonic stage of seven to eight weeks. The court rejected the requirement that a fetus be viable in order to be the subject of murder &sect;187.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that the trial court's instructions to the jury that defined fetal viability under the law as it then existed were prejudicially erroneous. The court held that it was therefore required to reverse the judgment of murder and remand for a new trial on that count. The court modified the elements of fetal murder, and held its new interpretation should not be applied to cases that arose before the publication of the court's opinion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff petroleum company sought a tax refund of certain property taxes assessed against its geothermal interests during seven tax years. Plaintiff contended that defendant county's method of assessment was in violation of Cal. Const. art. XIII A. The trial court agreed and awarded plaintiff a tax refund, interest, and costs. Defendant appealed the judgment. Plaintiff appealed a postjudgment order that denied its motion for attorney fees and fixed prejudgment interest. The appellate court affirmed both the judgment and the order. The court held that because geothermal interests and oil and gas interest were substantially similar, Cal. Code Regs., tit. 18, &sect; 468, a regulation that established valuation principles for the taxation of oil and gas interests, applied to geothermal interests. The court held that under &sect; 468, defendant should have assigned the interests a base year value as of the lien date following acquisition by plaintiff's predecessor. The court further held that an award of attorney fees was not appropriate because defendant's failure to apply &sect; 468 was a misunderstanding of the law rather than a challenge to the validity of the provision itself.</SPAN></P>

The arbitrator found for appellants, who then petitioned the trial court to confirm the award. The trial court dismissed the petition because it found that the city's ordinance was unconstitutional. Upon review, the court affirmed, finding that respondents did not consent to arbitration as they were threatened with criminal prosecution by the city's attorney for failure to comply with the ordinance if they did not sign the agreement. The court found that the ordinance deprived respondents of property without due process of law in violation of U.S. Const. amend. XIV and Cal. Const. art.

On review, that court found that although Cal. Gov't.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant insurance fund challenged a judgment that dismissed an action for a tax refund in which appellant challenged the validity of a provision of Proposition 103, which raised the rate of the insurance premium tax imposed by Cal.

Code &sect; 12202.1, appellant filed a complaint for a refund against appellee State Board of Equalization. The trial court granted appellee's motion to dismiss. Appellant argued that Cal. Const. art. XIII, &sect; 28, mandated that the legislature was authorized to change the tax rate and that appellee was directed to assess the tax at the rate the legislature decided upon. Appellant therefore argued that Cal. Rev. &amp; Tax. Code &sect; 12202.1 was constitutionally invalid. The appellate court disagreed and affirmed the judgment dismissing appellant's action. The court concluded that the electorate also had the power to change the tax rate by initiative because the constitutional grant of power to the legislature in Cal. Const. art.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was tried and convicted by a jury of one count of continuous sexual abuse of a child, in violation of Cal. Penal Code &sect; 288.5. On appeal, defendant contended he was deprived of his right to a unanimous jury verdict by an instruction, derived from language in the statute, allowing conviction without jury unanimity on which individual acts of abuse occurred. The appeals court affirmed the conviction because the legislature did not deprive defendant of due process by defining in &sect; 288.5 a course of criminal conduct crime. The court reasoned that in a prosecution for a course-of-conduct offense, where the evidence shows only a single course of conduct, the jury need not be instructed on a need for unanimity as to the conduct supporting the conviction. The court noted that &sect; 288.5 allowed prosecutors to seek significant penalties against the resident molester, without demanding unrealistic precision from a child witness. At the same time, it limited the offender's potential liability to a single count against a given victim, thus eliminating the potential for arbitrary variation in charging and punishment present under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 288.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appeals court affirmed defendant's conviction for continuous sexual abuse of a child. The court ruled that because the criminal statute punished a course of conduct, the entire course of conduct constituted only one violation of the statute, and hence unanimity on each individual act was not required.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff county filed a complaint against defendant husband and father to establish paternity of a 12-year old child. Defendant husband was married to the child's mother when the child was conceived, but they later divorced. Defendant father had a sexual relationship with the mother at that time. Defendant father's complaint added defendant husband as a defendant. Blood tests established that defendant father was the natural father. Defendant father appealed the order of paternity finding him to be the natural and legal father, arguing that the trial court erred by refusing to apply the presumption that defendant husband was the father, Cal. Evid. Code &sect; 621. The court affirmed, holding that the presumption did not apply because to allow defendant father to use the statute to protect him from assuming responsibility for the child would defeat the statute's purpose, that failure to apply the statutory presumption would not disrupt any marital union because the child, the mother, and defendant husband never lived together, that declaring defendant father to be the father was in the child's best interests, and that decisions under &sect; 621 required balancing private and state interests.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant hotel owner sought relief from the judgment entered by the Superior Court of Alameda County (California), awarding relief to respondent city on appellant's cross-complaint that alleged that a business license tax ordinance passed by respondent violated the equal protection clause of the constitution. Respondent had filed suit to collect the taxes under the contested ordinance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent city enacted a business license tax ordinance, which required that certain businesses pay annual taxes. Respondent filed a complaint to collect unpaid business license taxes, and appellant hotel owner filed a cross-complaint for declaratory relief, alleging that the ordinance violated the equal protection clause of the constitution. The trial court entered judgment for respondent. Appellant sought relief. The court held that appellant was subject to a business license tax irrespective of the nature of the legal relationship between the provider and the guest. Appellant next argued that even if the disputed section of the ordinance applied to the hotel operation, it was invalid because it contravened the equal protection clause of the Constitution. The court held that the ordinance was enacted for rational reasons, and a mere disparity in the tax rate did not provide a legitimate reason to overturn the ordinance on equal protection grounds. The court concluded that the ordinance was constitutionally justified and that appellant's contention that the tax classification in the ordinance automatically failed was wrong; thus, the court affirmed the judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant taxpayers sought review of the judgment of the Superior Court of Ventura County (California), which granted respondent state education officials' motion to vacate an injunction and writ of mandate that were issued against respondent pursuant to an appellate ruling that Cal. Educ. Code &sect; 39807.5 violated the California Constitution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After ruling in favor of appellant taxpayers that Cal. Educ. Code &sect; 39807.5 violated both the free school guaranty and the equal protection clause of the state constitution, the court issued an injunction and writ of mandate against respondent state education officials. Thereafter, the trial court granted respondent's motion to vacate the injunction and writ in view of the subsequent state supreme court ruling that found &sect; 39807.5 was facially valid. On review, the court reversed the trial court's judgment and remanded the case with instructions. The court noted that it was in fact the administration and implementation of &sect; 39807.5 which was contested in the first case, not its existence. The court ruled that &sect; 39807.5 fee waiver mandate was ignored by school districts, or if it was utilized it was not enforced uniformly or properly. Thus, the statute as applied violated the state constitution, and therefore the injunction and writ were still necessary and proper in the interests of justice. The court noted that respondent did not allege any changed facts and that the prior supreme court ruling did not affect the facts regarding the nature of the statute's application.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant employer challenged the order of the Superior Court of Orange County (California) compelling it to produce documents pursuant to an administrative subpoena issued by respondent state division of labor standards enforcement, arguing that respondent lacked the authority to investigate whether appellant was subject to the vacation pay requirements of Cal. Lab. Code &sect; 227.3 and that the subpoena was too broad.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's order that appellant employer comply with an administrative subpoena issued by respondent state division of labor standards, which was investigating whether appellant was subject to the vacation pay provisions of Cal. Lab. Code &sect; 227.3. It found that Cal. Lab. Code &sect; 95(a) gave respondent power to enforce state labor laws, and that neither &sect; 95(a) nor Cal. Gov't Code &sect; 11180 required that a pending claim be assigned to appellee before it could make an investigation. The court rejected appellant's argument that the investigation was preempted by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, 29 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1001 et seq.; although respondent could not regulate appellant's vacation benefits if they were paid out of a funded Voluntary Employees' Beneficiary Association Trust, as opposed to its general assets, respondent had the right to seek the documents to determine whether preemption applied or not. Finally, the court found, the subpoena was not overly broad because it sought records appellant was required to file, but not to retain, concluding that nothing in the law limited respondent to seeking only records appellant was required to retain.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Finding that respondent state division of labor standards had the power to investigate whether appellant employer was subject to vested vacation pay law and that it was not necessary that respondent first be assigned a pending claim, the court affirmed the order that appellant comply with respondent's administrative subpoena.

The court held that it was reasonable to limit search waits to 10 minutes with additional time for special circumstances not to exceed 30 minutes and written notice requirements were a proper way to acquire informed, voluntary consent. The court struck any restriction imposed after a drug sniffing dog alerted to the scent of contraband because U.S. Const. amend. IV imposed no time limits on searches founded on probable cause. The prison was permitted to deny visitation to a visitor found with contraband regardless of the manner in which it was packaged. The prohibition on soiling visitor's property was struck because there was no evidence of an inadequate remedy at law. The judgment was modified, and, as modified, affirmed.</SPAN></P>

Health &amp; Safety Code &sect; 11351.5 for possession of cocaine base for sale. Pursuant to Cal. Welf. &amp; Inst. Code &sect; 725(b), defendant was adjudged a ward of the court and released on probation. Defendant's motion to suppress the evidence obtained during his arrest pursuant to Cal. Welf. &amp; Inst. Code &sect; 700.1 was denied. The court found that the carport where the arrest and search occurred was a public place, thereby negating defendant's arguments based on a warrantless search or arrest. As a minor, the court found that defendant was afforded full protection under U.S. Const. amend. IV. This included the requirement of probable cause for arrest, but the facts showed that the police officers had prior knowledge of suspicious activity by defendant, which established grounds for a detention and investigation, even though they did not have probable cause to arrest. The court affirmed the denial of the motion to suppress evidence and held that even though the evidence was obtained by unlawful police conduct, it would have been discovered even without the unlawful act and was an exception to the exclusionary rule.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state, ex relatione the state department of transportation, challenged the judgment of the Superior Court, San Bernardino County (California), which found a de facto taking, awarded damages for unreasonable delay by the state in instituting its direct condemnation action, and imposed a 10 percent postjudgment interest rate on the compensation and damages awarded to defendant landowner.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state, ex relatione the state department of transportation, condemned defendant landowner's property under its power of eminent domain. The trial court awarded defendant damages for the state's unreasonable delay in instituting its direct condemnation action and imposed a 10 percent postjudgment interest rate. The court affirmed the judgment in part and held that there was substantial evidence that the state effected a de facto taking prior to the filing of the eminent domain action. The court reversed the judgment that assessed damages for unreasonable pre-condemnation activities and applied a 10 percent postjudgment interest rate. The state was not liable for damages because the delay occurred after the de facto taking; there would have been a duplication in damages because defendant received full payment on its condemnation award, which ran from the date of the de facto taking. The trial court incorrectly calculated the proper interest rate; it should have independently determined the extant market rate of interest and then applied the higher of that rate or the legislatively-created apportionment rate set forth in Cal. Civ. Proc. Code &sect; 1268.350.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant city challenged the order of the Superior Court, Los Angeles County (California), which held that Long Beach, Cal., Municipal Code ch. 5.60 imparted unconstitutionally broad administrative discretion over the grant or denial of parade permits, and since the section could not have been severed, the ordinance was entirely invalid.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff activists challenged the constitutionality of a parade permit ordinance, Long Beach, Cal., Municipal Code ch. 5.60. Defendant city appealed the trial court's judgment that the ordinance imparted unconstitutionally broad administrative discretion over the grant or denial of parade permits, and because the section could not be severed, the ordinance was entirely invalid. Plaintiff appealed the trial court's judgment that held constitutional the requirement that permittees pay for services and carry insurance. The court affirmed and held that Long Beach, Cal., Municipal Code &sect; 5.60.030(C) unconstitutionally granted unrestrained discretion to grant or deny parade permits, and because the section could not be severed, the entire ordinance was unconstitutional. The court held that except for the insurance requirement and the provisions for the timing of permit applications, the other challenged aspects of ch. 5.60 were valid. The court could not discern sufficient justification for a blanket 30-day application requirement. It was not clear that the insurance requirement did not turn on the content of the parade.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent department filed a petition alleging appellant father had molested his son on numerous occasions. The next month respondent filed an amended petition with six specific allegations.

Welf. &amp; Inst. Code &sect; 300(c). However, the trial court also found respondent failed to show the father sexually abused his son by a preponderance of the evidence. A dispositional hearing was then held, and the trial court ordered visitation to be arranged and supervised as agreed upon by therapists for the child and appellant. It also ordered a reunification plan for appellant, which included instructions directing appellant to enter weekly therapy. In response, appellant sought review, attacking both the jurisdictional and dispositional orders. On review, the court reversed the jurisdictional order, and declared the dispositional orders moot, because respondent failed to bear its burden of proving the &sect; 300(c) allegations.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the jurisdictional order, and declared all subsequent orders moot, because respondent department failed to prove the required statutory allegations, and the sustained allegations focused on the child's behavior and reactions, not appellant father's behavior.</SPAN></P>

Defendant brought a motion for new trial, which included, as an alternative to granting a new trial, a request to modify the verdict to the lesser charge of receiving stolen property, in violation of Cal. Penal Code &sect; 496(1). The trial court found that the verdict was contrary to evidence and may have been contrary to law. The trial court modified the verdict by finding defendant guilty of the lesser included offense of receiving stolen property. The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court, holding that it had the nonstatutory authority to modify the verdict to a lesser related offense, upon a defense request for such consideration, because the evidence showed defendant to be not guilty of the crime of which he was convicted, but guilty of the lesser related crime. The court held that the right to modify a verdict to a lesser related offense on a motion for new trial was just as much an aspect of fundamental fairness required by due process as the right to a verdict or finding of a lesser related offense in a nonjury trial.</SPAN></P>

The court issued a peremptory writ of mandate directing respondent to vacate its order and to enter a new order granting petitioner's application.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment that found him guilty of violating the states' hate crime statute,&nbsp;Cal. Penal Code &sect; 422.7(a), after physically attacking a gay neighbor. The court affirmed the judgment on the basis that &sect; 422.7 did not violate U.S. Const. amend. I. The court held that the statute was not void for vagueness as it had been construed to require proof of a specific intent to deprive an individual of a right secured by federal or state law. The court found the statute not overly broad as it was narrowly drawn to protect a compelling state interest and did not attempt to prohibit bigotry itself, but the discriminatory act of selecting a crime victim based on his or her race or other status. The court stated the violent conduct proscribed by &sect; 422.7 was not sufficiently imbued with elements of communication to be protected as expressive conduct and labeled &quot;speech.&quot; The court stated that even if the hate crime statute enhanced penalties based on the perpetrator's bigoted thoughts, the statute targeted discriminatory conduct, not speech, and therefore fell within exceptions to the First Amendment prohibition of content discrimination.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was affirmed because California's hate crime statute was narrowly drawn to protect a compelling state interest and proscribed violent discriminatory conduct, not constitutionally protected expression.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of a disposition made by a juvenile court referee in the Superior Court of Los Angeles County (California), that sustained the petition that charged defendant with possessing a short-barreled rifle.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A juvenile court referee conducted a jurisdictional hearing but did not obtain a stipulation pursuant to Cal. Welf. &amp; Inst. Code &sect; 248. Defense counsel refused to sign it during the hearing, because the referee improperly questioned a witness for the state. The juvenile court referee denied the parties' joint motion for a mistrial and sustained the petition that charged defendant with possession of a firearm. On appeal, defendant argued that the referee lacked the fundamental power to act as a temporary judge at the jurisdictional hearing. The reviewing court reversed the trial court's decision and the case was remanded for a new hearing. The court held that the adjudications based upon the referee's purported exercise of judicial powers could not stand for lack of jurisdiction. Since &sect; 248 unambiguously prohibited a referee from presiding over a jurisdictional hearing unless the parties entered into a written stipulation, the court concluded that the stipulation was a mandatory requisite to the authority of the referee to perform anything beyond &quot;subordinate judicial duties.&quot; The court's decision was not based on sufficiency of the evidence, so double jeopardy did not apply.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment against defendant juvenile was reversed, because the juvenile court referee was without jurisdiction to sustain the charging petition absent the statutorily required written stipulation.

The hospital thereafter petitioned for writ relief, claiming that the evidence was insufficient to establish a substantial probability of success. The court denied the petition. The evidence submitted by plaintiffs was sufficient to make a prima facie case for the award of punitive damages. A trier of fact could find that petitioner's failure to properly investigate the relationship between plaintiff and the physician employee constituted both petitioner's ratification of the acts and malicious behavior on its own part. Such a finding would justify the imposition of punitive damages. Furthermore, a trier of fact could find that the physician employee's malicious acts should be imputed to petitioner so as to render it personally guilty of malice.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of robbery and kidnapping after he pushed a 67 year old woman into her car and drove away. His sentence was enhanced, in part, because the victim was over 65 years of age, and he had a prior conviction for robbery under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 667.9. The court of appeal affirmed. The language of the statute that defendant knew or reasonably should have known that the victim was over 65 was not unconstitutionally vague. Case law upheld the &quot;reasonable knowledge&quot; standard for other enhancement statutes. Defendant was protected from increased sentence, if, for example, he robbed someone who looked younger than 65 but was older than 65 because the statute required that he knew or should have known of the victim's age. The evidence supported the enhancement because the victim was over 65, and her physical appearance was evidence for the jury to consider.

The verdict was sufficient because the victim was 67, and her physical appearance was evident.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, who was convicted of shoplifting beer, challenged a judgment of the Superior Court of Tulare County (California), which on its own motion arraigned appellant for violating a probation condition that required him to wear a T-shirt bearing a printed statement of his status as a felony theft probationer. Appellant contended that the probation condition was unconstitutional and not reasonably related to the goal of rehabilitation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, who was convicted of shoplifting beer, challenged a probation condition that required that he wear a T-shirt bearing a printed statement of his status as a felony theft probationer. The requirement applied whenever appellant was outside his residence. Appellant and another man were apprehended when each took two 12-packs of beer from a store without paying for them. Appellant challenged the validity of the T-shirt condition on the grounds that it was vague, overbroad, and not reasonably related to the goal of rehabilitation. The prosecution argued that appellant waived his challenge by failing to appeal from the order granting probation and by failing to assert the challenge at the probation revocation hearing. The appellate court disagreed on the ground that the lower court itself had raised the validity of the T-shirt condition at the probation revocation hearing. Rather than facilitating appellant's rehabilitation, the appellate court held that the T-shirt condition impinged on appellant's inalienable right to privacy guaranteed by Cal. Const. art. I, &sect; 1. The court therefore reversed the order revoking appellant's probation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order revoking appellant's probation and the judgment of sentence were reversed and remanded for further proceedings consistent with the court's opinion that the condition could adversely affect appellant's ability to carry on activities having no possible relationship to the offense for which he was convicted or to future criminality. The court therefore held that the condition was unreasonably overbroad and as such was invalid.</SPAN></P>

Petitioners sent the insurer a letter terminating the partnership, filed an action in Delaware that sought a declaration that the insurer defaulted on the partnership agreement, which Delaware dismissed, and then filed an action to quash the service of summons, which the superior court denied. Petitioners then sought a writ of mandate. The court denied petitioners' writ, holding that while petitioners' contacts with California were not sufficient to confer general jurisdiction on the superior court, petitioners' efforts to solicit and negotiate with the insurer were sufficient to satisfy minimum contacts with California, which due process required. The court held that petitioners purposefully availed themselves to California benefits. Thus, California courts had jurisdiction over them.</SPAN></P>

They filed writs of habeas corpus in which they sought one-for-one work conduct credits pursuant to Cal. Penal Code &sect; 2933.

That punishment was not reducible by one-for-one work time credits. The court also held that allowing one-for-one credits under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 667.7, the recidivist statute, would violate the intent of voters who prescribed no such credits for people sentenced for murder under an initiative of which &sect; 190 was a part.</SPAN></P>

The court rejected the remaining requests as moot or unripe. The court held that under Cal. Sch. Code &sect; 2.1321 (1929), and Cal. Educ.

The court reversed the trial court's findings on the prior convictions because as with a charged offense, waiver of a jury trial on the issue of a prior conviction could not be implied.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, personal management service providers, filed an action against defendants, Commissioner of Labor and other officials, and alleged that the licensing provisions of the Talent Agencies Act (Act), Cal. Labor Code 1700-1700.4, were unconstitutional on their face. The licensing provisions provided an exemption for persons who procure only recording contracts and plaintiffs unsuccessfully had claimed they were exempt. The trial court granted defendants' motion for summary judgment and declared the Act constitutional. The court held that the trial court properly concluded that plaintiffs' motion for continuance failed to provide sufficient justification for a continuance as required by Cal. Civ. Proc. Code 437c(h). The court held that the affidavits that plaintiffs submitted with their motion were irrelevant, and that defendants' report from its experts provided a sufficient rational basis for the licensing exemption. The court affirmed and held that the term occupation of procuring employment was not so vague and wholly devoid of objective meaning that it provided no standard at all.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner filed a motion for return of a roll of film that contained photographs taken at a court proceeding in violation of the judge's order pursuant to Cal.

Petitioner filed a writ of mandate seeking relief from the order and alleged that the confiscation was an unconstitutional prior restraint of free speech in violation of U.S. Const. amend. XIV. On review the court denied the writ of mandate. The court held that pursuant to Cal. R. Ct. 980, the lower court had the authority to ban court photography completely. Therefore, the seizure of the film did not give rise to a restraint of free speech, but rather, enforced the lower court order that prohibited the photographs during the court proceeding. The court opined that the seizure was not analogous to a prior restraint on free speech because the contents of the roll of film seized were not obtained lawfully. The contents were obtained in a knowing and deliberate violation of the law. Thus, the writ of mandate was refused and the lower court was ordered to maintain possession of the film and to destroy it upon final resolution of the matter.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In respondent abortion clinic's suit against appellants, anti-abortion protesters, the trial court granted a permanent injunction against appellants. On appeal, the court affirmed, but struck a provision prohibiting speech in front of children. The court held that respondent had standing to bring suit to exclude appellants from its parking lot because they had a &quot;possessory interest&quot; in the parking lot, and appellants' activities were aimed at disrupting and impeding its lawful business. The court held that the provisions excluding appellants from the clinic parking lot and from the public sidewalk directly in front of the clinic did not violate Cal. Const. art. I, &sect; 2 or Cal. Const. art. I, &sect; 1. The parking lot was not a public forum, the injunction was content neutral, was narrowly tailored to serve significant government interests of keeping the free flow of vehicle and pedestrian traffic, and a woman's right to privacy, and left open ample alternative means of communication. The court held that the restrictions as to speech in front of children was unconstitutional because it limited &quot;core political speech&quot; and did not serve a compelling governmental interest.</SPAN></P>

Appellant filed a complaint for legal malpractice but he filed no further documents and made no appearances. As a result, the action was dismissed by the trial court for lack of prosecution.

The Client Security Fund Commission, a division of respondent state bar, instituted an investigation and subsequently issued a decision proposing reimbursement of the unearned balance of the payment made to appellant. Appellant contended that the client's payment was a fee for consultation and petitioned for a writ of mandate in the trial court. The trial court affirmed the findings. The evidence showed that appellant's acts fell within the concept of the wrongful taking of a client's money. Further, appellant failed to utilize the client's funds for the purpose for which they were tendered. The court also found that de novo review was not appropriate when an administrative decision did not involve a fundamental right, and it found respondent's actions appropriate.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court reversed and held that the municipal court had heard the evidence and that the superior court should not have substituted its judgment for that of the municipal court. The petition for writ of habeas corpus was therefore moot. The court held that Cal. Penal Code &sect; 1387.1 created an exception to the general rule of &sect; 1387 that a charge could not be filed a third time and allowed a third filing where either of the prior dismissals was due solely to excusable neglect and the state's conduct did not amount to bad faith. Bad faith had not been alleged.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant driver contested the dismissal of a petition for a writ of mandate by the Superior Court of the City and County of San Francisco (California), ordering respondents, Department of Motor Vehicles and Highway Patrol, to reinstate his driver's license. Appellant claimed he was denied a fair hearing under Cal. Gov't Code &sect; 68097.2(b), and that the evidence did not support the trial court's conclusion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondents, Department of Motor Vehicles and Highway Patrol, suspended the driver's license of appellant driver for drunk driving. Appellant contended that he was denied a fair hearing because he was unable to compel the attendance of the arresting officer due to his indigence, and that the evidence did not support the conclusion that he had been driving drunk. The court rejected both arguments and affirmed the judgment. It held that appellant had not complied with Cal. Gov't Code &sect; 68097.2(b) that required him to reimburse respondent Highway Patrol for the expense of a peace officer's salary, in order for the officer to comply with appellant's subpoena, and that &sect; 68097.2(b) did not infringe on appellant's due process rights. The court held that the privilege of operating a motor vehicle was important, but not fundamental. Appellant had shown a lack of due diligence to support his claim at the hearing, when he failed to attempt to have the subpoena fee waived or to have the subpoena enforced. The court held that there was no error in the trial court's admission of evidence of appellant's blood alcohol level, or its determination that appellant had been driving drunk.</SPAN></P>

Appellant's due process rights were not violated, and the trial court did not err in finding that appellant was driving drunk.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Law enforcement agencies utilized underage decoys in supervised programs to enforce the prohibition against selling alcohol to minors, pursuant to Cal.

Petitioners protested their license suspensions and argued that the use of underage police agents to purchase alcoholic beverages was unconstitutional. Respondent California Alcoholic Beverage Control Appeals Board interpreted the constitutional provision that &quot;no person under the age of 21 years shall purchase any alcoholic beverage&quot; (Cal. Const., art. XX, &sect; 22) to exclude persons in decoy programs supervised by the department or other law enforcement agency. On appeal, the court reversed respondent's judgment and found that, unlike Cal. Heath &amp; Safety Code &sect; 11367, both the constitutional provision and the statute covering the prohibition against buying alcohol contained no express exception for persons working in a law enforcement capacity.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the alcohol license suspensions of petitioner grocery stores by respondent California Alcoholic Beverage Control Appeals Board because it was impermissible under the California constitution to use underage youths as decoys in the enforcement of the prohibition against selling alcohol to minors.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of possession of cocaine base for sale under Cal. Health &amp; Safety Code &sect; 11351.5. Defendant appealed his conviction on grounds that the cocaine should have been suppressed because Cal. Veh. Code &sect; 40302(a) was unconstitutional, and thus the search of defendant was illegal. On appeal, the court affirmed defendant's conviction, finding that the officer's decision to take defendant who had no identification into custody was a proper exercise of his discretion under Cal. Veh. Code &sect; 40302.  Cal. Veh. Code &sect; 40302 delegates discretion to an officer, after arresting an individual for a minor vehicle code violation, to either cite and release, or take into custody, an individual where he does not have a driver's license or its functional equivalent, based on the officer's determination of whether other evidence of identification presented was satisfactory.  Cal. Veh. Code &sect; 40302 is not fatally vague and unconstitutional for giving an officer such discretion. An officer must accept, as satisfactory evidence of identification, any current written identification which bears the minimum amount of data required by Cal. Veh. Code &sect; 12811 and &sect; 40500.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's conviction was affirmed, because the officer's decision to take defendant into custody, resulting in a search, was a proper exercise of discretion where defendant could not produce a driver's license or other satisfactory evidence of identification.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged his conviction in trial court for voluntary manslaughter while using a firearm and was sentenced to 10 years in prison. Appellant contended that the trial court erred by giving Cal. Evid. Code &sect; 1103 regarding admission of character evidence for violence ex post facto application. The court rejected appellant's ex post facto claim because he did not object at trial, and additionally, appellant called the court's attention to the amended statute and urged its application as part of his trial strategy to show that victim was violent. The court held that admission of testimony concerning appellant's interest in guns was not error because he did not object at trial and also held that officer's testimony concerning appellant's statement was admissible. The court disagreed with appellant's contention that dismissal of a juror was error because the trial court had discretion to dismiss the juror for violating the trial court's order to discuss the case and for failure to follow instructions.

Appellant argued that his convictions were improper because the trial court committed prejudicial error in allowing into evidence a letter from appellant to a psychotherapist in which he admitted acts of sexual molestation. The reviewing court upheld most counts of the conviction. To determine if the letter was a confidential communication between patient and psychotherapist under Cal. Evid. Code &sect; 1014, the reviewing court applied the dominant purpose test. Here, appellant's asserted purpose was to avoid a prison sentence, not to receive treatment. Even assuming that the letter was privileged, appellant was not prejudiced, given the ample evidence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant physician and his wife sought review of a decision from the Superior Court of Los Angeles County (California), convicting defendant physician of aiding and abetting his unlicensed assistant in the prescribing and furnishing of controlled substances under Cal.

Code &sect; 14107. The court found that Cal. Health &amp; Safety Code &sect; 11153 prohibited an unlicensed assistant from writing a controlled substance prescription, without regard to whether the prescription was medically appropriate, and that defendant physician's convictions under &sect; 11153(a) for aiding and abetting an unlicensed assistant to write prescriptions, were supported by substantial evidence. Defendant physician could not rely on the medical appropriateness of the unlicensed assistant's illegal prescription to escape liability under &sect; 11352 because the assistant was not a licensed physician. The court modified the judgment against defendant physician by staying fines and penalty assessments that violated Cal. Penal Code &sect; 654, and directed the trial court to recalculate the new total of fines and assessments owed. As modified, the court affirmed the judgments against defendants.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff county appealed from the order of the Superior Court of Los Angeles County (California), which modified the amount of child support payable by defendant father and held that Cal. R. Ct. 1274(b)(6) was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff county sought a modification of child support concerning defendant father's payments in support of his minor child, who was in its mother's custody and received welfare benefits. The lower court ordered an increase in child support and held that Cal. Civ. Code &sect;1274(b)(6)&nbsp;unconstitutionally discriminated against noncustodial parents on the basis of wealth. Plaintiff county appealed, contending that Cal. Civ. Code &sect;1274(b)(6) was constitutional and did not violate U.S. Const. amend. XIV or Cal. Const. art. I &sect; 7(a). The court reversed the judgment of the lower court, holding that Cal. Civ. Code &sect; 1274(b)(6) made a classification based on the welfare status of the child that was subject to the rational basis test. Accordingly, a legitimate purpose existed for distinguishing between noncustodial parents of children whose custodial parents received welfare benefits and noncustodial parents generally, in allowing a reduction in support based on visitation. The state's interest in relieving the public of the economic burden of support for needy children was legitimate.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the lower court's judgment, which modified defendant father's child support and found that a statute was unconstitutional, and remanded the case for determination of the proper amount of child support, because it was constitutional under the Equal Protection clause for the state to consider the welfare status of a dependent child in determining child support.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, county and board of supervisors, contended that the trial court erred when it determined that the local zoning ordinance was preempted by the merger provisions in the Subdivision Map Act (Map Act), Cal.

In 1981, appellant downzoned the area so that only 1 dwelling per 100 acres was permitted, however there was a grandfather clause. Appellees filed for a permit to build on the parcel and appellants' denied the request. Appellants contended that it was feasible to recombine appellee's parcel with enough contiguous lots to make a 100-acre parcel because the other lots were owned by appellees' family or their corporation. The trial court concluded that the county ordinances were preempted by the exclusive merger provisions of the Map Act. The court stated that although the Map Act controlled development of parcels in a broad sense, the Map Act permitted the local governments to supplement it with reasonable local regulations. The court held that the local government was not precluded from controlling development of substandard parcels simply because the end result was a merger of parcels.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1973, pursuant to the amendment of defendant city's charter by the voters, defendant enacted an ordinance prohibiting the building of multiple dwelling units. In 1981, Cal. Evid. Code &sect; 669.5 went into effect, shifting the burden of proof in actions challenging the validity of certain growth control ordinances to the proponents of those ordinances. In 1987, plaintiffs filed suit against defendant and challenged the constitutionality of the ordinance prohibiting the building of multiple dwelling units. Plaintiffs moved for summary adjudication of issues, seeking a determination that &sect; 669.5 applied to their action. The trial court held that &sect; 669.5 did not apply and entered judgment in defendant's favor. Plaintiffs appealed. On review, the court reversed and remanded the case for a trial on the merits. The court held that &sect; 669.5 was applicable in plaintiffs' action and that the ordinance fell within the scope of &sect; 669.5. Because &sect; 669.5 addressed the conduct of trials and did not change the legal consequences of the parties' past conduct, the statute's operation was prospective. In any event, the statute's language suggested that the statute was intended to apply retroactively.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the dismissal of appellant's petition because it held that the suspension of driving privileges was a civil matter that was independent of the person's guilt or innocence in any parallel criminal prosecution. The court also held that the privilege to drive a motor vehicle was not a fundamental right and that a driver was required to pay fees in connection therewith. Finally, the court noted that appellant had not exercised due diligence in invoking the court's aid to secure his witness and that he therefore did not have room to complain of the absence of the witness.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant vending company sought a writ of mandate and filed an action seeking declaratory and injunctive relief from a city ordinance, Rancho Mirage, Cal., Municipal Code ch. 5.24, which prohibited cigarette vending machines. The trial court denied both types of relief, finding that Cal. Penal Code &sect; 308 did not preempt the ordinance. The court affirmed, finding that the ordinance was not preempted because it did not duplicate any provision of &sect; 308, nor did the ordinance contradict &sect; 308 because &sect; 308 did not expressly authorize the use of vending machines for cigarette sales. The court found that &sect; 308 did not occupy the entire field. Finally, the court found that appellant did not meet its burden to show that &sect; 308 preempted the ordinance because the laws did not concern the same subject matter. Although &sect; 308 concerned sale of cigarettes to minors, the ordinance concerned sale of cigarettes in vending machines.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's judgment that the ordinance was valid because preemption was the sole reason advanced for the ordinance's alleged invalidity and the state statute did not preempt the ordinance.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his convictions under Cal.

Penal Code &sect; 311.4(c), inducing a minor to engage in preparing a film involving sexual conduct, and Cal. Penal Code &sect; 647.6, annoying or molesting of children under the age of 18. The court reversed the convictions under &sect; 288(c) and &sect; 311.4(c), while affirming the &sect; 647.6 conviction. The court found that defendant did not directly touch the victims and did not indirectly touch them in a lewd or lascivious manner. The victims remained clothed and did not engage in sexual acts. Violations could not occur without a sexual act. The court held that it was reversible error not to instruct the jury that an essential element of &sect; 288(c) and &sect; 311.4(c) was that the defendant's touching of the victims had to be lewd and lascivious, regardless of his specific intent. Such an instructional error was not harmless under the applicable &quot;beyond a reasonable doubt&quot; standard.</SPAN></P>

A lewd and lascivious act was not proven where there was no proof of sexual conduct or specific intent. The judgment was otherwise affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant California Franchise Tax Board appealed a judgment of the Superior Court of Sacramento County (California), which held that a regulation for the allocation of income of foreign-based companies, such as plaintiff foreign-based corporation, was a violation of due process.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff foreign-based corporation filed suit against defendant California Franchise Tax Board when defendant used the worldwide combined reporting (WWCR) method of income allocation, codified at Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, &sect; 25137-6, to levy additional taxes on plaintiff. After the California Supreme Court reversed and remanded the court's judgment that WWCR was unconstitutional, the court held that the WWCR method violated neither the Commerce nor Due Process Clauses of the U.S. Constitution. The court found that WWCR was not discriminatory under the Commerce Clause because domestic- and foreign-based corporations stood on relatively equal footing when one considered the &quot;practical operation&quot; of the method as applied to the compliance costs they incurred. The court held that WWCR was permissible under federal and state Due Process clauses because defendant's discretion regarding compliance cost computation under regulation &sect; 25137-6 was subject to reasonably adequate standards to guide enforcement. The court therefore reversed the judgment of the trial court that &sect; 25137-6 violated due process protections and remanded with direction to enter judgment for defendant.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment that the unitary tax method of worldwide combined reporting as applied to plaintiff foreign-based corporation violated due process protections, because adequate safeguards controlled defendant California Franchise Tax Board's regulatory discretion in computing compliance costs; the court therefore remanded the case with instructions that judgment be entered for defendant.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court originally held that the method was not unconstitutional. However, the state supreme court remanded for a modification so the decision would be consistent with a recent state supreme court decision. On remand, the court held that the method was not unconstitutional because there was an affirmative federal policy permitting California to apply the worldwide unitary tax method to domestic-parent groups with foreign subsidiaries. Thus, there was no need to apply the dormant foreign commerce clause framework because Congress has acted and the courts were no longer needed to prevent states from burdening commerce. The court held that respondent did not meet the steep burden imposed by the constitutional distortion principle of &quot;external consistency.&quot; The court held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it denied appellant's motion for sanctions because the motion was not timely.</SPAN></P>

This meant that defendant's conduct must be a reckless, gross, or culpable departure from what would be the conduct of an ordinarily prudent person under the same situation as to be incompatible with proper regard for human life.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged a judgment by the San Francisco Superior Court (California), which convicted him of second-degree murder with the use of a firearm, and imposed a sentence of 15 years to life plus four years for the use of the firearm.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of second-degree murder for shooting the victim in the back after a botched drug deal. At trial, evidence was admitted that tended to show that appellant had a reputation for violence. Appellant contended that Cal. Evid. Code &sect; 1103(b) violated his due process rights by making evidence of his reputation for violence admissible when he had not proffered evidence as to his reputation for or character trait of violence. On appeal, the court affirmed the conviction. The court held that &sect; 1103(b) was constitutionally applied in appellant's case, because &sect; 1103(b) allowed such evidence in rebuttal to defense evidence. Therefore, there was no violation of constitutional principles of due process. The court further concluded that if there had been a constitutional error, on the facts of the particular case, the error would have been harmless.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant's second-degree murder conviction was affirmed. Appellant's constitutional due process challenge was dismissed, because the evidence admitted at trial relating to appellant's reputation for violence was offered in rebuttal to defense evidence. Thus, there was no violation of the state or the federal constitution.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant owner stored several vehicles without current registrations at his residence, not in any structure. Respondent city filed a complaint, seeking to declare the vehicles a nuisance, pursuant to Costa Mesa, Cal., Municipal Code &sect; 11-65, and seeking injunctive and declaratory relief to abate the vehicles as a public nuisance. The court declared five of the vehicles a public nuisance and ordered them to be removed within 10 days. The court affirmed, finding that respondent could declare abandoned, wrecked, dismantled, or inoperative vehicles or parts thereof on private property a public nuisance and could declare certain uses of property a nuisance per se. The court held that respondent successfully carried its burden of proving the vehicles were a public nuisance because they were abandoned, wrecked, dismantled, or inoperative. The court held that Costa Mesa, Cal., Municipal Code &sect; 11-65 et seq., was not unconstitutionally vague and overbroad. The court found that Costa Mesa, Cal., Municipal Code &sect;&sect; 11-68 and 11-69 did not violate the warrant requirement of U.S. Const. amend. IV.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant mobilehome park owner filed suit challenging respondent city's rent control ordinance, alleging that the ordinance effected a taking of its property without just compensation by failing to include a &quot;vacancy decontrol&quot; provision that would allow appellant to charge market rents to a successor tenant if a current tenant sold his or her mobilehome. The trial court granted judgment on the pleadings to respondent. On appeal, the court reversed, holding that appellant had stated a claim that the ordinance was an unconstitutional taking, because it alleged that the ordinance worked to increase the cost of mobilehome housing to all tenants except those in place at the time it was enacted, which was contrary to the ordinance's purpose. The court also held that the statute of limitations did not bar appellant's action, because each sale of a mobilehome constituted a separate taking, a new limitations period thus commenced with the sale of each home located in appellant's park, and appellant's claim for damages were limited to those home sold within the five years preceding its filing of its complaint.</SPAN></P>

Welf. &amp; Inst. Code &sect; 366.21 and Cal. Welf. &amp; Inst. Code &sect; 366.26 in a parental termination proceeding.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant mother challenged orders entered by the trial court on March 12, 1991 setting a dispositional hearing, the first appeal, and on July 12, 1991, which terminated parents' rights to son and placed daughter in long term foster care. The court had previously dismissed as untimely the second appeal. The court dismissed the first appeal refusing to deem the first notice of appeal to be a premature appeal because such appeals were timely when the decision being appealed from had been made preliminarily, but was not yet final. There had been no preliminary decision on March 12th. The court also rejected appellant's request that the doctrine of constructive filing be applied because an order dismissing one appeal could not be attacked by a separate appeal, because appellant was not incarcerated, and because the doctrine did not include orders terminating parental rights. The March 12th orders were not appealable because the statute provided only for review by extraordinary writ pursuant to Cal. Welf. &amp; Inst. Code &sect; 366.26(k), and appellant's request to treat the appeal as a writ petition was untimely because it was not made until after the &sect; 366.26 hearing had been held.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court dismissed the appeal denying appellant mother's motion to deem the first notice of appeal to be a premature appeal from the orders made at the hearing of July 12, 1991, because there was not good cause for it to be an appeal from the orders made at the subsequent hearing. The court also rejected appellant's requests to allow the appeal under the theory of constructive filing or for treatment of the appeal as a writ petition.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the judgment and found that Cal. Gov't Code &sect; 24001 set the eligibility requirements for local office. The court agreed with previous court decisions which found that legislature had intended to preempt local regulation of eligibility for election to local governing bodies. The court rejected defendant's argument that the statutes should have been construed to take into account changed conditions, because the issues involved whole statutory schemes that were not subject to the whims of public opinion. The court held that the statute did not grant power to defendant to change the qualifications of an elected official, and defendant had no special interest different from other cities.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants appealed the orders of the Superior Court of Los Angeles County (California) that convicted them for conspiracy to commit murder under Cal. Penal Code &sect;&sect; 182 and 187 and robbery under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 211 with a finding under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 12022(a) of being armed with firearms.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were convicted of conspiracy to commit murder and of robbery with firearms. On appeal they argued that they were improperly denied access to a writer's notes and tapes relative to a key witness, that secondary evidence of a lost item of evidence was improperly admitted and that juror misconduct required a new trial. The court affirmed, ruling that substantial evidence supported the finding that the writer's unpublished data was protected by the journalist's shield provision of Cal. Const. Art. I &sect; 2(b) and Cal. Evid. Code &sect; 1070 and the denial of access was not an abuse of discretion. The court also held that in the absence of bad faith on the part of the police, the failure to preserve potentially useful evidence did not constitute a denial of due process of law. The court further held that the trial court correctly denied the motion for new trial based upon allegations of jury misconduct because there was no showing that new evidence was improperly presented to the jury. The court also ruled that false imprisonment of the robbery victims was not an included offense of robbery and that the trial court properly excluded parts of transcripts of taped conversations.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendants' convictions, ruling that a writer's notes and tapes as to a key witness were protected under the journalist's shield law and the trial court's denial of access was not an abuse of discretion. The court also ruled that absent a showing of improper police motive, the loss of an item of evidence was not a denial of due process, and that there was no showing that new evidence was presented to the jury.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff Resolution Trust Authority sought review of a decision from the Superior Court of Santa Clara County (California) ordering plaintiff to pay defendant $ 415,000 on defendant's cross-complaint for damages resulting from negligent misrepresentations made with respect to the parties' security agreement. Defendant challenged the trial court's decision finding defendant liable for breach of contract and ordering specific performance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In plaintiff Resolution Trust Authority's action for breach of contract, defendant challenged the trial court's judgment ordering defendant to specifically perform by conveying stock as set forth in the parties' security agreement. On defendant's cross-complaint for detrimental reliance, plaintiff contested the trial court's judgment ordering plaintiff to pay defendant $ 415,000 for negligent misrepresentation. The parties' written contract provided that plaintiff would invest money in defendant's business in exchange for an assignment of stock when certain conditions precedent were met. On appeal, the court held that plaintiff was not liable for making misrepresentations because the federal common law D'Oench, Duhme doctrine, codified at 12 U.S.C.S. 1823(e), preempted state law and barred introduction of the parties' unwritten understandings in determining the parties' intent in the written contract. Therefore, the court reversed the judgment in favor of defendant. Because specific performance was not a statutory remedy for breach of a security agreement, the court also reversed the decision in favor of plaintiff. The court reversed as to both the appeal and the cross-appeal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner state agency appealed an order of the Superior Court of Fresno County (California), which granted respondent a writ of mandate to set aside an order of petitioner that suspended respondent's driving privileges for second offenders under Cal. Veh. Code &sect; 13353.2(a), and 13353.3(b)(2). Respondent claimed there was a conflict between the administrative per se suspension and probation statutes allowing him a restricted license.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent was arrested for driving under the influence, and petitioner state agency subsequently suspended respondent's driving privileges for second offenders under Cal. Veh. Code &sect;&sect; 13353.2(a), and 13353.3(b)(2). Respondent pleaded guilty and the trial court placed him on probation and restricted his driver's license to travel from and to work under Cal. Veh. Code &sect;&sect; 23165, 23166(b). Petitioner refused to grant respondent a restricted license. At a hearing on petitioner's suspension order, respondent argued that there was a conflict between the administrative per se suspension law and the probation statutes which provided for license restriction rather than suspension. Petitioner upheld its order and respondent filed for a writ of mandate with the trial court to vacate the order, which the trial court granted. Petitioner appealed the ruling, and the court reversed the order and remanded the case. The court held that the laws did not conflict. The legislature intended two processes, one criminal and one administrative, to address drunk driving concerns and the statutes did not violate due process rights, because the criminal and civil dispositions ran concurrently.</SPAN></P>

The criminal punishment and administrative sanctions imposed on respondent served different purposes and did not violate due process rights. The case was remanded.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged jury convictions for six counts of forcible rape under Cal. Pen. Code &sect; 361(2) and two counts of oral copulation by force under Cal. Pen. Code &sect; 288a(c). Defendant kidnapped a woman from her home, beating and raping her repeatedly for a period of several hours before she was able to escape. On appeal, the court held that, under Cal. Pen. Code &sect; 868.5, the trial court did not err in permitting the victim's sister to sit in the courtroom as a support person while the victim testified. There was no evidence suggesting that the sister's presence unduly influenced or prejudiced the jury in reaching its verdicts. The fact that the sister testified prior to acting as a support person also diminished any possibility of prejudice. Other than mentioning in closing argument that the jury had observed &quot;two crying women,&quot; defense counsel failed to make a record specifying why defendant's due process right to a fair trial was abridged by the support person's presence. The court affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's multiple convictions for rape, holding that defendant's due process right to a fair trial was not impaired by the presence of a support witness in the courtroom during the victim's testimony, as permitted by law. Defense counsel failed to create an adequate record to show that his client was prejudiced by the support witness's attendance.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">During a pursuit that extended over several miles, defendant ran five stop signs and two red lights with a car that was stolen; he also drove on the curb to pass cars and to cut off a tractor-trailer rig. As a result, defendant was involved in an automobile accident that killed another individual. The court admitted evidence of defendant's outstanding arrest warrant for a parole violation. Defendant pleaded guilty to selling and transporting marijuana, and the jury convicted him of second-degree murder, unlawful driving or taking of a vehicle, and attempting to evade a pursuing police vehicle. The trial court rejected defendant's contention that no evidence showed he was intoxicated during the pursuit, and that intoxication was an essential element for a conviction of second-degree murder. The court determined that fleeing from a police in a high speed chase supported the conclusion that, even without being intoxicated, he had implied malice, which supported the conviction. Although the jury instruction was erroneously phrased in unqualified terms, the jury would have reached the same decision because of defendant's dangerous acts. His convictions were affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's conviction of second-degree murder, among others, was affirmed because his fleeing from a police high speed chase showed that he had implied malice to support his conviction for second-degree murder.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court held that the statute was ambiguous, taking to consideration the context of a bifurcated capital case, in which the issues of guilt and punishment were always tried in separate proceedings. The court held that with respect to a capital case, the statute did not mandate the defense disclosure of evidence it intended to present at the penalty trial until a guilty verdict and finding of special circumstances have been returned in the guilt trial.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant candidate and his campaign committees sought review of a decision from the Superior Court, Orange County (California), which denied their petition for writ of mandamus, which challenged punitive measures undertaken against them by respondent Fair Political Practices Commission. Respondent found appellants violated Cal. Gov't Code &sect; 84305 by sending out anonymous campaign literature.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant candidate and his campaign committees circulated anonymous political mailings. Respondent political commission brought punitive measures against appellants. An administrative law judge determined that appellants' actions violated Cal. Gov't Code &sect; 84305, which required the candidate or the committee sending out such mailings to identify themselves. Appellants contended the statute was unconstitutional and sought a writ of mandamus, declaratory relief, and injunctive relief. Their motions for a peremptory writ and for summary judgment were denied. On appeal, the lower court's decision was affirmed. The appellate court held that the state had a compelling interest in an informed electorate, in assuring that the voters are provided with information which will aid them in evaluating the candidates and that &sect; 84305, as applied to appellants, promoted the state's compelling interest in an informed electorate. The appellate court applied a limited construction of the statute to ensure narrow application of the disclosure rule in order to avoid a declaration of unconstitutionality based on overbreadth.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The denial of appellant candidate and his campaign committees' writ seeking review of respondent political commission's assessment of punitive measures against them was affirmed. The appellate court held the applicable provision of the California Government Code was constitutional as applied to appellants and that its potential overbreadth was cured by the interpretation that it applied only to candidates and candidate controlled committees.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, a temporary conservatee, appealed the judgment of the Superior Court of Orange County (California), which terminated her parental rights, claiming the court erred by conducting the termination hearing without the presence of her public guardian, resulting in a denial of her right to the effective assistance of counsel, and denial of due process because the termination of parental rights was based on a preponderance of the evidence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff mother, who had been placed under a temporary conservatorship, appealed the order of the lower court, which terminated her parental rights. On appeal, the court reversed. The court held that the parent was denied due process because Cal. Welf. &amp; Inst. Code &sect; 366.26&nbsp;unconstitutionally authorized the trial court to terminate her parental rights based on findings made by a preponderance of the evidence and found this lesser burden of proof constitutionally insufficient. The court held that the question of the adoptability of the child should not be permitted to supplant or influence the independent finding concerning parental unfitness. The court held that it was error to fail to appoint a guardian ad litem for the mother, but found the error to be harmless. The trial court was informed that the parent had been placed under a temporary conservatorship and a permanent appointment was pending; this was sufficient to require the appointment of a guardian ad litem.</SPAN></P>

The failure to appoint a guardian was error, but harmless.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant accountant was suspended by the Federal Home Loan Bank Board (FHLBB) because of improprieties perceived in his audit performance of a savings and loan. Respondent state board of accountancy later filed an accusation seeking to revoke appellant's license to practice accountancy in the state pursuant to Cal. Bus. &amp; Prof. Code &sect; 5100. An administrative law judge made specific findings that the FHLBB suspension was substantially related to the qualifications, functions, or duties of the accounting profession, and respondent revoked appellant's license. The trial court refused to issue a writ of mandate to set the decision. The court affirmed the decision. The court concluded a reasonable interpretation of Cal. Bus. &amp; Prof. Code &sect; 5100(g) included a requirement that a licensee's prior suspension be substantially related to conduct pertaining to qualifications, functions, or duties as an accountant to justify discipline under &sect; 5100.

Appellant facially challenged the constitutionality of &sect; 1293 contending that admitting the preliminary hearing testimony of the minors unconstitutionally deprived him of his right to confront witnesses as guaranteed by due process. The court relied on controlling precedent which held that a state's interest in protecting child victims could outweigh the right of confrontation and maintained that the legislature could properly find it unnecessary to require a showing of unavailability before a juvenile could admit preliminary hearing testimony of a minor. The court also held that the presumption underlying &sect; 1293 was that testimony and cross-examination from the former proceeding as recorded in the transcript provided a sufficient means for the court to assess credibility of nontestifying witnesses, and that the presumption was constitutionally valid. Accordingly the judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant father sought review of a judgment from the Superior Court of Shasta County (California), which terminated his parental rights and placed his minor daughter for adoption pursuant to Cal.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the court found that the use of a preponderance of evidence standard at the review hearing under Cal.

Welf. &amp; Inst. Code &sect; 361(b). The court noted that it was only on the narrow question of whether the child would have been subjected to a substantial risk of harm in a return to a home which already had been found to be unfit that the legislature had chosen a preponderance of the evidence standard. The court then rejected appellant's assertion that Cal. Welf. &amp; Inst. Code &sect; 366.21(f) constituted an unconstitutional presumption of parental unfitness, finding that the statute did not establish a presumption affecting appellant's burden of proof, but rather a rebuttable presumption to be reached by respondent agency with respect to parental unfitness.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the order that terminated appellant father's parental rights and placed the dependent child for adoption where the preponderance of the evidence at the review hearing established that a return to the custody of appellant, who already had been shown to be unfit by clear and convincing evidence at the initial disposition hearing, would have created a substantial risk to the child's physical or emotional well-being.</SPAN></P>

Because no hearing record existed, the court could not ascertain whether or not the billboard fell down due to plaintiff's failure to conform to the Act. Because the Act provided plaintiff with no meaningful due process either before or after the revocation of his permit, the first paragraph of section 5463 of the Act was unconstitutional. The court reversed and remanded.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court's grant of summary judgment to defendant department of transportation and declared a portion of an outdoor advertising statute unconstitutional because the statute deprived plaintiff billboard owner of his property without giving plaintiff notice or a meaningful opportunity to be heard, thereby vitiating plaintiff's due process rights.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff petroleum transporter sought to invalidate an assessment district that was created to fund road improvements, because its properties did not receive the special benefit necessary to justify the special assessment.

Plaintiff sought review, and the court affirmed the judgment. The court held that the Majority Protest Act, Cal. Sts. &amp; High. Code &sect; 2800, was inapplicable to assessments formed in conjunction with Integrated Financing District Act, Cal. Gov't Code &sect; 53178, and that there was no majority protest or any evidence that a majority of the affected property owners opposed the assessments.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

Petitioner refused to comply with an order that directed him to comply with the prosecution's request for discovery of statements made by a specified defense witness. Petitioner refused to comply with the order upon the argument that a local court rule provided that the defense was entitled to 15 days' formal notice of any prosecution request for a formal discovery order. The court below found petitioner in contempt after it found that Cal. Penal Code &sect; 1054.5 prevailed over the local rule and after it found that petitioner's request for 15 days' notice was untimely. The court denied a petition for writ of habeas corpus filed that was subsequently filed by petitioner because Cal. Civ. Proc. Code &sect; 1005(b) and the local rule at issue provided that their time limits could be shortened by a court. Petitioner's good faith belief that the reciprocal discovery law was unconstitutional did not protect his deliberate violation of the lower court's order.</SPAN></P>

The property was discovered after a routine traffic stop which revealed that appellant and his passenger both had suspended licenses. The officer decided to impound the van and conduct an inventory search because the van was parked on an isolated stretch of road, because there was the possibility that appellant would simply drive off once he left, because it was late at night, and because the van could be vandalized if left on the highway. The inventory search revealed property that led to appellant's conviction. The trial court's judgment was affirmed on appeal. The court found that the traffic stop, decision to impound, and subsequent inventory search were reasonable under the circumstances, even though the sheriff's department lacked a written policy on impoundment, because the deputies were given clear parameters under which to exercise their discretion pursuant to Cal. Veh. Code &sect; 22651(p). Therefore, the trial court properly denied appellant's motion to suppress.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of one count of continuous sexual abuse of a child in violation of Cal. Penal Code &sect; 288.5. Appellant argued on appeal that &sect; 288.5&nbsp;unconstitutionally deprived an accused of due process by failing to give notice of the specific acts of molestation with which he is charged and deprives the criminal defendant of the right to a unanimous jury verdict by permitting a conviction without unanimity on which acts of molestation occurred. Appellant's conviction was affirmed on appeal after the court determined that &sect; 288.5 was constitutional. By criminalizing a course of conduct, &sect; 288.5 was intended to make proof of specific acts unnecessary. The fact that the jurors select different acts to satisfy the numerical threshold for a course of conduct did not render the statute unconstitutional. Rather, it assured that the jury must agree that there was a course of conduct. Moreover, it prevented convictions based on a single act or a series of acts upon which the jury did not agree. The court found that the information, coupled with the victim's testimony at the preliminary hearing, had more than adequately apprised appellant of the nature of the charges against him.</SPAN></P>

The court denied the petition, concluding the reciprocal discovery provisions required defense disclosure of penalty phase evidence and such requirement was not unconstitutional. The court explained the statutory scheme requiring both defense and prosecution disclosure did not entitle the prosecution to any form of discovery not available to the defense. The court further determined the word &quot;trial&quot; as used in the statute applied to the penalty phase of a trial. The court reasoned during the penalty phase, the jury addressed itself to ultimate issues and had to sift through facts in evaluating the substance of the defendant's record, history, mental condition, and circumstances. The court noted under such circumstance, a defendant was not entitled to an opportunity to present false or misleading information.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><BR><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c5">DISPOSITION:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;There is no proof in this record that Gates ever intentionally violated any court order or willfully neglected any duty.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant Municipal Court for the Judicial District of Orange County challenged the decision of the Superior Court of Orange County (California), which granted respondent Orange County jail sheriff's request for a writ of prohibition and vacated appellant's contempt conviction against respondent for violation of Cal. Penal Code &sect; 827.1, which precluded the pretrial release of persons arrested for certain crimes.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent Orange County jail sheriff had to comply with a federal court order that required every prisoner to have a bed or bunk. To make more room, respondent instituted a cite and release program for pretrial arrestees, but was unaware that it violated Cal. Penal Code &sect; 827.1, until appellant Municipal Court for the Judicial District of Orange County brought it to his attention and he amended his policies. Nonetheless, appellant brought contempt proceedings against respondent for intentionally and willfully releasing criminals in violation of Cal. Penal Code &sect; 827.1, at times prior to the revised policy having gone into effect. The lower court found that there was insufficient evidence and vacated the contempt conviction. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that enforcement of &sect; 827.1 was legally impossible while simultaneously following the federal court order to the extent that the cite and release program was necessary to implement the court order. Even if the defense of impossibility didn't apply, appellant never proved that respondent acted with the requisite willful intent to support a contempt conviction. The lower court did not err.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the decision granting the writ and vacating the contempt judgment. It was legally impossible for respondent Orange County jail sheriff to simultaneously enforce the state law precluding release of persons arrested for certain crimes. Also, appellant Municipal Court for the Judicial District of Orange County failed to prove that respondent willfully neglected any duty.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, mother of an abused minor and dependent child of the state, challenged the decision of the Superior Court of Orange County (California) which allowed the minor to testify in camera regarding her living arrangements decision pursuant to Cal.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At the selection and implementation hearing of a minor who became a dependent child of the state after her mother's boyfriend abused her, the minor could not choose between living with her maternal aunt and uncle or appellant, mother of the abused minor and dependent child of the state. The trial court proposed that the minor testify in camera pursuant to Cal. Welf. &amp; Inst. Code &sect; 350(b) and that only the minor and her counsel be present along with a court reporter, which appellant's counsel did not object to. After reviewing the minor's testimony that she wanted to live with her aunt and uncle, appellant believed that it would have been different had she been present. Appellant challenged the trial court's in camera hearing. The court reversed, holding that the trial court was without authority to exclude appellant's attorney from the hearing, under Cal. Welf. &amp; Inst. Code &sect;&sect; 350(b), 366.26. While any constitutional right could be waived, mere acquiescence was not a waiver, and there was no showing that appellant was aware of her right to have counsel present at the in camera hearing. Failing to require counsel's presence in the absence of a valid waiver was prejudicial.</SPAN></P>

Appellant was prejudiced by the trial court's failure to require her attorney's presence, and the court ordered a new selection and implementation hearing.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed and remanded the matter for further proceedings to determine the threshold constitutional question of whether appellant demonstrated a sufficient commitment to his parental responsibilities. The court found that appellant's parental rights were terminated upon a finding that there was no constructive receipt of the child by appellant pursuant to Cal.

The court reversed. The court found that appellee was &quot;essentially controlled&quot; by the county and, therefore, was a &quot;special district&quot; within the meaning of &sect; 4. The court also found that the sales tax was a special tax requiring supermajority approval by the electorate because it was levied for a specific purpose and not placed in a general fund to be used for general governmental purposes.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of possessing a sharp instrument while confined in state prison, in violation of Cal.

The appellate court agreed and reversed the conviction. The court held that although many of the circumstances in the case suggested that the jury, at the deliberation stage, was aware of the presumption of innocence and the prosecution's burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt, it was not persuaded that the trial court's failure to repeat the necessary instruction in the final charge was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.

Respondents claimed that the information in the minors' records was necessary to serve the public's interest because it showed the manner by which appellant handled cases involving potential child abuse. The juvenile court concluded that it had discretion to release the records to the newspaper, and decided that it would not prohibit such disclosure because the records were directly relevant to an investigation conducted by the newspaper in connection with the administration of a social services program. The juvenile court authorized disclosure of the records, but restricted respondents' use of them. Appellant filed a petition for writ of supersedeas to challenge the disclosure order. The court granted the petition and directed the juvenile court to vacate its order requiring disclosure of the records. Appellant was a public office that administered public social services and received grants by the United States. Therefore, Cal. Welf. &amp; Inst. Code &sect; 10850 protected the confidentiality of appellant's records.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the juvenile court's order granting a request by respondents, newspaper and its reporter, for disclosure of records concerning two deceased minors. Appellant Child Protective Services (CPS) was a public office that administered public social services and received grants by the United States, so state law protected the confidentiality of its records.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiff timely filed a petition seeking extraordinary relief. The court recognized that &sect; 170.6 guaranteed litigants, including prosecutors, a right to disqualify a judge. The court concluded that defendant failed to establish the requisite prima facie case of purposeful discrimination; therefore, respondent had no authority to compel plaintiff to assume the burden of demonstrating that the challenge was not predicated on group bias alone. In the absence of a prima facie case of race-based exclusion, respondent was bound to accept the peremptory challenge without further inquiry. Further, the court found, plaintiff's proffered reasons constituted sufficient grounds for the exercise of the challenge.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant property claimant filed an action to quiet title to 7.5 acres of real property in a certain county.

When the date for furnishing security to the court the second time passed without being tendered, the trial court granted respondent's motion to dismiss.

The trial court noticed the error and set a new hearing after which appellant was given a new deadline to furnish security. When security was not furnished, another order of dismissal was entered. Appellant filed a notice of appeal. One judge entered all of the orders. Appellant had filed a peremptory challenge under Cal. Civ. Proc.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant mother sought review of the decision from the Superior Court of San Diego County (California), which terminated appellant's parental rights to her minor son, asserting that the standard of evidence used at the hearing, under Cal. Welf. &amp; Inst. Code &sect; 366.26, was incorrect and that she received ineffective assistance of counsel.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The lower court determined during a Cal. Welf. &amp; Inst. Code &sect; 366.22 hearing that return of the minor son to appellant mother would present a substantial risk of detriment and that there was no substantial probability that the minor could be returned to appellant's custody within a six- month period. At a subsequent selection and implementation hearing under Cal. Welf. &amp; Inst. Code &sect; 366.26, appellant's parental rights were terminated. On appeal the court granted respondent social services agency's motion to dismiss the appeal and found that review of an order terminating reunification services and referring the case to a &sect; 366.26 selection and implementation hearing must be undertaken by petition for extraordinary writ, and could not be mounted as an appeal from the later judgment rendered at the selection and implementation hearing. The court found that appellant failed to offer evidence to support her claim of ineffective assistance of counsel because appellant did not prove that counsel's failure to timely file a review petition was due to negligence and that a timely filed petition would have resulted in a more favorable outcome.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted respondent social services agency's motion to dismiss the review of appellant mother's termination of her parental rights because appellant's claim of ineffective assistance of counsel was not supported by evidence of negligence or that a more favorable outcome would have resulted. Appellant's claims of errors in her reunification hearing with her minor son were barred because they were not timely brought by writ petition.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants appealed the judgments from the Superior Court of San Diego County (California), convicting them of robbery that involved a great taking and of being armed with a firearm in violation of Cal. Penal Code &sect;&sect; 211, 12022.6(b), and 12022(a). Defendants argued that the trial court erred in failing sua sponte to instruct the jury according to Cal. Jury Instructions - Criminal No. 17.01.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were convicted of robbery that involved a great taking and being armed with a firearm. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court rejected the argument that Cal. Jury Instructions - Criminal No. 17.01 was required by the possibility that jurors could split on what defendants did, with some believing they directly participated in the crime and others concluding they were only aiders and abettors. The court held that when conviction on a single count could be based on two or more discrete criminal events, No. 17.01 would be an appropriate jury instruction, and jurors should all agree that defendants were responsible for the same discrete criminal event. Where multiple theories or acts could form the basis of a guilty verdict on one discrete criminal event, however, the charge urged by defendants would be inappropriate. Because both a perpetrator and an aider and abettor would have contributed to but a single criminal event, jurors did not need to unanimously agree on defendants' role, even when different evidence and facts supported each conclusion. The trial court was not required to instruct on jury unanimity.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendants' convictions for robbery that involved a great taking and being armed with a firearm because it was not necessary for the jurors to have agreed on the theory of criminality or the theory of criminal participation.</SPAN></P>

Moreover, the court found that the finding of clear and convincing evidence of detriment to the child or unfitness made at the jurisdictional hearing dictating temporary removal of the child was insufficient to satisfy due process because it was merely a finding for temporary removal. The court found that, before appellant's parental rights could be terminated, due process required respondent to support its allegations by clear and convincing evidence at the time of the order permanently severing the relationship.</SPAN></P>

Judicial review of police power looked at whether or not a regulation was reasonably related to furthering public health, safety, comfort, and welfare. The court found that the ordinances were reasonably related to preserving the public interest in the bay. Respondent had determined that free anchorage was detrimental to overall development and public use of the bay.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Ruling against appellants, the court affirmed the trial court's judgment. The court held that respondent San Diego Unified Port District's ordinances permitting only designated anchorage and mooring were reasonably related to preserving the public interest in the bay. Boaters did not have a constitutional right to unregulated long-term anchorage in public navigable waters.</SPAN></P>

The appeals court affirmed the conviction for manufacturing methamphetamine and reversed the conviction for making space available for manufacturing methamphetamine. The trial court properly denied the suppression motion, brought pursuant to Cal. Penal Code &sect; 1538.5, as there was probable cause for the search warrant. There was sufficient evidence to support the conviction for manufacturing methamphetamine, as the facts supported the finding that defendant knowingly permitted the manufacturing to take place on his property. The court held that the evidence was insufficient to support defendant's conviction of making space available for the manufacture of methamphetamine. Based on the evidence presented, defendant could not have been convicted of the violation. The Double Jeopardy Clause forbade a second trial.

Health &amp; Safety Code &sect; 11359, and placed him on probation one condition of which required him to register with the local police or sheriff in any community in which he was domiciled.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court, which convicted defendant of possession of methamphetamine for personal use pursuant to Cal.

The trial court placed him on probation, one condition of which required him to register with the local police or sheriff in any community in which he was domiciled. Defendant challenged the statutorily mandated requirement as unconstitutional. Defendant contended that such registration violated his right to personal privacy under Cal. Const. art. I, &sect; 1. The court held that although the registration requirement did intrude on defendant's right of privacy, it did not substantially burden that right. The court discerned a rational legislative basis for collecting and maintaining information concerning the whereabouts of drug offenders convicted of certain more serious drug offenses. Retaining such information was properly within the exercise of the state's right to enact laws promoting public health, welfare and safety, by permitting local police to keep track of the identities and locations of drug offenders in the community.</SPAN></P>

The registration requirement, which required defendant to register with the local police in any community in which he was domiciled, did not violate defendant's constitutional right to privacy. The registration requirement did not unduly burden the right of privacy of a controlled substance offender and was not prohibited as a dual punishment.</SPAN></P>

The trial court found one of defendant's prior convictions constitutionally invalid and struck it from his record. The people's appeal was dismissed by the reviewing court because it held that the trial court's order to strike one of defendant's prior convictions was not appealable under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 1466(a)(2). The reviewing court denied the people's petition for rehearing but certified the case to an appellate court, which transferred it. The court reversed the order and remanded the case to the reviewing court holding that Cal. Penal Code &sect; 1466 and Cal. Const. art. I, &sect; 29 authorized the people's appeal of an order by an inferior court that struck an allegation of a prior conviction before judgment.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">California statutes required appellant, owner of a towing business, to accept credit cards as payment from the owners of vehicles whose vehicles had been involuntarily towed. Seeking declaratory relief, appellant asserted that the statutes were unconstitutional under the legal tender, equal protection, and due process clauses of the United States Constitution. The trial court entered judgment in favor of respondent commissioner. Appellant sought review. The court affirmed, holding that legislation requiring towing companies to accept checks and credit cards did not violate the legal tender provision of U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 10. Next, there was no denial of equal protection of the laws by requiring towing facilities, operating under a legislative aegis, to accept credit cards from vehicle owners whose vehicles had been involuntarily towed. Finally, appellant was not deprived of property without due process of the law because a statutory lien could be statutorily defined and limited. Thus, appellant was not deprived of property; his property interest was a lien requiring possession of the vehicle, and possession had to be surrendered upon presentation of a valid bank credit card.</SPAN></P>

Defendant filed a motion to dismiss the information which was granted. On appeal, the court reversed, holding that the term abandonment under Cal. Health &amp; Safety Code &sect; 25189.5 did not require an affirmative relocation of the hazardous waste, but was simply the permanent and intentional surrendering of dominion and control over that waste. The defense of legal impossibility was not appropriate in that defendant had the opportunity to remove the waste despite having been evicted from the premises. The defense of financial impossibility was rejected on the grounds that it was not available, and even assuming that it was, the evidence adduced at the hearing did not support the defense. There was no question that defendant was aware of the actual facts in leaving behind the waste and was therefore acting in a knowing manner.

The court found the enhancement to be true, and sentenced defendant to two years for the assault and to a two-year consecutive term for the enhancement. Defendant appealed arguing that the evidence was insufficient to support imposition of the enhancement, and that the enhancement was unconstitutional because it was vague and overbroad. The court reversed in part, applying the test of Cal. Penal code 186.22(f) because there was no evidence suggesting the three predicate convictions were related to the gang, and the court found that the state failed to demonstrate that the predicate offenses were gang-related.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of first degree murder and was sentenced to life imprisonment. The Board of Prison Terms (BPT) decided to grant him parole, and the Governor of California reversed the decision. Defendant filed a habeas corpus petition, claiming that Cal. Const. art. V, &sect; 8(b), which allowed the governor a 30-day period to review and affirm, modify, or reverse the decision of the BPT, was enacted after defendant committed his crime, and contending that the law was ex post facto. Defendant also contended that the governor's reversal was ineffective because he failed to timely act. The court held that the governor's authority to review the parole decision commenced on the effective date of the BPT's decision. The court determined that the review authorized by Cal. Const. art. V, &sect; 8(b), and Cal. Pen. Code &sect; 3041.2, was confined to a reexamination and consideration of the administrative record before the BPT. The court held that the provisions were not ex post facto because they merely provided for discretionary review, and did not punish a previously innocent act.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury convicted defendant of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon in violation of Cal.

Const. art. I, &sect; 9, because defendant was punished for a violation of a new statute rather than receiving an increase of punishment for the earlier offense. The court reasoned that the legal consequences of defendant's past conduct were not changed. The court found that the probation department's notification of active probationers only of &sect; 12021(a)'s provisions was reasonably related to the goals of probation and within its discretion; the decision was not arbitrary, and active probationers was a reasonable classification for equal protection purposes. The court concluded that defendant could not show intentional or purposeful discrimination.

The court also held that the California legislature's utilization of its procedure for amendments to &sect; 667 was proper, and that the resulting amended statute was valid. The court held defendant lacked standing to challenge the constitutionality of &sect; 667.5, because his sentence was not enhanced under &sect; 667.5. Because defendant did not make a showing of discriminatory enforcement of &sect; 667, the court held defendant's equal protection challenge to &sect; 667 failed.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff doctor decided to retire. He sought advice from defendants attorney and law firm regarding the purchase of &quot;tail&quot; insurance coverage for medical malpractice. Defendants advised plaintiff that plaintiff need not pay the premium. Thereafter, plaintiff was sued for medical malpractice, and defendants were unable to reinstate his tail insurance through arbitration. Plaintiff was required to retain counsel to defend the medical malpractice action at his own expense. He settled the action by paying an amount in excess of the premium amount he would have paid for the tail coverage, and brought his legal malpractice claim within one year of the settlement, but not within one year of the arbitration award or of his retention of counsel. The trial court applied Cal. Civ. Proc. Code &sect; 340.6 and dismissed the claim. The court affirmed the judgment of dismissal because it found that plaintiff sustained injury when he incurred attorney fees, and the cause of action accrued then, more than a year before he filed the action for legal malpractice, and that defect could not be cured by amendment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a prior determination of paternity, the state prosecuted and convicted defendant for willfully failing to support his minor child under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 270. His conviction was upheld on appeal. The matter was transferred to the court, which reversed his conviction. The court determined that while &sect; 270 did not create two separate offenses, as defendant asserted, the trial court did interpret the statute erroneously. The court held that the trial court erred when it modified the jury instructions based on its interpretation, as it had the effect of creating a conclusive presumption of paternity where a prior determination existed, and defendant had notice of the ruling. The court ruled that such a presumption was unconstitutional and invalid, and so the jury instruction was improper. The trial court erred when it precluded defendant from introducing evidence, including a letter from the child's mother, to show that he reasonably believed the minor child was not his. The failure to allow evidence relevant to defendant's mistake of fact defense was reversible error, and the trial judge should have allowed defendant's jury instruction regarding this defense as well.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with murder, the prosecution of which was twice dismissed; once because a material witness was missing, and again because of a typographical omission in the information charging the offense.

The trial court, on defendant's motion, dismissed the information on the grounds that Cal. Penal Code &sect; 1387 barred a third filing absent a showing under &sect; 1387.1 of excusable neglect on the part of the prosecution, which the trial court determined was not shown. The state appealed, and the court reversed, holding that because defendant was not prejudiced by the prosecution's neglect, and because there was no showing of bad faith on the part of the prosecution, the public policy promoting substantial justice and favoring trial on the merits should prevail. The court noted that the magistrate had not abused his discretion when he determined excusable neglect on the prosecution's part under &sect; 1387.1.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant golf course licensees were licensed by respondent city to operate respondent's golf course.

The trial court granted the injunction, which also enjoined appellants from interfering with respondent's use of all personal property necessary to the operation of the course, including appellants' personalty. Appellant sought review and claimed that respondent's actions in appropriating the personal property owned by them amounted to a taking for public use without compensation in violation of Cal. Const. art I, &sect; 19, and Cal. Civ. Proc. Code &sect;&sect; 1255.010-1255.480. The court affirmed the injunction, but modified it to the extent that it enjoined respondent from taking possession of appellants' personalty.

Defendants argued that the required minimum was not limited to funding for local schools. The court reversed, ruling that the constitutional provisions reserving the initiative power to local voters were construed in light of other provisions which define the scope of permissible local legislation. The court ruled that local voters were precluded from accomplishing by initiative that which was beyond the powers of the local board of supervisors. The court further ruled that Proposition 98 did not alter the state's role in education and the constitution continued to make education a statewide matter, and that it was within the legislature's plenary power to determine how to fulfill the required education funding level and to include therein funds not controlled by local schools.</SPAN></P>

The court held the evidence was sufficient for the jury to reasonably find, beyond a reasonable doubt, that appellant committed the acts with the intent required by statute. The evidence showed appellant's intent was to arouse the sexual desires' of himself or the victim in violation of &sect; 288. Appellant also used the required physical force pursuant to &sect; 288(b) because the physical force he used was substantially greater than that necessary to accomplish the act. In addition, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to hold an evidentiary hearing on juror misconduct because appellant's assertions raised no more than a speculative possibility of misconduct. Furthermore, there was no error in allowing expert testimony on the characteristics generally exhibited by abused children because the evidence was admitted to rehabilitate the victims' credibility after appellant's vigorous credibility-oriented cross-examination of the children.</SPAN></P>

Civ. Code &sect;&sect; 7000-7021.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was the biological father of a baby born out of wedlock and born after respondent biological mother married respondent husband. Once advised of the birth, appellant told respondents he wanted to participate in the baby's upbringing and contribute to its support. When respondents enjoined appellant from further contact, he promptly filed suit to declare paternity. On respondents' demurrer, the trial court dismissed the complaint. Because respondents were married when the baby was born, respondent husband was the presumed father pursuant to the Uniform Paternity Act (UPA), Cal. Civ. Code &sect; 7004(a)(1). Under the UPA, the trial court held, appellant lacked standing to bring an action either to establish his paternity or to rebut the presumption that respondent husband was the baby's father. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded. The court held that, as applied to appellant, the UPA's standing provisions were an unconstitutional infringement on his substantive due process right to form a relationship with his child. Noting that appellant had promptly taken steps to preserve his opportunity interest, the court concluded that he should be allowed standing under the UPA.</SPAN></P>

Appellant billed respondent for maintaining voter files, establishing and reviewing precinct lines, training poll workers, and maintaining poll sites. Respondent filed a cross-claim to recover prior election overpayments. The trial court held that appellant could not bill respondent for the aforementioned costs and could not charge at all if an election was not held. The trial court held that respondent's cross-claim was barred by the three-year statute of limitations in Cal. Civ. Proc. Code &sect; 338. The court affirmed as modified, holding that under Cal. Elec. Code &sect; 23524 and Cal. Educ. Code &sect; 5420, respondent could be billed only for actual costs incurred as a result of its participation in its school election, not for election preparation costs. Respondent was not responsible for list of aforementioned costs because these costs would have been incurred regardless of respondent's election involvement.

The court affirmed the conviction and rejected appellant's argument, explaining that the statute criminalized a course of continuous conduct and not the specific acts of abuse that occurred. The court noted that the legislature enacted the statute to reach those repeated acts of child sexual abuse that were perpetrated by those with recurring access to the victims. The court found that the evidence of prior uncharged acts of molestation upon the victim were sufficient to support a finding that appellant sodomized and orally copulated with the victim. The court further elaborated that where the issue presented to the jury was whether a defendant committed a course of conduct, a unanimity instruction was proper because the issue was not whether a specific act was committed on a specific day.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants sought review of an order by the Superior Court of Santa Clara County (California), which convicted defendants of robbery, attempted robbery and false imprisonment and found weapons and arming enhancements true. Defendants challenged the prearrest photographic identification and the constitutionality of the restriction on voir dire in Cal. Civ. Proc. Code 223.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were convicted of robbery, attempted robbery and false imprisonment and the weapons and arming enhancements were found true. On appeal, the court affirmed the convictions, holding that the restriction on voir dire found in Cal. Civ. Proc. Code 223, did not violate U. S. Const. amend XIV, or Cal. Const. art. I, &sect; 7, because the distinction between civil and criminal voir dire was rationally related to the legitimate state purpose of stopping abuse of the voir dire process. The court further held that the pre-arrest photographic identification of defendants was not suggestive because the photos presented for identification were of persons similar in age, complexion, and physical features. The court further held that the defendants' sentencing was proper because of the multiple acts of robbery and multiple victims. The court also ruled that the trial court could properly considered the defendants' lack of remorse when probation was denied.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants' convictions were affirmed because the restrictions of voir dire in a criminal case did not violate the equal protection clause of the United States or California Constitutions. The court further held that the photographic lineup was not overly suggestive because the photos were of persons of similar age, complexion, and physical features.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of making terrorist threats in violation of Cal. Penal Code &sect; 422, when he told a coworker he was going to shoot a television journalist. On appeal, the court affirmed, and held that the fact that &sect; 422 did not require an intent to carry out the threat did not affect its validity under U.S. Const. amend. I. The court held that &sect; 422 controlled pure speech and that the crime could be committed by words alone, without action or an intent to act. The court held that &sect; 422 did not require that defendant have a specific intent that the threat be communicated to the intended victim, only that the statement be taken as a threat. There was sufficient evidence for the jury to conclude that defendant intended his threat to be taken seriously, including the nature of the threat, his previous obsessive behavior regarding the victim, his prior threat, and his possession of bullets. The victim's fear was sustained for a sufficient time to sustain the jury's finding. The facts surrounding the making of the threat were relevant and the trial court did not err in admitting the evidence. The prosecutor's comment regarding the rights of the jurors was not prejudicial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction of making terrorist threats and held that the statute did not violate defendant's First Amendment rights because it was not overbroad.

On remand, the court affirmed the award of damages and nonsuit and reversed the grant of a new trial and judgment notwithstanding the verdict. The court held that due process required that in an award of punitive damages, it was required to consider the reprehensibility of defendants' conduct, the deterrent effect in light of defendants' financial condition, and whether the punitive damages bore a reasonable relation to the actual damages. The court held that given the conspiratorial nature of defendants' conduct, the award was reasonable, that the ratio of punitive to actual damages fell within that approved in other California cases, and that there was sufficient financial data to determine that the awards would not cripple defendants' financial existence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant and decedent were involved in an automobile accident that apparently was the fault of decedent. Decedent died two months after the accident. Decedent's attorney commenced administration of the estate, and the court issued letters testamentary to respondent, decedent's daughter, as personal representative of the estate. Although appellant's attorney learned of decedent's death, appellant changed attorneys, and a creditor's claim against decedent's estate was not filed until 10 months later. Respondent rejected the claim, and appellant filed suit. The trial court ruled that appellant's claim was time-barred, and rejected appellant's motion for new trial. The court reversed, concluding that a recent United States Supreme Court opinion cast doubt on the validity of state nonclaim provisions. Due process rights required that a known or reasonably ascertainable creditor whose claim was not merely conjectural but who was not given actual notice of administration could not be cut off by a short claims filing period. The fact that appellant's attorney knew of decedent's death was not relevant; what was required was knowledge of administration, which appellant did not have.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's judgment time-barring appellant's claim against respondent, personal representative of decedent's estate, was reversed. A known or reasonably ascertainable creditor with a non-conjectural claim was entitled to actual notice of an estate's administration. The court remanded the cause to determine whether appellant was a known or reasonably ascertainable creditor of decedent's estate and for further proceedings if necessary.</SPAN></P>

The court determined that the paramount underlying purpose of dependency proceedings was the protection of the child, and appellant did not represent a competing interest in that respect.

The court reversed the trial court's judgments because respondents had failed to prove as a matter of law that the policy term &quot;damages&quot; unambiguously excluded coverage for the civil rights claims. The court held that resolution of the duty to defend depended upon whether coverage existed at the time the defense had to be commenced, not on whether respondents were ultimately required to pay monies to the third party plaintiff. Although the underlying complaint sought injunctive relief, respondents had a duty to defend because a suit for equitable relief could in some cases result in damages within the meaning of a general liability insurance policy and, in cases involving a complete violation of the right to vote, it was presumed a plaintiff was entitled to a damage award and costs and attorneys' fees could constitute damages within the meaning of the policies. The fact that the civil rights complaint did not seek damages did not preclude a duty to defend.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant administratrix sought review, on behalf of appellant decedent, of an order of the Superior Court, Los Angeles County (California) that entered judgment in favor of respondent individual in his action on a prior judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1967, appellant decedent executed a promissory note in another state, payable to respondent . When the note was not paid on the due date, respondent filed an action on the note. Almost ten years later, respondent received a judgment against appellant decedent. After entry of judgment, but prior to 1980, appellant decedent moved his domicile to another state. In 1987, respondent filed an application to renew the judgment, but his application was denied as untimely. Consequently, respondent filed a motion for relief from default. The motion was denied on the basis that the period for renewal of judgments ran after 10 years. In September 1988, respondent filed a separate action on the judgment of 1976. Appellant decedent died two months later, and appellant administratrix was substituted. The trial court entered judgment for respondent, and appellant moved for new trial. After the motion was denied, appellant sought review raising multiple points of error. On review, the court affirmed because the period of limitations was tolled up to the time respondent filed the separate action on the judgment, and the tolling did not violate any constitutional right of appellant decedent.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the order of judgment, because the ten-year statute of limitations was tolled before appellant left the state and the period of limitations remained tolled up to the time of the filing of respondent individual's separate action on the original judgment, and such tolling did not violate appellant decedent's constitutional rights.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners, members of Public Employees' Retirement System (PERS) and employee organization, sought a writ of mandamus challenging the constitutionality of portions of 1991 Cal. Stat. ch. 83, which repealed supplemental cost of living programs, directed that funds be used to offset contributions due from PERS employers, and transferred the responsibility of actuarial determinations from the PERS board to an actuary acting under a contract with respondent Governor. Petitioners contended that the repeal of the supplemental programs and the reallocation of the funds unconstitutionally impaired the contract rights of PERS beneficiaries and, along with the transfer of actuarial functions, violated Cal. Const. art. XVI, &sect; 17, which declared that the assets of a public pension or retirement system were trust funds. The court denied the petition and held that the statute did not impair previously existing contract rights because petitioners who had earned vested contract rights by rendering service under the repealed statutes were given comparable advantages under the new supplemental program, and that previous employees had no vested rights that could have been impaired.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied petitioners', members of the Public Employees' Retirement System and employee organizations, petitioner for mandamus and held that a law which repealed various supplemental cost of living programs and redirected funding from them was consistent with trust law and did not violate petitioners' preexisting contractual rights.

Petitioner requested a writ of mandate from the trial court, seeking an order directing the municipal court to sustain his demurrer. The trial court denied the writ, and petitioner then sought a writ of mandate from the court directing the trial court to vacate and set aside its order. Petitioner contended that the municipal code was preempted by state law, and was unconstitutionally vague. The court denied petitioner's writ, and held that state law had not preempted the area because the municipal code dealt with access to any fenced and posted area of the airport while that state law dealt only with areas of airport operations. Therefore the laws did not conflict and the subject matter of airport access was not fully and completely covered by state law. The court also held that the ordinance was not unconstitutionally vague because a reasonable person did not have to guess at its meaning.</SPAN></P>

The court first held that the standing issue did not apply to the situation. The court further held that there was no specific language or legislative intent granting the California Horse Racing Board the authority to award damages in these types of disputes. In addition the court held that appellee was estopped from bringing the interpretation issues. The court also held that appellant's actions were not excused by statute or regulation.

Appellant challenged respondent director's policy to include &quot;aid paid pending&quot; the outcome of hearings on reduced Aid to Families with Dependent Children payments in its calculation of net available income when determining eligibility for supplemental payments pursuant to Cal. Welf. &amp; Inst. Code &sect; 11450.2. Appellant received &quot;aid paid pending&quot; in the amount of appellant's maximum aid payment, but was denied supplemental income. It was determined that appellant had received an overpayment and had to repay the &quot;aid paid pending.&quot; Appellant argued that respondent's policy violated the purpose of &sect; 11450.2 and violated equal protection and due process. The court held that respondent's policy did not violate the statute's purpose because appellant never had to live on less than 80 percent of the maximum aid payment. The court held that there was an obvious correspondence between the classification and the goal of the statute because the system was rationally calculated to achieve its goal of assisting families most in need of immediate cash.</SPAN></P>

Welf. &amp; Inst. Code &sect; 366.26. The judgment was entered after the court summarily denied appellant's petition pursuant to Cal. Welf. &amp; Inst. Code &sect; 388 requesting that the hearing date be modified or set aside.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The minor child of appellant mother was removed from her custody and a reunification plan was established. At a 12-month review hearing, the juvenile court referee terminated reunification services and ordered a Cal. Welf. &amp; Inst. Code &sect; 366.26 hearing to determine the child's adoptability and terminate appellant's parental rights. Prior to the &sect; 366.26 hearing, appellant petitioned under Cal. Welf. &amp; Inst. Code &sect; 388, requesting that the order setting the &sect; 366.26 hearing date be modified or set aside. The juvenile court denied the petition summarily without a hearing and cited no factual reasons for its conclusion that the child's best interests would not be promoted by a change in the order. On appeal, the court held that once appellant made a prima facie showing of a favorable change in her circumstances including almost full compliance with the court ordered reunification plan, procedural due process required that appellant be granted a full and fair &sect; 388 hearing on the merits. After reviewing the record, the court concluded that the juvenile court's summary denial of appellant's petition without a hearing was not support by the record and thus was an abuse of discretion.</SPAN></P>

Appellant contended that his counsel's performance during jury selection deprived him of the effective assistance of counsel at a critical stage of the proceedings. The court held appellant lacked standing to challenge the constitutional validity of Proposition 115. The court determined that appellant failed to establish that he was adversely impacted by the procedure and he has failed to establish the trial court's voir dire of the jury was deficient.

Appellant conceded that she violated the ordinance by paying individuals to perform camp-related tasks at her residence. Thus, there was a rebuttable presumption that the potential harm to the public outweighed any harm to appellant.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant attorney challenged the order of the Superior Court of Orange County (California), which imposed discovery sanctions on him in an amount greater than $ 750.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant attorney sought relief from the trial court's order imposing sanctions on him in the amount of $ 794 for his failure to fully respond to interrogatories. The issue was whether appellant could appeal the order as of right prior to entry of final judgment in the underlying litigation. The court held that he could, and then affirmed the order imposing sanctions. The court grounded its holding regarding the timing of the appeal on Cal.  Civ. Proc.  &sect; 904.1(k). The court reviewed the legislative history of this statute and concluded that the legislature intended to create a &quot;bright line&quot; at $ 750, above which immediate appellate scrutiny of a sanctions order was authorized. The court held that the legislature intended to strike a balance between judicial administration and the right to immediate review of a sanctions order, which in some cases might cripple an attorney's practice. The court also held that the effect of &sect; 904.1(k) was to allow an appeal from any sanctions order provided the amount in controversy exceeded $ 750.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the order imposing discovery sanctions on appellant attorney in an amount greater than $ 750 because a sanctions order exceeding $ 750 was immediately appealable despite the fact that a final judgment had not been entered in the underlying litigation. There was nothing in the record to indicate that the order was not justified.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, environmental activists and individual, sought declaratory and injunctive relief against the enforcement by respondent City of Glendale of two ordinances which regulated charitable solicitations, one that required solicitors to submit to fingerprinting, and the other that exempted those organizations which had maintained headquarters in the city for three years. Appellants alleged that the ordinances violated their federal and state constitutional rights to freedom of speech and equal protection. Both parties filed cross motions for summary judgment. The trial court issued an order that granted respondent's motion for summary judgment. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded since both ordinances were unconstitutional. The court held that although respondent had a compelling interest to deter fraud, the fingerprint ordinance was not narrowly tailored, it chilled freedom of speech, and less restrictive means were available. The court ruled that the second ordinance's durational residence requirement violated equal protection in that it was not narrowly tailored, and it was not necessary to promote respondent's interest in fraud deterrence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant parents challenged a judgment of the Superior Court of Orange County (California), which found that they were gravely mentally disabled under Cal. Welf. &amp; Inst. Code &sect; 361.5(b)(2), and thus incapable of utilizing reunification services mandated by Cal. Welf. &amp; Inst. Code &sect; 361.5(a).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When appellant parents, both institutionalized for mental illness, had a baby, it was placed with respondent social services. At a dispositional hearing, the trial court declared the minor a dependent of the court and found that under Cal. Welf. &amp; Inst. Code &sect; 361.5(b)(2), reunification services were not required. After a hearing under Cal. Welf. &amp; Inst. Code &sect; 366.26, the trial court found that the minor could not be returned to appellants and it was likely that she would be adopted. On appeal, the court held that Cal. Welf. &amp; Inst. Code &sect; 361.5(c), was not unconstitutional because it created a permissible legislative classification. It was reasonable for the state to distinguish between those who could and could not benefit from reunification services under &sect; 361.5(c). Further, &sect; 361.5(c), did not deprive appellants of due process where expert testimony showed that they were incapable of utilizing reunification services. The court held there was sufficient evidence to support the trial court's finding that the minor would be adopted in the foreseeable future under Cal. Welf. &amp; Inst. Code &sect; 366.26(c)(1), where a relative and four other families expressed interest in adopting her.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court reversed the judgment as to all of plaintiff daughter's claims except her wrongful death claim and denied all of defendant's claims. Both parties appealed to the United States Supreme Court, which remanded the case back to the court for reconsideration. Upon reconsideration, the court reaffirmed its original decision as to daughter's claims, but reversed itself as to defendant's damage claims and remanded the case to the trial court for retrial on plaintiff mother's punitive damage award. The court found that new legal precedent had been issued since the commencement of plaintiffs' action that applied retroactively to plaintiff mother's punitive damages claim. Plaintiff mother was required mother to present evidence of defendant's financial condition so that a jury could award damages that would punish and deter defendant's behavior without destroying it financially.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, patient and cryogenic suspension participant, challenged the judgment of the Superior Court of Santa Barbara County (California), which dismissed their action for declaratory and injunctive relief against defendants, attorney general, district attorney, and coroner. Plaintiffs asserted that plaintiff patient had a constitutional right to premortem cryogenic suspension of his body.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, patient and cryogenic suspension participant, sought a declaration that plaintiff patient had a constitutional right to premortem cryogenic suspension of his body and the assistance of others in achieving that state. Plaintiffs sought an injunction against criminal prosecution of participants in the procedure and against the coroner performing an autopsy on the body after death. The trial court sustained a demurrer brought by defendants, attorney general, district attorney, and coroner. On appeal, the court held that there was no constitutional right to assisted suicide and that the trial court could not enjoin public officers from performing official acts that they were required to do by law. The act of taking one's own life with the assistance of others was not the exercise of the right to refuse medical treatment. Allowing another individual to take aid plaintiff patient's suicide violated Cal. Penal Code &sect; 401, even though suicide itself was not illegal. The court held that &sect; 401, did not violate plaintiff cryogenic suspension participant's constitutional right to free speech. There was no constitutional protection for a planned participation in another's suicide.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's judgment, which sustained a demurrer brought by defendants, attorney general, district attorney, and coroner, in an action brought by plaintiffs, patient and cryogenic suspension participant, concerning the constitutional right to premortem cryogenic suspension. There was no constitutional right to an assisted suicide, and the act of assisting or encouraging another's suicide was a felony.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of burglary and challenged that portion of the judgment that ordered restitution, taken from his prison wages pursuant to Cal. Penal Code &sect; 2085.5, for loss of a jacket and transmission damage, contending that the order was invalid and unconstitutional. The court struck that portion of the judgment to take restitution from prison wages and affirmed the remainder. The court held that to impose restitution under Cal. Gov't. Code &sect; 13967(c), the economic loss suffered by the victim must have resulted from appellant's criminal conduct. The court held under the &quot;plain meaning&quot; rule and legislative history that &quot;result&quot; was defined as any injury done to any person resulting from a breach of the law, for all damages actually caused by the crime. The court held that the problems with the transmission were triggered by victim's reaction to appellant's unlawful presence at her house and thus the damage was a result of appellant's criminal conduct since the damage was actually caused by and a logical consequence of such conduct. Thus, as the damage to the car arose from such conduct; the economic loss that arose out of such damage falls within the statute.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the trial court did not err when it failed to instruct appellant sua sponte on the lesser included offense of grand theft from the person because there was no contradictory evidence concerning the circumstances of the robbery. The use of force was compelling because the victim suffered an injury, though minor, and appellant presented no defense. The court held that the trial court did not have a duty to advise appellant that he had a right to testify because the general rule was that a self-represented person was not entitled to any assistance or advice from the trial judge on matters of law, evidence, or trial practice. The court directed the trial court to correct the abstract of judgment to reflect the actual local time of 285 days.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant ex-husband sought review of a decision of the Superior Court of the City and County of San Francisco (California), which refused to allocate the community interest in his pension plan according to the method set forth in recent amendments to the Judges' Retirement Law and instead applied Cal.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When appellant ex-husband and respondent ex-wife divorced, appellant asked that the court retain jurisdiction over his retirement plan and to distribute pension benefits at maturity. Subsequently, appellant's retirement plan placed a hold on his account pending a determination of the parties' community interests. The trial court refused to allocate the community interest in appellant's pension plan according to the method set forth in recent Judges' Retirement Law (JRL) amendments and instead applied Cal. Civ. Code &sect; 4800.8 (1988), which was more favorable to respondent. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that the trial court properly exercised its discretion, because &sect; 4800.8 applied retroactively. The court noted that the divorce reservation clause was not open-ended and that the trial court only retained limited supervisory authority over the retirement plan. The court also concluded that &sect; 4800.8 and the JRL amendments were discretionary and that the retirement plan's interpretation was reasonable.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff students challenged the judgment in favor of defendants, university, its regents, and its student association, arguing that defendant university had no right to impose a mandatory fee and that the fees violated their rights under U.S. Const. amend. I, because they were forced to belong and to give financial support to an organization that espoused political and religious views. On appeal, the court affirmed and held that defendant university was a public trust with the authority to assess mandatory student activity fees under Cal. Educ. Code &sect; 89300. The court held that a person's rights under U.S. Const. amend. I were violated only when compelled to make contributions to support an ideological cause. Contributions could have been compelled only for activities germane to the organization's purpose. The court ruled that the fees were germane to the goal of educating students, and within defendant university's mission as set forth in Cal. Educ. Code &sect; 66010.4(c). The court found that the funded student activity groups with religious names were cultural, not &quot;religious,&quot; so they fostered defendant university's organizational purpose.</SPAN></P>

During defendants' trial, the jury was instructed on second degree felony murder with kidnapping as the underlying felony. Defendants were subsequently convicted of the charged crimes.

On appeal, the court found that there was no statutory basis for the rule, even though the highest state court applied it. Therefore, the court held that it was bound to apply the second degree felony murder rule. However, the court further held that simple kidnapping was not inherently dangerous to human life, because it did not create a high probability of death. Therefore, the court concluded that the jury should not have been instructed on second degree felony murder. Judgment was affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded for new trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant heir and appellee city both challenged a judgment of the Superior Court of Tehama County (California). The trial court held that land once conveyed by appellant's ancestors to appellee for use as a public library was a transfer subject to a condition; while appellee's temporary nonuse of the building for library purposes did not breach the condition, it continued in effect. Hence, appellee owned the land subject to the use restrictions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant heir's ancestors conveyed property to appellee city subject to its continuous use as a free public library. When appellee ceased using it for library purposes, appellant filed an action seeking reconveyance pursuant to the original grants, which provided for reversion to the grantors' heirs if use as a library ended. Appellee contended that it owned the land free of any use restrictions. Both parties appealed the trial court's judgment that the condition remained valid, but had not been breached by appellee's temporary abandonment of the property for library purposes. The court reversed, holding that the conveyance was subject to a condition that created a possibility of reverter in the grantors and their heirs. Enactment of Cal. Civ. Code &sect; 885.020 abolished the reversionary interest and converted it into a power of termination. While appellant failed to timely record his power as required by statute, appellee waived the issue by failing to assert it before the trial court in affirmative defense to appellant's action, and by virtue of appellee's nonuse for library purposes, appellant established a breach of the condition of conveyance and was entitled to quiet title.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court's judgment and remanded with directions to enter judgment quieting title in favor of appellant heir. The court agreed with the trial court that the conveyance was not a trust but rather a transfer subject to a condition, which converted into a power of termination by operation of law. The court held that the city's removal of all library books established a breach of the condition of conveyance.</SPAN></P>

A police officer observed defendant driving with a suspended license.

Appellants also argued that the findings of the trial court were not supported by substantial evidence. The court denied the petition and found that not only was &sect; 366.26(k) constitutional but there was substantial evidence to support the trial court's findings. The court found no authority that held a petitioner was denied due process by lack of a reply brief, oral argument or petition for rehearing, and thus substantive review by writ application as prescribed in &sect; 366.26(k) complied with due process. Equal protection was not violated because the greater scope of review given to parents of children in foster care was based on the fact that a foster care order was a final decision of the court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff property owners obtained initial approval from the planning commission for rezoning their lot to the zoning category for most of the surrounding parcels so that they could build another house on the property. Plaintiffs owned a 1.117-acre lot that was virtually surrounded by parcels of lesser size. The city council denied the zoning change after neighbors voiced opposition. Plaintiffs brought a lawsuit against defendant city based on, among other things, discriminatory &quot;spot zoning.&quot; The trial court ruled in favor of plaintiffs. And defendant appealed. The court held that plaintiffs' lot was the object of discriminatory spot zoning and that defendant's land use restrictions were arbitrary and discriminatory. The judgment of the trial court was affirmed because defendants incorrectly denied plaintiffs' request for rezoning. The court found that defendant's own records reflected that it amended its general plan to reduce allowable density for just five lots, including plaintiffs' lot, after plaintiffs filed their lawsuit. The court held that this was constitutionally impermissible as it isolated plaintiffs as the special objects of legislative action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's judgment in favor of plaintiff property owners because the record showed that plaintiffs' real property was the object of discriminatory spot zoning by defendant city.</SPAN></P>

Defendant appealed. Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the judgment, the court found sufficient evidence from which the trial court could find that defendant harbored the requisite intent necessary to support his convictions, and his blatantly racial epithets, his brandishing a rifle, and his shooting a victim constituted acts of violence and intimidation motivated by racial hatred.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A civil penalty was assessed against appellant county for patient abuse at a long-term health facility operated under a license issued by respondent California Department of Health Services by appellant. After using the administrative review processes without satisfaction, appellant filed a complaint seeking judicial review. After respondent answered the complaint, appellant did not file an at issue memorandum within the next six months. Respondent therefore filed a motion to dismiss the complaint. Appellant responded by tendering a tardy at issue memorandum and filing a request for relief from the six-month time limitation on the ground of excusable neglect of counsel, relying on Cal. Civ. Proc. Code &sect; 473. The municipal court denied appellant's motion and granted the respondent's motion to dismiss. The case was transferred to the court, which affirmed the order of dismissal finding that the failure of appellant's counsel to file a timely at issue memorandum, though inexcusable neglect, was not fraudulent and was non-compliant with Cal. Health &amp; Safety Code &sect; 1428(c) which governed the judicial review of the parties' dispute.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c5">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant auto dealer sought review of a judgment by the Superior Court of Fresno County (California), which denied appellant's petition for writ of mandate to compel respondent Director of Development for the City of Fresno to issue zoning permits to erect freestanding signs. Appellant contended that respondent had a ministerial duty to issue the permits since they were within the applicable zoning regulations.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After appellant auto dealer successfully submitted an application for a sign, which was approved by respondent Director of Development for the City of Fresno, appellant applied for three more sign permits. Respondent denied these applications on the ground that the signs would not be compatible with the landscaped environment of the freeway. Appellant unsuccessfully sought judicial intervention, and then filed a petition for a writ of mandate, Cal. Civ. Proc. Code &sect; 1085. Appellant contended that the requested permits were within the zoning regulations and that respondent's job in issuing the permits was ministerial and non-discretionary. Appellant also asserted that the zoning ordinance conflicted with a more specific ordinance dealing with placement of signs on business locations and, therefore the more specific ordinance should control, and that the denial of the permits violated U.S. Const. amend. I. Upon review, the court affirmed, holding that respondent's functions were not ministerial because he was required him make several finding before issuing the permits. The court held that the two statutes were constitutional and could be read together.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed because respondent Director of Development for the City of Fresno performed more than a ministerial function when issuing sign permits and appellant auto dealer could not use a writ to compel respondent to perform his job a particular manner. The court also held that the two applicable statutes were compatible with each other and did not unconstitutionally abridge appellants' right to free speech.</SPAN></P>
