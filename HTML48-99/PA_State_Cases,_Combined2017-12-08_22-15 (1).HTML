</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, which had obtained a writ of foreign attachment against appellee's property, filed an appeal from the order of the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, ordering appellee's bond discharged and cancelled on the basis of a prior decision, which declared the Pennsylvania foreign attachment procedures unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant obtained a writ of foreign attachment, which directed the seizure of appellee's property. The attachment was released upon the posting of a bond by appellee. The trial court ordered the bond discharged and cancelled on the basis of an appellate court decision, adopted by the court, which declared the Pennsylvania foreign attachment procedures unconstitutional. Appellant filed an appeal from this order directly to the court. The court held that it did not have jurisdiction over the appeal. The Judicial Code, 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. &sect; 722(7) (1979), provided that the Pennsylvania Supreme Court had exclusive jurisdiction of appeals from final orders of trial courts where such courts held a Pennsylvania statute invalid as repugnant to the U.S. Constitution, treaties or laws, or to the Pennsylvania Constitution. The trial court did not declare the Pennsylvania foreign attachment procedures unconstitutional. The foreign attachment provisions had been ruled unconstitutional some years earlier. The trial court merely applied this rule retrospectively. Such action was not the same as actually declaring the Pennsylvania foreign attachment provisions unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Court held it did not have jurisdiction over appeal and transferred the matter to superior court.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When the prosecution received leave to re-submit defendant's case to a second grand jury, the prosecution knew defendant was incarcerated in another state. Two days later, defendant was returned to the commonwealth and incarcerated. Two weeks later, the case was submitted to the grand jury, which returned indictments against defendant. Defendant was found guilty of first degree murder, robbery, and related offenses by a jury, arising out of the victim's death. Defendant appealed his conviction. Defendant argued that he was entitled to a reversal of his conviction, and further prosecution was barred for the prosecution's failure to bring him to trial within 180 days from his arrest pursuant to Pa. R. Crim. P. 1100. The court disagreed. The period of time between the first and second grand juries was time which needed to be excluded for the purposes of the rule. However, the court ruled defendant was entitled to a new trial because he was denied his rights under Pa. R. Crim. P. 203. Because defendant was in custody and the prosecution knew his whereabouts, the prosecution had the burden to show that defendant received notice of the presentment. This they failed to do.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court vacated the judgment of sentence entered against defendant and quashed the indictments against defendant because defendant was entitled to a new trial since he was not given the opportunity to challenge the array of the grand jury that indicted him.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's judgment of sentence, which convicted appellant of passing a bad check under 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. &sect; 4105. The court held that &sect; 4105 no longer required an intent to defraud as one of the essential elements of the crime. By the omission of the specific element of intent to defraud from the bad check charge, the legislature intended to denominate passing a check for which there are insufficient funds with knowledge of the issuer as a crime regardless of whether present consideration passed at the time of passing the check or not. The court held that Pa. Const. art. I, &sect; 16 did not apply to appellant because appellant had not been retained in prison after delivering up his estate for the benefit of his creditors. The court held that &sect; 4105 was not unconstitutional because it did not imprison a person for being a debtor but, rather, imprisoned a person for intentionally disrupting the flow of, and undermining the soundness of commercial paper in the commonwealth. The constitution did not preclude imprisonment of one who knowingly passes a bad check.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of burglary and murder in the first degree and was sentenced to death. On appeal, he challenged the trial court's ruling suppressing certain evidence, alleged that the prosecution did not meet its burden of proof, claimed that evidence of his intoxication nullified the specific intent necessary to support his conviction, and contended that his death sentence was illegal because he was sentenced to death under 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 1311. The court found all but the last issue to be without merit.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged the judgment of sentence imposed by the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County (Pennsylvania) following a jury trial resulting in a conviction for the offense of murder of the third degree, and a nonjury trial resulting in a conviction for the offense of attempted theft by extortion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In challenging her murder conviction, appellant claimed that the trial court erred in failing to grant her motion to suppress evidence of her bank records, seized pursuant to two subpoenae duces tecum. On appeal, the court reversed the murder conviction and remanded, holding that under Pa. Const. art. I, &sect; 8, bank customers had a legitimate expectation of privacy in records pertaining to their affairs at a bank, and that such records were not subject to subpoena. The court held that because the records seized were taken pursuant to an invalid subpoena, and appellant had a legitimate expectation of privacy in those records, appellant had standing to challenge their admissibility. The court noted that at the trial on the forgery and attempted extortion charges that appellant admitted purchasing the typewriter with the check seized pursuant to the invalid subpoena, but that she failed to argue that the typewriter and bill of sale were obtained only because of the illegally seized check. Thus, because the illegally seized check was not introduced into evidence and no illegal seizure argument was advanced, the court affirmed the judgment of sentence for attempted theft by extortion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant's murder conviction was reversed because appellant's bank records introduced at trial to establish motive for the murder were obtained in violation of her expectation of privacy in those records. The matter was remanded for a new trial. Appellant's judgment of sentence for attempted theft by extortion was affirmed because appellant did not advance an illegal seizure argument challenging it.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, however, the supreme court held that appellants were not immune to appellee's zoning ordinances and reversed the decree of the lower court. The lower court subsequently granted summary judgment in favor of appellee. Appellants sought review and argued that the lower court erred in refusing to entertain their defense that the zoning ordinance was unconstitutionally vague, arbitrary, and exclusionary. The court held that the lower court was correct when it ruled that it had no jurisdiction as a court sitting in equity, to determine the merits of appellant's legal defenses.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of the judgments of sentence of the Court of Common Pleas of Montgomery County (Pennsylvania) imposed on two murder convictions and on a burglary conviction. Approximately two weeks after the original pronouncements of sentence, appellant's sentence for the murder convictions was increased to a single term of life imprisonment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of two counts of second degree murder, burglary, criminal attempt, and violations of the Uniform Firearms Act after he shot two sisters at their home. After sentences were imposed, the trial court increased the sentence for the murder convictions. Appellant sought review of the judgments of sentence. The court vacated the increase in sentence on the murder convictions and reimposed the original sentence. In his appeal, appellant alleged ineffective assistance of counsel. Counsel's assistance was deemed constitutionally effective once the court concluded that the particular course chosen by counsel had some reasonable basis designed to effectuate his client's interests. Before this standard was even reached, however, the court had to determine whether the claim appellant alleged his counsel should have made even had any reasonable basis. The court found no reasonable basis to the various claims appellant alleged his counsel should have made. The court did agree with appellant that the increased sentence constituted a double jeopardy violation. Once a criminal defendant began to serve a sentence, any increase in that sentence violated double jeopardy.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court vacated the increased judgment of sentence imposed on the murder convictions and remanded the case for reimposition of the original judgment of sentence, which the court then affirmed. The increase was a double jeopardy violation. The court affirmed the judgment of sentence imposed on the burglary conviction. The court found no merit to appellant's ineffective assistance of counsel claims.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants taxpayers filed an action in equity, seeking to restrain appellees taxing entities from availing themselves of rent sequestration pursuant to the Local Tax Collection Law of 1945, 72 P.S. &sect; 5511.19, as a means to collect appellants' delinquent tax payments. The equity court denied appellants' request, and the lower court affirmed this decision. The court then reviewed the matter upon appellants' Petition for Allowance of Appeal. The court affirmed the orders of the lower courts and held that rent sequestration as permitted by &sect; 5511.19 was not a violation of appellants' due process rights because appellants still had the recourse of payment of taxes under protest and appeal, the rationale of requiring prompt payment was amply vindicated by the experience of appellees, of the importance of the government's interest in collecting tax revenue, and of the necessary flexibility procedural protections required for particular situations. The court also held that the sequestration of rents permitted under &sect;5511.19 was not impliedly repealed by, revised by, or impermissibly reconcilable with Real Estate Tax Law of 1947, 72 P.S. &sect; 5860.101 et seq.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Prior to 1969 appellants Pennsylvania State Employees' Retirement Board and associated government officials credited time served towards retirement benefits for salaried part-time state employees at a rate of one full year for every twelve months a salaried part-time employee received a salary. Beginning in 1969, appellants gave such employees less than a full year of credit for each twelve months a salary was received and credited them a percentage of a full-time schedule that a salaried part-time employee worked. Appellees state mental hospital association on behalf of state part-time employees sought a writ of mandamus to direct appellants to compute credited service for salaried part-time state employees as it was computed up until the change of 1969. The trial court held that the scheme that began in 1969 violated the State Employees' Retirement Code, 71 P.S. &sect;1725-401 (1959). The court affirmed the trial court's ruling because the plain language of &sect;1725-401 and other key provisions of the code were clear and free from all ambiguity in that the new 1969 scheme was violative of the code.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When appellant school district learned that its expenditures exceeded its revenues for the school year and that consequently it would either have to close schools or offer students less services, appellant parents and appellant school district petitioned for a decree enjoining and restraining appellee treasurer and appellee secretary from making payments of state funds to any other school districts until appellant school district was able to secure sufficient funds to finance its operation. The trial court dismissed the petition, and appellants sought review. The court affirmed. Appellants challenged the constitutionality of the state financing system. As long as the legislative scheme for financing public education had a reasonable relationship to providing for the maintenance and support of a thorough and efficient system of public schools, the legislature fulfilled its constitutional duty to the public school students residing within appellant school district. The framework in place here was neutral with regard to appellant school district and provided it with its fair share of state funds.

Retention was a process by which the Commonwealth's electors determine whether a judicial officer should remain in his position as set forth in Pa.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee attorney was appointed under the Criminal Justice Act, 18 U.S.C.S. &sect; 3006A et seq., to represent appellant client in connection with a federal grand jury investigation. Appellant brought a damage suit against appellee, alleging that appellee lost a written agreement under which federal prosecutors agreed to confer immunity from prosecution on appellant, which immunity would have precluded a prosecution resulting in his conviction in federal court. Based on appellee's immunity, the lower court en banc dismissed the complaint for failure to state a cause of action. The appellate court affirmed. On further appeal, the court noted that defense attorneys appointed pursuant to the Criminal Justice Act enjoyed absolute immunity as to tort actions in the nature of malpractice instituted in state courts. This immunity extended to this situation, and appellant's claim that the immunity should be qualified rather than absolute was rejected in light of the strong history in the federal system of affording the principal participants in a legal proceeding, the judge, prosecutor, and appointed defense counsel, with absolute immunity in common law actions for damages.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Act 372 authorized local school districts to provide for the free transportation of pupils to public and nonpublic schools. Appellant school districts challenged the constitutionality of Act 372 on grounds that it violated the equal protection clause of U.S. Const. amend. XIV, the establishment clause of U.S. Const. amend. I, as well as Pa. Const. art. I, &sect; 3 and Pa. Const. art. III, &sect;&sect; 15 and 29. The court held that free school bus transportation provided to parochial school children under Act 372 did not violate the federal or state constitutions because governmental action was not necessarily proscribed if it resulted in a benefit to a religious institution where, as here, the benefit provided was indirect and incidental. The fact that bus transportation was enjoyed by the child attending parochial school as well as the public school youngster was not the type of benefit that offended the concept of neutrality mandated by the establishment clause, U.S. Const. amend. I, according to the court. Therefore, the court affirmed commonwealth court orders that found appellant districts' failure to transport parochial students to be in violation of Act 372.</SPAN></P>

The trial court sentenced him and ordered him to pay restitution to the victim. That order was reversed. On appeal by the commonwealth, the court was asked to determine whether or not Pennsylvania courts had the authority to order restitution as a condition of probation. The court first noted that the trial judge incorrectly relied upon repealed &sect; 1109 of the 1939 Penal Code, 18 P.S. &sect; 5109, as authority for her order of restitution. The court further noted that the practice of ordering restitution as a condition of probation was widely established and highly favored in the law, as an aid both to the criminal in achieving rehabilitation and to his victim in obtaining some measure of redress. The court was not persuaded that the repeal of &sect; 1109 of the 1939 Code reflected any legislative desire to forbid restitution in the appropriate probationary case. Thus, although the trial court's broad discretion to order restitution was not unlimited, the court concluded that the trial court had the legal authority to enter such an order.

The court affirmed appellant's conviction, holding that appellant's motion to suppress his statement was properly denied, because the totality of the circumstances showed that he voluntarily and intelligently waived his right against self-incrimination.

The court reasoned that there was no successive prosecution to which jeopardy could attach. The court also found that Rule 115(b) was not improperly invoked, because the trial judge only had to be of the opinion that the homicide may have constituted first-degree murder.</SPAN></P>

The court found that counsel's failure to file frivolous motions to suppress did not render counsel's performance ineffective or induce an invalid guilty plea. The court rejected defendant's other arguments that his trial counsel was ineffective. Defendant's last assertion was that his guilty plea was invalid because it was not knowing and voluntary where he entered it in order to avoid the death penalty.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant patients filed separate malpractice actions against appellee healthcare providers. Appellees objected based on the arbitration provisions of the Pennsylvania Health Care Services Malpractice Act (Act), Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 40, &sect; 1301.101 et seq. Appellants argued that the Act was unconstitutional and filed declaratory judgment actions that raised the same constitutional issue. The trial court held that the Act was constitutional, except that &sect; 1301.510 was unconstitutional. On appeal, the court held that the Act's provision for compulsory arbitration of malpractice cases in which health care providers were defendants did not violate the right to jury trial as guaranteed by Pa.

Also, the court concluded that the legislature's establishment of an alternative administrative remedy to resolve malpractice claims in an arbitration forum was not an unconstitutional delegation of judicial power. The court reversed the trial court's decision that &sect; 1301.510 was unconstitutional because the admission of an arbitration award did not disturb the jury's role as the final arbiter of the facts presented.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The prosecution filed indictments against defendants for open lewdness in violation of 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 5901 (1973). The indictments were quashed on the ground that the statute was unconstitutional because it did not set forth the conduct proscribed with sufficient specificity. The prosecution appealed. The court resolved the appeal without reaching the constitutional issue because there was a non-constitutional ground for the decision. The court held that under the statute, conduct only constituted an offense if it occurred at a time and in a place where it was likely to be observed by persons who had not consented to its occurrence or who were likely to be affronted by it. Because defendants' conduct occurred in a confined place that was inaccessible to the general public and was viewed only by persons who were not affronted by it, but who viewed it as a form of entertainment, defendants' conduct did not violate the statute. The orders quashing the informations against defendants were affirmed.</SPAN></P>

Defendant also contended that &sect; 5502 was unconstitutional. On appeal, the court affirmed defendant's conviction. Evidence established that there were three or more persons engaging in the conduct when officers told the group to disperse. Section 5502 was not vague because a person of ordinary intelligence could understand the behavior prohibited by the statute.&nbsp;Section 5502 was not overbroad because statute's overbreadth was not real or substantial, as judged in relation to the state's legitimate interest in protecting public safety and welfare.</SPAN></P>

Such sentence was vacated and the trial court imposed a minimum sentence of six months to three years. Defendant challenged such sentence alleging that the imposition of such sentence constituted an enhancement and a violation of the double jeopardy clauses found in U.S. Const. amend. V and Pa. Const. art. I, &sect; 10. On appeal, the court affirmed the sentence. The court did find that the minimum sentence constituted an enhancement because defendant's parole eligibility would be delayed. Such sentence did not violate double jeopardy principles because defendant was not subject to multiple punishments. Defendant's appeal of the original three-year sentence was done at her request. Once that sentence was vacated, the slate was wiped clean because the unexpired portion of such sentence would never be served. Defendant was then sentenced to the minimum sentence, as if the original sentence had never taken place. The second sentence was the only lawful single punishment imposed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant student graduated from a law school that was not accredited by the American Bar Association (ABA). Appellant submitted an application to take the Pennsylvania bar exam. Appellee board of law examiners denied such application because Pa. Bar Admissions R. 203(2) required that an applicant's school be accredited. Appellant attorney practiced law in another state and submitted an application for eligibility to practice under the rule of comity. Appellee denied appellant attorney's application because he, too, did not graduate from an accredited law school. Appellants challenged the denial of their applications. On appeal, the court affirmed the decision. The court found that the ABA accreditation was an important accrediting accomplishment for a law school. The accreditation carried with it an endorsement of standards. If the court allowed graduates from non-accredited law schools to take the bar examination or practice law under the rule of comity, then the ABA accreditation would serve little purpose. Non-accredited law schools would have the same standing as accredited law schools.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner defense counsel tape-recorded the preliminary hearing testimony of his client's alleged accomplice. The tape was the only record of the testimony. The accomplice later announced he would assert at trial his right against self-incrimination under U.S. Const. amend.

Petitioner filed a request for a writ of prohibition, which the state supreme court denied. The court ruled that petitioner had full opportunity to cross-examine and so admission of the testimony would not violate his client's right to confrontation under U.S. Const. amend. VI. The court ruled that the tape recording was not attorney work product because it contained none of petitioner's mental processes or trial strategy. The court ruled that the trial court's order did not violate petitioner's client's right against self-incrimination under U.S. Const. amend.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged the order of the Superior Court (Pennsylvania), which affirmed the dismissal of defendant's petition for writ of certiorari that challenged the constitutionality of the election law under which he was convicted.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A district magistrate convicted defendant because he violated election laws. Defendant filed a petition for a writ of certiorari with the trial court and challenged the constitutionality of the election law he was accused of violating. The appellate court affirmed the order that dismissed the writ on grounds that the constitutionality of a statute was not a cognizable issue upon appeal by way of a writ of certiorari. On review, the court disagreed and vacated the appellate court's order. The court held that the trial court had the power to entertain the merits of defendant's claim upon a grant of certiorari. The court noted that defendant should have requested a general appeal rather than a petition for writ of certiorari. However, defendant's procedural mistake did not prove fatal to his case because the court concluded that the proper remedy for bringing a case in the wrong division of a multi-division court was not dismissal, but a transfer of the matter to the correct division. Since consideration of defendant's constitutional claim was not ultra vires the trial court, the case was remanded to the appellate court for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

After the officer responded, appellant made the challenged statement. Defendant was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to death. The court vacated the death sentence and imposed a sentence of life imprisonment. The court held that at the time of prosecution, the only authorized penalty for first degree murder was life imprisonment under 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 1102.

A new trial was properly granted on the basis of a subsequent civil case decision. The trial court erred in instructing the jury using the term &quot;unreasonably dangerous.&quot; The term &quot;unreasonably dangerous&quot; tended to suggest considerations usually identified with the law of negligence. The determination of risk of loss was a decision to be made by the court, not the finder of fact. &quot;Unreasonably dangerous&quot; did not serve a useful purpose in predicting liability and should not have been used in framing the question for the jury's consideration.

In so ruling, the appellate court noted that appellant had a right to self-representation under the federal constitution. Further, appellant voluntarily and intelligently elected to represent himself. Appellant's waiver of counsel was deliberate, and the trial court fully advised him of both his rights to be represented by counsel and the disadvantages of self-representation.

Appellee's request for a hearing was granted, and the hearing panel concluded that appellee was an exclusive community engaging in exclusionary policies.

The lower court had not decided whether appellant had exceeded its authority in drafting the rules; it determined that the regulation was not in effect at the time this matter was adjudicated. The court affirmed reversal of appellant's denial by the lower court. The court held that appellee's zoning ordinances were constitutional, and there was no showing that official conduct had contributed to the imbalances in the makeup of appellee's community. The court held that because appellee's ordinances and policies were constitutional, appellant had no basis for the denial of funds and, therefore, the secretary of the department had abused his power by declaring public policy instead of enforcing it.</SPAN></P>

P. 323(f), 323(g), 326, and 327, to enter special orders closing the pre-trial hearing to the public, sealing the record of these pre-trial proceedings, and prohibiting participants in these proceedings from discussing, disclosing, or disseminating evidence the admissibility of which may have to be determined by the court. Petitioner newspapers objected when respondent judges entered the requested orders. The court held that the rules restricting pretrial publicity ensure that a defendant's right to have unconstitutionally seized evidence suppressed would not be chilled by fear that information becoming public that would make the selection of an impartial jury more difficult to select. The court also held that there was no unlimited right of access to judicial proceedings. The court held that the special relief requested by petitioners was properly denied.</SPAN></P>

Appellee appealed and a trial de novo was held in the court of common pleas. In a nonjury trial, appellee was found guilty of being 1700 pounds overweight and a fine of $ 120.00 was imposed. The prosecution filed an appeal in the contending that the fine was not the proper fine under the penalty section of Pa. Motor Veh. Code &sect; 903(k) 75 P.S. &sect; 101 et seq. According to the prosecution, the trial court should have imposed a greater fine. The court did not agree with the prosecution that the trial court ignored the legislative mandate as to penalties in imposing sentence, therefore there was no need to consider whether the penalty provisions of Pa. Motor Veh. Code &sect; 903(c) were constitutional. The court stated that the only verdict was that the driver was overweight. The court held that it was bound by that verdict and any doubts in the verdict must be resolved in favor of the defendant. Judgment of the trial court was affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment of the trial court was affirmed, because the only verdict that appears at the conclusion of the trial was that the truck driver's vehicle was overweight and that any speculation and guesswork regarding the verdict in a criminal case must be resolved in favor of the defendant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant out of state company sought review of a judgment by the Commonwealth Court of Pennsylvania, which sustained the decision and order of the Board of Finance and Revenue Board on imposition of a state income tax.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant out of state company was engaged in the manufacture and sale of tobacco products. Its products were sold exclusively in interstate commerce. Appellant's sole contact with Pennsylvania was through representatives. These representatives, furnished with company cars, visited independent wholesalers to inform them of company activities and promotions, and sometimes took orders for appellant's products. The representatives maintained daily reports of their activities. Appellant was subject to a state income tax and sought review. Appellant asserted that Pennsylvania's Corporation Income Tax could not be validly applied to a foreign corporation which was engaged solely in interstate commerce but solicited business in the commonwealth through the use of field representatives. The court agreed with appellant that 15 U.S.C.S. 381, exempted it from state income taxes, and reversed the order of the lower court that had directed appellant to pay the tax. The court held that there was no need to address appellant's constitutional arguments, nor the issues relating to the computation of appellant's ultimate tax liability.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order of the commonwealth court which held that appellant out of state company owed state corporate income taxes was reversed, because there was no taxable nexus established. Federal statutes prevented the imposition of state income taxes on a foreign company that was only engaged in &quot;mere solicitation&quot; within the state.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of carrying a concealed deadly weapon and unlawfully carrying a firearm without a license. The court reversed the decisions of the lower courts and directed a trial be granted because the revolver was improperly seized. The U.S. Supreme Court reversed that order and remanded it to the court for further proceedings. The court reexamined the records and determined appellant was entitled to a new trial on grounds other than a search and seizure violation. It held that the passenger in appellant's car was improperly questioned about the religious affiliations of appellant and himself, which were irrelevant to any issue at trial and was not evoked by the direct examination of the witness. The court held that because appellant's defense depended altogether on the credibility of the assertions by him and the witnesses concerning the circumstances under which the search took place, the impeachment tactics employed by commonwealth in violation of an express act of legislature was not harmless.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant mothers challenged separate judgments from the Court of Common Pleas of Lycoming County (Pennsylvania), terminating their parental rights to their children pursuant to P.S. tit. 1, &sect; 311(2) (1977). Appellee in both appeals was Lycoming County Children's Services. The two appeals were consolidated for hearing and decision because they raised similar issues regarding the constitutionality of the statute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In separate proceedings, both appellant mothers' parental rights were terminated pursuant to P.S. tit. 1, &sect; 311(2) (Supp. 1977) on the basis of evidence establishing &quot;repeated and continued incapacity&quot; to provide their children with essential parental care, control, or subsistence to ensure their physical or mental well-being. Appellants challenged the sufficiency of the evidence; claimed that &sect; 311(2) was impermissibly vague; and argued that the statute, as applied, deprived them of their interest in maintaining parental relationships protected by U.S. Const. amend. I, U.S. Const. amend. IX, and U.S. Const. amend. XIV. The court affirmed both judgments, holding that &sect; 311(2) was not unconstitutionally vague, nor did it violate substantive due process; and that it was constitutionally applied under the facts of both cases. The basis for termination was several years of demonstrated parental incapacity that did not involve parental misconduct. The court held that the orders terminating appellants' parental rights were supported by competent evidence, rejecting appellants' argument that absent serious harm, the court could not terminate parental rights.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed, holding that the statute authorizing the termination of appellant mothers' parental rights for incapacity was not unconstitutionally vague in light of its standards and the state policy of restraint from interfering in the family; that the statute's application to terminate appellants' parental rights was constitutionally permissible; and that competent evidence supported both decrees terminating appellants' parental rights.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant mental patient, while still an impatient in a psychiatric facility, filed a petition for injunctive relief seeking to restrain the facility from administering medication against his will. Appellant also alleged that the statute under which the facility relied for its authority, 50 P.S. &sect; 4417 (1969), was unconstitutional. The trial court denied appellant injunctive relief. After appellant was released, he filed exceptions to the order, which were rendered to be moot by the trial court because of his release. Upon appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that because appellant was released and the statute that he challenged was subsequently changed by new legislation, his exceptions were moot. The court reasoned that when appellant was released it changed the factual posture of the case because there was nothing left to enjoin. The court also found that there was a significant change in the law after the filing of appellant's petition where a new provision, 50 P.S.&sect; 7107, was enacted which required patient participation. The court noted that &sect; 7107 was the heart of appellant's constitutional attack and addressed the very rights that appellant sought to establish.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of murder of the first degree and rape. Defendant was sentenced to imprisonment for a term of 10-20 years on the rape charge and to death on the murder conviction. Defendant sought review, however, he did not challenge the constitutionality of the statute under which he was sentenced to death. Upon review, the court reversed defendant's sentence for murder and affirmed his sentence for rape. The court held that the statute under which defendant was sentenced to death, 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. &sect; 1102, was unconstitutional because it left totally unbridled discretion in the finders of fact to determine whether execution or life imprisonment was the proper penalty. The court reasoned that pursuant to precedent, the statute was void on its face. The court held that defendant's sentencing under &sect; 1102 required reversal even though defendant did not challenge the constitutionality of the statute. The court reasoned that the application of the doctrine of waiver in a death penalty case was contrary to the overwhelming public policy of insuring that the standards used in implementing the death penalty sentence were constitutionally beyond approach.</SPAN></P>

More than 12 years later, appellant sued alleging that appellee's negligence caused the collapse of the building's ceiling. Appellant's complaint was dismissed as time barred. Appellant claimed that 12 P.S. &sect; 65.1, which barred negligence suits against builders not brought within 12 years, was unconstitutional. The court held that the statute was not a &quot;special law&quot; because there were real distinctions between builders, landowners, and suppliers that supported the conclusion that builders' liability should be limited. Because there was no vested right in the continued existence of a body of negligence law, the court held that the fact that the statute did away with a previously existing cause of action did not close the courts to an injured party. The court found that the statute did not limit the amount recoverable under a cause of action, but merely eliminated the cause of action altogether.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was arrested and charged with murder for shooting and killing a police officer. He was found guilty by a jury of first degree murder and was sentenced to death. His direct appeal to the court was authorized by P.S. tit. 17, &sect; 211.202(1) (Supp. 1977). Among other things, he argued that irrelevant, prejudicial evidence was admitted concerning the decedent's personal family life and his professional reputation. The court agreed, holding that such evidence had no place in a criminal trial and was clearly intended to create sympathy for the victim's family and thereby inflame the jury. The court condemned such trial tactics, and rejected the state's argument that admission of the evidence was harmless error. The state contended that the evidence of appellant's guilt was so overwhelming that he would have been convicted even without the challenged evidence. The court disagreed, holding that the error was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt because the evidence of guilt, even if overwhelming, was not undisputed in this case. The court therefore could not conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the erroneously admitted evidence did not affect the outcome of the trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the conviction and granted a new trial, agreeing with appellant that irrelevant, prejudicial evidence regarding the victim's family life and professional reputation was improperly admitted. The court rejected the state's harmless error argument, holding that only uncontradicted evidence may be considered when applying the overwhelming evidence test of harmless error. In this case, the evidence, while overwhelming, was disputed.</SPAN></P>

The court concluded that the township ordinance unconstitutionally excluded multi-family dwellings because it did not provide a &quot;fair share&quot; of its land for development of multi-family dwellings. In applying the &quot;fair share&quot; principle, the court found that the township was a logical area for development and population growth because it was located 12 miles or so from a major city and was situated at the intersection of two main traffic arteries, one leading directly to the city. The court found that the township was not a high density population area and roughly one-quarter of the township land was undeveloped; thus, not precluding further development of multi-family dwellings. The court found that the zoning ordinance provided 1.14 percent of the township land for development of multi-family dwellings; therefore, the land was not set aside for exclusive use of multi-family dwellings.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant company sought reversal because the commonwealth court upheld a provision in an ordinance, which prohibited appellant from increasing its charges to the people in the community, without approval of the appellee borough. Appellant attacked the regulatory aspect of appellee's ordinance. Appellant claimed that not only was it unauthorized but also unconstitutional. The court held that the acceptance of the terms of the ordinance created a contractual relationship. The court reasoned that appellee in its control over any increases in the charges, was performing an important function in protecting its residents from being subjected to uncontrolled price increases for the duration of the contract. The court also found that appellee had the legal authority to regulate the charges. The order was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

A lower court denied appellant's post-verdict motions, and sentenced appellant to life imprisonment for the murder conviction. Appellant claimed that he was denied his right to a jury trial as required by U.S. Const. amend. VI. Appellant argued that 18 P.S. &sect; 1311 provided for the imposition of the death penalty in a jury trial under certain circumstances, and no such provision was applicable to either nonjury trials or guilty pleas. The court held that the standard for evaluating a waiver to a jury trial was whether it was voluntarily and knowingly made. The court found that appellant did not demonstrate that his waiver was not made voluntarily and knowingly. The court found appellant's argument that he was induced by fear of the imposition of the death penalty was by itself not sufficient for vitiating appellant's guilty plea.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant entered a plea of guilty and was convicted of murder in the first degree and sentenced to life imprisonment. Although appellant admitted he pleaded guilty to avoid the death penalty, he asserted that the improper counseling of his attorney induced the plea so that it was not made intelligently and willingly. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment and held that there was no evidence indicative of any probability that appellant would have refrained from changing his plea if there had been the disclosure of any additional information. The court also held that there had not been any nondisclosure of such a serious nature as would warrant a per se conclusion of inducement. The court concluded that the record and particularly the colloquy at the time of the plea revealed a thorough and conscientious attempt by the trial court, defense counsel, and the district attorney to make sure that the plea was intelligent and with full understanding. The court held that a plea bargain which had been fully carried out in accordance with its terms would not be set aside in the absence of convincing evidence that the appellant was dealt with indecently or unfairly.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant commonwealth challenged the determination of the trial court that 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann &sect; 1311 (1977-78), was unconstitutional. Pursuant to 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann &sect; 1311(c), after appellant was convicted a hearing was held to permit the jury to receive additional testimony and arguments on the question of aggravating and mitigating circumstances. The motions court denied defendant's motions in arrest of judgment and for a new trial, but a majority of that court concluded that to impose the death penalty on appellee would be unconstitutional because the statutory mitigating circumstances were unconstitutionally vague and at the time of appellee's trial the trial court did not have the power to impose the death penalty in cases such as appellant's. The court affirmed the order of the trial court and held that to protect a defendant from cruel and unusual punishment in a capital case, it was necessary both that the aggravating circumstances be clearly defined for the sentencing authority, and that the sentencing authority be allowed to consider whatever mitigating evidence was relevant to his character and record, and that defendant could be present.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order of the trial court was affirmed because the statute which authorized capital punishment for even a narrowly-limited category of murder violated the Eight Amendment if it did not sufficiently permit the sentencing authority in determining the sentencing to take into account the particular circumstances of the crime and individual history and character of the criminal.</SPAN></P>

The statute was amended to provide for resentencing for certain individuals. Appellants sought resentencing under the amendment. The commonwealth filed an answer to the petitions in which it alleged that the statute upon which appellants relied was unconstitutional. The lower court agreed and dismissed the petitions for resentencing. The court affirmed the judgment of the lower court and held that the power of commutation and pardon were not granted to the legislature and were specifically and solely a power of the executive branch. An attempt to legislate such powers were constitutionally repugnant, Pa. Const. art IV, &sect; 9.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order which dismissed appellant petitions for resentencing was affirmed because the statute under which they sought resentencing was unconstitutional.

On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that after 1945, both ordinary and extraordinary stock dividends were to be allocated to principal in the absence of a contrary direction by the settlor, because, in 1945, the legislature enacted the Uniform Principal and Income Act of 1945 (Act), formerly 20 P.S. 3471-3485, which decreed that ordinary stock dividends of less than six percent were to be classified as principal, but which at the same time recognized a power in the settlor to himself direct the manner of ascertainment of income and principal. The court noted that the trust instrument did not contain a direction to the trustee to classify ordinary stock dividends of less than six percent as income rather than as principal, and there was no language in the trust itself which might indicate such an intention on the part of the settlor.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a jury verdict of guilty for the charge of possession of a controlled substance with intent to deliver, in violation of Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 35, &sect; 780-113(a)(30) (Supp. 1977), defendant received a sentence of two to five years imprisonment, was fined, and ordered to pay the costs of prosecution. At the time of sentencing, the trial court did not order a presentence report and did not state on the record any of its reasoning behind its sentence determination. On appeal, the court vacated the sentence and remanded for further proceedings to allow the trial court to place its reasons on the record. The court found that, especially in light of the lack of the presentence report, there was a necessity for an articulation of sentencing reasons and motivations to be on the record. The court cited several reasons for this, including ease of review on appeal, safeguarding procedural due process, and assuring no vindictiveness or misinformation was present. Finally the court held that, in the future, defendant was to first present his claim of error to the trial court.</SPAN></P>

XIV. The lower court also denied appellants' petition for an order for a writ of foreign attachment conditioned upon following procedures that met the requirements of due process. The court held that in the absence of any statute or rules of court which satisfied constitutional standards, foreign attachment was not presently available in Pennsylvania and therefore, the lower properly dissolved appellants' writs of foreign. The court held that the decision which held that Pennsylvania's rules governing foreign attachment were unconstitutional did not establish a new principle of law which might be applied prospectively only; i.e., to writs issued after the date of decision and that foreign attachment was not an independent cause of action entertained by the courts; it was solely a form of process, provided by statute or rule.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant ousted member of the House of Representatives of Pennsylvania, along with two of his constituents, brought an action in equity against appellee House members who he held responsible for his removal and his subsequent replacement. He was being removed for violations while in office, namely a jury's guilty verdict against appellant for three counts of mail fraud. The lower court found in favor of appellees, by way of granting their demurrer and dismissing the action. On appeal, the court affirmed the lower court's treatment of the matter, citing that the House acted properly in their investigation of appellant and that they were vested with the power to conduct such investigations. Further, the matter was rendered moot by the fact that appellant's term of office had expired by the date for oral arguments. The court found, however, that appellant's request for back pay was not moot and found that no tenure existed for his position and that he was not denied procedural due process by his loss of back pay.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following an arbitration hearing in which appellees, injured car accident victims, were awarded damages for injuries caused by appellant, allegedly negligent driver, appellees sought review in the trial court and received a jury trial in which they called a physician witness, whom they had not called at the arbitration, to testify as to their damages. The trial court held that Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County R. 303 J prevented appellees from calling a witness at trial that they did not call at the prior arbitration hearing, but an en banc trial court granted appellees a new trial finding that Rule 303 J violated their due process rights. The appellate court affirmed the trial court's order on the ground that Rule 303 J conflicted with &sect; 27 of the Arbitration Act of 1836 (Act), Pa. Stat.

Defendant also claimed that the trial court erred when it admitted the notes of testimony of defendant's co-participant from a preliminary hearing after the witness asserted his right against self-incrimination. The court affirmed the convictions. The court held that the in-court identification by one witness was not improper because it had an independent origin from the improper out-of-court identification that was suppressed by the trial court.

V, XIV and Pa. Const. art. I &sect; 10. Defendant asserted that he was entitled to seek an immediate appeal of the trial court's order and that the trial court had erred when it denied defendant's application to dismiss because defendant's motion for a mistrial was necessitated by serious prosecutorial and judicial misconduct and because a retrial would have violated the double jeopardy clause. The court affirmed the order denying defendant's motion to dismiss and remanded for trial. The court held that, while the denial of the pre-trial application to dismiss the indictment could have been appealed before the new trial took place, nevertheless, the trial court properly denied defendant's application because there was no prosecutorial or judicial overreaching in the first proceeding.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The commonwealth sought a writ of prohibition against respondent trial judge who made a preliminary determination that a reasonable jury could not have found the death penalty in a murder case before him.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A teenager's murder case was assigned to respondent trial judge, who held a preliminary hearing to determine whether he believed a reasonable jury could have found the death penalty in the case. Respondent held that the case was non-capital based on the youth and lack of maturity of the teenager at the time of the crime and certified the issue for immediate appeal. The commonwealth petitioned instead for a writ of prohibition vacating the order and prohibiting such pretrial determinations. Considering the petition as an appeal from the order, the court reversed respondent's determination. Section 1311 of the Sentencing Code, 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. &sect; 1311 (1976-77), intended to have the same jury which determined guilt also determine whether to sentence a defendant to death based on the totality of the evidence and the legal standards set forth. An automatic appeal protected a defendant from an illegal sentence of death. Section 1311 required that the initial determination of the presence or absence of aggravating and mitigating circumstances in a jury trial for murder be made by the jury following a conviction of murder of the first degree.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed respondent trial judge's preliminary determination after treating the commonwealth's petition as an appeal of the order. The court found that the same jury was to determine guilt and capital punishment. In a jury trial for murder, the presence or absence of aggravating and mitigating circumstances was to be determined by the jury after it convicted a defendant of first degree murder.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the Supreme Court had not found the Act to be unconstitutional in its entirety but only as it was applied to sectarian nonpublic schools. The court then held that the Act was severable and could be applied only to nonsectarian nonpublic schools. Both public policy and the severability clause contained within the Act supported this holding. The court also held that there had been no implied repeal the Act. The court acknowledged that there had been subsequent legislation. Most of that legislation, however, had been deemed unconstitutional and could not therefore impliedly repeal the act. The remaining constitutional legislation did not the entire subject matter of the Act and, therefore, could not act to impliedly repeal the Act. Finally, the court held that the Act could be administered without creating any &quot;excessive entanglement&quot; with religion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">This case was previously on appeal to determine the power of the Department of Environmental Resources to enjoin acid mine drainage from abandoned mines.

The court affirmed the judgment and held that the final decree of the lower court was not an unreasonable or unduly oppressive exercise of police power and did not constitute a taking even though the record supported the finding that much of the acid water which was being discharged was attributable to fugitive mine water generated by other mines. The court was concerned with the source of the discharge of the acid mine water and not the source of the polluted water itself.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In Pennsylvania, coal mining companies were required to purchase insurance coverage for black lung benefits as a condition of doing business. The rates charged for such insurance were subject to regulation by appellee Pennsylvania Insurance Department. On August 1, 1975, a rate increase became effective without notice to the coal mining companies which purchase black lung insurance. Appellants, an association of coal mining companies, petitioned to intervene in the rate hearing. The petition was denied by the Insurance Commissioner because the rates had already been deemed into effect. Appellants sought a determination by the lower court which held that appellants were not entitled to notice and a hearing on the proposed rates before they became effective. On appeal, the court reversed finding that there was a dependency and reliance by appellants on the Insurance Department that made applicable the protections of procedural due process. The court held that the rates should not have been deemed into effect without provision for notice to appellants that the rates had been submitted and an opportunity for appellants to present written objections to the proposed rates.</SPAN></P>

After a hearing, the chancellor found the submitted materials obscene and permanently enjoined appellants from selling the materials found to be obscene, and from operating the businesses. The court reversed. The ex parte procedure in which the preliminary injunction was granted was invalid There was also no legal basis for the permanent injunction. The obscenity definition set forth in section 5903(b) of the Pennsylvania Obscenity Statute,&nbsp;18 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 5903(b), had been held unconstitutionally vague and no injunction could issue under section 5903(h) of that statute in the absence of a constitutionally valid definition of obscenity. The injunction could not be issued under a common law nuisance theory.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The commonwealth challenged the decision of the Superior Court, Bucks County (Pennsylvania), which affirmed an order denying its request to grant immunity to a prosecution witness appearing before a grand jury in relation to criminal charges against two defendants, based on the Immunity Act, 19 P.S. &sect; 640.1 et seq. (Supp. 1975-76).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were charged with extortion, prohibited acts by public officers, and conspiracy in their capacity as township supervisors. The prosecuting attorney, however, withdrew the conspiracy charge. When the remaining charges were presented to the indicting grand jury, two witnesses were subpoenaed to testify regarding their transactions with defendants. The witnesses refused to answer certain questions on the basis of their constitutional privilege against self incrimination. The supervising judge sustained their refusal to testify. The commonwealth petitioned for an order immunizing the two witnesses from prosecution and compelling them to testify. The petition was dismissed on the grounds that without the conspiracy allegation, there was no organized crime or racketeering as required by the Immunity Act, 19 P.S. &sect; 640.1 et seq. (Supp. 1975-76). On appeal by the commonwealth, the court affirmed. It held that, as to grand juries, immunity was available only to those involved in an investigation, not those concerned with indictments, as here. Alternatively, absent allegations of conspiracy, the power to obtain a grant of immunity was not available under the Act.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the lower court's determination that the commonwealth's petition for immunity for prosecution witnesses in a grand jury proceeding were properly denied.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant elections board sought review of an order from the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County (Pennsylvania), which granted appellee recall committee's request for a writ of mandamus to compel appellant elections board to accept the recall petition for filing and to implement the requisite procedures for the holding of the recall election of appellant mayor.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the court determined that although the trial judge properly had jurisdiction to entertain the action in mandamus, he erred in granting the relief requested by appellee recall committee. The court initially noted that jurisdiction to consider a petition for writ of mandamus against appellant elections board was with the trial judge by virtue of statutory grant. The court then found that the trial judge had erred in substituting his determination as to the sufficiency of the recall petition for that of appellant. The court noted that there was no authority to act in such a manner where appellant had made a good faith determination within the lawful bounds of its discretion that the petition had been defective as a result of the signatures which fell into the &quot;illegal notarizations&quot; and &quot;irregular affidavits&quot; categories. The court further held that the Philadelphia Home Rule Charter's recall provisions, 351 Pa. Code &sect; 9.9-100 et. seq., were unconstitutional and reversed. The court concluded that the recall provisions were antithetical to the provisions of Pa. Const. art. VI, &sect; 7, which ensured that elected officials were not removed from office without cause.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the order that had granted the requested mandamus relief and remanded the matter, concluding that the trial judge erred in substituting his judgment for that of appellant elections board in evaluating the sufficiency of the recall petition in question and that the recall provisions of the Philadelphia Home Rule Charter were unconstitutional for authorizing removal of duly elected officials without cause.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant natural mother sought review of the decree of the Court of Common Pleas of Cumberland County, Orphans' Court Division (Pennsylvania), denying her petition seeking the involuntary termination of parental rights of appellee first husband pursuant to 1 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 311(3), and that denied appellant second husband's petition to legally adopt the child pursuant to 1 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect;&sect; 401, 402, 411, 414.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant natural mother sought to terminate the parental rights of appellee first husband, arguing that appellee was not her child's natural father under 1 Pa.

The court affirmed the lower court's decree denying the petitions, concluding that the facts as proven in the record were insufficient to establish that appellee was not the natural father. The court found that the lower court correctly refused to order appellee to submit to a blood grouping test along with the child and both appellants on the ground of estoppel. The court could not condone appellants' actions in continuing to accept child support from appellee for over three years, while they conveniently alleged that all along they believed appellant second husband to be the natural father of the child. Appellee had maintained and lovingly carried out his duties as the child's father since birth, and both were entitled to maintain faith in and gather strength from that important relationship.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the lower court's decree, concluding that estoppel barred appellant natural mother from terminating the parental rights of appellee first husband who had lovingly carried out his duties as the child's father since birth, and since appellant second husband could not adopt the child without appellee's consent, the court affirmed the decree denying appellant second husband's request to legally adopt the child.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The commonwealth appealed the decision of the trial court (Pennsylvania) that dismissed appellee's conviction for two counts of involuntary manslaughter and a violation of 18 Pa.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant dropped a lighted match in solvent that had spilled on the floor while attempting to light a cigarette. His safety shoes caught fire and he kicked them off, each shoe being aflame and landing in different directions. The resultant fire raged uncontrolled for approximately four hours. Numerous injuries were sustained including the death of two firemen. The commonwealth indicted appellee under 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 3302(b), but the trial court concluded that the word &quot;catastrophe&quot; was not sufficiently precise and therefore held that the statute was void for vagueness. The court reversed, finding that the statute applied to those who would expose the public to an unreasonable risk because of their reckless handling of volatile substances. In addition, the term &quot;catastrophe&quot; was sufficiently precise to designate the extent of the harm sought to be presented by this section.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment, concluding that the volatile nature of the substance that started the fire, and the repeated warnings against the use of matches in the area and the obvious possible consequences of ignoring the precautions, appellee should have been aware that his conduct was proscribed.

The court affirmed, holding that 75 P.S. &sect; 1212, which created a presumption that the registered driver of a car involved in a vehicle code violation was driving the car at the time of the violation, was unconstitutional.

After eight years, appellee filed a petition to terminate appellant's parental rights and to adopt the minor, pursuant to the Adoption Act, 1 P.S. &sect; 311(2) (Supp. 1975). The hearing court granted appellee's petition. The court affirmed the decree. The court applied a three-part test and held that there was a clear showing of necessity, which supported the termination of appellant's parental rights to her minor child. The court found that the minor's physical condition and the condition of her family at the time she was removed from her parents demonstrated repeated and continued parental neglect and that the minor was without essential parental care and subsistence. The court found that appellant's current circumstances offered compelling evidence to support the final requirement, that the causes of the neglect or incapacity would not be remedied. The court then examined the minor's current circumstances and determined that it would be in the minor's best interests to permit appellee to adopt the child.</SPAN></P>

During the taxable period, appellant sold and leased its products inside and outside the state, was not assessed taxes by any other state, but paid various ad valorem, property, and utility taxes in other states. Appellant used the apportionment factors in Article IV of the Act to compute its taxes. Appellee Commonwealth determined appellant was not entitled to use this formula and assessed the tax at a higher amount. The Board of Finance and Revenue refused appellant's petition for review and the Commonwealth Court affirmed. Appellant sought review and on appeal the court affirmed. The court held the changes in the Act indicated the legislature intended the electing corporation show it was taxable in another state as a condition precedent to use of the three-factor apportionment formula.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff commonwealth brought an original action in quo warranto against defendants, state dental council and examining board member. Defendants' preliminary objection in the nature of a demurrer to the complaint was denied, and plaintiff commonwealth moved for judgment on the pleadings. The court granted the motion. The court noted that defendant became a board member pursuant to 71 P.S. &sect; 124 following his election as president of the state dental society. The court held that the subject statute was unconstitutional because the power to appoint defendant to conduct governmental functions could not have been delegated to the state dental society because it was a private organization. The court reasoned that the state dental society's motivation for voting for defendant was probably the private interest of the members rather than the public interest. It was not prompted by a desire to select a person appropriately suited to serve as a member of the board. Thus, it was an unconstitutional delegation to a private group of the power to make governmental appointments.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee individual was indicted on one count of open lewdness, under 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. &sect; 5901, for masturbating in a public place in plain view of other members of the public. The trial court granted his motion to quash the indictment on the ground of vagueness. On review, the court found that appellee's vagueness challenge was to be measured against the conduct in which he was engaged. The court held that the statute was a codification of common law that defined open lewdness as an act of gross and open indecency, which tended to corrupt the morals of a community. Because it was a codification, the court found that the prohibitory language did not need to be as precise as a newly conceived statute. The court found that the statute contained an ascertainable standard that the appellee's conduct fell within; thus he had no standing to complain of vagueness, and the statute was constitutional as it applied to him. The court reversed the order quashing the indictment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The commonwealth challenged an order of the Pennsylvania trial court that granted defendant's motion for a new trial following his conviction of first-degree murder, attempted robbery, and criminal conspiracy. The commonwealth argued that the introduction of defendant's statement to police at trial was proper and did not mandate the vacating of the judgment of conviction and a new trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After defendant was convicted of first-degree murder, attempted robbery, and criminal conspiracy, the trial court concluded that his statements to police had improperly been introduced into evidence, mandating a new trial. The prosecution appealed the order granting a new trial, arguing that defendant's incriminating statement was properly admitted. In reversing the order granting a new trial and remanding for the imposition of sentence, the court concluded that the trial court erred in deeming a delay of three and one-half hours before interrogating to have established a coercive environment that precluded a determination that the statement was given voluntarily. The mere fact that a delay occurred did not lead to a conclusion that it was unnecessary and therefore coercive. Where there was no showing that the confession was the product of the delay or of a constant, prolonged interrogation by police, the totality of the circumstances failed to establish a coercive environment sufficient to render defendant's statement involuntarily made. Where no reasonable relationship existed between the delay and the confession, defendant's statement was properly admitted.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged the decision of the Court of Common Pleas of Montgomery County, Criminal Division (Pennsylvania), which denied defendant's motion to modify his new sentence imposed by the trial court alleging due process and double jeopardy violations.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of possessing an instrument of crime, simple assault, recklessly endangering another person, unlawful restraint, and criminal trespass, in violation of 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 907(b), 2701(a)(1), 2705, 2902, and 3503(a)(1) (1983)and sentenced accordingly. At a post conviction hearing act, 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect;9541-9551 (1982), proceeding the trial court increased defendant's sentence with regard to the offense of criminal trespass. Defendant filed a motion to modify the new sentence that was denied. He then filed a timely notice of appeal. Defendant challenged the legality of his new sentence under the due process and double jeopardy clauses in U.S. Const. amend. VI and XIV. The court concluded that where a trial court responded to a defendant's motion to vacate a sentence by increasing the severity of the aggregate sentence, the use of the presumption of vindictiveness was clearly warranted. Defendant also argued that the trial court violated the double jeopardy clause of U.S. Const. Amend V, but the court found that this claim was without merit. Accordingly, the court affirmed defendant's conviction and sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction and sentence because under the unusual facts of this case, the Post Conviction Hearing Act court did not exceed the limits of its authority by increasing defendant's maximum prison term, and neither double jeopardy nor due process was violated.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged the decision of the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County (Pennsylvania), which denied his motion for a writ of habeas corpus/reconsideration of commitment after he pled guilty to two counts of driving while under the influence of alcohol, 75 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 3731(a)(1) &amp; (4)) and driving while his operating privilege was suspended or revoked, &sect; 1543(a) &amp; (b).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was arrested for driving under the influence for a third time. Prior to trial, he pled guilty to two counts of driving while under the influence of alcohol, 75 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 3731(a)(1) &amp; (4)) and driving while his operating privilege was suspended or revoked, &sect; 1543(a) &amp; (b). The trial court sentenced appellant to a one-year term of incarceration. However, without notice to appellant, the court modified appellant's sentence to a term of one to two years' incarceration. Appellant filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus, which was denied by the trial court. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's decision. The court held that normally it would reverse a trial court's order if no notice was given to a defendant; however, the sentence that was imposed by the trial court in this case was the only sentence that could have been entered, given the statutory sentencing scheme. According to 75 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 3731(e)(1)(iv), if a person is convicted of three driving under the influence offenses within a seven year period, the potential sentence ranges from a minimum of not less than one year to not more than two years in prison.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's decision to deny appellant's petition for a writ of habeas corpus. The court also affirmed appellant's sentence, holding that a modified sentence imposed by the trial court was permissible because the trial court's initial sentence was not in conformity with the statutory sentencing scheme.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant executrix of deceased filed a wrongful death action against appellee auto manufacturer after decedent's car was hit from behind causing it to go forward into a tree. The action alleged negligence, products liability, and breach of warranty. The claim alleged that appellee defectively designed the automobile by failing to install passive restraints or air bags. Appellee moved for partial summary judgment, asserting that passive restraint claims were preempted by federal safety regulations while also arguing that state law barred the claims as well. The trial court granted the motion in part, holding that the federal safety regulations preempted a state common law tort action and that appellant was precluded from alleging that a vehicle was defective because no airbag system was installed. Upon review, the court agreed with the trial court's holding allowing evidence of defective design but reversed as to preemption and permitted the passive restraint claims to go forward. The court held that there was no federal preemption and that compliance with federal motor vehicle safety standards did not exempt any person from liability.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, the vice-president and general manager of an oil and gas corporation, was convicted of willfully failing to pay the company's franchise taxes in violation of 75 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 9510(c). The court affirmed the conviction, holding that appellant was subject to the criminal provisions of &sect; 9510(c) because he personally dominated and controlled the affairs of the corporation and was thus a &quot;person&quot; as defined under the statute. The court also found that the indictment properly alleged that appellant was an officer or agent of a corporation that was required to collect and remit the tax. The court also held that the prosecution did not coerce appellant's father into claiming the privilege against self-incrimination by informing him of his potential criminal liability, as he decided to claim the privilege after consultation with independent counsel and there was no evidence of intimidating or harassing tactics by the prosecutor. Further, the court found that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying appellant's request for a continuance and that the franchise taxing scheme was not unconstitutionally vague or an improper exercise of the state's police power.</SPAN></P>

Prior to trial, he filed a motion for recusal of the trial judge and to declare the career criminal program null and void.

The court affirmed the judgment of sentence, finding that defendant offered no evidence to establish bias or prejudice by the trial judge. The jury was the factfinder and the record showed that it was not aware of any information, other than that presented at trial, and that it had absolutely no information concerning defendant's status as the time of trial. The court found that defendant was not deprived of his right to have a non-jury trial and that the right to a bench trial was not absolute. At no time did defendant request a waiver of a jury trial.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of rape, involuntary deviate sexual intercourse, indecent assault, simple assault, and four counts of criminal conspiracy. On appeal, the court vacated appellant's sentences because while 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. &sect; 5945.1 prohibited the examination of a sexual assault counselor as a witness, it did not prohibit an in-camera review to determine if the records contained any &quot;statements&quot; made by the victim, and if there were no &quot;statements,&quot; the sentence was to have been reinstated. The court also held that the new evidence failed to meet the standard required for the grant of a new trial because it could have been obtained prior to trial. The court held that counsel's failure to seek a severance was not reversible error because the victim's testimony had not been so unreliable as to have required the court to overturn the verdict because the charges arose out of the same questions of law and fact. The court held that the trial court had not erred in denying appellant a new trial on the basis of the omission of the phrase &quot;without her consent&quot; on the verdict slips because it could not possibly have contributed to appellant's convictions.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court vacated appellant's sentences because appellant had been entitled to have the court make an in-camera inspection of the records from rape counselors to determine whether any &quot;statements&quot; by the victim existed. To have denied that review was reversible error, and if such &quot;statements&quot; did not exist, the sentence should have been reinstated.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged the judgment of sentence entered by the Court of Common Pleas of York County (Pennsylvania), which convicted appellant of driving under the influence of alcohol pursuant to 75 Pa. Const. Stat. Ann. &sect; 3731(a)(4).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was placed under arrest after appellant failed two field sobriety tests, and was convicted of driving under the influence under 75 Pa. Const. Stat. Ann. &sect; 3731(a)(4). On appeal, the court affirmed and held that the admission of appellant's blood-alcohol test was proper where the custodian of the laboratory's records testified regarding the chain of custody. The mere fact that the custodian did not see the actual testing of appellant's blood and the fact that appellant did not have an opportunity to cross-examine the actual test taker did not warrant a conclusion that the trial court erred when it admitted the blood test results. The court also found that &sect; 3731(a)(4) and 75 Pa. Const. Stat. Ann. &sect; 1547, an evidentiary provision, were consistent with each other, and that the delay between when appellant's blood sample was taken and when the analysis was performed did not affect the commonwealth's ability to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he was intoxicated while driving. The lab custodian testified that a preservative added to the blood sample halted any chemical changes in the blood for the first 24 hours.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed appellant's conviction for driving under the influence and held that the admission of appellant's blood sample that established his blood alcohol content was proper, as its chain of custody was testified to, the evidentiary statute that allowed its admission did not conflict with the statute under which he was charged, and the time lapse between the taking and testing of the sample did not affect the test results.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant husband challenged an order of the Court of Common Pleas of Montgomery County (Pennsylvania), which denied appellants' exceptions to the trial court's decree nisi entered in appellee wife's divorce action instituted under the 1980 Divorce Code.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee wife instituted a divorce action under the 1980 Divorce Code against appellant husband. Appellant sought review of the trial court's denial of his exceptions to the decree nisi on grounds that the 1980 Divorce Code was unconstitutional, that the trial court failed to give credit for monies he spent to preserve marital assets and reduce marital debts, and that the trial court erred in awarding alimony and partial attorney fees to appellee. In affirming, the court held that where a higher appellate court found the Divorce Code constitutional under the U.S. Constitution due process clause, the court was bound to follow that holding. The equitable distribution provisions of the Divorce Code were a legitimate exercise of the state's police power and did not violate appellant's contractual rights under U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 10, and Pa. Const. art. I, &sect; 17. The trial court's offset of appellant's contributions by dissipation of other marital property was within its discretion. Awards of alimony and attorney fees were proper where marital misconduct was not a bar and the disparity of the parties' earnings warranted them.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed. The court was bound by a higher appellate court's finding that the 1980 Divorce Code was constitutional under due process and found that it was constitutional under the contract clauses of the federal and state constitutions. Offset of contributions to marital property by dissipation of other marital property and awards of alimony and attorney fees were proper.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged his conviction for robbery in the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County (Pennsylvania) on the ground that the prosecutor failed to rebut appellant's prima facie showing that the commonwealth's peremptory challenges against venirepersons had been used for a racially discriminatory purpose.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, a black man, invoked his right to trial by jury on a robbery charge. During voir dire, the prosecutor used all of his peremptory challenges to remove prospective black jurors. Appellant objected that the prosecutor had violated his right to equal protection of the law by challenging jurors in a racially discriminatory manner. The prosecution denied this, pointing out that the final petit jury included two black jurors, as well as one black alternate, and that the victim and two police officers who testified for the prosecution were black. The trial court found that appellant had established a prima facie case of discrimination but that the commonwealth rebutted it. Appellant was convicted. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that the fact that a defendant was of the same race as the prosecution witnesses did not negate a prima facie case, nor did the fact that some minority persons were on the jury. However, the court also upheld the finding that the commonwealth had rebutted the prima facie case with the prosecutor's explanation of his challenges, including legitimate reasons such as the demeanor of the venirepersons and their familiarity with the locale.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed appellant's conviction for robbery, upholding the trial judge's findings that appellant had established a prima facie case of discrimination in the prosecution's use of peremptory challenges solely against black jurors and that the commonwealth had rebutted this prima facie case by giving reasons for striking black jurors that were reasonably specific and not obviously illegitimate.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of simple assault, robbery, recklessly endangering another person, theft by unlawful taking or disposition, and criminal conspiracy. Defendant was sentenced to a total of 5 to 10 years imprisonment. Defendant filed a motion for reconsideration of sentence, which was denied. On direct appeal, the court affirmed the judgment of sentence. Defendant's due process rights were not violated as a result of the commonwealth's having provided him with notice of its intention to seek mandatory sentencing pursuant to 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 9713, because the commission of a crime at or near a public transportation facility was not an element of the crime, and only became important for purposes of sentencing. The evidence presented at trial was sufficient to support the finding that the incident occurred at or near the vicinity of the public transportation facility because the commonwealth presented sufficient evidence that the incident occurred on a passageway leading to and from such a facility. Defendant lacked standing to challenge &sect; 9713 on vagueness because the provision of the statute that defendant alleged was vague was not applied to the facts of defendant's case.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At defendant's trial for rape, involuntary deviate sexual intercourse, statutory rape, indecent assault, and corrupting the morals of a minor, a witness' testimony showed that her knowledge of the attacks on the victim was based upon the victim's statements to the witness. An expert witness testified that in his employment, he interviewed the children brought for treatment to confirm or deny the information relayed by their families and noted a high correlation of reliability between what the children and adults said. The trial court denied defendant's motion for mistrial but granted his motion for new trial. On appeal, the court reversed the judgment and held the expert's testimony did not usurp the jury's function as fact-finder because the testimony made no judgment of credibility in the case at bar but merely noted that the reasons given by the children for why they entered the hospital tend to match those given by the adults. Further, even if the jury did infer from the expert's comment that the witness' testimony matched that of the victim, the comment did not bolster the victim's credibility or remove the issue of the victim's credibility from the province of the jury.</SPAN></P>

He challenged his conviction, attacking the constitutionality of &sect; 3742. This statute required a mandatory sentence for a hit and run driver who &quot;materially contributed&quot; to serious bodily injury. Appellant argued that &sect; 3742 did not define &quot;material contribution&quot; and that he was denied due process when the issue of &quot;material contribution&quot; was not submitted to the jury, The court held that &sect; 3742 was clear on its face and that, if the prosecution sought the mandatory sentence under Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 3742(b)(3), it had to prove &quot;material contribution&quot; as an element of the crime and submit it to the jury.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted for corrupting minors, reckless endangerment of another person, and criminal mischief. He was sentenced to seven years' probation, assessed a fine, and ordered to surrender his gun collection for destruction. Appellant's new attorney filed a petition to modify the sentence. On review, appellant alleged that his sentence, which resulted in the forfeiture of his firearm collection, was illegal and unconstitutional. Further, despite his failure to raise the issue in his petition to modify sentence, it had not been waived. The court vacated the sentence and remanded the matter to the trial court. The court found that appellant's counsel was ineffective for failing to raise and preserve the challenge to his sentence. The court held that the confiscation of appellant's property without compensation deprived him of his property without due process of law or its legal equivalent under Pa. Const. art. I &sect; 9. The court further held that the sentence could not be justified as a confiscation of derivative contraband, because there was no allegation that the gun collection was used in appellant's underlying crime, or in the perpetuation of an unlawful act.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant state challenged the judgment of the Court of Common Pleas of Montgomery County (Pennsylvania), which suppressed drugs and drug paraphernalia that the fire marshal observed and had a police officer seize while the marshal was investigating a fire. The trial court also ruled other evidence inadmissible due to the taint of the original search.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The fire marshal was called to the scene of a fire to investigate the cause of the fire. He determined the location where the fire began and then, in the scope of his duties, looked through the rest of the residence to determine if there was additional smoke damage. He observed in plain view in a back room drugs and drug paraphernalia. He summoned a police officer to seize the evidence. The trial court suppressed the evidence and held that fire investigators did not have the power to seize non-arson related evidence and therefore a warrant was required to seize the evidence. The court, on appeal, reversed the suppression order and remanded the case back for further proceedings and found that the evidence was properly seized without a warrant. The court found that the fire marshal was properly inside the premises in the course of his duties and inadvertently observed, in plain view, evidence of criminal activity, that the fire marshal summoned a police officer to seize the evidence rather than doing it himself did not require the officer to obtain a search warrant, so long as the officer did not extend the scope of the search.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court, on appeal, reversed the case and remanded it back to the trial court for further proceedings because the evidence seized by the police officer was in plain view of the fire marshal and the Marshall was authorized to be where he was when the evidence was found and it would have been an absurd result to say that the police officer needed a warrant to seize evidence which the Marshall would have been authorized to seize.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Pennsylvania Supreme Court reversed the appellate court's judgment reversing the trial court's conviction of defendant for possession of a controlled substance. The supreme court remanded the matter for further proceedings on defendant's remaining appellate issues that 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 5701 was unconstitutional and an informant's consent to a wiretap was an unreasonable search and seizure.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of possession and delivery of a controlled substance as a result of an alleged sale of cocaine to a police informant in defendant's home. The police informant was wearing a concealed recording device that enabled the police to record the conversation between defendant and the informant. On appeal, the court reversed defendant's conviction, holding the recorded conversation in defendant's home was an unreasonable search and seizure. The supreme court reversed pursuant to a supreme court decision and remanded to the court for further proceedings to dispose of defendant's remaining appellate issues. The court affirmed, holding the Wiretapping and Electronic Surveillance Act, 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 5701 et seq. was not unconstitutional and did not amount to a denial of due process because it denied ordinary citizens the right to record their own conversations while at the same time permitting law enforcement officials to record conversations. The court held the informant's consent to the interception was voluntary where he testified he made a deliberate decision to cooperate in the investigation in the hope that he might eventually receive more lenient treatment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction of possession and delivery of a controlled substance because the court determined that the Wiretapping and Electronic Surveillance Act was not unconstitutional and did not amount to a denial of due process, and that the police informant's consent to the electronic interception was voluntary. The court held in consensual surveillance cases there was no requirement that the target be identified.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An agent from the Bureau of Narcotics sought to search the Schedule II files of the pharmacy, at which appellee was the pharmacist, to gain information on another individual who was accused of falsifying prescriptions. The agent found other false prescriptions and returned to check the files again on two other dates. Appellee did not know that he was under investigation for falsifying prescriptions when he consented to the search. The trial court granted appellee's omnibus motion to suppress the false slips found on the second search because a search warrant was required and appellee had not voluntarily consented to the second search. The court, on appeal, affirmed the trial court's judgment as to the validity of the second search and found that appellee was under the misapprehension that his files were being searched for evidence against another and therefore his consent to search the files was not voluntary. The court quashed appellee's cross-appeal on the trial court's denial to suppress other evidence and found that it was without jurisdiction to hear the claim because the order was interlocutory, as appellee could still object at trial and appeal after his conviction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant pled guilty but mentally ill to kidnapping while in visible possession of a firearm and was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of not less than 5 years nor more than 10 years, plus the cost of prosecution. On review, appellant contended that the imposition of the statutorily required 5 to 10 years incarceration constituted cruel and unusual punishment; the trial court erred in not imposing a sentence of &quot;total confinement&quot; consisting of involuntary mental health treatment; and the trial court erred in failing to order implementation of a mental health treatment plan. The court affirmed, holding that the fact that appellant pled guilty but mentally ill did not authorize a deviation from the mandatory minimum sentence required by 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9712. Because the trial court had no choice but to commit appellant to the Bureau of Corrections as required by 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9762(1), appellant's derivative claim regarding involuntary mental health treatment necessarily failed. The court held it was the Bureau of Corrections responsibility and not the trial court's to formulate a treatment program in accordance with 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9727.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's judgment of sentence because appellant was not entitled to a deviation from the mandatory minimum sentence merely because he pled guilty but mentally ill; the trial court had no choice but to commit appellant to the Bureau of Corrections in accordance with the mandatory minimum sentence requirements; and it was not the trial court's responsibility to formulate a treatment program for appellant.</SPAN></P>

The court held that appellant's settlement offer was not in accordance with Rule 238(b)(1) and that appellee was not responsible for any delay; thus, appellant was liable for delay damages.

The court, on appeal, vacated the trial court's order and found that appellant claimed that the marital domicile was in Pennsylvania, which might have been sufficient minimum contacts to give the trial court personal jurisdiction over appellee.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff patient sued defendant physician for failing to properly diagnose her pregnancy. She sought damages for the anxiety she experienced and continued to experience, past and future medical costs, pain and suffering, lost earnings and for the expenses of raising her child. Plaintiff had undergone a tubal ligation two years prior to the pregnancy and did not want more children. Plaintiff argued that but for defendant's failure to timely order a pregnancy test and diagnose her as being pregnant, plaintiff would have been able to legally abort the child and would have been able to avoid bearing an unplanned child. The court held the general assembly unambiguously expressed its intention that 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 8305 (1988) was to be applied retroactively. The wrongful birth statute expressly provided that there was no cause of action based on a claim that, but for an act of the defendant, a person once conceived would not or should not have been born or aborted.

Appellant forcibly made one resident place his hand on the other resident's penis and then forced the resident's head near the other resident's penis. The events were terminated when one of the resident's father knocked on the door. Charges were filed against appellant and appellant was convicted of attempted deviate sexual intercourse, 18 P.S. &sect; 3123 (1983), indecent assault, 18 P.S. &sect; 3126 (1983), and unlawful restraint. On appeal, the court affirmed because 18 P.S. &sect; 306 (1983), imputed criminal liability to an individual that forced unlawful sexual contact between two innocent victims. The court held that the &sect; 306 was not vague because it provided appellant and law enforcement officials, with fair notice that appellant's actions would render him legally accountable for the conduct of the victims. The court also held there was no ineffective assistance of counsel because counsel was not required to anticipate changes in the sentencing law.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged the judgment of the Court of Common Pleas of Westmoreland County (Pennsylvania), which admitted into evidence blood test results and statements taken from appellant at the hospital and convicted appellant after he was found to have a blood alcohol content of greater than .10 percent following an accident in which the passenger of appellant's car was killed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was injured and his passenger killed after appellant wrecked his automobile. At the hospital, a police officer suspected that appellant was under the influence of alcohol because appellant smelled of alcohol and had bloodshot and glassy eyes. The officer then went to survey the scene of the accident where he observed the body of the passenger, then returned to the hospital. Over a three hour period, three blood alcohol tests were performed on appellant, the highest showed appellant's blood alcohol content to have been .228 percent, in violation of 75 P.S. &sect; 3731(a)(4). At no time was appellant under arrest. The trial court admitted the blood alcohol tests into evidence and also allowed statements made by appellant when the officer returned to the hospital to be admitted into evidence. The court, on appeal, affirmed appellant's conviction and found that neither appellant's consent nor arrest was not required before performing a blood alcohol test and found that appellant was not in custody at the time he made the statements to the police, therefore the trial court did not err in allowing the test and the statements into evidence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A third party who provided laborers to appellant electric company employed appellee worker. While working on the jobsite of appellant electric company, appellee fell from a catwalk erected by appellant manufacturer and sustained serious injuries. Appellants sought review of the trial court judgment awarding damages to appellee. On appeal, the court granted appellant manufacturer a judgment n.o.v. The court found that appellant manufacturer did not construct an unreasonably dangerous catwalk, and it was not foreseeable that appellant electric company would fail to have its workers re-weld grates that were removed. The court held that appellant electric company was not appellee's statutory employer in its position as the owner. Conflicting evidence on the issue of control of work allowed the jury to determine that appellee was not a borrowed employee. Consequently, appellant electric company was not immune from suit as an employer under the Worker's Compensation Act, Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 77, &sect;&sect; 1-1601 (1952 &amp; Supp.1988). The case was remanded for a recalculation of delay damages under Pa. R. Civ. P. 238, which was promulgated while the challenge to delay damages was pending.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted judgment n.o.v. for appellant manufacturer because as a matter of law appellant manufacturer was not negligent for failing to anticipate the misconduct of appellant electric company that led to appellee worker's injury. Appellant electric company was not immune from suit and was not entitled to indemnity or a new trial, but the court remanded for recalculation of delay damages payable to appellee.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was found guilty of overtime parking in violation of a city ordinance and was fined for the offense and was also fined for parking in a restricted area in violation of 42 Pa.

The court concluded that the trial court did not violate defendant's constitutional right to due process under U.S. Cons. amend XIV when the commonwealth did not prove beyond a reasonable doubt the identity of the perpetrator. The court held that traffic violations fell within a proper classification of public welfare offenses and the U.S. Supreme Court had carved out an exception to the general criminal due process considerations for such offenses. The court concluded that the commonwealth could thus make out a prima facie case for imposing responsibility for a traffic violation upon the vehicle's owner by proving the existence of an illegally parked vehicle registered in the name of defendant. The court refused to impose a requirement of identifying the driver in such parking violation cases.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state challenged the judgments of sentence entered in the Court of Common Pleas of Clearfield County (Pennsylvania), after defendants pled guilty to welfare fraud for their failure to disclose family income, in violation of 62 P.S. &sect; 481(a). The state contended that the sentences imposed were illegal because the trial court failed to impose a restitution order as mandated by 62 P.S. &sect; 481(c).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Upon accepting defendants' guilty pleas to welfare fraud, the trial court imposed sentences that specifically excluded restitution orders. In its memorandum filed pursuant to Pa. R. App. P. 1925(a), the trial court reasoned that the word &quot;shall&quot; in 62 P.S. 481(c) was discretionary and not mandatory, or in the alternative, that the state failed to establish the amount of restitution because the complaining claims agent of the welfare department failed to appear at sentencing. The court examined &sect; 481(c) in light of the provisions of the Statutory Construction Act, 1 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. &sect; 1901 et seq, and vacated the judgments of sentence. The court found that the restitution provision of the act was intended to be mandatory and that such construction was in harmony with the mischief to be remedied and the object to be attained by &sect; 481(c). The court held that the forfeiture of the right to restitution was not justifiable as a sanction for the claims agent's alleged non-compliance with the court's directive to appear because the commonwealth's right to restitution could not be forfeited.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that the trial court was without authority to impose sentences which failed to require defendants to make restitution of any moneys fraudulently obtained.

Defendant claimed that the trial court improperly imposed the five-year mandatory minimum sentence required by 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 9713, and that the court erred it denied his motion to dismiss on statutory speedy trial grounds.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant claimed that his speedy trial rights had been violated when he was not brought to trial for robbery and conspiracy within the term specified by Pa.

The court affirmed the conviction and held that the period of the delay was excluded from the time within which defendant had to be brought to trial because the delay was caused by defendant's counsel. The court ruled that evidence obtained as a result of defendant's arrest was not tainted because the police had reasonable suspicion to stop defendant and probable cause to arrest him. The court determined that the photograph identification was not unduly suggestive when displayed to the victim whose cab and cash was stolen by defendant, and that there was an independent basis for the complaining witness' in-court identification. The court held that defendant did not have the right to be represented by counsel at the photo array because there had not yet been an arrest for the offense in question and defendant was in custody pursuant to a different offense. The court ruled that the cab was a vehicle that rendered public passenger transportation services such that 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 9713 applied.</SPAN></P>

A trial court entered a judgment of sentence. Appellant sought review. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment. Accepting as true all of appellant's assertions of fact, the court found that appellant presented the appearance of a substantial question. The court was unable, however, to grant review because several of appellant's contentions were either based on assertions of fact not included in the record or were misstatements of recorded facts. The court found that there was nothing improper in the trial court's consideration of appellant's parole without verdict disposition for sentencing purposes. The court found that appellant failed to properly preserve a challenge to the constitutionality of the sentencing guidelines. The court determined that appellant's ineffectiveness of counsel claims were raised in a vacuum, and that appellant's counsel sufficiently preserved the claim that the sentencing guidelines were improperly applied and that the trial court abused its discretion. Finally, the court declined to hold appellant's counsel ineffective for failing to predict changes in the law.</SPAN></P>

Const. Stat. Ann. &sect; 1543(b). Appellant sought review of the trial court's judgment of sentence. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment because the sentences imposed under &sect; 1543(b) were not disproportionate to the gravity of the offense and were not repugnant to societal standards of justice. The court found that &sect; 1543(b) was not overbroad in its application to DUI-related suspension offenders such as appellant. The court found that appellant's refusal to submit to a chemical test, as required by 75 Pa. Const. Stat.

The court determined that the mandatory penalties set forth in &sect; 1543(b) were rationally related to the Commonwealth's interest in keeping its highways safe. In the absence of any allegation that persons similarly situated to appellant were not treated alike, the court held that &sect; 1543(b) was rationally related to a legitimate state interest and, for that reason, did not violate the Equal Protection Clause.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the guard father instrument possessed by appellant fell within the definition of an offensive weapon under 18 Pa. Cons. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff natural mother filed an action in support that alleged that defendant natural father had failed to support the parties' minor child, which was born out of wedlock. Defendant responded with a motion for judgment on the pleadings that claimed that the six-year statute of limitations provided in 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 6704(e) barred plaintiff's claim. The trial court denied defendant's motion and held that the 18-year limitation period set forth in 23 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 4343(b) was applicable. On appeal, the court affirmed, and held that plaintiff's action was timely filed under &sect; 4343(b), which was the applicable statute of limitations, as it was the statute in effect at the time of filing. The child at issue was born before the effective date of &sect; 4343(b), but plaintiff's petition was filed after that date. In addition, &sect; 6704(e) had been declared unconstitutional. However, the issue of whether &sect; 4343(b) was to be applied retroactively had never been decided. The court determined that if &sect; 4343(b) were not applied retroactively, there would have been no statute of limitations in place for cases formerly covered by the six-year statute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant commonwealth contended that the trial court lacked authority to reconsider the order, which denied post-verdict motions in appellee's criminal convictions 30 days after its entry, pursuant to 42 Pa.

On appeal, the court vacated the order for a new trial, reinstated the verdict, and directed the trial court to resentence appellee. The court held that &sect; 5505 did not apply to interlocutory orders and that neither remand order restricted the trial court's authority to reconsider the timely filed post-verdict motions. Appellee had requested a new trial based upon a change in the law, and the trial court concluded that the failure to instruct the jury that evidence of the victim's prior inconsistent statement could have been used as substantive evidence constituted reversible error.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested and charged with rape and indecent assault. He filed a pre-trial motion, requesting records from the rape crisis center that treated the victim. The crisis center moved to quash the subpoena and claimed confidentiality under 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. &sect; 5945.1. The trial court granted the motion, and defendant was subsequently convicted. On appeal the court reversed and held that &sect; 5945.1 was inapplicable because it only applied to oral interviews of counselors, not to production of documents. The court held that the trial court must perform an in camera inspection to determine exactly what in the file was truly verbatim accounts of the victim and not recollections or interpretations of the interviewing counselor. Only statements that had a direct bearing to the facts of the alleged offense and not to counseling services could be released. If the court concluded on remand, after the in camera inspection, that materials should have been disclosed to defendant then a new trial would be required. If all documents were outside the scope of defense review the court should reimpose sentence.</SPAN></P>

At the conclusion of the prosecution's case, the trial court sustained demurrers on the charges of murder, voluntary manslaughter, and causing a catastrophe. Trial on the remaining charges was continued to permit the commonwealth to appeal the order sustaining the demurrers. When trial was resumed, appellants filed a motion to dismiss on the grounds of double jeopardy and denial of a speedy trial; the motion was denied. The court affirmed the order denying the motion to dismiss. The court held that a delay of six years did not deny appellants a speedy trial because the delay was reasonable, appellants did not fully assert their rights to a speedy trial, and no prejudice resulted. The court found no double jeopardy violation because the proceedings on the remaining charges were never terminated and no judgment of acquittal or conviction had been entered.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of robbing taxicabs and sentenced pursuant to the Mandatory Minimum Sentencing Act, 42 Pa.

Appellant maintained that &sect; 9713 of the Act was a violation of the Equal Protection Clause of U.S. Const. amend. XIV. The court affirmed the judgment of conviction and sentence. The court held that the classification of offenders who commit crimes on or near public transportation is neither suspect nor sensitive. Because people using public transportation must feel safe and protected while riding or waiting for public vehicles, the imposition of a more severe punishment upon those who committed crimes on or near public transportation was rationally related to a legitimate state interest. The court held that the statute's protection extended to taxicab drivers as well as to passengers. The court held that &sect; 9713 was not arbitrary but rested upon a substantial need to protect those citizens who availed themselves of public transportation and the operators who provided the service.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of his conviction from a jury trial held in the Court of Common Pleas of Delaware County (Pennsylvania), where the jury found him guilty but mentally ill on the charges of robbery, in violation of 18 Pa. Con. Stat. &sect; 3701, simple assault, 18 Pa. Con. Stat. &sect; 2701, and terroristic threats, 18 Pa. Con.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant attempted to rob a restaurant using a toy rifle, but was unsuccessful at obtaining any money and was apprehended at the scene.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants were charged with defiant trespass as a result of their destruction of property and occupation of an abortion clinic. Appellants claimed that justification under 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect;&sect; 501-510 provided a defense. The trial court denied the use of the defense, and a jury convicted appellants. The court affirmed the convictions because justification did not provide a defense. To prove justification as a defense, appellants had shown under &sect; 503 that there was a clear and imminent harm, that appellants' actions would have avoided the greater harm, that there was no legal alternative to prevent the harm, and that the legislature did not preclude the defense. The court found that because abortion was legal under the Abortion Control Act, 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect;&sect; 3201-3220, and under the United States Constitution, abortion was not a public disaster. Additionally, appellants were unable to prevent abortion by its offense in one clinic, there were suitable peaceful means by which to make a protest, and there was a legislative purpose in the preclusion of the defense to appellants because abortion was legal.</SPAN></P>

The court rejected defendant's contention that, in light of his good behavior while on parole from the original sentence, the new sentence was excessive and disproportionate and therefore constituted cruel and unusual punishment. The court held that the individual circumstances of particular cases were not considered in deciding whether the mandatory minimum sentence applied. Rather, the individual circumstances of the particular case were only considered in determining whether sanctions in excess of the mandatory minimum sentence should have been imposed. Finally, the court held that the sentence was not excessive or arbitrary as the legislature had determined that the need to deter the illegal possession of firearms during the commission of specified crimes warranted imposition of a five year mandatory minimum sentence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant widow's late husband conveyed realty to appellees, his daughters of a prior marriage, as joint tenants with rights of survivorship. Appellant brought suit to partition the realty. The lower court granted appellees' motion to dismiss on the ground that appellant's action was actually an untimely exercise of her spousal right of election under 20 P.S. &sect;&sect; 2203, 2210. Appellant sought review and the court affirmed. Appellant's attempt to assert her dower right failed because 20 P.S. &sect;&sect; 2105, 2203 supplanted her common law dower rights. Instead, under &sect; 2203, appellant had a choice to take under her late husband's will or to take one-third of his augmented estate irrespective of his existing will. That the conveyance complained of occurred before the enactment of &sect;&sect; 2015, 2203 was irrelevant, as the legislature stipulated that those sections were applicable to any decedent dying 60 days or more after their effective dates. Appellant waived her appellate attack against the sections as an unconstitutional taking because she gave no written notice of the question to the state Attorney General as required by Pa. R.

Defendant appealed his conviction, contending that his arrest was not based on probable cause, he received ineffective assistance of counsel, and that his sentence for involuntary deviate sexual intercourse was excessive.

The court held that police had probable cause to arrest defendant and, upon consideration of the totality of the circumstances, concluded that the victim provided the officers with sufficient facts to warrant the officers' belief that defendant was the one who assaulted her. The court ruled that defendant did not receive ineffective representation, noting that defendant's prior convictions for crimes involving dishonesty were admissible to impeach his credibility and that trial counsel was not ineffective for raising a meritless claim.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court entered a judgment of sentence for criminal trespass and defiant trespass in connection with defendant's demonstration at an abortion clinic. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that appellant was not entitled to raise the defense of justification. Where the law did not recognize abortions as a harm, appellant did not demonstrate that he was faced with a clear harm. Appellant did not show that his actions would be effective in preventing women from obtaining abortions. Appellant had a legal alternative to trespass and the legislature, in not enacting laws prohibiting abortions prior to viability, precluded the justification defense with regard to protests at abortion facilities. Because appellant was not entitled to assert the justification defense at trial, he was not entitled to a jury instruction on the same. Appellant, having failed to object to the jury charge on criminal trespass at trial, waived the right to do so on appeal. Because appellant failed to comply with Pa. R. Admin. P. 2119(f) in challenging his sentence, and because the commonwealth objected, the court held that it must disallow appellant's appeal as to that issue.</SPAN></P>

Defendant received consecutive terms of imprisonment of seven and one-half to fifteen years on count one and two and one-half to ten years on count three. Defendant appealed the sentence. The court vacated the sentence imposed. The court held that, because the sentence imposed was almost twice as long as the sentence which was recommended, there was a substantial question that the sentence imposed was not appropriate. The court also held that, although the trial court did refer to the maximum sentence which had been agreed upon, the sentencing court failed to provide a contemporaneous written statement of its reasons for deviations from the guidelines, as was required.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were charged with various crimes after their vehicles were stopped at three sobriety checkpoint roadblocks. The trial court granted defendants' motions to suppress all evidence obtained as a result of the stops made at the checkpoints. The court affirmed the suppression order as to one defendant, finding that the roadblock, which occurred earlier than the other roadblocks at issue, was unlawful because it was not authorized by the legislature and the police had no grounds to suspect a violation of the law when they stopped that defendant. As to the following roadblock nearly one month later, the court found that the police were authorized by the legislature to operate that roadblock because 75 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. &sect; 6308(b) had been amended to permit the stops without individual suspicion of illegal activity. The court found that the roadblock was conducted in a constitutional manner, but remanded for a hearing on additional issues.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of unlawfully delivering and possessing cocaine. On appeal, he challenged the constitutionality of the Wiretapping and Electronic Surveillance Control Act, 18 P.S. &sect; 5701 et seq. (1983). Defendant alleged that the tape recording worn on the informant should have been suppressed because the agents failed to obtain a court order to intercept the communication at issue. Defendant also asserted that the interception of the oral communications was a search and was therefore constitutional only if it had been authorized by a neutral and detached magistrate upon a showing of probable cause, and that the police should have obtained a warrant before recording defendant's conversations inside his vehicle. The judgment of the trial court was affirmed, and the court held that because the confidential informant was a party to the wiretapping communication and voluntarily consented to wearing the body wire, no court order was necessary.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgement below, holding that because the confidential informant was a party to the wiretapping communication and voluntarily consented to wearing the body wire, no court order was necessary.

The court held that there was sufficient evidence provided by accident reconstruction experts to establish that defendant had crossed the centerline and failed to drive at a safe speed. The state had shown that defendant's conduct constituted a gross deviation from the standard of care that a normally prudent person would exercise in like circumstances. His conduct satisfied a finding of at least criminal negligence, if not recklessness. Defendant's actions were the legal cause of the victims' deaths because the deaths were a probable consequence of his actions. The court held that the application of &sect; 3732 was not unconstitutional as his conduct rose to the level of criminal negligence. Finally, the court determined that there was no error in failing to admit the testimony of several lay witnesses to further demonstrate the road's inherently dangerous condition because there was no abuse of discretion.</SPAN></P>

The trial court erred in permitting the commonwealth to call defendant's wife, who was in the vehicle at the time of the accident, to testify against him because the exception in 42 Pa. Cons.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged a judgment from the sentencing court, which resentenced him after his original sentence for robbery was invalidated. A federal district court invalidated a prior conviction for voluntary deviate sexual intercourse and instructed that appellant be resentenced on his robbery conviction because he needed to be given credit for time served against his robbery sentence and because the sentencing report showed that the trial court had considered appellant's prior conviction for voluntary deviate sexual intercourse when it issued the sentence for robbery. On appeal, the court vacated the sentence and remanded for resentencing, because the sentencing court did not include an adequate statement of reasons. The court noted that in every case where a sentence was imposed for a felony or misdemeanor, the sentencing court had to include as part of the record, and disclose at the time of sentencing, a statement of the reasons for the sentence imposed, and that failure to comply was grounds for vacating the sentence.

Appellee insurance company which insured the driver of the car, denied benefits to appellant under the Motor Vehicle Financial Responsibility Law, 75 Pa. Cons. Stat.

Appellant's vehicle was not the one involved in the accident, and she filed a complaint for declaratory judgment requesting that &sect; 1714 be declared unconstitutional as applied to her. The trial court found the statute constitutional and entered summary judgment for appellee. The court affirmed, holding that the &quot;rational basis&quot; test applied to &sect; 1714 because it provided for entitlement to economic benefits relating to losses incurred as the result of motor vehicle usage. Appellant was free to pursue any claim in a civil action. The court held that the statute had a legitimate purpose and a rational relationship between that purpose and the means chosen to foster it. The statute's purpose was to require owners of registered vehicles to be financially responsible, and it excluded financially irresponsible persons from receiving benefits.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, owner of rental property, sought review of the orders of the Court of Common Pleas, Civil Division, of Philadelphia County (Pennsylvania) refusing to strike judgments in two cases. The judgments were obtained against appellant as a result of the death of the husband of appellee when he fell while repairing appellant's rental property. Appellant contended that the statute authorizing entry of the judgments was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The husband of appellee was killed when he fell while repairing rental property owned by appellant. Appellee filed workmen's compensation claims against appellant for medical and death benefits. Appellant failed to file answers to the claims. After receiving notice from the Pennsylvania Compensation Rating Bureau that appellant was not carrying workmen's compensation insurance, appellee filed two praecipes with the prothonotary of the trial court to enter temporary judgments against appellant pursuant to 77 P. S. &sect; 931. Appellant filed an answer claiming that he was not an employer subject to the Workmen's Compensation Act, and then filed a petition to strike the judgments alleging that &sect; 931 was unconstitutional on its face. In affirming the decision of the trial court, the court held the effect of the temporary judgments authorized by &sect; 931 was only to preserve a claimant's status as a lienholder and did not allow a claimant to execute on the judgment unless and until it had been finally determined that the employer was liable for the claim. Because there was a reasonable basis for this statute, the act did not substantively deny due process.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court, holding that the statute allowing appellee widow to file a temporary judgment against appellant, property owner was not unconstitutional. However, because the trial court had not addressed the merits of appellant's petition to open, the court remanded and directed the trial court to consider it.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's conversation with an informant, equipped with a body transmitter and sent into his home by police to make a controlled purchase, was recorded. The police swore out a warrant reciting as probable cause the controlled purchases. Defendant was convicted of possession of controlled substances with the intent to deliver marijuana. He challenged the constitutionality of the electronic eavesdropping and the trial court denied his motions. A panel of the court affirmed the trial court. However, the court en banc held that although the U.S. Const. amend. IV imposed no limit on eavesdropping where one party had consented, Pa. Const. art. I, &sect; 8, imposed a higher standard, as states had the power to do. The state constitution required a warrant based upon probable cause for the electronic seizure of the communication because defendant had a reasonable and legitimate expectation of privacy. The court held that the evidence, upon which the search warrant was issued, excluding the illegally obtained communication, was insufficient to establish probable cause. The court concluded that the good-faith exception did not apply. The illegally seized evidence should have been suppressed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court en banc reversed the judgment of sentence, remanded the case for a new trial, and ordered the evidence obtained from the electronic surveillance suppressed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant uninsured motorist was operating a vehicle insured by appellee insurance company when he was involved in an accident. The vehicle owner's insurance policy provided for first-party benefits in the form of payment of medical bills and lost wages pursuant to the Motor Vehicle Financial Responsibility Act, 75 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 1701-1798. Appellant filed a claim to recover first-party benefits from appellee under 75 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. &sect; 1713(a)(3). Appellee denied appellant's claim pursuant to 75 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. &sect; 1714 because at the time of the accident appellant owned an uninsured, registered vehicle. The trial court awarded a verdict in favor of appellee and appellant sought review. On appeal, the court affirmed the verdict because appellant was required to maintain insurance on his registered motor vehicle although it was inoperable. The court found that appellant could have avoided ineligibility to recover first-party benefits under &sect; 1714 by either purchasing adequate insurance, by not registering the vehicle, or by cancelling the registration on the vehicle.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After raping the victim in her seventh month of pregnancy and threatening to kill her if she told anyone about the incident, defendant was convicted of rape, conspiracy to commit rape, theft, terroristic threats, and involuntary deviate sexual intercourse. Defendant appealed, raising issues concerning the alleged failure of the commonwealth to comply with defendant's discovery requests and the admission of testimony relating to the victim's post-rape trauma. The court affirmed the judgment. The court held that giving defendant's counsel the opportunity to investigate the new information cured any prejudice that may have resulted from the tardy disclosure of the potentially exculpatory evidence. The trial court properly denied defendant's request for a new trial on this ground. The court held that the non-expert testimony of post-rape trauma was relevant in determining whether a rape occurred.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the judgment of the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County (Pennsylvania), which convicted him of six sex offenses against three juvenile males.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of six sex offenses against three juvenile males, all of whom were under the age of sixteen at the time of the incidents. On appeal, defendant challenged the trial court's refusal to allow him to cross-examine two of the complainants for bias based on their juvenile records, the court's interpretation of the criminal solicitation statute, and other trial rulings. Finding that the state's interest in protecting the confidentiality of a juvenile's record had to yield to defendant's right to cross-examine an adverse witness to show bias, the court held that the trial court erred in denying defendant an opportunity to demonstrate the potential bias of the two juvenile complainants. The court held that the evidence was sufficient to sustain the guilty verdict as to two solicitation charges because the statute did not require a showing of criminal behavior by the person solicited, but rather the statute required what was shown by the evidence, namely, complicity, or participation, in the commission of a crime. Because defendant voluntarily submitted to stationhouse questioning, the court held that the trial court did not err in denying his motion to suppress.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court vacated the judgment of the trial court as to four of the six convictions against defendant for sex offenses against juvenile males and remanded the case for a new trial. The court held that the trial court committed reversible error by denying appellant an opportunity to demonstrate the potential bias of the two juvenile complainants on cross-examination.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of a judgment of sentence by the Court of Common Pleas of Dauphin County (Pennsylvania), for willful failure or refusal to timely pay the fuel use tax and the oil company franchise tax due. The taxes were allegedly due in connection with the sale of diesel fuel at defendant's truckstop.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of willful failure or refusal to timely pay the fuel use tax under 72 P.S. &sect; 2614.21(a), and the oil company franchise tax due under 75 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect;9510(c). Defendant contended on appeal that the oil company franchise tax did not apply to the sale of diesel fuel and that he was not an actor that could be held criminally liable under the statute. The court affirmed the convictions, holding that the definition asserted by defendant of &quot;liquid fuels&quot; was taken in error from the Liquid Fuels Tax Act, 72 P.S. &sect;2611a et seq., because the definition used in the statute under which he was convicted did include diesel fuels in its definition. The court also held that individuals, such as defendant, were subject to indictment for acts done under the guise of a corporation where the individual personally so dominated and controlled the corporation as to immediately direct its action. The court found that defendant was indeed responsible for the non-payment of the taxes.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's convictions stemming from his failure to pay taxes due in connection with his business, holding that the diesel fuel sold by defendant's business was included in the definition of taxable items in the statute under which he was convicted. The court also found him to be the responsible party for the business's failure to pay the taxes because he was in control of the business.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant admitted his involvement in a robbery but denied that he used a knife in committing the offense.

Defendant appealed the judgment of sentence claiming that the statute was unconstitutionally vague and overbroad. Since defendant did not contend that his rights under U.S. Const. amend.

Cons. Stat. &sect; 5703.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A state trooper that was interviewing defendant regarding the theft of another inmate's personal property was unaware that defendant was secretly tape recording the conversation. The trooper only made penciled notes of the interview, and would have refused defendant's request to tape the interview if asked. The trial court granted defendant a writ of habeas corpus and dismissed charges brought against him under the Wiretapping and Electronic Surveillance Control Act, 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 5703. In reversing the trial court, the court held that the violation of the Act was not based on one's expectation of privacy, but rather on the expectation that such communication was not subject to interception as defined by 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 5702. For that reason, the court concluded that the interview between the trooper and defendant was an oral communication protected under the Wiretap Act. Defendant's argument that the very nature of the trooper's job waived the protection of the Act for the trooper was also without merit since a trooper was &quot;a person&quot; as defined by &sect; 5702.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with perjury, having testified in her earlier prostitution trial that she had never been convicted of a crime. She had a pending civil lawsuit against the police department with regard to an allegedly coercive body cavity search. At her perjury trial she was prevented from cross-examining a police officer, who was named as a co-defendant in her civil lawsuit, about his motive in testifying. She was convicted of perjury and false swearing. The court held that the trial court abused its discretion when it did not let defendant examine the police officer about his motive. The court held that she should have been permitted to test the witness's credibility especially in light of the fact that in a perjury action there is a &quot;two witness&quot; rule for corroborating the perjury and the trial judge charged the jury with the seriousness of witness credibility. The court held that the trial court erred when it did not have an evidentiary hearing on defendant's claim that the commonwealth had engaged in prosecutorial vindictiveness, charging her with perjury after she had filed her civil lawsuit.

The court affirmed in part and vacated in part. The court held that there was sufficient evidence to convict defendants of disorderly conduct under 18 Pa. Cons. Stat.

The court held that the convictions did not violate defendants' rights to free speech and assembly because their acts occurred on church property, not merely on public sidewalks. The court also held that the statute was not overbroad nor vague because it narrowly confined the state's police powers. The court held, however, with the state's concession, that there was insufficient evidence to convict defendants of failure of disorderly persons to disperse upon official order under 18 Pa. Cons.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant heirs-at-law sought review after the trial court constructed decedent's last will and testament in favor of appellee.

Here, the court found that decedent established a simple formula for distributing her estate, first to her husband, then to issue, then to appellee. However, the court concluded that decedent's ex-husband was clearly disqualified from receiving the estate. Nevertheless, in the absence of clear evidence of intent to the contrary, the property which was prevented from passing to the former spouse because of divorce, could pass in the same manner as if the former spouse had failed to survive the decedent. Therefore, the court concluded that appellee was entitled to inherit under the will. Accordingly, the judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was found guilty of rape, involuntary deviate sexual intercourse, incest, corruption of minors, and endangering the welfare of a child. On review, appellant contended that his right to confrontation was violated when his accuser, a child, was permitted to testify at trial via closed circuit television. The court found that the use of closed circuit television in child abuse cases was a minimally intrusive infringement on the right of confrontation. Considerations of public policy required that testimony from the alleged victim of abuse be received without further psychological injury to the child. Here, the evidence established good cause for the procedure utilized by the trial court. This evidence showed that the victim had been able to describe, in detail, the sexual acts, which had been perpetrated upon her by appellant to social workers and law enforcement officials. However, at a preliminary hearing, when asked to describe the acts in the presence of appellant, she fell into silence from fear. Under the circumstances, the court concluded that the trial court acted properly and within its discretion. Accordingly, the judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of conviction was affirmed because appellant's constitutional right to confrontation was not violated when the trial court permitted the child abuse victim to testify via closed circuit television.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed an order of the lower court terminating appellant father's parental rights, and the supreme court reversed and remanded the order of the superior court. Appellant argued that Adoption Act sections were invoked in an arbitrary and discriminatory manner and also contended that that appellee agency pursued their action against him because of a personal disapproval and dislike of him. Evidence showed that appellant initially denied paternity, took little interest in visiting, caring for or supporting child and was uncooperative with social worker. Evidence also showed that appellant was consistently unemployed, suffered from chronic schizophrenia, and had a history of drug abuse. The court held that appellant failed to meet the requisite burden of proof that he was purposefully singled out by agency because of dislike unrelated to his status as an unfit parent as he provided nothing more than unsupported assertions that appellee was after him. Additionally the court held that mere surmise, suggestion, and implication were insufficient to meet appellant's burden of proof. Accordingly the judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order was affirmed because appellee agency established by clear and convincing evidence that appellants' parental rights should be terminated, and appellant failed to establish that pertinent adoption act statutes were unconstitutionally applied against him.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After appellant pled guilty to the charges of unlawful restraint, recklessly endangering another person, terroristic threats, and aggravated assault, he was sentenced to 18 to 36 months' incarceration, 7 years probation, and a $ 1,000 fine. Appellant filed a timely motion to reconsider and modify sentence, in which the trial court vacated its previous sentence and imposed a sentence modifying the prison term to 16 to 36 months and a probationary period of 5 years. Appellant sought review, claiming that the deadly weapons enhancement provisions under 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9721 were unconstitutional and that the sentence imposed was excessive. Further, appellant claimed that the sentencing judge failed to state upon the record the reasons for the sentence and to consider the circumstances of the crime and appellant's history, character, and condition. The court affirmed. The court found that appellant waived his claims of error, with the exception of &sect; 9721's constitutionality. The court declined to decide the constitutionality issue because appellant was not affected by the potential applicability of &sect; 9721 and thus did not suffer any prejudice by its operation.</SPAN></P>

The Court of Common Pleas, Westmoreland County (Pennsylvania), Civil Division dismissed appellant's claims against three individual appellees for lack of personal jurisdiction, and granted summary judgment to three corporate appellees. Appellant sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant investor and another individual formed a corporation and entered an agreement to supply joint venturers with microparticle coal. Appellant injected funds and co-signed on loans to the corporation to further the enterprise, based on promises that he would be a shareholder in another corporation. These funds were apparently diverted to appellee corporations. Appellee corporations sought summary judgment, based on their lack of wrongdoing, and appellant responded with references to his complaint. The trial court granted summary judgment, and also dismissed appellee individual corporate officers for lack of personal jurisdiction. Appellant sought review. The court affirmed. Appellant failed to discharge his burden of demonstrating a genuine issue for trial by coming forward with affidavits or other admissible evidence; he could not rest on his complaint. The trial court lacked jurisdiction over appellee individuals, because appellant failed to show that they had personally directed the actions of their corporations sufficiently to hold them personally liable for the corporate acts.</SPAN></P>

Appellant failed to establish that appellee individuals personally took part in the commission of any torts; the trial court therefore lacked personal jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>

Appellant eventually confessed to the murder in a sworn statement to the Pennsylvania State Police. Appellant alleged that she reasonably believed that deadly force was necessary to protect herself from serious bodily injury. Because the victim was asleep at the time of the murder, the victim was not the aggressor. The court found that self-defense was not properly at issue because there was no evidence presented to establish that appellant reasonably believed that she or any other person was in imminent danger of death or serious bodily injury when the deadly force was used. The court held that the trial court properly refused to suppress appellant's statements to the police because she was not taken into custody or otherwise deprived of her freedom, she was given full Miranda warnings and knowingly and intelligently waived her rights before giving oral and written statements.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An officer suspected that appellee was intoxicated at the accident scene. Appellee had not been arrested or informed of the implied consent law when the hospital took a sample of his blood in order to treat him. The officer was verbally advised of the blood test results. A subpoena was obtained for the written results, and the officer swore out an affidavit of probable cause for appellee's arrest on charges of driving under the influence of alcohol. The trial court granted appellee's motion to suppress the results. On appeal, the court reversed the suppression order and remanded the case. The subpoena was invalid and should have been vacated because it was obtained when no arrest had been made, nor warrants or citations issued. However, the officer's determination of probable cause was based on the verbal results, not the written results, thus the invalidity of the subpoena did not require exclusion of the blood test evidence. The verbal request for information was a U.S. Const. amend. IV search that was justified under the implied consent provision of the Motor Vehicle Code, 75 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 1547(a).</SPAN></P>

On appeal, defendant raised 15 points of error, 11 of which the court found were adequately disposed of by the trial court's comprehensive opinion. The court affirmed defendant's convictions, finding that defendant's remaining four points of error were without merit. Specifically, the court held that 18 Pa. Cons.

The court further held that the trial judge did not err in allowing the jury to read transcripts of three wiretapped communications or in refusing to strike for cause certain prospective jurors.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The commonwealth appealed from that portion of an order of the Court of Common Pleas, Westmoreland County (Pennsylvania) that arrested judgment on appellant's jury conviction of involuntary deviate sexual intercourse. Appellant challenged the judgment of sentence of the same court that was entered following his conviction by a jury for the crime of attempted rape.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Before the court for review were cross appeals. The commonwealth challenged that portion of an order arresting judgment on appellant's jury conviction of involuntary deviate sexual intercourse; appellant sought review of the judgment of sentence following his conviction by a jury for the crime of attempted rape. The commonwealth asked whether cunnilingus was an act prohibited by 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. &sect; 3123; while appellant raised several trial errors styled in terms of ineffectiveness of trial counsel. The court reversed the grant of the motion to arrest judgment. The court affirmed the judgment of sentence on the charge of attempted rape. A reasonable, common sense reading of &sect; 3123, together with the definitional language contained in 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. &sect; 3101, led to no other conclusion but that the legislature intended the act of cunnilingus to fall within the class of crimes constituting involuntary deviate sexual intercourse. Further, sufficient evidence of appellant's activity and conduct toward the victim existed to sustain his conviction for involuntary deviate sexual intercourse. The court found no merit to appellant's claims of ineffectiveness of trial counsel.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the order arresting judgment on charge of involuntary deviate sexual intercourse and reinstated the jury verdict. The court affirmed the judgment of sentence on the charge of attempted rape. The court relinquished jurisdiction. Ample evidence demonstrated appellant's acts established the requisite elements of the crime of involuntary deviate sexual intercourse. The claims of ineffectiveness of trial counsel were without merit.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A divorce action was brought by appellant against appellee, her husband. The trial court decreed the equitable distribution of all marital property and denied appellant's claim for alimony and counsel fees. On appeal, the court ordered that the decree be vacated as to the distribution of the residential property and that the property in its entirety be awarded to the wife. Attacking the judicial butterfly that comes away with the pollen of judicial precedent, the court found that the trial court erred by establishing a 50-50 starting point for making an award of equitable distribution of marital property, and by failing to make a division upon serious application of the factors set out in 23 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 401(d). The court found that appellant provided almost all of the funds used to the purchase the residential property, made all of the mortgage and utility payments, provided the insurance, and paid for all maintenance, repairs, and improvements. The case was remanded for findings as to alimony and counsel fees, because the trial court summarily denied each without setting forth reasons as mandated by 23 Pa. Cons.

The court affirmed, finding that there was sufficient evidence to sustain the conviction for violating &sect;&sect; 403(a) &amp; (b) and &sect; 4904(a)(1) and that the acquittal on a bribery charge did not effect the prosecution of &sect; 403(b), nor did it constitute res judicata. The court concluded that the trial court did not err in admitting a co-conspirator's hearsay statement because the prosecution established the conspiracy by a fair preponderance of the evidence. The court also found that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying defendant's requests for recusal and to waive his right to a jury trial. The court determined that the trial court stated adequate reasons for sentencing as it did, sentenced within the guidelines, and that the sentence was not excessive. Finally, the court found that the trial court properly imposed a fine on defendant within the statutes controlling and defendant's due process rights were not violated by the imposition of a fine or by denial of the opportunity to quit office before facing charges.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants husband and wife cross-appealed from an order of the Court of Common Pleas of Cumberland County (Pennsylvania) which granted them a divorce. Both appellants contended that the trial court abused its discretion in the division of certain assets as marital property.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants husband and wife challenged the lower court's decision regarding marital assets divided during divorce. Appellant husband specifically disputed the application of the tracing concept to property. He maintained that non-marital assets could be traced into the acquisition of stock. Based on this tracing, under appellant's theory, the assets should have retained their status as non-marital. The court held that in reviewing the record, there was no abuse of discretion by the trial court in determining the assets were marital property. The trial court correctly determined the proportions in which the parties should share in marital assets. However, the court found, as appellant wife contended, it was an abuse of discretion to value the assets as of the date of separation. On remand, the trial court was directed to determine the value of various stocks and assets. The trial court held that an award as requested by appellant wife was not warranted because of the large sum she was to receive and found no case law support for such an action. The court disagreed and thought the wife should be awarded benefits based on her pro rata interest in the various assets.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the actions of the lower court in determining the proportions in which the parties should share in the marital assets. The court remanded to allow the court to establish values for various shares of stock including the car dealerships and leasing company, in addition to other assets. The decision was based on the passage of time since the assets were valued and the substantial sums that would be involved in such fluctuations.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Three police officers set up a checkpoint on a state road to conduct a traffic safety check. The officers stopped all vehicles traveling in either direction and asked the operators to produce their licenses and registration cards. When the officers stopped appellant, he failed to produce a driver's license. The officers subsequently determined that appellant's license was suspended. He was charged with driving on a suspended license in violation of 75 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 1543(b). A magistrate found appellant guilty of the charge. The trial court dismissed his appeal and denied his post-trial motions. The court reversed, concluding that the traffic safety check violated appellant's right under U.S. Const. amend. IV and Pa. Const. art. I, &sect; 8, to be free from unreasonable seizures. The court found that the safety check was unreasonable because the field officers were given unbridled discretion to choose the time, date, and location of the check, there were no written guidelines or procedures, and there was no indication that the officers received any instructions from supervisory personnel regarding the operation of the safety check.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment from the Court of Common Pleas, Cumberland County (Pennsylvania), which convicted him, upon a jury trial, of rape and involuntary deviate sexual intercourse, contending it was error to permit the commonwealth to introduce evidence of his prior burglary convictions, to restrict his cross examination of the victim, and to permit the prosecutor to make improper comments in his closing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of rape and involuntary deviate sexual intercourse and appealed, challenging evidence of his prior convictions for burglary, the restriction on his cross examination of the victim, and certain comments by the prosecutor in his closing argument. The court affirmed the convictions, finding evidence of defendant's prior convictions was necessary to challenge his veracity based upon his defense of consent by the victim. The court determined that the convictions were not the same as the crime charged so they did not establish defendant's propensity to commit the offense being defended. The court held that the rape shield law, 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. &sect; 3104(a), prevented defendant from examining the victim about any reference to past sexual conduct except that with defendant. The court concluded defendant's attempt to elicit testimony that the victim was not a virgin was proscribed by the said statute. The court found that the challenged comments by the prosecutor in his closing argument were permissible references to evidence presented to the jury and merely pointed out legitimate inferences that could be drawn therefrom.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff employee brought an action under the Federal Employers' Liability Act (FELA), 45 U.S.C.S. &sect;&sect; 51-60, for injuries received in his employment with defendant railroad company. The jury found in favor of plaintiff. Defendant sought review, contending that the trial court erred by instructing the jury that it knew or should have known that plaintiff's on-the-job exposure to asbestos-containing products presented an unreasonable risk of harm, that the trial court erred by failing to instruct the jury that defendant would not be liable to the plaintiff for damages resulting from injuries resulting from plaintiff's hereditary asthma, and that it was not liable for the payment of any delay damages under Pa. R. Civ. P. 238 because the action was brought under FELA. The court rejected defendant's contentions, finding that the trial court properly focused on federal substantive law in considering appellant's request for a charge. However, the court noted that Rule 238 violated U.S. Const. amend. XIV by denying a forum to assess fault for the delay. The court thus vacated the judgment of the trial court and remanded the case to the trial court for an evidentiary hearing.</SPAN></P>

Those who had been placed in ARD had not been convicted of the offense. Thus, the trial court did not err in holding that the district attorney had sole discretion to determine placement in ARD.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of a judgment from the Court of Common Pleas of Northampton County (Pennsylvania), which convicted her of prostitution in violation of 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. &sect; 5902, and imposed a sentence of one year probation and a fine.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of prostitution in violation of 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. &sect; 5902. Appellant challenged her conviction, contending, inter alia, that the statute was unconstitutionally vague and, thus, void. Specifically, appellant alleged that the term &quot;sexual activity&quot; was inadequately defined, and that she had no notice and fair warning that she was violating the law by allowing manual genital stimulation for the payment of money. Affirming appellant's conviction, the court held that this was not a situation where the conduct prohibited was so intangible or vague as to require men of common intelligence to guess at its meaning and differ as to its application. Therefore, the court concluded that the statute was not unconstitutionally vague so as to cause appellant to seriously believe that she was not providing some form of sexual gratification for the payment of money.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed appellant's conviction for prostitution because appellant had notice and fair warning, as required by due process, that she was violating the law by allowing manual sexual stimulation for the payment of money.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant mother challenged the order of the Court of Common Pleas, Family Division, of Allegheny County (Pennsylvania), which dismissed appellant's complaint for support of her child, born out of wedlock, against appellee putative father.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant mother filed a support action on behalf of her child against appellee putative father of the child, approximately two years and two months after appellee last provided financial support for the child. Appellee filed an answer and new matter denying paternity and alleging the six-year statute of limitations under 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 6704 as a defense. The trial court dismissed the petition. Appellant challenged the order and the court affirmed, finding that appellant's claim was barred by the statute of limitations under the statute, and that appellee engaged in no activity justifying a tolling of the statute of limitations. Though a new statute had been enacted extending the statute of limitations to 18 years, appellant's cause of action had expired prior to the enactment of the new statute and retroactive application of the new statute could not revive her expired claim.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the dismissal of appellant mother's claim for support from appellee putative father because the statute of limitations barred the claim. A new, longer limitations period was not retroactive. Because appellant's claim expired before the enactment of the new statute, even retroactive application would not have affected appellant's rights.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, he argued that his sentence was excessive and also that the trial court improperly used misdemeanors not involving weapons in determining the prior record score for sentencing purposes. The court agreed with the latter argument. The court held that in computing defendant's prior record score for sentencing purposes, the trial court could not count defendant's prior misdemeanor convictions not involving use of a deadly weapon. Because the trial court improperly used misdemeanors in calculating defendant's prior record score, the court vacated the sentence and remanded for resentencing. Because defendant had to be resentenced, the court declined to rule on the excessive sentence issue.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of sentence in the Court of Common Pleas, Dauphin County (Pennsylvania), which reinstated defendant's conviction for solicitation to murder his wife after the trial court conducted evidentiary hearings and denied a motion for a new trial based on a proffered recantation by a key prosecution witness. The witness, after being granted immunity, withdrew any recantation and testified that his trial testimony was true.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of solicitation to murder his wife but the key prosecution witness, who testified that defendant had approached him to commit the murder, later recanted his testimony. On remand from the court, the trial court held four evidentiary hearings, denied defendant's motion for a new trial, and reinstated the judgment of sentence. On appeal, the court affirmed after a review to determine if the trial court had abused its discretion. The court held that a petition for immunity for the key witness under 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. &sect; 5947 was an exercise of prosecutorial discretion that the court would not disturb without a gross abuse of discretion. The court held that recantation testimony was considered extremely unreliable and the trial court should deny a new trial unless satisfied that the testimony was true. The key witness, after being granted immunity, disavowed the recantation and insisted his trial testimony was true. It was the function of the trial court to judge the credibility of the key witness and defendant's rebuttal witnesses. The court found defendant's claims of witness intimidation and other allegations to be without merit.</SPAN></P>
