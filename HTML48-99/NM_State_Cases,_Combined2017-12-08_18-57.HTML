<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Proceeding contesting results of city election for office of City Commissioner.  The District Court, Otero County, George T. Harris, J., entered judgment favorable to contestant, and contestee appealed.  The Supreme Court, Seymour, J., held that under statutes providing that elector shall mark a cross in square on ballot, that cross shall be two lines intersecting at any angle within circle or square, that elector can vote only by making such cross with pen and ink or indelible pencil and that no elector shall place any mark upon his ballot by which it may afterwards be identified, ballots which were marked by placing of check mark inside square opposite name of certain candidate would be rejected.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant contestee sought review of a judgment from the District Court, Otero County, New Mexico, that found in favor appellee contestant in a proceeding to contest the results of a city election for the office of city commissioner. The contestee argued that ballots marked with a check mark rather than a cross, as required by N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 56-312, 56-313 (1941), were nonetheless valid.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Twenty-seven ballots cast in the city election were marked with a check in the box beside the contestee's name. If the ballots marked with a check were counted, the contestee would win. If the ballots were rejected, the contestant would be the winner of the election. The court held that the general election provisions of N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 14-303, 56-720 (1941) were applicable to elections for municipal officers. As to the check marks, the court noted that there was no allegation of fraud. The court also noted the competing interests of voters' intent and ballot secrecy. However, the court rejected the minority view that upheld the intent of the voter. The court followed the majority view and concluded that the statutory provisions requiring a voter to mark a ballot by a cross were mandatory. N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 56-501 (1941) prohibited voters from placing a mark on a ballot that could later identify that voter. Interpreting the marking provisions as mandatory promoted ballot secrecy. The voter had to be held to strict performance. This also relieved voters from the consequences of election officials' failure to perform their statutory duties. The trial court did not err.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment in favor of the contestant that effectively declared the contestant the winner of the election was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

The Supreme Court, Lujan, J., held that the statute, providing for the punishment of all persons who, without the permission of the owner, skin or remove the hide from the carcass of neat cattle found dead, but exempting all employees of railroad company so doing when the animal was killed by the railroad company, was constitutional.  </SPAN></P>

The court noted that the grounds upon which the motion to quash was based were that the statute was unconstitutional because it discriminated against all persons except employees of railroad companies by whom cattle were killed. The court noted that the legislature could classify for legislative purposes without offending the constitutional requirement of equal protection of the laws as long as the classification was based upon some rational and substantial basis inherent in the subject matter or some difference in situation which distinguished those within the class from those without and which rationally justified different or unequal treatment. The court reversed the trial court's decision to quash the indictment and remanded the cause, holding that the statute's purpose was to prevent theft and protect the industry of stock raising and that the exemption of railroad employees was rationally related to the statute's purpose.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Middle Rio Grande Conservancy District brought proceedings against the Middle Rio Grande Water Users Association to determine validity of reclamation contract between the United States and the District.  The District Court of the Second Judicial District, sitting as Conservancy Court, Waldo H. Rogers, R. F. Deacon Arledge, and Edwin L. Swope, District Judges, entered judgment in favor of the District, and the Association appealed.  The Supreme Court, McGhee, J., held that contract is valid in all particulars, except as to provision giving Secretary of Interior power to withhold water from water user for failure to pay assessment declared irregular or void by Court of competent jurisdiction or as to which collection has been enjoined by any such court; and, except as to a 160 acre limitation imposed by contract.  The Supreme Court, Sadler, C. J., held the contract was valid in all particulars, save as to the powers conferred on the Secretary of the Interior on the conditions named.  Federici, D. J., dissented insofar as the court failed to approve the contract in toto.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, an association of agricultural water users (association) within appellee conservancy district (district), sought review of a judgment of the District Court of the Second Judicial District (New Mexico) sitting as Conservancy Court, which validated a contract between the district and the United States.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The district and the United States entered into a contract pursuant to N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 77-3101 through 77-3124 (1941) and the Reclamation Act, 43 U.S.C.S. &sect;&sect; 371-670. Under the contract, the irrigation and drainage system operated by the district would be conveyed to the United States, which would rehabilitate and extend it, with the cost reimbursed by the district over 40 years. The association challenged the contract and the New Mexico statutes, but the conservancy court found them valid and constitutional. On appeal, the court affirmed, with the exception of one contractual provision. That provision allowed the United States to deny water rights to any user whose assessment was judicially determined to be invalid. The court found that the contract could not override the right of a user to have his day in court. The court held that the conveyance to the United States was proper, as it was only for purposes of security, with reconveyance to be made upon payment. The court found that limitation of water delivery to those with vested rights to water in an amount that was more than sufficient to irrigate 160 acres was valid and constitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Suit was brought for declaratory judgment concerning constitutionality of statute authorizing county commissioners to purchase voting machines and to provide for payment thereof, in annual installments not exceeding ten years.  The District Court of Bernalillo County, R. F. Deacon Arledge, D. J., entered judgment holding statute unconstitutional, and defendants appealed.  The Supreme Court, Lujan, J., held that statute violates constitutional provision forbidding contraction of any debt for any purpose other than for erecting necessary public buildings or constructing or repairing public roads and bridges.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><BR><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">DISPOSITION:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Judgment affirmed.  <BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant Board of Commissioners of Bernalillo County appealed a judgment of the District Court of Bernalillo County (New Mexico) that held that 1951 N.M. Laws ch. 192 was unconstitutional. Plaintiff voting-machine corporation had brought the case under N.M. Comp. Stat. &sect; 25-601 (1941) as one for a declaratory judgment on constitutionality. The corporation had entered into a contract with the Board for voting machines.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The error committed by the trial court as presented on appeal was that it had mistakenly ruled that as a matter of law the contract between the corporation and the Board was null and void because 1951 N.M. Laws ch. 192 contravened the N.M. Const. art. 9, &sect; 10. According to the court, the N.M. Const. art. 9, &sect; 10 indubitably prohibited a county from the contracting of any debt for any purpose except the erection of necessary public buildings or the construction or repair of public roads and bridges and then only after a proposition to incur such debt was submitted to the qualified county electors and approved by a majority of those voting on it. Ergo, the court ruled that the Board did not have authority to bind the County of Bernalillo by a contract with the corporation for voting machines to be provided by the corporation for the use of the County.</SPAN></P>

The District Court, Lea County, George T. Harris, D. J., overruled defendant's motion to quash information, and defendant appealed.  The Supreme Court, Lujan, J., held that statute, which authorizes real estate board to issue real estate broker's licenses and which provides for punishment of persons, corporations, and associations but not for firms, partnerships, and copartnerships, for violations of statute, is not unconstitutional on ground that it fails to provide penalties equally applicable to all persons coming within its prohibition.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the District Court of Lea County (New Mexico), which overruled defendant's motion to quash the information filed against him by the State for engaging in business as real estate broker without first obtaining a license, in violation of 1951 N.M.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant had engaged in the real estate business for eight years but never had a real estate broker's license in New Mexico. The court held that the Act was constitutional. The Act was not an unconstitutional delegation of legislative power because it had to be presumed that the board would exercise fairly and impartially the powers conferred and its regulations did not determine what the law should be. The Act did not deny equal protection by exempting those already licensed from taking the examination. Such persons, who had rights already recognized by the law, were not similarly situated with those who had a mere hope or expectation of embarking in the same calling at a future date. The business of real estate broker was one properly subject to police regulation, and in the exercise of its police power the State could require that all applicants be honest, trustworthy, and of good moral character and reputation before a license was issued to them to engage in business. The Act did not deny equal protection by not prescribing a penalty for partnerships, which were not recognized as separate from their component members, insofar as criminal responsibility was concerned.</SPAN></P>

The Act granted lands to the state in trust and restricted the use of money derived therefrom to certain specified purposes, most of which were for the benefit of specific educational and penal institutions. The state accepted the grants with such restrictions by the terms of N.M. Const. art. 21, &sect;&sect; 9, 10. Acting on orders of the state board of finance and the state auditor, the state treasurer diverted certain sums from the fund created pursuant to the Act to the general fund, where the funds became intermingled.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Action by Jack Fowler, doing business as the Santa Fe Beverage Company, against Charles H. Corlett, as Commissioner of Revenue, and another for a declaratory judgment determining the constitutionality of an act amending the act relating to funds for the Commission on Alcoholism.  From a judgment of the District Court, Sante Fe County, David W. Carmody, J., sustaining the constitutionality of the amendatory act, plaintiff appealed.  The Supreme Court, Sadler, J., held that the amendatory act is not unconstitutional as not expressing or embracing its subject-matter in its title, delegating the Legislature's taxing power to the State Revenue Bureau, incorporating provisions of the Liquor Control Act by reference to its title only, denying due process and equal protection of laws, or providing for double taxation.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant businessman sought review of a judgment from the District Court, Santa Fe County (New Mexico), in favor of appellee Commissioner of Revenue in the businessman's declaratory judgment action regarding the constitutionality of 1951 N.M. Laws ch. 218. The trial court ruled that ch. 218 was constitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the businessman contended that ch. 218 was unconstitutional because its subject matter was not expressed or embraced in its title and that this failure contravened the requirements of the N.M. Const. art. 4, &sect; 16. The court ruled that the title of 1951 N.M. Laws ch. 218 left no doubt as to its purpose and thus satisfied the chief purpose of N.M. Const. art. 4, &sect; 16, which was to prevent the legislature from being defrauded or surprised by means of hidden or concealed provisions of bills. The court rejected another asserted basis of invalidity for ch. 218, i.e., that it amounted to an illegal delegation to the Bureau of Revenue of the taxing power of the legislature. The court further rejected a challenge to ch. 218 asserted on the basis of vagueness. The court commented that, if the businessman truly did not understand what the term &quot;alcoholic beverage&quot; meant, the court declined to enlighten him. The court found no due process violation or double taxation because the levy imposed a blanket tax against all alcoholic beverages. No group or class was taxed to the exclusion of any other group or class.</SPAN></P>

Bowling, if living, or if deceased, his unknown heirs, and all unknown claimants of interests adverse to plaintiffs' estate in certain land, to quiet title thereto.  Mary E. Gardner and others intervened as heirs of James T. Bowling, deceased.  From a judgment of the District Court, Rio Arriba County, Edwin L.

The heirs contended that the wife, who was a rural school teacher, was an employee of the state and was barred by N.M. Comp. Laws &sect; 76-707 (1941) from purchasing property from the state. The trial court held that deed from the State Tax Commission to the husband and wife should be declared to be void and that title of the heirs be quieted when the husband and wife had been reimbursed for all monies paid by them for the property and for the value of improvements made. The court held that the wife was not a county employee prohibited by &sect; 76-707 from purchasing from the State Tax Commission land sold to the State for delinquent taxes. The court noted that it was error to find that the wife, as a school teacher was an employee of a county and the State, as the finding was not supported by any substantial evidence.</SPAN></P>

Bliss, State Engineer, brought separate suits against Bert Troy Dority, Loman Wiley, and S. A. Lanning, Jr., to enjoin defendants from unlawfully using water drawn from the Roswell Artesian Basin and valley fill above it, which plaintiff asserted were subject to appropriation.  The suits were consolidated for trial.  The District Court, Chaves County, C. Roy Anderson, J., entered a decree adverse to defendants, and defendants appealed.  The Supreme Court, Brice, C. J., held, inter alia, that artesian water and underground reservoir in valley fill overlying such artesian basin, were reserved on or before date Desert Land Act became effective, to state as trustee for public, and were subject to use by public at any time thereafter by authority of state statutes, even though passed after date of patents to land of defendants.  </SPAN></P>

The trial court held in favor of the state and entered a decree enjoining the users from using the water basin. The users appealed the decree enjoining them from using unappropriated water, arguing that they had a vested interest in the title to the water under their lands. The court ruled that the public waters of the state were owned by the state as trustee for the people and that the state was authorized to institute suits to protect the public waters against unlawful use. Further, the court held that waters of underground rivers with defined banks were subject to appropriation and that all water that could be used for irrigation was reserved to be used beneficially by the public. The court affirmed the decree enjoining the users, concluding that the water involved was reserved to the state as trustee for the public.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">W. A. Strawn and others sued John W. Russell and others to enjoin consolidation of two rural school districts and to adjudge resolutions of the Roosevelt County Board of Education and the State Board of Education, recommending and directing the consolidation, arbitrary and unreasonable.  From a judgment of the District Court, Roosevelt County, E. T. Hensley, Jr., J., dismissing the petition for an injunction, plaintiffs appealed.  The Supreme Court, McGhee, J., held that the boards' actions were not arbitrary or unreasonable and that the order of consolidation was not unconstitutional as denying some pupils of the two districts a free school by creating such a large district that they could not go to school and back home each day.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, residents and taxpayers, challenged a judgment of the District Court of Roosevelt County (New Mexico) dismissing their action against appellees, Roosevelt County Board of Education and the State Board of Education, seeking to enjoin the boards from consolidating two rural school districts. Appellants contended that the consolidation resolutions were arbitrary and unreasonable.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Due mostly to the increase in farm sizes in the rural districts, the number of students had decreased as families farmed larger and larger plots. Resulting cuts in school budgets had reduced the number of teachers and those remaining were required to teach more classes. The boards decided that the two districts would be consolidated. The residents and taxpayers filed an action to enjoin consolidation, and the trial court denied to grant their injunction. On appeal the court held, as an initial matter, that the boards had been given authority in effecting consolidation, and absent arbitrariness or unreasonableness, the decision of the boards could not be overturned. The court further held that while the extended bus trips of students in the new district was unfortunate, because it did not make it impossible to go to and return from school in one day, the consolidation was not unreasonable. The court noted that N.M. Const. art. 12, &sect; 1 required a uniform system of education, free to all school-aged children, but that the consolidation did not violate that requirement.</SPAN></P>

The bus company argued that N.M. Comp. Stat. &sect; 14-3501 (1941) did not control over city charter provisions for referendum elections and that &sect; 14-3501 was invalid under N.M. Const. art. IV, &sect; 16.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">By ordinance, the city granted the bus company a franchise to operate over its streets for a specified term. When the term ended, more than 10 percent of the city's adult residents petitioned to hold a referendum election on the franchise. The city ordered an election and directed the bus company to cover the expenses. The bus company challenged the petition on the ground that Albuquerque, N.M., City Charter &sect; 2, art. 3 required that a petition be signed by 20 percent of the city's adult residents. A delegation of power to cities to grant franchises was strictly construed in favor of the public. N.M. Comp. Stat. &sect; 14-3501 (1941) was a special act that applied to all municipalities, whether organized under general or special laws. The court held that the referendum provisions of &sect; 14-3501 that dealt specially with popular referenda on franchise ordinances prevailed over the referendum provisions of the city charter, which applied to ordinances generally and not to franchise ordinances specifically. The title of &sect; 14-3501 was sufficiently clear and did not violate N.M. Const. art. IV, &sect; 16, because it stated that it was amending a prior statute that related to franchises.</SPAN></P>

Stat. Ann. &sect; 44-116 (Supp. 1941). The information was dismissed on the ground that &sect; 44-116 was so vague as to render it null and void.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with contributing to the delinquency of a minor by having sexual intercourse with her. The court disagreed that N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 44-116 (Supp. 1941) was vague. Section 44-116 proscribed an act or omission that caused or tended to cause or encourage the delinquency of persons under 18 years of age but did not specify or define the particular act or omission that constituted the offense. The court found that the common sense of the community and the sense of decency and morality that most people entertained were sufficient t point out what particular conduct was criminal under &sect; 44-116. The indelicacy of the subject prevented a particular definition of what constituted the crime. The district court took notice that the juvenile court had exclusive jurisdiction over the offense under N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 44-102 (Supp. 1941). The court held that that portion of &sect; 44-102 was unconstitutional and void. When the legislature made the offense a felony, it automatically placed cases arising under it for trial in district courts. Under N.M. Const. art. VI, &sect;&sect; 13, 23, the legislature had no authority to divest the district courts of jurisdiction over felony offenses.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Informant, an unsuccessful candidate in a primary election for the democratic nomination for district court judge, brought mandamus proceedings against respondent individuals, the governor, chief justice of the state supreme court, and the secretary of state, who comprised the State Board of Canvassers of the State of New Mexico; and the Board itself, to command respondents to recanvass the election returns.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The candidate had originally been declared the winner, but, after a recount, the Board certified his opponent as having the most votes. The candidate sought another recount and claimed that this recount should exclude all return from portions of a certain precinct, which had been acquired by the United States through condemnation proceedings and incorporated what was commonly known as the &quot;Los Alamos Project.&quot; He claimed that the area at issue was not &quot;in New Mexico&quot; within the meaning of N.M. Const. art. VII, &sect; 1. The court concluded that part of the land acquired by the federal government for the Los Alamos Project was under exclusive federal jurisdiction and so was not in New Mexico for purposes of elector qualifications, but that part remained within New Mexico for the purpose of determining elector eligibility. However, the polling places within the Project were all outside of New Mexico, and that fact was fatal to the validity of the election. Those residents affected could cast their ballots elsewhere or vote by absentee ballot, but it was up to the county board of commissioners to relocate the polling places. The court made permanent the alternative writ of mandamus.</SPAN></P>

Laws Ch. 48 was unconstitutional insofar as it authorized a county to issue general obligation bonds for the purpose of equipping a county hospital and isolation wards, and for the purchase of necessary land therefor. The court held the phrase &quot;erecting necessary public buildings&quot; as used in N.M. Const. art. 9, &sect; 10 included within its purview the construction of a county hospital with isolation ward, equipping such hospital and isolation ward, and acquiring the land therefor. It was the court's duty to interpret the constitution to carry out the constitution, not giving it an overly technical reading to destroy what was intended. The power to erect a necessary public building included the implied power to purchase the necessary land on which to erect it, and to equip it so that it could be used for the purpose for which it is built.</SPAN></P>

The tax was based on the gross receipts of the mine. The trial court dismissed the mining company's action. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that: (1) the tax was constitutional because it was not a direct tax on interstate commerce, and it did not unduly burden interstate commerce; (2) the tax did not constitute a burden upon or an interference with the United States' authority to coin money or regulate the value of money: (3) neither the Gold Reserve Act of 1934, 48 Stat. 337, or U.S. Const. art.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Section 41-4519 provided that any person in the possession of the property of another, who converted such property to his own use, was guilty of embezzlement. It expressly repealed a prior statute that provided that a person who fraudulently converted property that had been entrusted to him to his own use was guilty of larceny. The information charged that defendant fraudulently converted money with which he had been entrusted, which did not belong to him. The information was quashed as unconstitutional and void, and defendant was released. On review, the court first concluded that &sect; 41-4519 was unconstitutional because it did not refer to entrustment and fraudulent appropriation, which were essential elements of embezzlement. However, the court then held that because &sect; 41-4519 failed in its purpose to define the crime of embezzlement, its repealing clause failed as well, and the previous statute remained in effect. Furthermore, the information sufficiently advised defendant of the offense charged. Therefore, the court held that the trial court erred in dismissing defendant, reversed the trial court's judgment, and directed the trial court to reinstate the case on its docket.</SPAN></P>

Defendants argued that the order to arbitrate was not final because they did not agree to binding arbitration and that the order was unconstitutional because it deprived them of their right to a jury trial. The court dismissed the appeal, which was filed 16 months after entry of the arbitration order. The trial court delegated resolution of the merits to the arbitration process, divesting itself of any further power to address the issues of law or fact presented by the case, rendering the order final and only appealable within 30 days of its entry. Because the order was final, defendants were also obligated to appeal to preserve their right to jury trial.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appeal was dismissed. Order compelling arbitration was a final order from which defendants failed to timely appeal within 30 days, postponing their appeal until after an arbitration award was rendered against them.

The trial court denied his request, holding that the concurrence of appellee, the state, was required. Appellant challenged, arguing that the concurrence of appellee was not necessary.

Neither &sect; 32A-2-16(A) nor N.M. Child Ct. R. 10-228 (1999) afforded appellee the right to concur or object to appellant's waiver of a jury trial. Nor did N.M. Const. art.

Defendant was also convicted of bribery or intimidation of a witness, under N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 30-24-3(A)(3) (1997). On appeal, the court found there was fundamental error in the jury instruction and reversed and remanded for the intimidation conviction. Because the trial court did not submit special verdict forms to the jury, defendant was acquitted of all the felony charges except threatening a witness, and it was impossible to determine whether the jury found each of the essential elements of &sect; 30-24-3(A)(3).

Plaintiffs claimed the trial court erred in finding plaintiff driver caused the accident due to his loss of consciousness prior to impact, and in failing to accept plaintiffs' evidence disputing the blackout.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that plaintiffs' auto negligence suit was properly dismissed where plaintiff driver's depositional testimony proved plaintiff driver's blackout prior to impact proximately caused the accident, and where plaintiffs' summary judgment evidence was rejected as untimely and unverified. Plaintiff driver was injured in auto accident involving defendant trucking company's truck. On defendants' motion for summary judgment, plaintiff driver presented his affidavit alleging he did not blackout prior to the accident, but suffered a loss of memory regarding the accident. Plaintiff driver also submitted a police report to this effect. The trial court granted summary judgment to defendants, determining that plaintiff driver's blackout proximately caused the accident. Plaintiffs brought a motion to reconsider, which the trial court denied. The court affirmed, holding that the trial court properly excluded plaintiff driver's affidavit and the police report where they were untimely submitted and the police report was unverified. As admission of the untimely deposition testimony would not change the result, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in granting defendants' motion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff took an emergency position with a state university as a basketball coach. A year later, plaintiff re-applied and was rehired in the same position. Plaintiff did not have an express, written contract of employment, but instead claimed certain rights as an employee under the employment manual. The key dispute was whether plaintiff was still a probationary employee at the time of his termination. A decision denying summary judgment to defendant athletic director on the ground of qualified immunity in plaintiff's suit under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 was reversed and remanded. Plaintiff did not have a clearly established right to continued employment. He was hired under emergency procedures designed to fill an urgent need. There was nothing in the manual providing a probationary period for emergency hires or clearly indicating that the two overlapped. Defendant may reasonably have been entitled to believe that plaintiff's time as an emergency hire did not eliminate the need for a probationary status. Individual provisions within the manual were arguably inconsistent and contradictory. Affidavits did not create a genuine issue of material fact sufficient to defeat summary judgment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed and remanded for entry of summary judgment on defendant's qualified immunity claim because plaintiff's alleged property interest in continued employment under the employment manual was not clearly established at the time of his discharge.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were elected members of a five-member board that had passed a resolution that one board member would be elected the chair and vote only in a tie.

Had the chair been permitted to vote on the matter, the vote would have been two-to-two and the variances would not have been approved. A decision dismissing plaintiffs' suit alleging that the voting resolution violated U.S. Const. amend. XIV was affirmed. Defendants failed to show that the suit was dismissed for failure to join an indispensable party. The resolution lacked any obvious discriminatory purpose. Plaintiffs demonstrated no severe restriction upon their fundamental rights. There was no evidence that the classification burdened a sensitive but not suspect class. The rule imposed only reasonable, nondiscriminatory restrictions. The resolution allowed the business of county government to be conducted in an organized and efficient manner.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After criminal defendant was convicted of concealing identity in violation of N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 30-22-3 (1963), he appealed. On appeal, the court consolidated defendant's variety of issues into four groups: (1) whether the district court correctly interpreted the requirements of &sect; 30-22-3; (2) whether there was sufficient evidence to convict; (3) whether his constitutional rights were violated; and (4) whether jurisdiction was proper. The court affirmed conviction and sentence because the law required a person to show identification or, if he had reasonable concern as to the validity of the request, to show identification so soon as not to cause substantial inconvenience or expense to the police. The evidence sufficed for the trial court to find that officers were acting in the legal performance of their duties. The court noted that shortcomings in the discovery process did not affect jurisdiction. To the extent that defendant believed that &sect; 30-22-3 was vague in other respects, he failed to elaborate on his challenge.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, a Native American school board and two private gasoline distributors, sought review of the denial of their request for a refund of state gas taxes. Appellants brought their suit under the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act of 1975 (Act), 25 U.S.C.S. &sect;&sect; 450-458, claiming that the statute preempted a state gas tax law. The lower court denied appellants a refund of the gas taxes. The appellate court found that the Act did not specifically preempt the state gas taxes, but that the taxes were preempted by virtue of the fact that the state law would not impose the taxes on a federal agency performing the same services as appellant school board. The court found that the purpose of the Act was to permit Native American tribes to take over the education of tribal children from the federal government. As such, appellant school board was entitled to the same exemption from taxation as the federal government.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed a judgment which ordered appellant city to grant appellee's requested zoning change from residential to commercial. The district court found that appellant's decision to deny the requested zoning change was not supported by substantial evidence and thereafter issued a writ of mandamus ordering appellant to determine a new zoning category for the lots at issue. Appellant contended on appeal that the district court exceeded its scope of review for a zoning appeal and that substantial evidence supported its zoning decision. The court agreed, holding that the district court was not authorized to overturn a rejection of a petition for a zoning change and then order appellant to rezone. In particular, a district court could not prescribe what zoning would be applied to a particular property. Further, N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 3-21-9(D) was unconstitutional to the extent that it purported to allow a district court to zone land. Finally, the district court could not issue a writ of mandamus to interfere with appellant's legitimate exercise of its authority to act on the application after the district court reversed appellant's zoning decision.</SPAN></P>

The District Court of Otero County (New Mexico) denied his motion to suppress evidence seized as a result of a warrantless search of his automobile by agents of the United States Border Patrol at a fixed checkpoint in the state and convicted him of the charge.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant asserted that the failure to exclude the evidence violated his rights under N.M. Const. art. II, &sect; 10 because the state failed to make a particularized showing of exigent circumstances. The state asserted that there was no state action. The court held that under N.M. Const. art. II, &sect; 10, the requirement of exigent circumstances for a warrantless vehicle search applied to a federal border patrol agent's search at a state checkpoint. The court also held that it would defer to the border patrol agent's judgment if reasonable people might differ about whether exigent circumstances were present. Defendant claimed that there were no exigent circumstances because his person and his vehicle could have been secured while the agents sought a search warrant. The court rejected this argument because physically restraining defendant pending the issuance of a search warrant would not be any less intrusive than conducting an immediate search and because an extended investigatory stop could become a suspect de facto arrest. The court held that there was an objectively reasonable basis for the agents to believe that there were exigent circumstances justifying the warrantless search.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of a judgment and sentence of the District Court Of Bernalillo County (New Mexico), which convicted defendant of stalking, harassment, and two counts of criminal trespass.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was indicted for stalking and a separate charge of harassment; and the same pattern of conduct was used to prove both crimes. The issues on appeal were: (1) whether defendant's convictions for stalking and harassment violated double jeopardy; (2) whether the criminal harassment statute,&nbsp;N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 30-3A-2 (1993), was unconstitutionally vague; (3) whether the convictions were supported by sufficient evidence; and (4) whether he was denied due process of law because of the trial judge's alleged bias. The court reversed the convictions in part. In so ruling, the court determined that (1) a comparison of the offenses of harassment and stalking had failed to clearly indicate that the legislature intended that the same unitary conduct underlying the charges of harassment and stalking be punished as distinct offenses; and (2) the intent required to be proven for both crimes overlapped in part. The court concluded that the harassment offense was subsumed into the misdemeanor stalking offense. On remand, the court directed the trial court to resentence defendant. The court found that no other reversible error was committed and the convictions were otherwise affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's convictions of stalking, harassment, and two counts of criminal trespass were affirmed in part.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The county adopted a zoning ordinance at the time the land in question was owned and managed by the United States, prohibiting the land from being used for mineral extraction activities. The land was later conveyed to the property owner, which filed a complaint seeking a declaratory judgment that the land was not zoned. The trial court granted the county's motion for summary judgment, ruling that the ordinance applied to the land. On appeal, the court reversed. The court noted that the county had the power to zone federally-owned land. However, the ordinance in question excluded land owned by the state or federal government. The county conceded that it only intended to zone privately-owned land when it adopted the ordinance. The court rejected the county's argument that when the land passed into private ownership the ordinance took effect. The court held that the land became unzoned when it became private property. In order to zone it, the county had to meet the notice requirements of N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 3-21-6(B). The original notice was not adequate to apprise the average citizen that the county intended the ordinance to apply to federally-owned land that passed into private hands.</SPAN></P>

Both parties alleged that the trial court's custody and support order was final.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A final decree between the father and the mother was entered by the trial court incorporating the provisions of a marital settlement agreement, including specific religious lifestyle provisions. One year later, the mother sought a modification of the custody arrangement, sanctions, and attorney fees. Although there were numerous subsequent motions between the parties raising new issues and requesting new relief, the trial court only entered two subsequent orders - the final of which was under appeal. The court dismissed the appeal and ruled that it lacked jurisdiction over the case. The court found that the appealed order, although designated as &quot;final and appealable&quot; and containing findings of facts and conclusions of law, did not contain required decretal language or provisions directing the entry of judgment. Moreover, the order did not address a number of claims raised in the parties' motions. Because the resolved claims were so intertwined with the issues held in abeyance and remaining to be resolved and because the order was not designated as a N.M. R. Civ. P. Dist. Ct. 1-054(C)(1) &quot;no just reason for delay&quot; appeal, appellate review was premature.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court dismissed the father's appeal for lack of jurisdiction over the trial court's decision that was not yet final.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The father pleaded guilty to criminal sexual penetration of a child. The victim gave birth to a baby girl and executed a relinquishment and consent to adoption. Subsequently, the agency filed a petition to terminate the father's parental rights. The trial court granted summary judgment to the agency. On appeal, the court found that the father did not acquire a fundamental right to withhold consent to the adoption because he committed criminal sexual penetration of a minor. The court determined that N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 32A-5-19(C) was rationally related to the state's legitimate interest in protecting children and preventing their exploitation. The court held that the father was not entitled to a evidentiary hearing because there was no requirement for obtaining the consent of a biological father of a child conceived as a result of rape. The court also held that the father had no standing to assert that his parents (the paternal grandparents) were not provided with notice of the proceedings to terminate his parental rights. The court concluded that the father failed to demonstrate the existence of any material, disputed factual issues which would preclude an award of summary judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The school district filed a petition in the trial court to condemn certain property. A trust owned a portion of the land sought by the school district. The trustee challenged the adequacy of the condemnation offer, and the trial court awarded the trust an additional amount. Although the trustee accepted a check payable to the trust, the trustee appealed the judgment, and the school district cross-appealed. Upon review, the court denied the trustee's appeal and affirmed the school district's cross-appeal. The court held that none of the exceptions to the general rule that a party waived his right to appeal when he accepted the benefits of a judgment applied to the trustee because, when the trustee accepted the full amount of the judgment and not just the advance deposit made by the school district, the trustee waived his right to appeal under &sect; 42-2-6(B). The court stated that the statute's language regarding &quot;advance deposits&quot; did not apply to the final judgment. The court found that delivery of a cashier's check was for payment in full and that the school district had no cause to move to dismiss the trustee's appeal until the trustee actually filed his notice of appeal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A student at school within the school district complained that her ring was missing. School officials conducted strip searches of two students, one of which required the student to be partially nude, and the other required the student to strip to his undergarments. Students filed a 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 action for damages. The trial court found in favor of the students, and awarded compensatory and punitive damages. School officials appealed, arguing they were precluded from judgment because of qualified immunity. The school district appealed, arguing that insufficient evidence and evidentiary errors warranted reversal of the trial court's judgment. The court held that the judgment entered against the school district was proper because it should have known that its custom of strip searching its students without individualized reasonable suspicion was improper and that it should have trained its employees to conduct searches only after a determination of individualized reasonable suspicion. As for the school officials, the court held that they could be relieved of liability if their conduct did not violate clearly established rights of which a reasonable person would have known.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the act of making arrangements to pay a court reporter for deposition services did not involve the rendering of a service that required the use of legal knowledge or skill and therefore the statute did not unconstitutionally regulate the practice of law. The court held that &sect; 36-2-13.1(A) did not conflict with attorney rule of conduct, N.M. R. Prof. Conduct 16-108(E)(1) (1997), which provided that the client was ultimately liable for the costs and expenses of litigation. The court held that there was no conflict of interest involved in the lawyer's subsequent action to recover these fees from the client.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The client retained an attorney to represent him in a driver's license revocation proceeding before the department.

The department revoked the client's driver's license. The district court overturned the revocation on the ground that &sect; 10-16-8(C) was an unconstitutional usurpation of the judiciary's authority to regulate the conduct of attorneys. On appeal, the court reversed the decision, holding that &sect; 10-16-8(C) did not violate separation of powers principles. Section 10-16-8(C) prohibited a former government employee from representing persons before his former employer for pay for a period of one year. The court found that the statute was rationally related to the state's interest of enhancing public trust by prohibiting any conflicts of interest. Further, the court held that attorneys were not expressly excluded from the definition of public employee. The court also held that N.M.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The husband served in the military during their marriage and retired therefrom fifteen years subsequent to the parties' divorce. The divorce decree divided property but was silent as to military retirement benefits. After the husband retired, the wife petitioned the trial court to divide what she alleged was her undivided community interest in the military retirement pay that her husband was then receiving. The basis for the wife's action was N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40-4-20, which provided a party the right to seek a division and distribution of previously undivided property in a separate proceeding after the divorce. The court reversed. The court found that the Uniform Services Former Spouses' Protection Act barred the application of state law in cases where a divorce decree, entered prior to a particular U. S. Supreme Court decision, did not contain specific language that treated, or reserved jurisdiction to treat, military retirement pay as the property of a service member and his former spouse. Thus, the wife could not utilize &sect; 40-4-20 to obtain a share of the military pension because the parties' final decree of divorce was entered prior to the Supreme Court's decision.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The residents claimed that the commission's hearing to consider annexation was improper because the commission did not publish notice as set forth in the general definitional section of N.M.

The court reversed the order for a new hearing after determining that the order was appealable under the doctrine of practical finality, and affirmed the commission's decision to annex. The court found that the commission gave adequate notice because it complied with the specific notice statute of N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 3-7-14(B) (1965). The specific statute was controlling over the general statute and was consistent with the legislative purpose of extending notice to persons who lived outside the municipality's boundaries, but likely had an interest in the proposed annexation. The court also found that the commission acted with a proper quorum because under N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 3-7-12(A), any two members constituted a majority and thus a quorum of the three-member commission.</SPAN></P>

Ann. &sect; 41-5-1 to 29 (1976, as amended through 1992) (Act), the father submitted a written application to the panel regarding his intention to bring a medical malpractice action, pro se, against certain health care providers. The panel instructed the father to obtain counsel. The father's suit sought to have the panel's interpretation of the Act requiring attorney representation declared unconstitutional. The panel filed a motion to dismiss the suit because the father was practicing law without a license. The trial court ruled that the father's actions were not an unauthorized practice of law, but that the father's suit was premature. The court affirmed in part and reversed in part, and held that: (1) N.M. R. Civ. P. Dist. Ct. 1-017(C) had no effect on the regulation of the practice of law; (2) the father was not acting pro se, but representing his child's interests, which was an unauthorized practice of law; and (3) the case was remanded for the trial court to appoint an attorney to represent the child before the panel, instead of affirming the trial court as right for the wrong reasons, because the statute of limitations had run.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the conviction and sentence for CSP II that resulted in personal injury, but it reversed the other convictions and remanded the case. In doing so, the court held that it was not persuaded that the legislature intended multiple punishments for the same offense or that the legislature intended to punish every CSP that resulted from force and restraint as a second-degree felony.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An Indian tribe, which was exempt from property tax, leased its land for 99 years to a corporation, which leased two lots to the taxpayers. The taxpayers claimed that they were exempt from property taxes, and the board rejected the taxpayers' claim. The taxpayers appealed, and the court affirmed the decision of the board. The court held that the master lease was not a fractional interest under N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 7-36-4(A)(1) (1978) because the term of the lease was for more than 75 years. The court looked at the original term of the lease and not the time remaining under the lease. The court held that the classification under &sect; 7-36-4 had a rational basis, which satisfied the constitutional requirements. The court ruled that the record established neither a disproportionate effect on Indians nor a discriminatory intent or purpose so there was no equal protection violation. The court held that the N.M. Stat. &sect;&sect; 1048, 1069 (1905) did not apply because the leasehold interest was the property of the taxpayers.

Ann. &sect;&sect; 40-13-1 to 40-13-8, and an order dismissing her paternity action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother was the subject of a Protection Act action brought by the father many months after an alleged minor incident. The district court nevertheless issued an order giving custody to the paternal grandmother. Later, while the mother was in custody as a delinquent, she filed a paternity action, which the district court dismissed as res judicata based on the Protection Act proceedings. The grandmother then sought to adopt the child. The mother filed a motion under N.M. R. Civ. P. Dist. Ct. 1-060(B) and contended that both orders were void. The court affirmed the denial of the Rule 1-060(B) motion. Because the Protection Act order automatically expired six months after issuance, and because reopening the order would give the mother no actual relief and would have no impact on the adoption or custody situation, the court agreed that the Protection Act order should not be reopened. The court found the district court correct in not reopening the paternity order because considering that the district court had both personal and subject matter jurisdiction, the paternity order was not void, but merely erroneous for its res judicata determination.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The pharmacist spoke to a drug inspector requesting that he investigate what the pharmacist suspected were forged prescriptions. The drug inspector reviewed the pharmacist's prescription records looking for forgeries. The pharmacist fully cooperated with the inspector. The drug inspector confirmed 150 forged prescriptions. Although under state law the drug inspector had the power to make an arrest, he made no effort to place the pharmacist under arrest. The drug inspector was called to testify before the grand jury that subsequently indicted the pharmacist on a number of drug-related charges. All charges were later dismissed. The pharmacist filed suit against the drug inspector and the assistant district attorney under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983. The jury awarded the pharmacist damages for violation of his civil rights. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded with instructions to enter judgment for defendant. The court opined that the case, as presented to the jury, fell somewhere in between unconstitutional arrest and unconstitutional malicious prosecution. The court held that the case failed to satisfy either theory or to establish the deprivation of a right secured to the pharmacist.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Upon her return home, defendant discovered that her husband had given two people permission to stay in her home. The state alleged that defendant chased the two people away with an ax and then broke the windows, windshield, and headlights and damaged the engine of their employer's pickup. The trial court dismissed the state's charge against defendant on the ground that defendant could only have been charged under a specific statute,&nbsp;N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect;66-3-506 (1994), injuring or tampering with a vehicle, and not under a general statute,&nbsp;&sect; 30-15-1 criminal damage to property. On appeal, the court reversed the trial court's decision. The court held that &sect; 30-15-1 did not include the same matter as &sect; 66-3-506. Under &sect; 30-15-1 the state had to prove that the amount of damage exceeded $ 1000. Under &sect; 66-3-506 the state had to prove that the property damaged was a motor vehicle. Thus, each statute included an element that the other did not, and therefore, the general/specific rule was inapplicable.

Plaintiffs cross-appealed on the issue of whether the tort claim damages cap under N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 41-4-19 was constitutional. The court dismissed plaintiffs' cross-appeal on the grounds that the parties had stipulated that if the cap were found unconstitutional in further hearings, the case would be reopened and because plaintiffs failed to preserve the issue regarding application of the cap.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a decision of the District Court of Bernalillo County (New Mexico) imposing an additional 60 days of confinement pursuant to N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 66-8-102(F)(2) (1978 &amp; Repl. Pamp. 1994), based on defendant's refusal to submit to a chemical breath alcohol test, following defendant's guilty plea to a charge of aggravated driving while intoxicated (DWI).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pleaded guilty to aggravated DWI. The basis for the aggravation was defendant's refusal to submit to a chemical test that would determine the alcohol concentration of his breath. The district court imposed a sentence that included an additional 60-day minimum mandatory confinement. He appealed the sentence contending that &sect; 66-8-102(F)(2) was unconstitutional. The court disagreed and affirmed the district court's decision. The court held that the provision did not violate defendant's Sixth Amendment right to counsel because the issuance of a citation for DWI did not amount to the initiation of criminal proceedings in which presence of counsel was required. The court ruled that the right to refuse an alcohol test had no constitutional implications. Thus, the statutory penalty arising from a refusal to take the test did not offend notions of fairness and due process. The court concluded that defendant's failure to cooperate or give his assent to a breath test did not create a legal right where one otherwise did not exist.</SPAN></P>

The court determined that it was not only permissible but necessary for the employee to bear the burden of presenting the facts he claimed mitigated or explained his behavior. Under the particular procedural facts of the case, the court concluded that the employee should bear the burden of producing that evidence and of persuading the hearing officer of its validity. The court further held that there was no violation of constitutional due process when a statute, ordinance, or rule provides that a public agency's decision to terminate or otherwise discipline an employee should be affirmed by a personnel board unless the employee persuaded the board that the agency decision was incorrect.</SPAN></P>

The trial court found that a truck engine bearing an altered vehicle identification number (VIN) was contraband and subject to forfeiture by the state police. The driver appealed and the court affirmed. The court held that under New Mexico law, the driver who was in possession of an engine having an altered VIN had the burden to overcome the presumption that the engine was contraband and as such subject to forfeiture to the state. The driver could not produce documents that provided evidence of his title to the engine through its intermediate owners to the manufacturer.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee union complained that a directive constituted a practice prohibited by the Public Employee Bargaining Act (PEBA), N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 10-7D-1 to -26 and the Las Cruces, N.M., Ordinance ch. 16.5 (1993) (ordinance). The local board of labor management relations (board) ruled in favor of the union. Appellant city sought review to the District Court of Dona Ana County (New Mexico), which affirmed the board's decision. The city appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A fire chief issued a directive forbidding union organizational activities in any fire department facility. The union complained that the directive was unconstitutional, and judgment was rendered in its favor. The city appealed and contended that the union's complaint to the board was untimely, the board's decision was incorrect, and the city did not receive a fair hearing before the board due to the bias of the board's chairperson. The court affirmed the decision of the district court. The court found that the filing of the complaint was timely and also agreed that &quot;duty hours&quot; was the time during which fire fighters were required to be performing job duties. If the city were to enforce the no-solicitation mandate of the ordinance as it interpreted the language, it would have been engaging in an employer practice ordinarily prohibited by the PEBA and by other provisions of the ordinance. Thus, the no-solicitation directive was not authorized by the ordinance and was a prohibited employer practice. The court found no impropriety in the chairman's questioning. The questions were intelligent, respectful, phrased in a fair manner, and pertinent to issues to be decided at the hearing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the District Court of Curry County (New Mexico), which convicted him of concealing his identity in violation of N.M.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was stopped for speeding and refused to produce a driver's license. The officer asked for his address, date of birth, and social security number, but defendant would only give his name. On appeal, defendant argued that this did not constitute concealing his identity under N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 30-22-3 (1978, Repl. Pamp. 1994), that the evidence was insufficient, and that the statute was vague. The court affirmed the conviction. Because the statute made it an offense to conceal one's name or identity and because all drivers in New Mexico were required to carry driver's licenses, the court concluded that the officer could seek more than just defendant's name and could request the information contained on a driver's license. The court found substantial evidence that defendant was concealing his identity because a jury could have reasonably inferred from defendant's conduct that he intended to hinder the officer. Considering that the statute was sufficiently definite in the context of a motor vehicle stop and required proof of specific intent and that the statute limited the officer's inquiry, the court determined that the statute was not impermissibly vague.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The worker was injured while working for the employer. After she was injured, but before she filed her workers' compensation claim, she began working for the WCA. Because she worked for the WCA, her case was reassigned to a mediator pro tem. The worker and the employer rejected a series of pro tem judges until finally one was appointed to which neither party objected. That pro tem judge issued a ruling dismissing the worker's claim. The worker argued that the WCA had neither the statutory nor constitutional authority to appoint a WCJ pro tem to hear her case. The court noted that, although the issue was not raised below, an argument regarding the lack of authority of a judge to hear a case was jurisdictional and could be raised at any time, even where the parties had stipulated to the appointment. The court held that where a WCA employee filed a complaint with the WCA, the Director had to appoint a pro tem judge to adjudicate the complaint. The court rejected the worker's argument that, under N.M. Const. art. VI, &sect; 3, only the Supreme Court could appoint judges pro tem.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court held that &quot;willfully&quot; was an essential element of the crime of escape that differed from the N.M. R.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The citizens argued that the county was in violation of N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 3-12-1.1.

The court dealt with the issue of whether the proviso in &sect; 3-12-1.1 negated the mandate that municipalities with a population of over 10,000 elect their governing body from single-member districts. The court found that the language in &sect; 3-12-1.1, which stated that H class counties &quot;may&quot; provide for single-member districts, unambiguously exempted the county from the mandate. The court held that the phrase &quot;having a population of 10,000 or less&quot; applied to municipalities and not to H class counties; therefore, the county was not required to provide for single-member districts. The court rejected the citizens' argument that the trial court's judgment violated their equal protection rights under N.M. Const. art.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a judgment entered by the District Court of San Juan County (New Mexico), which convicted him of the offense of driving while under the influence of intoxicating liquor (DWI). The trial also found that defendant was guilty of his fourth DWI, which made his conviction a felony under N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 66-8-102(A) (1994).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pleaded guilty to DWI, a misdemeanor offense. The State sought to enhance that conviction to a felony by submitting proof of three prior DWI convictions. Defense counsel conceded two of those convictions. He contested the use of the third because his client had not been represented by counsel. The trial court overruled his objection and enhanced his conviction to a felony in accordance with &sect; 66-8-102(A). On appeal, the court affirmed his conviction and sentence. It found that defendant had not established that the concession made by his attorney constituted the ineffective assistance of counsel. Moreover, those claims were usually resolved through a petition for habeas relief. While the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments specified that a defendant could be sentenced to prison only if he had been afforded the assistance of counsel, the lack of counsel did not prohibit the subsequent use of a conviction for enhancement purposes. Therefore, the trial court was allowed to consider the uncounseled conviction. The court found that defendant had waived the issue of whether the New Mexico Constitution afforded him greater protection in that regard.</SPAN></P>

Defendant argued that the sentences for CSP II, kidnapping, and burglary constituted multiple punishments.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pleaded guilty to charges of CSP II, aggravated burglary, kidnapping, and aggravated battery. At the plea hearing, he did not challenge the factual basis for the charges and did not offer any facts of his own. At the sentencing hearing, defense counsel for the first time raised the issue of whether CSP II merged with either aggravated burglary or kidnapping. The trial court denied a motion based on defense counsel's argument and sentenced defendant to 56 years in the penitentiary. Defendant appealed the sentence, contending that the CSP II conviction merged with either the kidnapping or the aggravated burglary conviction. The court affirmed the judgment of conviction and sentence. The court ruled that it was obvious to the trial court that defendant intended to appeal on grounds of a double jeopardy violation, that the guilty plea was a constructively conditional plea, and that appellate review of that issue was not waived. On the merits, the court found that defendant failed to establish a sufficient factual record below, and concluded that it could not ascertain whether defendant's conduct was unitary, the first part of its double jeopardy analysis.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of conviction and sentence that was imposed following defendant's guilty plea to CSP II, aggravated burglary, kidnapping, and aggravated battery.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state appealed the order from the District Court of Sandoval County (New Mexico), which granted defendant's motion to dismiss the information against defendant that charged him with the unlawful carrying of a firearm in an establishment licensed to dispense alcoholic beverages.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant entered a convenience store to purchase coffee. The store was licensed to sell alcoholic beverages, but at the time defendant entered the premises, such sales were prohibited by statute. Defendant had an unconcealed, loaded handgun in his pocket. A police officer noticed the gun, and he placed defendant under arrest for violating N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 30-7-3 (Repl. Pamp. 1994), the unlawful carrying of a firearm in an establishment licensed to dispense alcoholic beverages. Defendant filed a motion to dismiss the charge on the grounds that &sect; 30-7-3 was vague and overbroad. The trial court granted defendant's motion because it found that a small fraction of the licensed premises was devoted to package liquor sales and that a reasonable person would not know that there was liquor on the premises or that carrying a firearm therein was illegal. The trial court also found that the statute did not serve a valid purpose during the hours when liquor sales were restricted. The court reversed and found that &sect; 30-7-3 did not require proof that defendant knew that his act was unlawful. The court also found that the term &quot;licensed premises&quot; included the contiguous areas of a structure.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the order of the trial court and reinstated the information against defendant that charged him with unlawful carrying of a firearm in an establishment licensed to dispense alcoholic beverages. The court held that the statute was reasonably related to the public health, safety, and welfare and was not unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of driving while intoxicated (DWI), reckless driving, great bodily injury by vehicle, and four counts of vehicular homicide. Defendant sought review of his convictions and requested bail pending appeal under N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 31-11-1(C)(1995). The District Court of Bernalillo County (New Mexico) denied the request for bail pending appeal and defendant sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant claimed that &sect; 31-11-1(C)(2)&nbsp;unconstitutionally intruded upon the judiciary's power to prescribe rules of judicial procedure. The court rejected this claim, held that the statute was properly applied to the DWI conviction, but improperly applied to the other convictions, and affirmed in part and reversed in part the trial court's order. The court held that &sect; 31-11-1(C)(2) was valid and did not impinge upon the separation of powers. The court also held that defendant's challenge to the DWI conviction did not present a substantial question that was likely to result in reversal. The court found that defendant's prior conviction, which was based on a guilty plea, was properly used to enhance the sentence on his current conviction because there was no error in failing to inform him of all the collateral consequences of his plea. However, the court held that defendant's appeal on the remaining convictions presented a substantial question that was likely to result in reversal because it appeared that the trial court improperly ruled on the motion to change venue. Accordingly, the court reversed the denial of bail pending appeal on these remaining convictions.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's denial of bail pending appeal of defendant's DWI conviction and sentence.

On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that there was no support for a constitutional requirement that a CID could issue only if the attorney general established a likelihood that the Act had been or was being violated and that the evidence was not so compelling that every rational person would have determined the only purposes of the attorney general were improper ones.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The child beat, kidnapped, and repeatedly raped a convenience store clerk and admitted that he was guilty of four crimes.

Even though no expert stated that the child could not be treated, the court held that the children's court was entitled to disbelieve the experts and to determine the credibility of the testimony.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After defendant stabbed an acquaintance during an altercation involving his girlfriend, he was convicted of voluntary manslaughter and conspiracy to tamper with evidence, and his sentence was enhanced due to his status as a habitual offender. Defendant appealed the denial of his requested instruction on deadly force and defense of others, the determination that he was competent to stand trial, and the use of his prior convictions to enhance his sentence. The court affirmed the convictions and the sentence, holding that defendant was not entitled to the requested instruction on deadly force. Although defendant failed to testify, the jury could infer that his attack on the victim was motivated by an intent to protect his girlfriend. However, there was no evidence to show that the use of force was reasonable in light of the victim's statements, actions, and unarmed status. Although there was some conflicting testimony regarding defendant's competency, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in finding him competent. Further, no showing was made that the sentence enhancement was improper despite the claim that defendant had been unable to understand the prior guilty pleas.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A husband was awarded joint custody of a child in a divorce decree, and the wife appealed, asserting that the child was conceived during the marriage by artificial insemination from an anonymous donor. The court affirmed and held that the parties substantially complied with the provisions of N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40-11-6. The court explained that a husband was entitled to custody of a child only if he was the child's &quot;natural&quot; father, according to N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40-4-9.1(K). N.M. Stat. Ann.&nbsp;&sect; 40-11-6 provided that a husband was to be treated as the natural father of a child conceived by artificial insemination so long as the husband's consent was in a writing signed by him and his wife. There was no written consent signed by the husband and wife prior to the child's birth; however, the court held that the purposes of N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40-11-6(A) were best effectuated by treating the husband as the child's natural father. Section 40-11-6(A) did not prescribe the form of the writing nor require that the writing be created at a certain time. The court found that the pleadings in the divorce action demonstrated a knowing consent by the parties to treat the husband as the natural father.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that because the Commission had taken no action against the miners under the regulations, it did not have jurisdiction to review the constitutionality of the Act.

The court found that the Commission failed to comply with the statuary requirements to produce a schedule of fees. Therefore, the court invalidated those provisions of the regulations that did not set a determinate fee but merely set maximum fees. Other than those regulations, the court held that the remaining regulations (1) did not conflict with the Act; (2) were not impermissibly vague (3) did not improperly delegate unguided discretion or violate N.M. Const. art III, &sect; 1 by improperly delegating legislative authority; (4) did not violation N.M. Cont. arts.

Defendants claimed that they were immune from liability under N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 41-4-6 (Supp. 1995). In a prior appeal, the court concluded that the trial court erred in granting defendants' motion for summary judgment because the only evidence of record was that the lake was used solely for recreational purposes and defendants failed to show a right to immunity. On remand, defendants filed a renewed summary judgment motion adding an engineer's affidavit stating that the lake served multiple purposes, including the storage and diversion of water. On appeal of the second summary judgment order, the court ruled that the new evidence provided by defendants established that they were entitled to immunity under the second sentence of &sect; 41-4-6.The court noted that the legislative intent in enacting &sect; 41-4-6 was to preserve sovereign immunity for water diversion and storage works. The court further ruled that the law of the case doctrine did not preclude defendants from adducing new evidence to support their renewed motion for summary judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1994, almost seven years after a change in the employees' job responsibilities, the employees brought a breach of an employment contract action against the city, alleging that they were entitled to a retroactive raise in salary commensurate with their increased job responsibilities. The trial court dismissed the claim, holding that the three-year statute of limitations applicable to contract claims against a city began to run when the employees' duties were changed in November 1987. On appeal the employees contended that a new breach of contract occurred with each paycheck that did not include the raise to which they were entitled. The court affirmed, holding that the continuing-wrong theory was inapplicable because the only actionable wrong alleged by the employees was the city's initial refusal to increase the employees' salaries and, although that wrong had continuing consequences in the form of lower paychecks, the continuing effects did not extend the life of the breach of contract cause of action, which was based solely on the initial refusal. Because the breach of contract occurred in November 1987, the employees had only until November 1990 to file their complaint.</SPAN></P>

The city and the landowners filed cross motions for summary judgment. The district court concluded that the annexed tract was contiguous as a matter of law pursuant to N.M. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The amendment in question, Albuquerque, N.M. Charter &sect; 13, limited the term of its city councilors to no more than two elected terms. The trial court stated that passage and enforcement of the amendment was a constitutional exercise of the city's powers under the Home Rule Amendment, N.M. Const. art. X, &sect; 6. The court reversed, holding that the Qualifications Clause, N.M. Const. art. VII, &sect; 2, preempted a home rule municipality's power to adopt additional qualifications for elected office within the State of New Mexico beyond those set forth in its constitution. The court stated that reading N.M. Const. art. VII, &sect; 2 and N.M. Const. art. V, &sect; 13 together, the law was that any citizen who was a qualified voter could have held any municipal elected office subject only to the residency requirement. Thus, the amendment to the city charter was inconsistent with the Qualifications Clause. The Municipal Charter Act, N.M. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial courts found that N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 30-4-4(B) (1994), which defined custodial interference as the taking of a child without good cause and with the intent to deprive another person of his right to custody for a protracted time, was unconstitutionally vague and violated the Due Process Clauses of the United States and New Mexico Constitutions. On appeal, the court determined that the State failed to preserve its argument that defendants were precluded from asserting a facial challenge to &sect; 30-4-4(B). The court reversed the dismissals on the ground that the statute was not impermissibly vague because the phrases used in the statute had such general and well-recognized meanings that individuals were placed on notice of the conduct sought to be proscribed, and that it was not necessary that phrases such as &quot;without good cause&quot; and &quot;for a protracted time&quot; be defined by statute.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the relationship between a mother and grandmother deteriorated, the mother terminated all contact between her child and the grandparents. The grandparents subsequently filed a petition for grandparental visitation. The trial court granted the petition. The mother appealed from the order, arguing that the Grandparent's Visitation Privileges Act (GVA), N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 40-9-1 to 4 (1994), was unconstitutional and that the amount of visitation granted was unreasonable and not supported by substantial evidence. The court affirmed, holding that the GVA was constitutional because although the state's enforcement of it did impact the mother's right to raise her child, the intrusion was not a substantial interference and was thus an appropriate mechanism by which the state may balance the parties' competing interests. The court noted that an act authorizing the trial court to permit grandparent child visitation withstood state and federal constitutional challenges if allowance of such visitation was shown to be in the best interest of the child. The court also held that the trial court's grant of visitation was reasonable and not an abuse of discretion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant corporation appealed a decision of the District Court of Sandoval County (New Mexico), which entered a verdict in favor of plaintiff, executor of the estate of a deceased motor vehicle driver. The corporation argued that the district court committed error in excluding evidence that neither the driver nor his passenger was wearing seat belts at the time of the accident, refusing jury instructions, and refusing to admit relevant evidence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The corporation argued that the seat belt defense was not prohibited by statute when the executor brought her action, and the district court therefore violated N.M. Const. art. IV, &sect; 34 by prohibiting the introduction of seat belt evidence. The court held that because the corporation did not possess the right to limit the executor's recovery for seat belt non-use at common law, N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 66-7-373 did not limit the corporation's rights and the statute was within the legitimate ambit of legislative authority. The corporation also argued that the prohibition of a seat belt defense arbitrarily and unreasonably interfered with the adjudication of rights in a comparative negligence system and denied substantive due process. The court held that evidence of the failure to use seat belts did not limit or apportion damages. The court also held that because the theory of strict liability was not raised, the failure to instruct the jury on strict liability was not error, and the district court did not abuse its discretion in determining that expert testimony would not assist the jury.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pleaded no contest to a marijuana charge and was sentenced under the habitual-offender statute to over five years in prison. On appeal, defendant argued that her incarceration was unconstitutional in view of the court's earlier ruling, on unrelated charges, that imposing a prison term upon her, a person with significant asthma problems, was cruel and unusual punishment under U.S. Const. amend. VIII and N.M. Const. art. II, &sect; 13. The court disagreed, explaining that the basis of its earlier ruling was that the evidence showed that the prison was unable to provide defendant with necessary medical care. Incarceration, in such circumstances, would be life-threatening because defendant's medical needs could not be handled adequately. Testimony in the instant case indicated, however, that a contract physician was available 24 hours a day to provide treatment and that he could arrive within 10 minutes of an emergency call. Moreover, other physicians were available and at least one nurse was always on duty, and defendant could retain possession of her medication. Thus, custodial treatment at the prison would not amount to deliberate indifference to defendant's condition.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction and five and one-half year sentence as a habitual offender in the correctional facility.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer filed suit against the department and sought a refund of corporate income taxes paid to the State of New Mexico for certain years based on what its tax liability would have been had foreign dividends and income been excluded from its apportionable tax base. The department denied the taxpayer's claim for refunds and the taxpayer appealed. On appeal, the court affirmed the department's decision and held that the denial of a refund to the taxpayer was proper because where the dividends from subsidiaries of a parent company reflected profits derived from an integrated enterprise, those dividends, including foreign subsidiary dividends, were income earned. The court held that as long as the intra-state and extra-state activities formed part of a single, unitary business, the fact that a tax was apportioned in part upon the taxpayer's foreign income sources did not constitute a bar to state taxation. Lastly, the court held that New Mexico did not allow a foreign tax credit for corporations using the separate-entity reporting method and having foreign subsidiary dividend income, and that it was proper to look at the entire tax scheme in evaluating a claim of discrimination.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Department initiated successful proceedings to terminate the police officer for violating &sect; 66-8-134(A) by using his position of authority to suggest or imply to a motorist that he could reduce or alter the DWI citation issued to her.

The court held that the Department was entitled to appeal the order based on an exception to the final order requirement. The court further held that &sect; 66-8-134(A) was not unconstitutional. The court explained that the provision precisely defined, in unequivocal terms, the type of behavior prohibited, that no one could cancel or solicit the cancellation of any uniform traffic citation other than as provided in the Motor Vehicle Code.

His driver's license was revoked by the MVD after a hearing. The district court upheld that revocation. The driver appealed from the district court's judgment, which was affirmed. The Act authorized the revocation of a driver's license solely on the basis of a driver's refusal to submit to a breath test. The court rejected the driver's argument that the Act was unconstitutional because his refusal to take a breath test could be used to establish the criminal offense of aggravated driving while intoxicated under N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 66-8-102(D)(3) (1994). Rather, the privilege against self-incrimination and right to counsel secured by the Fifth and Sixth Amendments to the United States Constitution were applicable to only criminal proceedings. Furthermore, the United States Supreme Court had found that implied consent acts were a valid exercise of a state's police power. The court also stated that the driver did not have standing to challenge the constitutionality of &sect; 66-8-102(D)(3) because he had not been charged under that statute.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant requested permission from a friend to park a vehicle at her residence. After the vehicle had remained parked on the property for three weeks, the friend's husband telephoned police stating that he feared the vehicle was stolen. Because the keys were unavailable, police put a coat hanger through the vehicle's window in order to move an envelope that covered the VIN and discovered that the VIN matched that of a vehicle that was reported stolen. The trial court admitted the VIN into evidence, finding that the police had acted reasonably under the circumstances, their actions were lawful, and a warrant had been unnecessary. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded the case, finding that the search had violated defendant's Fourth Amendment rights. The court reasoned that defendant had not abandoned the vehicle and that it was reasonable to expect that police would not break into a car to reveal its VIN.

Stat. Ann. &sect; 30-45-3 (Repl. Pamp. 1989), and one count of attempt to commit fraud over $ 250 in violation of N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 30-16-6, 30-28-1 (Repl. Pamp. 1994). The court affirmed his conviction on the intent charge, but reversed and vacated his conviction on the attempt charge. The court found that he allowed the state's expert testimony that the switching involved in a long distance call constituted accessing a computer network, to go unrebutted and, therefore, there was substantial evidence to support his conviction for computer access with intent to defraud under N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 30-45-3 (Repl. Pamp. 1989). The court held that the applicable statutes were not vague and that the jury instructions made it clear that the applicable law was contained entirely in those instructions. The court ruled that the state failed to rebut his contention that he could not be convicted of attempt under the general fraud statute if he also was convicted, on the same facts, of the completed offense under the specific provisions of the &sect; 30-45-3 computer fraud statute.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the remainder of his conviction because it was supported by substantial evidence.</SPAN></P>

Defendant pleaded guilty to one count of unauthorized practice of medicine and two counts of fraud. The other counts were dismissed pursuant to a plea agreement. After a federal district court set aside defendant's guilty plea, defendant was tried on seven of the counts against her. The jury convicted defendant on two of the counts. On appeal, defendant raised eight points of error. The appellate court summarily rejected defendant's contentions concerning the specificity of the indictment, the trial judge's failure to recuse himself, the sufficiency of the evidence, the testimony of a particular witness, and the claimed ineffectiveness of trial counsel. The court also rejected defendant's argument concerning a witness's reference to the prior guilty plea and defendant's speedy trial claim. The court agreed with defendant, however, that her confinement pursuant to the guilty plea that was set aside should have been credited toward her sentence. Hence, the court remanded for an award of proper credit for defendant's pre-sentence confinement.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In response to the adoption of a county bond issue, the individuals filed a suit claiming that the issuance of the bond violated constitutional provisions requiring voter approval of bond issues. Subsequent to a trial court's ruling invalidating only a portion of the bond issue, the court held that limitations on the individuals' discovery did not deny them their due process rights. The court then noted that, by limiting repayment of the bonds to receipts from gross receipts and gasoline tax revenues, the bonds were solely repayable out of special funds and thus were not considered general obligation bonds because they did not pledge the full faith and credit of the county. As a result, the court held that the bond issue did not violate N.M. Const. art. IX, &sect; 10, which required voter approval only prior to the issuance of general obligation bonds. However, the court held that the trial court erred in invalidating the portion of the bond issue that allowed for the refinancing of road building equipment. In so holding, the court reasoned that the power to purchase equipment to construct roads was a part of the express power a county was granted to build and maintain such roads.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The worker brought a claim against the employer and the carrier concerning a head injury sustained in a work-related car accident. The administration determined that her attorney had reasonably expended almost $ 20,000 in fees because of the complexity of the case, but found that it had to limit the award to $ 12,500, as required by N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 52-1-54(G). The worker raised an equal protection challenge to this statute because the attorney's fees of the employer were not similarly limited. The court ruled that &sect; 52-1-54(G) was unconstitutional and remanded for a reconsideration of the fee award. The court found that a heightened rational-basis review applied to the classification and interests represented in the statute and that the statute had to have a factual foundation and a legal rationale. Although limits on attorney's fees were originally justified as a protection for workers, the court determined that the imposition of a cap on fees in the absence of the employer's bad faith was not justifiable as serving any rationale purpose and, in fact, placed the worker at a disadvantage to the employer.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were convicted of possession of marijuana with intent to distribute, conspiracy to commit distribution of marijuana, and possession of drug paraphernalia. Defendants argued that the State's use of five out of five peremptory challenges against Hispanic prospective jurors was racially motivated and violated defendants' constitutional rights. The State argued that defendants failed to establish a prima facie case that the State purposefully discriminated against Hispanic prospective jurors, and, even if defendants had established a prima facie case of purposeful discrimination, the prosecutor satisfied his burden of providing race-neutral explanations for his peremptory challenges. The court reversed and remanded for a new trial, holding that Hispanics were a cognizable group for purposes of Batson inquiry. Because of the presence of Anglo jurors whose characteristics were comparable to those relied upon to exclude Hispanic jurors, the State failed to satisfy its burden of providing a racially neutral explanation. Also, the Batson rationale not only protected a defendant's right to an impartial jury, but also protected prospective jurors from discriminatory exclusion.</SPAN></P>

The pharmacist sought a declaratory judgment against the attorney declaring that his civil rights were violated by the attorney's past conduct. The trial court entered judgment in favor of the attorney. On appeal, the court affirmed. Past wrongs, even unconstitutional wrongs, did not create a foundation for declaratory relief without either continuing illegal actions or continuing consequences to the pharmacist. The absence of any &quot;useful purpose&quot; or &quot;practical effect&quot; was the essence of why declaratory judgment was inappropriate for the pharmacist.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant superintendent appealed a decision by the District Court of Santa Fe County (New Mexico), which concluded that N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 59A-51-4 (Repl. Pamp. 1992) and N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 59A-51-13(C) (Repl. Pamp. 1992) violated equal protection guarantees because the two statutes infringed plaintiff bail bondsman's fundamental right to hold public office and because they were not rationally related to a legitimate state end.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The bail bondsman filed an action for declaratory judgment, challenging the constitutionality of N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 59A-51-4, 59A-51-13(C). The superintendent contended that the statutes were rationally related to a legitimate governmental interest and were therefore constitutional. The court stated that the statutes, which required the bail bondsman to give up his livelihood if he was to remain in elected office, were substantial barriers to his candidacy. The statutes were subject to at least the heightened rational-basis standard of review under the New Mexico Constitution. The superintendent proffered as a basis for the statute the need to protect the integrity of the bail-bonding process. The court agreed that protecting the integrity of the bail-bonding process was a legitimate state goal. However, the statutes were both under inclusive and over inclusive, and the presence of state and county officials in the statutes' prohibitions did not appear to be rationally based. Also, the statutes contained a number of classifications, and those were required to be rationally related to the purported purpose of the statutes. Thus, the court affirmed the judgment of the trial court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court, which concluded that the two statutes, which precluded county officers from being licensed as bail bondsmen or from receiving benefits from the bail-bonding business, violated equal protection guarantees in the bail bondsman's declaratory judgment action.</SPAN></P>

The court found that at the time of the alleged father's death, it was already established that, under the Uniform Probate Code, an adopted child inherited through the adoptive, not the natural, parents. Therefore, the court affirmed the dismissal of the child's actions because the adoption was final and its validity could not be attacked.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff State of New Mexico appealed an order of the District Court of Santa Fe County (New Mexico), which ruled that a pension plan for legislators was constitutional. In the action against defendants, the Public Employees Retirement Board and various plan participants, the attorney general had contended that the plan violated N.M. Const. art. IV, &sect; 10, and that a portion of the benefits already received should be repaid.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The case was assigned to a district judge who issued an order finding the plan unconstitutional. On appeal by defendants, the court dismissed the appeal on the ground that the order was not a final, appealable order because it did not resolve the attorney general's claim for refunds. On remand, the district judge vacated the order. On appeal, the court rejected the attorney general's contentions that under the law of the case doctrine, the second district judge should not have revisited and reversed the first decision regarding constitutionality. The district court had the authority to reconsider the earlier non-final ruling; thus, it was not inappropriate for the second district judge to overrule the prior interlocutory order. In reversing the order, the court held that the legislative pension plan violated the Constitution. It was &quot;clearly satisfied&quot; that state-funded pensions were barred by N.M. Const. art. IV, &sect; 10 because the words &quot;compensation, perquisite or allowance&quot; included pension plan benefits. Irrespective of whether the framers contemplated pensions, they clearly stated that legislators were to receive nothing other than the sums specified in the Constitution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the district court's order and remanded the action for further proceedings regarding the attorney general's claim for repayment of pension plan benefits already received.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant worker sought review from a decision of the New Mexico Workers' Compensation Administration (New Mexico), which granted her disability claim but denied her certain parts of her motion requesting attorney fees against appellee employer.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the court rejected the worker's claim that it was error for the administration judge to deny her claim of bad faith attorney fees, since it was within the administration judge's discretion, and it was not clearly irrational. The court found that the worker and the expert's testimony led them to conclude that there was substantial evidence on the record to support a finding of temporary total disability. Since post-injury employment did not preclude a finding of temporary total disability, it was not error for the administration judge to refuse to award a credit for overpayment of benefits to the employer. The court agreed with the employer that it was error to find that the worker suffered a scheduled injury to her left arm versus her left hand, since the record did not reveal any evidence to support the medical expert's opinion that the worker's left arm was useless. Since the worker failed to show that she could not perform her pre-injury job, the court erred in awarding her expenses for college education as vocational rehabilitation benefits. Since the expert witness did not testify under subpoena, the expert witness fee awarded to the worker was in error.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the administration judge's denial of bad faith attorney fees to the worker and affirmed the denial of a credit for overpayment of benefits to the worker by the employer.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayers were New Mexico residents and retired employees (or their spouses) of Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL), which was operated by the University of California (UC) through a contract with the federal government. They paid income taxes on their California retirement income under N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 7-2-3 (Repl. Pamp. 1988). The taxpayers filed a complaint seeking a refund of the taxes, claiming that the tax violated the intergovernmental tax immunity (ITI) doctrine. The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of the taxpayers on the basis that taxation of their retirement income operated to discriminate against those who dealt with the federal government and the State of California. On appeal, the court reversed the grant of summary judgment. The court held that the tax did not violate the ITI doctrine because the tax fell directly on the taxpayers based on their status as New Mexico residents. They were not so closely connected with the federal government that they could not be viewed as separate entities. The fact that UC operated LANL through federal funding did not make UC into a party with whom the federal government dealt for ITI purposes.</SPAN></P>

Affirming, the court held that &quot;any amount&quot; as used in &sect; 30-31-23(D) clearly meant that the legislature intended to prohibit possession of any identifiable amount of a controlled substance. Therefore, the clearly identifiable trace amount was sufficient to support the conviction.

The district court granted the neighbors' motion for summary judgment and held that the public had a prescriptive easement to use the road. On appeal, the court affirmed. The public acquired rights by implied dedication. There was evidence of the road's reputation as public that supported the general proposition that the road was open to the public. The neighbors produced enough evidence of implied dedication to make a prima facie showing of entitlement to summary judgment, and the landowners were unable to rebut the presumption. The evidence that the road was regarded in the community as a public road, that the county maintained the road, and that the city made significant improvements to it indicated the landowner's intent to make a dedication, the public's reliance, and public benefit.</SPAN></P>

The city zoning manager notified the nightclub that its dancers' breasts were not &quot;completely and opaquely covered&quot; as required by Albuquerque, N.M., Rev. Ordinances ch. 7, art. XIV, &sect; 5(B)(114)(a). The zoning manager ordered the nightclub to comply with the ordinance. The city planning commission and the city council both approved the zoning manager's ruling, The nightclub then appealed the decision to the district court by writ of certiorari. The district court found against the nightclub. On appeal, the court held that theatrical makeup, which was spread completely over the required surfaces of the dancers' breasts, and the plastic circles, which were placed on the dancers' nipples, satisfied the plain and unambiguous language of the ordinance. The court found that the definition of &quot;cover&quot; did not mean that only some sort of clothing could act as a cover. The court held that the nightclub complied with the zoning code as written, and reversed the district court's order of dismissal.</SPAN></P>

The trial court granted defendants additional peremptory challenges, but denied additional challenges to the patient.

It found that the trial court properly awarded defendants additional challenges as the evidence demonstrated their conflicting interests. Further, the rule did not authorize equalization of peremptory challenges and did not violate the patient's rights to equal protection. The court also found that a statement made by a juror to an alternate juror that there would be a verdict that day did not constitute jury misconduct as the communication concerned only the chronological progress of the trial and not the merits of the case. Finally, the court affirmed the order requiring each party to bear their own costs based on the patient's indigency as she did not engage in bad faith or abusive litigation tactics and her claims were not frivolous.</SPAN></P>

The injured passenger responded by claiming that the 90-day provision under &sect; 41-4-16(A), (B) was unconstitutional. The trial court granted the department's motion.

The court ruled that there was no evidence in the police report that any of the passengers' injuries were caused by the guardrail; therefore, the police report was insufficient as a matter of law to provide actual notice of the injured passenger's potential claim. The department did not have notice that the accident would have resulted in litigation.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The delinquent taxpayer contended that the tax sale was invalid as the state failed to comply with either statutory or constitutional due process requirements prior to the tax sale in which her real property was sold for delinquent taxes by the state.

The state contended that N.M. Stat.

The court held that the trial court's imposition of the statute of limitations was error because, based on the record, it held that the state failed to give the taxpayer minimum due process notice of the impending tax sale. It further held that the tax sale was invalid as a result of that due process violation under both U.S. Const. amend. XIV, &sect; 1 and N.M. Const. art. II, &sect; 18.</SPAN></P>

Following a hearing held on defendant's protest, the hearing officer found and concluded that the tax violated defendant's right against double jeopardy. Affirming the decision, the court determined that the controlled-substance tax was unconstitutional as applied to defendant. Noting that the fact that the assessment was labeled a &quot;tax&quot; was not dispositive of the double jeopardy issue, the court ruled that defendant rebutted the presumption that the tax assessment was correct by showing how he had previously been convicted of a drug offense involving the same controlled substances that formed the basis of the assessment, that the burden then shifted to the Department to show the correctness of the assessed tax, and that the Department did not present evidence showing that the assessment was proportionate to the claimed remedial goals and was therefore not a prohibited second penalty.</SPAN></P>

The court held (1) N.M.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The victim parked his car in a store's parking lot. He found the passenger door ajar when he returned. The ignition switch was also damaged. A security guard informed him that he had seen defendant getting out of the car. The security guard apprehended defendant. He admitted to the security guard that he had been the car. Defendant was found guilty of auto burglary and possession of burglary tools. He appealed from those convictions, which were affirmed. The burglary statute,&nbsp;N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 30-16-3 (Repl. Pamp. 1984), required an unauthorized entry. By comparison, unauthorized entry was not an element of the offenses of unlawful taking of a vehicle, N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 66-3-504 (Repl. Pamp. 1989), or tampering with a vehicle, N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 66-3-506 (Repl. Pamp. 1989). Therefore, the court rejected defendant reliance on the specific-statute doctrine. Furthermore, the evidence was sufficient to support a burglary conviction because the theft of a vehicle could be an offense committed therein. The trial court did not error when it refused to suppress defendant's statements to the security guard because that individual was not acting as a government agent.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners, mother and child, sought review of the decision of the District Court of Grant County (New Mexico) barring their actions for past child support against respondent father pursuant to the Uniform Parentage Act (Act), N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40-11-1 to -23 (Repl. Pamp. 1989).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother filed a complaint to establish paternity in the father and for past and future child support. Later, an amended complaint was filed, which added the child as a party to the action. The trial court found that the actions of the mother and child for past support were barred or limited pursuant to the general &quot;catch-all&quot; statute of limitations and not the statute of limitations under the Act. On appeal, the court affirmed in part and reversed in part. The court held that the general &quot;catch-all&quot; statute of limitations did not apply to actions to collect past child support and the applicable statute of limitations for support proceedings was provided by N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40-11-23. The court also concluded that the trial court erred when calculating past child support for not considering other sources of revenue other than the father's gross monthly income. Finally, the court ruled that the mother was not entitled to prejudgment interest on the past support because the amount was unliquidated until the action was brought and a figure set by the trial court.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The alcohol and gaming division granted preliminary approval for the transfer and then respondent city held a public hearing in which local citizens testified against the transfer. Subsequent to the hearing, the alcohol and gaming division denied the transfer and this decision was affirmed by the district court. On appeal, the court affirmed holding that the decision to deny the transfer was supported by substantial evidence and was not arbitrary, capricious, or an abuse of discretion. The court found that the objection that the decision was not supported by substantial evidence had not been raised below and that the business owners failed to introduce any evidence. The court held that as to the argument that the decision denied them due process under the law, the state had broad police powers to grant or deny a liquor license and the ownership of a liquor license was a privilege and not a right. The court held that the delegation of the legislative authority to transfer a license on moral as well as public health and safety grounds were within the traditional definition of the state's police power and therefore the denial had to stand.</SPAN></P>

The district court's failure to give notice to the first taxpayer's new attorney of the hearing on the motion to dismiss and motion for summary judgment resulted in a denial of due process. With respect to the second taxpayers, the court found that the trial court correctly determined that it lacked jurisdiction because of the failure to timely appeal, as required by the Tax Administration Act, N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 7-1-26 (1978). It was undisputed that the second taxpayers failed to follow the Act as to the time constraints or as to the manner in which they asserted their claim, which was mandatory before questioning in court the constitutionality of a tax. As there was a complete remedy otherwise provided by statute, and obviously intended to be exclusive, the issue was not subject to disposition by declaratory judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Criminal appellant challenged the decision of the District Court of Sierra County (New Mexico) that convicted her on eight counts of fraudulent practices contrary to N.M.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Criminal appellant was convicted on eight counts of securities fraud. On appeal, appellant first contended that the portions of the Securities Act she was convicted of violating were unconstitutionally vague and overbroad. Specifically, appellant asserted that N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 58-13B-30 and 58-13B-2V were vague and that section 58-13B-30 was overbroad because of the statutes' definitions of securities. Because appellant did not show that the state was improperly exercising its police power and that the statutes were unreasonably necessary, the court concluded that there was no violation of due process under the United States Constitution as well as the New Mexico Constitution. Appellant's next contention was a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. The appellate court found that appellant failed to demonstrate that he trial counsel's performance fell below the required standard. The court concluded that the evidence presented was substantial to support the trial court's conviction.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellate court affirmed criminal appellant's convictions when the court found that the portions of the Securities Act were not unconstitutional, she was not deprived of ineffective assistance of counsel, her convictions were supported by substantial evidence, and the trial court did not err in rejecting a proffered jury instruction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee claimed that she suffered mental and emotional damages as a result of the supervisor's harassment. Almost three years after the events giving rise to the cause of action, a decision was rendered in New Mexico which recognized a cause of action for prima facie tort as a specific tort cause of action and it was under this theory that the employee's cause went to trial. The trial court entered judgment in favor of the employee. On appeal, the court reversed, holding that the decision recognizing a prima facie tort should not be applied retroactively. It found that the recognition of a prima facie tort as a cause of action imposed significant new duties and conditions and took away previously existing rights. Further, the prima facie tort punished conduct that was lawful until the case recognizing the tort was decided. Finally, retrospective application would not further all purposes of the prima facie tort, as the goals of compensation and punishment arguably would be advanced by retroactive application, the goal of deterrence would not be advanced.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners filed a petition and map for incorporation with the board.

The court held that petition offered by petitioners did not comply with the statutory &quot;swear or affirm&quot; requirement of N.M. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In consolidated cases from the District Court of Santa Fe County (New Mexico) and the District Court of Luna County (New Mexico), the court considered whether NMSA 1978, &sect; 30-31-34(D) (Repl. Pamp. 1989) (New Mexico) allowed for the forfeiture of vehicles when a small amount of a controlled substance was discovered in the possession of the owners.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Each case raised the issue of whether &sect; 30-31-34(D) (Repl. Pamp. 1989) (New Mexico), provided for forfeiture of vehicles and other property when the owner of the property was in possession of a small amount of controlled substances designed solely for personal use. The trial courts came to opposite conclusions. The court found that, in order for property to be forfeited under the statute, possession of a controlled substance had to be for the purpose of sale. In reaching its determination, the court found that the 1981 amendment to the statute, as well as the comments to &sect; 505(a)(4) of the Uniform Controlled Substance Act (USCA), 9 U.L.A., Part II, 834 (1988), after which the state statute was modeled, mandated that forfeiture should be enforced only where the controlled substance possessed was meant for sale. Prior caselaw had not been based on the amended statute, and so was not controlling. The contention that the USCA could not be relied upon in interpreting New Mexico law was rejected. The claim of unconstitutional vagueness was not reached as it was mooted by the decision of the court. Likewise, a motion to transfer possession of the vehicle pending appeal was moot.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's order denying forfeiture in one case, and did not reach the issues concerning that trial court's order granting the motion to transfer possession of the vehicle pending appeal. In the other appeal, the court reversed the trial court's order of forfeiture.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The child instituted an action against the city for alleged negligent maintenance and inspection of a street where he was hit by a car.

Ann. &sect;&sect; 41-4-1 to 41-4-27 (Cum. Supp. 1992) was tolled because the child was a minor. The city brought an interlocutory appeal. The court affirmed the trial court's order that denied the city's motion for summary judgment. The court found that the application of the notice provision of N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 41-4-16 (Repl. Pamp. 1989) to a minor did not necessarily violate due process. The court concluded, however, that the trial court did not err in denying the motion for summary judgment because the record raised questions of material fact. The court determined that factual issues that precluded summary judgment included when the child retained counsel, whether he was otherwise able to comply with the notice provision, and whether, based on the facts, application of the notice provision to him violated due process.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Each defendant was given a urinalysis test while on probation or parole and each tested positive for cocaine. Four defendants subsequently entered guilty pleas, one defendant was convicted by jury, and one defendant was convicted at a bench trial. On appeal, defendants argued that the drug test results alone were insufficient evidence of possession, jurisdiction, knowledge, and intent, and that the drug test results were the fruit of unreasonable searches and seizures. Defendants also claimed that application of the possession statute to them was unconstitutional. The appellate court adopted the majority rule requiring that a positive drug test be corroborated by additional proof of intentional or knowing prior possession, but rejected defendants' remaining contentions. The court reversed one defendant's conviction by jury due to lack of corroborating evidence and reversed another defendant's conviction rendered after a bench trial because there was insufficient evidence that the ingestion of cocaine occurred within the state. The court affirmed the convictions of the remaining defendants, noting that their guilty pleas waived their challenges to the sufficiency of the evidence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Taxation and Revenue Department (Department) issued corporate income tax assessments against the corporation for taxes due in 1981 through 1987, plus interest and penalties.

The corporation challenged an administrative decision and an order of the Department that denied the corporation's challenge to four separate deficiency assessments of corporate income tax, penalty, and interest. The court affirmed. The court remanded, however for determination by the hearing officer of the amount of the allowable adjustment from the additional taxes imposed, because of the corporation's previous payment of taxes for certain of the years in question. The statutory apportionment formula did not violate the Foreign Commerce Clause of U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 8, cl. 3 because, in light of N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 7-4-10, -11, -14, and -16 (1990) and the statutory formula specified by the Uniform Division of Income for Tax Purposes Act, there was a clear legislative intent to impose the tax on property, payroll, and sales of the corporation's unitary business.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city council granted an amendment to the general plan that reclassified a tract of land from residential to industrial and commercial. When the landowners filed a petition for writ of certiorari seeking judicial review of the city council's decision, the district court dismissed the petition due to two jurisdictional defects: lack of standing and the untimely filing of the petition for writ of certiorari. On appeal, the court reversed the district court's order. The landowners alleged the following injuries: fear of increased noise, crime, and pollution; detrimental effect on aesthetics; declining property values; traffic hazards; and increased drainage and flooding. The court held that the threat of aesthetic, quality of life, and property harm alleged by the landowners, whose residential properties were located near the land included in the amendment, conferred standing on them. The court held that the date from which the city council's decision triggered the 30-day period for filing a petition for writ of certiorari pursuant to N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 3-21-9(A) was the date the city council made its final decision. Therefore, the petition for writ of certiorari was timely filed.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed the judgment and remanded the case. The employer was subject to the Workers' Compensation Act because it employed more than three workers in total, including workers employed outside New Mexico. Moreover, the statutory exemption for employers involved in interstate commerce did not apply in this case. The legislature had intended for out-of-state employers employing fewer than three workers in the State of New Mexico to be exempt only from the administrative burden of obtaining and filing proof of workers' compensation insurance complying with New Mexico's statutory requirements but not from liability for payment of benefits under the Act if they were otherwise subject to New Mexico's workers' compensation law.</SPAN></P>

Upon review, the court affirmed defendant's convictions. The court held that: (1) &sect; 30-7-4 did not infringe on defendant's right to bear arms because the right to bear arms under the state constitution was not absolute, and defendant's right to bear arms was circumscribed by the conditions under which he sought to assert the right; (2) &sect; 30-7-4 was not unconstitutionally overbroad and vague; and (3) the evidence was sufficient to support defendant's convictions.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, guardians of their daughter, filed a 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 claim in district court against defendants, a group home for retarded citizens and associated persons, that sought damages and a preliminary injunction that would enjoin defendants from discharging their daughter from a private home for the developmentally disabled. Plaintiffs alleged that defendants' discharge decision denied their daughter pre-deprivation procedural due process. The district court denied plaintiffs' requested relief. The court vacated the order denying injunctive relief, holding that a private entity that was under state contract to provide services to mentally disabled persons was a state actor when it made decisions regarding the discharge of those persons under its care. The court held that the district court's mistaken conclusion that defendants were not state actors foreclosed the possibility of it finding that plaintiffs suffered irreparable injury, and that they had a substantial likelihood of success on the merits. The court reinstated plaintiffs' &sect; 1983 action and ordered a stay of the discharge procedures pending review of the merits of the &sect; 1983 claim.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The district court held defendant in contempt for failure to comply with a court order. The order, issued on the basis of a local rule outlining appropriate dress in district court, required defendant, an attorney, to wear a conventional tie when he appeared in the district judge's courtroom. Defendant, contrary to the district judge's instructions had worn a bandanna. On appeal, defendant argued that his dress caused no disruption, that the judge required him to comply with a unique and personal interpretation of the local rule, and that the judge's ruling infringed defendant's First Amendment right of free expression. Because the evidence indicated that defendant violated a court order, the district court had the discretion to exercise its inherent power to issue a contempt sanction to preserve its authority and maintain respect for the courts and the court concluded that no abuse of discretion occurred. The court noted that defendant was required to obey the order, even if it was subject to reversal on constitutional grounds. Moreover, the district court judge's refusal to recuse himself was not an abuse of discretion.</SPAN></P>

On further appeal, the court affirmed on other grounds, holding that the criminal libel statute was unconstitutional insofar as it applied to a public statement involving a matter of public concern. The court held that the Constitution prohibited a conviction for criminal libel for public defamation made without actual malice on a matter of public concern. The court rejected the state's argument that any constitutional defect in the statute could be cured by requiring the trial court to instruct the jury on &quot;actual malice.&quot; Because the charge against defendant was predicated on public statements relating to the performance of the administration of a public institution of higher learning and thus was a matter of public concern, defendant could not constitutionally be prosecuted under &sect; 30-11-1.</SPAN></P>

Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 52-2-1 et seq.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The worker, a miner, filed a claim to receive workers' compensation benefits from the fund pursuant to the SIA, based on alleged disability resulting from aggravation of pre-existing lung disease, due to his employment with the company. He also filed an alternative claim for benefits under the New Mexico Occupation Disease Disablement Law (ODDL), N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 52-3-1 et seq. The fund denied the claim. After a hearing, during which evidence was taken both supporting and refuting the worker's claim that his disability was caused by his employment, a workers' compensation judge (WCJ) ruled that the worker did not suffer a compensable injury under the Workers' Compensation Act (WCA) and that the SIA did not apply to benefits payable under the ODDL. On appeal, the court affirmed the WCJ's decision. The court held that the WCJ's finding that the worker's disability was not caused by his employment was not in error because it was rationally based upon the evidence, and thus the worker was not eligible for SIA benefits arising under the WCA. Benefits payable under the ODDL were not compensable under the SIA because the SIA made no reference to the ODDL, but only to the WCA.</SPAN></P>

The statute gave the trial court discretion to award prejudgment interest after considering whether the plaintiff was the cause of unreasonable delay or whether defendant made a reasonable and timely offer of settlement. The trial court properly considered the factors required by the statute in making its award of prejudgment interest and did not abuse its discretion.

The employer failed to meet its burden of proof and demonstrate that the physician would not provide reasonable care to the worker.

The court held that the gross receipts tax was properly assessed on receipts for ancillary services and for pass-throughs of franchise fees, but that receipts for access services were not taxable. The provisions of the New Mexico Gross Receipts and Compensating Tax Act (act), specifically N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 7-9-55, in effect during the relevant time were construed to encompass tax deductions for all &quot;interstate messages&quot; regardless of whether the receipt related only to an intrastate component of the interstate transmission. Receipts from access charges were &quot;receipts from transmitting messages&quot; and not taxable. Receipts from charges for ancillary billing services related to the provision of interstate phone service but were not &quot;receipts from transmitting messages or conversations by telephone&quot; and were not taxable. Franchise fee pass throughs were taxable because they were included in the total amount received by the taxpayer for selling its telephone services.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The denial of the taxpayer's protest of the gross receipts tax imposed upon access charges and the penalty imposed for the delayed payment of the protested tax was reversed. The denial of the taxpayer's protest of taxes imposed upon ancillary service fees and municipal franchise fee pass-throughs was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant employer, a state agency, sought review of an order from the District Court of Bernalillo County (New Mexico), which had reversed and remanded a decision of a state personnel board. Appellee employee, a state alcohol beverage control agent, was terminated by the employer after he failed to meet the law enforcement certification requirements of NMSA 1978, &sect; 29-7-8 (Cum.Supp.1981), and the board had upheld the termination.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When the employee was hired , his position as an agent did not fall within the definition of a police officer. Several years later, the definition of a police officer was expanded in NMSA 1978, &sect; 29-7-7(F) (Cum.Supp.1981) to include persons working in a law enforcement agency. The law enforcement certification requirement for police officers in NMSA 1978, &sect; 29-7-8(B) required police officers to obtain certification within 12 months of their employment, which the employee failed to do. The employee claimed that he was exempted or grandfathered from the certification requirement, but the court disagreed and held that his termination was lawful. The court ruled that the employer was a law enforcement agency under NMSA 1978, &sect; 29-7-7(F) (Cum.Supp.1981) and that when NMSA 1978, &sect; 29-7-8 was amended, it required certification for both the permanent appointment and the continued employment of police officers. The change of the heading of &sect; 29-7-8 when it was amended was evidence of legislative intent. In addition, there was no written contract that was impaired, under article II, Section 19, of the New Mexico Constitution, by requiring the employee to meet the certification requirements.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the order of the district court and affirmed the decision of the board.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant New Mexico State Racing Commission sought review of a decision of the District Court of Lincoln County (New Mexico), which entered judgment finding void the commission's suspension of appellee trainer's license to participate in horse racing in the state for five years pursuant to N.M. St. Rac. Com'n R. 43.53.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The suspension had been based on test results indicating that three of the trainer's horses had tested positive for illegal drugs. The trainer contended on appeal that he had been denied procedural due process. The court reversed the judgment in part and remanded the case. As to the first horse, the court noted that N.M. St. Rac. Com'n R. 43.53 (rule) required a hearing as soon as was practicable. The court determined that the commission's delay in granting a hearing was unreasonable given the interest involved, and that because the rule had not been followed, the trainer's suspension based on the positive laboratory tests for the first horse was void. As to the other two horses, the court held that with a full hearing having been held within eight days after notification setting forth the charges, the requirements of the rule had been satisfied, that the hearing and the formal action taken by the commission within 30 days afterward satisfied the requirements of due process, and that the rule was not unconstitutional as applied. The court held that the rule on its face assured a sufficiently timely hearing to satisfy due process safeguards.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court set aside the trial court's judgment finding void the commission's suspension of the trainer and remanded the case for entry of a new judgment consistent with the court's opinion, with a direction that the trial court should then remand the matter to the commission for further proceedings consistent with the trial court's revised judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owner's parcel had been used continuously as a contractor's yard by him and then by his lessee since the late 1960s. In 1976, an amended special use permit was issued to the property owner to allow him to add a warehouse to the site. The permit was expressly granted &quot;for the life of the use.&quot; Based on complaints from neighbors, the Bernalillo County Planning Commission voted to cancel the property owner's permit in 1987. The Bernalillo Board of County Commissioners (the Board) affirmed the decision. The district court affirmed the decision of the Board to revoke a special-use permit issued because it was not beyond its zoning authority. On appeal, the property owner also challenged the district court's order on rehearing that reaffirmed its prior ruling. The court held that the order should be reversed because the Board had no authority to revoke the permit, which was granted &quot;for the life of the use.&quot; The court noted that the Board had other options in pursuing relief, such as seeking an injunction, filing an abatement action, or seeking penalties pursuant to the ordinance in quasi-criminal proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant employer sought review of a decision from the New Mexico Workers' Compensation Administration, which awarded temporary total disability benefits and attorney fees to appellee, a workers' compensation claimant. The claimant filed a cross-appeal attacking the constitutionality of the cap on attorney fees awards in workers' compensation cases as limited by NMSA 1978, &sect; 52-1-54(G) (Repl.Pamp.1987).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The claimant injured her knees in a fall at her work. She decided to retire, but before her official retirement date, her right knee gave out and she fell at home. She then retired and was awarded total disability benefits for several months after her retirement, as well as attorney fees. The employer asserted that she was not eligible for the benefits because she had voluntarily removed herself from the workforce by retiring. The court affirmed, holding that the issue was not whether the claimant lost wages, but whether she was prevented from engaging in an occupation for remuneration or profit, which was the definition of disability in NMSA 1978, &sect; 52-1-25(A) (Repl.Pamp.1987). The fact that the claimant had retired did not establish that she had voluntarily removed herself from the labor market. The employer claimed that there was insufficient evidence to prove a casual connection between the disability and the earlier injury at work, but there was sufficient medical testimony to support the casual connection. The award of attorney fees was not excessive, and the claimant could not attack the constitutionality of the cap on such fees because her award was below the cap.</SPAN></P>

The superintendent and the fund also requested a review arguing that the employer failed to substantially comply with the SIA, the apportioned liability between the employer and the fund was not supported by substantial evidence, and the purpose and the policy of the SIA was violated by assessing liability against the fund in this case. The court affirmed the judgment of the worker's compensation judge (WCJ), but reversed the compensation order insofar as it held the fund liable because the employer did fail to substantially comply with the SIA by failing to seek the worker's signature as to the worker's preexisting condition for a substantial amount of time after the accident. Pursuant to N.M.

The court held that: (1) where defendant had ability to place the minor in a confined workstation and the minor testified that he was scared, the jury could infer that defendant used his position to coerce the minor; (2) the court rejected defendant's merger argument stating that contributing required the proof of the additional element that the conduct tended to cause or encourage the delinquency and that defendant did not challenge the sufficiency of the evidence establishing that element; but (3) where &quot;unlawfulness&quot; was set forth in jury instructions as a required element of the crime of criminal sexual contact of a minor, the court certified the matter for determination of whether the element's absence was meaningful given that the lawfulness of the manner of touching was not in dispute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court would affirm defendant's convictions of criminal contact by a person in position of authority and contributing to the delinquency of a minor. However, because of its uncertainty as to the effect of the omission of the element of &quot;unlawfulness&quot; from the jury instruction regarding criminal sexual contact of a minor, the court certified the matter to the state supreme court.</SPAN></P>

Pamp. 1984).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The victim testified that defendant, her grandfather, molested her repeatedly from age 6 for over 10 years. Defendant argued that evidence of his past sexual misconduct against the victim was too remote for its probative value to outweigh its prejudicial impact but the court disagreed. Even though the misconduct dated back 10 years, time was only 1 factor to consider. The similarity of the past incidents and the number of incidents weighed in favor of admissibility in that his past sexual misconduct was indicative of a lewd disposition toward the victim. The court affirmed defendant's convictions. Defendant never requested a separate ruling on each incident of molestation and could not raise the issue for the first time on appeal. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in restricting impeachment of the victim's testimony by disallowing extrinsic evidence in the form of witness testimony. Defendant was afforded effective assistance of counsel. Counsel's decision not to call a witness was trial strategy and the result would not have been different if the witness was called. N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 30-9-13(B)(Repl. Pamp. 1984) was not unconstitutionally vague nor overbroad.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, appellants argued that the statutory requirement of obtaining a child care center license violated their right to freely exercise religion. The court affirmed the lower court judgment because &sect; 24-1-5(A) was generally applicable and religion neutral. The court held that there was nothing within the language of &sect; 24-1-5(A) to show that the legislature intended to discriminatorily burden religious exercise. The court concluded that appellants were not entitled to the relief sought because &sect; 24-1-5(A) required all childcare centers to have a license for operation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court convicted defendant of false voting in violation of N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 1-20-8. Defendant argued on appeal that he had been selectively prosecuted as a result of the exercise of his right to free speech. Defendant claimed that he had been singled out for prosecution due to his criticism of the police chief, the police department, and other agencies of the city and county. Defendant claimed that he was selected from a number of similarly situated individuals who were not prosecuted. The court found that defendant had failed to establish the requisite elements of a prima facie case of selective prosecution. Assuming that defendant proved the first element of selective prosecution, the court found that the record did not support a showing of discriminatory purpose based on defendant's vocal criticism of local officials. The court also found that defendant did not show that local officials who were the target of his criticism took part in the decision to prosecute. Accordingly, defendant's conviction was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, defendant argued, among other things, that the officer did not have reasonable suspicion to justify the initial stop of the vehicle, that the stop was pretextual, that any consent to search was withdrawn before the suitcase was opened, and that the warrantless search of the suitcase was unlawful. The court affirmed, holding that: (1) it was reasonable for the officer to believe a driver or passenger who permitted the shoulder harness to dangle free was not wearing his lap belt either; (2) the evidence at the suppression hearing was sufficient for the trial court to have concluded that the stop was not pretextual; and (3) where the officer smelled the odor of marijuana and thought he saw marijuana on the handle of the suitcase, he had probable cause to search the suitcase and the entire vehicle.</SPAN></P>

On appeal he contended that consensual sex between a therapist and his adult patient was not a crime in New Mexico because the state legislature had not enacted a criminal statute concerning sexual relations specifically between a therapist and a patient. N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 30-9-11 required the state to prove that the offense of CSP was committed through the use of force or coercion. Defendant's argument focused on the state's use the theory of &quot;transference&quot; to prove that the victim suffered from a mental condition rendering him incapable of understanding the nature and consequences of the sexual acts with defendant, and thus constituted coercion. The court concluded that in the absence of more precise statutory language, the legislature did not intend &quot;transference&quot; to be sufficient to bring defendant's conduct under the grasp of the CSP statute and that the state in prosecuting defendant under the CSP statute based on the theory of the transference phenomenon exceeded the limits of the statute's application.

The court held that there was substantial evidence that the taxpayer intended to retain the collateral in satisfaction of the debt and not account to the pawnors after the sale.

On appeal, the court reversed. The court found that the calls made by defendant were neither threatening nor maliciously annoying. The court found that because defendant was calling the victim to seek her assistance in terminating what she felt was an unhealthy relationship between her granddaughter and the victim's son, the calls were not maliciously annoying. Because the victim's son was over 20 and was having a sexual relationship with defendant's 16-year-old granddaughter, he was committing a fourth degree felony. The court found the basis for the calls to be legitimate. The court determined that defendant did not threaten the victim by telling her that she was going to call the attorney general. The court found that because the statement did not include a threat of criminal or tortious misconduct, it was not a threat.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant had been hospitalized after the motor vehicle accident in which he killed two individuals. The trial court had limited his presentence commitment credit to the time he was confined in jail after being released from the hospital. Defendant contended he was in custody while hospitalized. On appeal, the court vacated the sentences and remanded for resentencing and for a determination of the proper amount of presentence commitment credit. The court held that it was error to consider the uncounseled convictions because defendant had not waived assistance of counsel and because he had offered evidence of indigency. Although tribal law did not require appointment of counsel to indigent defendants, the court found that it was required by the N.M. Const. art. II, &sect;14, and the Sixth Amendment to the U.S. Const. The court also held that the trial court's denial of defendant's motion for determination of indigency was not prejudicial and its refusal to order a presentencing diagnostic commitment was not an abuse of discretion. The court found that any questions regarding the trial court's intention that the sentences be concurrent was resolved by the written order.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The widow and her children were awarded benefits under the Workers' Compensation Act based on the husband's death during the course of his employment with the employer. The widow was awarded attorneys' fees pursuant to the payment and benefit rule, but not pursuant to The Interim Act. The court reversed the award under the rule and affirmed the denial of an award under the Act. The court held that N.M. Const. art. IV, &sect; 34 barred the application of the payment and benefit rule to the widow's claim because the case was pending when the rule was enacted. Even though the issue of whether the rule applied was not raised before the Division, the widow did not suffer any unfair prejudice from the consideration of the issue for the first time on appeal, and the public interest and jurisdictional nature of the error argued in favor of consideration. Further, the widow was not entitled to an award of attorneys' fees under the Act because while there was evidence of bad faith, there was no evidence of any economic injury suffered as a result of respondents' delay in paying benefits.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant got into an argument with another person, who accused him of burglarizing his van. Defendant waived his arms at, pointed at, and used derogatory language toward the other person, even though a police officer told him to stop. Defendant contended that there was insufficient evidence to find him guilty of disorderly conduct and that the offense of disorderly conduct was void for vagueness. The court affirmed the judgment. The court noted that the lower court's reliance on defendant's language to support the disorderly conduct did not violate defendant's right to free speech because defendant's language involved &quot;fighting words,&quot; which were not protected by U.S. Const. amend. I. Because defendant's language and actions were likely to incite an immediate breach of the peace, the court concluded that there was sufficient evidence of a violation of disorderly conduct under N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 30-20-1 (1978, Repl. Pamp. 1984). Considering that the statute was limited to conduct disturbing the peace, was understandable by the average person, and was based on what was offensive to the average person, the court determined that the statute was not unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">During the trial court's voir dire, a prospective juror stated that she was the victim of a robbery. She stated she was inclined to sympathize with the state. However, during voir dire by the state and defendant, the juror stated she had thought the matter over and she felt confident she could make a decision based on the evidence. The trial court refused to excuse the juror for cause. Defendant contended that because the juror equivocated about her impartiality until pressured into it by being the object of the scrutiny of the open court, she should have been excused. The court affirmed defendant's conviction. The court held that if a juror rehabilitated his or her own bias, the trial court may properly deny challenges for cause to that juror absent undue prompting from the court or counsel. The court found that the juror admitted a bias but was left to think about the matter while the court and counsel examined other jurors on voir dire. On further examination, the first thing she said was that she on further reflection came to the conclusion that she could set aside her bias and decide the case on its own facts.

The sole issue on appeal was the legality of the search that uncovered cocaine in a false gas tank on their truck. The court affirmed the convictions, holding that the roadblock itself was proper because there was no evidence that state police officers questioned motorists about their citizenship in the absence of reasonable suspicion. Thus, the checkpoint was not in actuality an immigration checkpoint. The court further held that the patrol agent acquired sufficient evidence to establish probable cause to search the tank and that he acquired the evidence lawfully. When asked how many gas tanks they had, one defendant replied three while the other replied two. The patrol agent also crawled under the truck and pointed out that the gas tank could not be used for gasoline because the strapping seemed hand-cut and that the tank was not intended for that area of the truck. The court concluded that the underside of defendants' truck was sufficiently exposed to public view that the patrol agent's observations did not constitute a search.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that &quot;rude, insolent, or angry&quot; was sufficient to reasonably define defendant's conduct as criminally culpable. Further, because defendant failed to demonstrate prejudice that arose from the trial counsel's representation of her, the court denied her motion to amend. Moreover, because &sect; 30-22-24 required the conjunctive facts of rudeness, insolence, or anger, possibly evinced or accompanied by speech, without touch or applying force, the court held that the State punished defendant for the inseparable combination of what might have been a protected activity and what was clearly not a protected activity. The court held that where defendant coupled her rude, insolent, or angry remarks with force upon a police officer, the jury could have found defendant guilty of battery upon a police officer.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Department assessed the taxpayer for nonpayment of taxes on ethanol-blended gasoline that was not manufactured exclusively in New Mexico. On appeal, the Department conceded that the deduction was unconstitutional under U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 8. The court held that the discrimination between the tax treatment of ethanol-blended fuel manufactured in New Mexico and such fuel manufactured elsewhere violated the commerce clause. In considering whether the offending provisions in &sect; 7-13-4.1 were severable such that the rest of the statute could be preserved, the court noted that the first two criteria of a three-part test were met. The court considered the purpose of &sect; 7-13-4.1 as stated in N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 7-13-4.3 (Repl. Pamp. 1988). The court concluded that economic protectionism for New Mexico agricultural products was the primary purpose of the deduction. Concluding that the legislature would not have enacted the deduction had it known that the provision was invalid, the provision could not be severed. The entire deduction was invalid. The severability issue was not moot and the court refused to consider whether the Department had the power to declare a statute unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 4-48A-1 through 4-48A-18 (1989) was unconstitutional. The trial court found that the SHDA unconstitutionally delegated legislative powers to private persons.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellees contended that the SHDA allowed private persons arbitrarily to include property in a special hospital district even though the property and inhabitants would not have been benefited by inclusion. The court rejected this contention, holding that there was not any constitutional prohibition against including property within a special hospital district even though the property and its inhabitants would not benefit from inclusion. Further, the court held that it could not see how appellees could establish a total absence of benefit from inclusion in a special hospital district of relatively limited boundaries. The court reversed the judgment, holding that the SHDA was not unconstitutional on its face solely because the tax to benefit ratio for certain property owners may have differed from that for others within a special hospital district. The court held that because the potential for abuse under the SHDA was sufficiently small, there was no reason to strike the legislation itself. The court concluded that whether a particular district was created or acted in violation of the SHDA could have been resolved through specific litigation without bringing down the entire house.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant child appealed from a judgment of the District Court of Chaves County, children's court (New Mexico), which adjudicated him a delinquent after a bench trial conviction for committing criminal sexual contact of a minor victim pursuant to N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 30-9-13 (Supp. 1989). The trial court had found that the child had touched his private parts to those of his eight-year-old sister, causing her to contract gonorrhea.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The charging document alleged that the crime took place sometime during a two-month period. The victim testified by video. She had trouble remembering and refused to answer some cross-examination questions due to embarrassment. The state was permitted to show the victim a stick figure drawing of a person. On appeal, the court held that the charging document gave the child adequate notice to permit him to prepare a defense. However, the court held that the case should be remanded for a determination of whether the victim had needed special protection warranting the video testimony, which would otherwise have violated the child's right to confrontation. The court found that the drawing was not improperly leading since it was necessary to develop the victim's testimony. The court rejected the child's arguments that &sect; 30-9-13 was unconstitutionally vague because it did not define the terms &quot;groin&quot; and &quot;unlawful.&quot; Further, the court rejected the child's contention that he had been denied his right to confrontation because the victim failed to answer certain questions. The court noted that he had had a full and fair opportunity to expose any infirmities in the victim's testimony.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court conditionally affirmed the trial court's adjudication of the child as delinquent but remanded for findings as to whether the victim had been in need of special protection that had warranted admission of her testimony on a video monitor rather than in person. The court indicated that if the trial court found that the victim had not been in need of such protection, the child should be afforded a new trial.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court held that: (1) although the wife had testified in her defense at her trial, she did not thereby waive her right to claim the self-incrimination privilege, which could be raised while her direct appeal was pending, at defendant's trial; (2) the trial court had no authority to grant the wife use immunity, which was within the sole control of the prosecution, whose refusal to grant her the immunity was not for improper reasons; and (3) defense counsel made a tactical decision to present the tapes of the wife's prior recorded testimony in the event that she chose to invoke her self-incrimination privilege at defendant's trial, thereby waiving error to the admission thereof.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a jury trial in the District Court of Lea County, defendant was convicted of possession of a firearm by a felon. Appealing the conviction, he alleged that (1) the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress; (2) the prosecutor made improper comments during his closing argument about defendant's failure to testify; and (3) the trial court erred in refusing to instruct the jury on defense of property and defense of others.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On the evening of defendant's arrest, his neighbor reported to police that defendant had fired a shot at him. The officers in the area, who heard shots near the time of the neighbor's call, went to defendant's home, and from on a common driveway he shared with a neighbor shone a flashlight into defendant's window, where they saw him lying on a bed with a gun. When defendant did not answer their knock, the police removed a screen window, entered and arrested him. On appeal, the court ruled that because the officers viewed defendant from a common driveway, their action was not a Fourth Amendment search. Given that the officers had heard shots and the neighbor's report of being shot at, the trial court correctly found that exigent circumstances justified seizure of the gun. The prosecutor's closing argument criticized defense witnesses for not telling police when interviewed that, as they claimed at trial, the neighbor was the aggressor. Because it was based on the evidence and unrelated to defendant's failure to testify, it was proper. Because there was no evidence that defendant's acts were taken in defense of property or others, the refusal to give instructions thereon was correct.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was found to be a delinquent child in January 1988, based on his admission to two counts of possession of marijuana, and was placed on probation for a period not to exceed two years. Defendant admitted having violated his probation by failing to attend school and possessing marijuana. In lieu of commitment to the New Mexico Boys' School, defendant was placed on the Juvenile Intensive Probation Supervision (JIPS) Program in September 1988. The children's court found that defendant violated the curfew conditions of his JIPS probation agreement and committed defendant to the boys' school for a full term not to exceed two years. On appeal, defendant argued that the detention conditions of the JIPS program were illegal and rendered the JIPS probation order void. In turn, this rendered the subsequent order of commitment void as well. The court affirmed the order of commitment and held that the language of the Children's Code, N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 32-1-1 to -59 (Repl. Pamp. 1989), specifically N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 32-1-34(E)(3) (Repl.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged a judgment from the District Court of Curry County (New Mexico), which imposed sentence upon him after his nolo contendere plea to fraud and making false public vouchers. The district court found aggravating circumstances on the fraud counts, ordered defendant to turn over any money in a bank account to the county, and conditioned a reduction of defendant's prison sentence on his payment of restitution within 30 days.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, the county manager for Curry County, was convicted of fraud and making false public vouchers. On appeal, the court held that (1) defendant could be prosecuted and sentenced for making a false public voucher, N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 30-23-3 (Repl. Pamp. 1984) and fraud, N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 30-16-6 (Cum.

However, the court concluded that the district court did not follow the mandate of N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 31-17-1 (Repl.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court vacated defendant's sentence and remanded for a new sentence. The court required the district court to consider defendant's ability to pay restitution within 30 days before conditioning a portion of his term of imprisonment on payment of restitution within that time frame.

The statements to the pediatrician and psychologist were properly admitted pursuant to N.M. R. Ann. 11-803(D) as statements made for purposes of diagnosis or treatment. The court also held that the use of the children's depositions at trial satisfied the Confrontation Clause because defendant had opportunity for cross-examination at the children's depositions. Further, the trial court made individualized findings that the children needed protection from testifying at trial face-to-face with defendant. Defendant was not denied due process by the State's delayed disclosure of a child's recantation because such evidence was disclosed during the trial and defense counsel was as much at fault as the State.</SPAN></P>

A train struck an employee's vehicle while he was proceeding to work. His widow sought death benefits under the Act, and the compensation division awarded her benefits. The court affirmed and held that the Act, N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 52-5-1 (1987), was a prospective statement of legislative intent that left the going and coming rule in tact. The railroad crossing constituted a part of the employer's premises for purposes of recovery of benefits under the premises exception to the going and coming rule. The railroad crossing was adjacent to the employer's plant, and the employer had negotiated a right of passage over the crossing. The crossing was the sole means of ingress and egress to the plant. Under these circumstances, the crossing was sufficiently connected to the employer's business as to be an integral part of it.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants entered into a contract to provide school bus service to a local school district. Defendants were required to submit expense reports that itemized the amount spent on fuel, maintenance, and driver salaries. After an audit, it was determined that many of the figures had been fraudulently increased, and defendants had been pocketing the additional money. Criminal charges were brought against defendants for conspiracy to commit fraud, fraud, and racketeering. After a jury trial, defendants were convicted on all charges. Defendants appealed the convictions raising numerous points of alleged error. Of primary importance, the court discussed the challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence. The court noted that such a challenge required it to review the evidence in a light most favorable to support the verdict, resolving all conflicts and indulging all permissible inferences in favor of the verdict. The court concluded that the evidence was sufficient to support the convictions of all defendants, except for the corporation. The court held that the corporation was improperly convicted of racketeering because it was not specifically charged in the indictment.</SPAN></P>

Ann. &sect;&sect; 52-1-25, 52-1-42 (Supp. 1986) did not limit permanent partial disability to the American Medical Association (AMA) guidelines for permanent impairment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The previous and subsequent codification of the workers' compensation laws provided that partial disability benefits were determined by the inability to perform work, while benefits under the Interim Act, N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 52-1-42 (Supp. 1986) were determined by the AMA guidelines on percentage impairment. The court rejected the employee's contention that the Interim Act violated her equal protection rights, finding that the act did not create two classes of workers. All injured workers during the effective dates of the Interim Act were treated the same. The mere fact that a previous and subsequent codification of workers' compensation laws treated workers differently did not raise an equal protection claim. The court also found that the plain language of N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 52-1-42 (Supp. 1986) provided that partial disability would be determined by the AMA guidelines for permanent impairment. Where the act's language was clear and unambiguous, the court would not resort to any other means of interpretation, and it declined to disturb the hearing officer's findings. The court affirmed the disposition order.</SPAN></P>

The trial court denied defendant's motion for a directed verdict and entered judgment convicting him. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court rejected defendant's argument that &sect; 30-31-25(A)(3) was unconstitutionally vague, holding that it proscribed the intentional acquisition or attempted acquisition of a controlled substance by false means and that it was specific enough to provide a person with notice and fair warning of the nature of the proscribed act. The court specifically found that the terms &quot;deception&quot; and &quot;subertfuge&quot; in the statute were not too general or overly sweeping and that &sect; 30-31-25(A)(3) did not conflict with the general attempt statute, since &sect; 30-31-25(A)(3) was the more specific statute and thus controlled.

The city overruled the examiner and denied the use permit. The owners sought certiorari to the trial court, which affirmed the decision from the city. The court reversed and held that the city failed to comply with the provisions of its zoning code, which required that applicants for a conditional use permit were due notice and a public hearing to present evidence and argument and to question witnesses on all relevant issues.

Further, the administrators were liable for the violation of the professor's first amendment rights, as they set in motion the events that led to his termination.

The court affirmed, rejecting each of defendant's arguments. Specifically, the court held that the trial court did not err by failing to suppress evidence or grant a new trial on the grounds that the search warrant was not specific and resulted in an unconstitutional general search. Nor was the search invalid due to errors in the manner the search warrant was obtained and executed. The court held that the jury was properly instructed on fraud and tax evasion. Even assuming the trial court erred in refusing to merge several of the counts with which defendant was charged, he received concurrent sentences for the alleged lesser included offenses, which protected him from double jeopardy. Further, the court held that principles of double jeopardy were not offended by the collateral consequences of the separate convictions. Finally, the court rejected defendant's claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel. Defendant, having raised this issue for the first time on appeal, failed to meet his burden of showing that his attorney was incompetent and that he was prejudiced by counsel's errors.</SPAN></P>

Defendants argued that the ordinance was unconstitutional because it prescribed a mandatory jail term for first time offenders, whereas the state statute provided that the sentence for such offender could be suspended or deferred.

Ann. &sect; 30-1-12 (978) was not unconstitutionally vague because the term &quot;protracted impairment&quot; was capable of reasonable application by a jury of common intelligence after consideration of the circumstances involved.</SPAN></P>

The pit bull owners contended that the ordinance was vague, violated their procedural and substantive due process rights, and was an unconstitutional taking of their private property.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The village enacted the ordinance banning pit bull terriers in response to a series of attacks by pit bulls on persons and animals. The court held that the pit bull owners did not have standing to challenge the ordinance on vagueness grounds because the ordinance clearly applied to them. The court held that the village was entitled to combat the special threat it faced from pit bulls, and that the village's action was clearly rationally related to efforts to combat that threat. The court found no equal protection violation in the ordinance's singling out of only the pit bull terrier breed of dog. The ordinance did not violate the pit bull owners' procedural due process rights because it clearly contemplated that a hearing would take place before a dog was destroyed. The court held that the ordinance was not an unconstitutional taking because it was a legitimate exercise of the police power, reasonably necessary to preserve and protect the public health, safety, and welfare.</SPAN></P>

The court held that: (1) where the taxpayer's employees delivered food into the state and the taxpayer had a policy of visiting its customers' restaurants in New Mexico, there was sufficient nexus for the state constitutionally to impose the gross receipts tax upon the taxpayer's activities; (2) the assessment on the total receipts of goods sold to the New Mexico restaurants did not subject the taxpayer to double or triple taxation and was fairly apportioned to its activities within the state; and (3) the blanket certificate did not substantially comply with state requirements where it was not in a form prescribed by the department and would have required the department to revamp its processing and verification procedures.</SPAN></P>

Defendant's neighbor inadvertently discovered that the package contained drugs and drug paraphernalia, and she delivered the package to the police. Defendant made several attempts to collect his package from his neighbor but was unsuccessful. He was arrested and convicted of attempted trafficking by possession with intent to distribute and of conspiracy. On appeal, he argued that an attempted violation of the trafficking statute,&nbsp;N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 30-31-20(A)(3) (1987), was not a crime under New Mexico law. The court affirmed the judgment of conviction and held that it was possible for defendant to intend to possess a controlled substance and to intend to distribute that controlled substance without the person actually possessing the controlled substance. Under the general attempt statute,&nbsp;N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 30-28-1 (1984), defendant could have attempted possession with intent to distribute; the attempt applied to the possession, not the intent. N.M. Stat.

The trial court reversed the state engineer's decision, which allowed their application, on the grounds that the requested transfer would impair existing water rights on the stream system and would be contrary to the public interest. The court disagreed with the reversal. The court found, inter alia, that (1) under N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 72-5-23 all water used for irrigation purposes could be transferred for other purposes, without losing priority of right theretofore established, if such changes could be made without detriment to existing rights; (2) the long-standing administrative constructions of statutes by the agency charged with administering them were to be given persuasive weight, and were not be lightly overturned, such that the state engineer's orders were presumed to be proper implementations of the water laws; and (3) inherent in a water right was the right to change the place of diversion, subject only to the requirement that the rights of other water users not be injured or impaired thereby.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parents brought an action because a teacher employed by the district obtained marijuana for their minor children who were students at the school. On appeal, the court affirmed dismissal of the action. The court held that no waiver of sovereign immunity was made by the district pursuant to N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 41-4-5 through -12. Therefore, the parents' claims for negligence in hiring and retaining the teacher could not go forward. The court also held that a claim for educational malpractice was not recognized by the state and, even if it was, it was a form of negligence barred by sovereign immunity. The court held that the breach of contract claim was properly dismissed as well because payment of taxes did not create a contractual relationship with the district. The court also held that the parents did not meet the requirements of a &sect; 1983 action because they failed to allege that the district sanctioned distribution of marijuana to its students either by custom or policy. The court found that the award of attorney's fees to the district under &sect; 1988 was proper because the parents failed to do even minimal research, which would have revealed that they had no &sect; 1983 claim.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the injured party did not allege any prejudice from the resultant additional peremptory challenges. The court noted that the injured party had failed to preserve the issue for appeal.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother suffered from a chronic mental illness, presumably schizophrenia, that rendered her incapable of being a custodial parent. Her son was placed in foster care at an early age, and after an unsuccessful reunion and failed attempts at rehabilitation for the mother, petitioner State of New Mexico sought to terminate the mother's parental rights. The trial court concluded that the State had presented clear and convincing evidence that the child was abused and neglected, and it entered an order terminating the mother's parental rights. The mother argued that New Mexico's termination of parental rights statute, N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 32-1-54 (1986), was constitutionally defective because it failed to provide for a defense of mental illness. In affirming the trial court's order, the court held that because substantial policy reasons existed for disallowing a defense of mental incapacity in termination proceedings, &sect; 32-1-54 was not constitutionally infirm.</SPAN></P>

The landowners objected to the construction of the pipeline, counterclaimed for an injunction prohibiting the company from further burdening their lands, and sought damages. The trial court granted the company's motion for summary judgment on the basis that the state highway department had the power to authorize the placement of pipelines, and that highway easements could be used for pipelines without constituting an additional burden on the servient estates. On appeal, the court affirmed. N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 67-3-12(C) was an implicit delegation of power to the state highway commission to permit pipelines under public highways. The company had a permit for the emplacement of its pipeline on the state's right-of-way and no contention was made that the permit procedure was violative of law. Private corporations or persons that were not utilities were not excluded from the coverage of the statute.</SPAN></P>

The jury determined the business solicitor operated a pyramid chain, while it was in the guise of being a multilevel sales program, no product was ever sold and no goods were ever placed in the stream of commerce. In affirming, the court held the judgment did not violate the business solicitor's rights of expression and assembly as it was not an abridgment of freedom of speech or press to make a course of conduct illegal because the conduct was in part initiated, evidenced, or carried out by means of language, either spoken, written, or printed. The court also held the Act was not unconstitutionally vague and overbroad as people of common intelligence did not have to guess as to its meaning. Finally, the court held a statute was sustainable proper as a proper exercise of police power if it was reasonably necessary to prevent manifest evil or reasonably necessary to protect the public safety or general welfare and New Mexico had personal jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>

He appealed to the trial court, which found him guilty of violating both Farmington, N.M., City Code &sect; 21-48 and &sect; 21-49. The court held that: (1) &sect; 20A-6 was not a specific statute that prevailed over &sect;&sect; 21-48 and 21-49 because the former was a strict liability statute based solely on decibel levels, while the latter sections concentrated on the character of the noise and its effect on others; (2) &sect; 20A-6 and &sect;&sect; 21-48 and 21-49 were distinct from each other because the latter required proof of facts not required by the former; and (3) &sect;&sect; 21-48 and 21-49 were not unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>

Ann. &sect; 32-1-54(B)(1), that the mother's consent form for adoption was invalid, and that there was no waiver and estoppel.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court terminated the mother's parental rights. The mother and the parents appealed. The court held that the mother physically gave up her child when the infant was less than 48 hours old and executed a consent to adoption form, which was defective, five days after the child's birth. A key element in determining whether parental rights should be terminated under &sect; 32-1-54(B)(4) was whether the parent-child relationship had disintegrated. The child's extended absence from her natural mother led to the disintegration of the parent-child relationship. Thus, the trial court did not err in terminating appellant's parental rights under &sect; 32-1-54(B)(4). The mother failed to overcome the statutory presumption of abandonment. The trial court retained the power to determine custody in the absence of a legally valid consent, and it was within the authority of the trial court to continue the child in the custody of the parents. Because the mother's consent was invalid and because she did not give up a known legal right, waiver did not apply.</SPAN></P>

Notice for defendant's appeal trial in the district court was given by the clerk to defendant's counsel, who was under the mistaken belief that the clerk would also notify defendant. When defendant's counsel realized the error, she asked for a continuance of the suppression hearing and received a one-day continuance. Inexplicably, defendant's counsel did not take advantage of the continuance, waived the presence of defendant, and proceeded with the suppression hearing. The district court denied the motion to suppress and, the next day, with defendant still absent, denied defendant's motion for a continuance and dismissed defendant's appeal. The court reversed and remanded, holding that defendant was entitled to be present at the suppression hearing, absent a voluntary, knowing, and intelligent waiver. N.M. R. Ann. 5-612(A) required that defendant be present at the arraignment, at the time of the plea, and at every stage of the trial. Because defendant had not spoken to his attorney or received notice of the suppression hearing, the court held that he could not have validly waived his presence at the hearing.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a decision of the District Court of Rio Arriba County (New Mexico), which increased his basic sentences, pursuant to N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 31-18-15.1 (1981), for second degree criminal sexual penetration, kidnapping, false imprisonment, and assault with intent to commit criminal sexual penetration.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At a sentencing hearing following defendant's convictions for sexual assault-related crimes, the trial court increased his basic sentences and stated orally that it did so because defendant's conduct was brutal and he may have been a power rapist whose violence was triggered by uncontrollable alcohol abuse. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court rejected defendant's argument that the trial court's consideration of the physical injury suffered by the victim in enhancing his sentences exposed him to double jeopardy, holding that the trial court properly considered the circumstances surrounding the offense and concerning the offender in making its decision and that its consideration of circumstances surrounding an element of the offense did not expose defendant to double jeopardy. The court further held that the trial court's oral statement of its reasons for increasing defendant's sentences constituted a brief statement in the record of the case of its reasons for altering the basic sentence, as required by &sect; 31-18-15.1(A).</SPAN></P>

Stat. Ann. &sect; 74-1-8(A)(3) (1978, Repl. 1986). The chemical company then filed an appeal before the court challenging the board's adoption of the revised regulation. The court issued a judgment that found the board did not abuse its discretion in adopting the regulation. Specifically, the chemical company challenged that certain provisions in the regulation were unconstitutionally vague. The court disagreed, and did not find the regulations facially vague. The court found the terms in the regulation of &quot;more stringent&quot; and &quot;degradation of a body of water&quot; had provided clear and specific guidelines, which was clear enough to keep the regulation from being constitutionally vague. The court held that it was not necessary that a regulation be drafted with absolute precision, but only that it could be construed using known and accepted rules of construction.</SPAN></P>

Defendant appealed his conviction. On appeal, the court reversed, holding that the search warrant was invalid and part of the evidence obtained was inadmissible as the product of an illegal search and seizure. The initial search that formed the basis for probable cause for the warrant was illegal because the officers intruded onto the curtilage of the cabin, which was an area protected by the Fourth Amendment. The open fields exception did not excuse the lack of a search warrant because the police had no right to be on the curtilage when they observed marijuana growing in close proximity to the cabin. Further, the plain view exception did not justify the intrusion onto the curtilage of defendant's cabin. However, the court found that some of the evidence found outside the curtilage of the cabin was admissible. The court remanded the cause with instructions that the trial court determine if there were any means of distinguishing the admissible evidence from the inadmissible.</SPAN></P>

The good faith purchaser and the estate argued that the buyers' title was defective and that the good faith purchaser had superior title. The court affirmed the judgment because the deed was issued pursuant to the New Mexico Recording Act and the tax sale and deed were not invalidated on the basis of a claimed jurisdictional defect. The court remanded the case for a determination of whether the good faith purchaser executed its deed prior to the tax sale, which occurred on the same day. The court found that the good faith purchaser, who was unaware of the tax deficiency, acquired equitable interest in the property by paying value. The court held that the title company failed to exercise ordinary care, or reasonable diligence, to communicate to both the good faith purchaser or the estate knowledge acquired in the course of its agency.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Three defendants were sentenced, but because they were unable to make bail, they spent the time between arrest and sentencing in jail. All three defendants were given credit for this time served. Each filed a motion for additional credit for good time spent in jail. The theory of these motions was that a person admitted to bail during this time would be able to earn good-time credit for each day spent in the penitentiary pursuant to the sentence and would serve a lesser sentence than a person unable to make bail during the presentence period of the case since N.M.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the conviction, finding that there was substantial evidence to allow the jury to determine that defendant was aware of the child's presence and that he shared in the intent to assault the victims. The victims testified that they entered their vehicle carrying their child and that defendant participated in the verbal and physical attacks. The court found that defendant's actions came within the child abuse statute,&nbsp;N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 30-6-1(C), which forbade anyone from endangering the life or health of a child. Defendant was not put into double jeopardy because under the jurisdictional exception defendant was indicted for felony offenses which were outside the jurisdiction of the metropolitan court, which had dismissed the misdemeanor charges for failure to timely prosecute. The court found that there was no prosecutorial vindictiveness at the pretrial stage and that defendant did not show that the state's charging decision was motivated by a desire to punish him for having exercised a legal right. It was not error to admit extrinsic evidence to impeach defendant that the other occupants in his vehicle were hitchhikers whom he did not know.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The son was killed in an accident that occurred in the course of and arose out of his employment. The trial court ordered the complaint against the employer dismissed under N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 52-1-8 and -9, the exclusive remedy provisions of the Workmen's Compensation Act. In affirming the judgment the court held that the Act did not violate equal protection. Specifically the court held that the discrimination between non-dependent survivors of employees subject to the action and non-dependent survivors of ordinary torts was reasonable, because the purpose of the Act was to mitigate the financial hardship suffered by dependent survivors. The court also held that it was reasonable to discriminate between non-dependent survivors, who under N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 52-1-46(A), received mostly expenses, and dependent survivors, who were entitled to additional compensation under N.M. Stat. &sect; 52-1-46(B)-(F), for the same reason. Finally, the court held that the punitive purpose of the Act, which was secondary, was vindicated by N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 52-1-10(B) and (C) in cases where an employe lacking dependents was injured.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The three juveniles, two very close to the age of majority and another aged 16, were each charged with serious crimes, such as first degree criminal sexual penetration of a child under 13 years of age, aggravated assault, and murder. The trial court ordered the transfer of the juvenile cases to the district court based on a jury determination pursuant to N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 32-1-30. The three juveniles, in a consolidated appeal, challenged the transfer order. Each child contended that N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 32-1-30(A)(4) was unconstitutional on the basis that it was impermissibly vague, failed to provide a discernible and constitutional standard of proof, failed to give the child adequate notice regarding the factors against which he was required to defend, and worked to deprive the child of meaningful appellate review. The court affirmed the transfers and held that &sect; 32-1-30 was constitutional. The court held that proof or disproof of amenability was not requisite to a transfer under &sect; 32-1-30; (2) nothing in the constitution required amenability to even be considered; and (3) the children did not challenge what was required under &sect; 32-1-30, or the standard of proof for it.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the transfer orders and the constitutionality of the statute at issue.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant filed a motion to correct his sentence during the pendency of his first appeal. The trial court denied the motion, and defendant appealed. In dismissing the appeal of the denial of the motion, the court first noted that the appeal was untimely, but that this defect was the fault of the clerk of court. Nevertheless, the court held that the trial court had lacked jurisdiction to hear defendant's motion to correct, because the pendency of the first appeal divested the trial court of jurisdiction. The court noted however that under N.M. Stat. Ann., R. Crim. P. 57.1 (Repl. Pamp. 1980), the trial court could correct an illegal sentence within 30 days of the appellate mandate. The court held that under N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 31-20-12 (Repl. Pamp. 1981) defendant was entitled to one credit of 200 days for presentence confinement, and one credit only. The court rejected defendant's contention that he was entitled to 200 days credit for each of his 26 sentences.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the District Court of Bernalillo County (New Mexico) convicting him of 16 counts of sexual penetration in the second degree, five counts of attempted first degree murder, arson, residential burglary, and contributing to the delinquency of a minor.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The charges against defendant arose from his sexual relationship with the minor victim. After learning that the victim and the victim's family were about to move to Australia, defendant attempted to poison the victim's mother by mixing pentobarbital into a can of soft drink and attempted to burn down the victim's home. On appeal, defendant claimed he was denied due process for the attempted murder charge because none of the soft drink was left, after testing, for an independent analysis by defendant's chemist. The court held that the introduction of the poison into evidence was not reversible error because the &quot;lost&quot; evidence did not prejudice defendant's case. There was no substantial basis for supposing that the &quot;lost&quot; evidence would have undercut the state's case in light of the amount of evidence presented by the state. The court also held that the trial court was within its discretion in not permitting defendant to question the minor victim concerning the child's prior sexual conduct with persons other than defendant. Defendant was allowed during his case in chief to testify about what the victim told him at the inception of their relationship about his past sexual conduct.</SPAN></P>
